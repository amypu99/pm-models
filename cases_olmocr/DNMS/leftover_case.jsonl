{"id": "4684308144b1fb84731a314218f6e0a772564b53", "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nPetitioner Clarence Mack was convicted and sentenced to death in an Ohio state court for the aggravated murder of Peter Sanelli. Mack has filed a petition and amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, challenging the constitutionality of his convictions and sentence. (Docs. 24, 155.) Respondent Warden Margaret Bradshaw has filed a return of writ to the amended petition. (Doc. 158.)\u00b9 Mack has filed a traverse. (Doc. 162.) For the reasons stated below, the court denies Mack\u2019s amended petition.\n\n\u00b9 According to the parties\u2019 filings, Mack is currently incarcerated at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution, where Timothy Shoop, not Margaret Bradshaw, is the warden. For consistency with the docket, however, the court continues to list Margaret Bradshaw as the respondent.\nFACTUAL HISTORY\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court set forth the following facts underlying Mack\u2019s convictions:\n\nPeter Sanelli, along with his son Anthony, owned and operated Sandglo Glass and Mirror Company on Prospect Avenue in the city of Cleveland. On January 21, 1991, Thomas Sowell, Reginald Germany, and the defendant-appellant, Clarence Mack, carjacked Mr. Sanelli as he was leaving his business, fatally shooting him and stealing his car.\n\nMr. Sanelli was last seen around 5:45 p.m. by his son Anthony. At that time, Anthony went home for the day, leaving Mr. Sanelli at Sandglo. Before he left, Anthony gave his father a package of nails that he would need for a job. Mr. Sanelli's body was found around 6:10 p.m. lying in the middle of the parking lot next to Sandglo. Dr. Robert Challener of the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office later testified that the autopsy performed by Dr. Kalil Jiraki showed that Mr. Sanelli had been shot three times, and died from these wounds. One bullet entered the left side of the victim's face, somewhat below the ear. The irregular entrance wound indicated that the bullet had come in contact with an intermediate object such as glass before striking the victim. The other two bullets were fired into Mr. Sanelli's left shoulder from close range. One of these bullets struck Mr. Sanelli's left lung and tore the sac which surrounds the heart. A pellet with its copper jacket was retrieved from the right sleeve of Mr. Sanelli's undershirt.\n\nDetective Leo Allen investigated Mr. Sanelli's murder. At the scene where the body was found, Detective Allen discovered three nine-millimeter shell casings on the street three to five feet from the curb. A fourth shell casing was discovered on the sidewalk behind the Dome Grille, a neighboring business.\n\nMr. Sanelli's car, a 1987 light blue or silver Plymouth Horizon with red and white truck license plates, was found around 7:15 p.m. It had been crashed into a utility pole at East 90th and Holton Avenue. The front driver's side window and rear passenger side window were broken out. Anthony Sanelli testified that the car's windows were all intact when he last saw his father before the murder. An apparent bullet indentation was discovered on the rear passenger door, and a bullet hole was found in the back side of the passenger front seat. Part of a copper jacket to a nine-millimeter bullet was found in the car. No fingerprints were found.\n\nOn January 23, 1991, two days after the murder of Peter Sanelli, Timothy\nWillis approached the Sanelli family with information regarding the murder. The Sanelli family sent Willis to the police. At approximately 2:30 p.m. on January 23, Mr. Willis called Lt. John James, and told him the following story.\n\nWillis stated that on January 21, 1991, he was approached around 5:30 p.m. by the appellant, Thomas Sowell and Reginald Germany, who were looking to buy a gun to aid them in stealing a car. When Willis refused, Germany told Sowell that he had a nine-millimeter gun which Sowell could borrow. The three then drove away. Later around 6:45 p.m. the appellant and Sowell drove up to Willis in a silver Plymouth Horizon. Willis especially noticed that the automobile had red and white license plates and that the back passenger and front driver side windows were broken out. Sowell told Willis that they had obtained the car on Prospect Avenue. The appellant and Sowell then discussed in front of Willis their reasons for shooting \u201cthe man.\u201d Sowell said that he had fired at the car window because the man disobeyed his instructions by attempting to lock his door. The appellant claimed that he had started shooting because Sowell had fired. During this discussion, Willis noticed a pair of binoculars. Anthony Sanelli testified that his father kept a pair of binoculars in the car. Later that evening, Willis recognized the car driven by the appellant and Sowell on the evening news story about the murder of Peter Sanelli.\n\nOn January 22, 1991, Willis met the appellant and Germany at approximately 9:00 p.m. and drove around with them in a red van. Willis specifically asked the appellant and Germany where they got the silver Plymouth Horizon. The appellant again told Willis that they got it from the downtown area. The appellant and Germany laughed as they related how Sowell had injured his nose when he crashed the stolen car into a pole.\n\nAfter Willis told the police this story, he informed them where and when they might locate the appellant, Germany and Sowell. Based on the information given by Willis, the police dispatched officers to arrest these men. Willis had told the police that the appellant and Germany were on their way to his address. The police saw a red van matching the description given by Willis park in front of Willis's house at around 4:30 p.m. Reginald Germany, the appellant, and Maurice Washington exited. A fourth man, Brian McKinney, remained in the van. Reginald Germany exited the driver's side of the van holding a nine-millimeter gun in one hand, which he immediately dropped to the ground as the police approached. The officers stopped and frisked each of the men, and searched the van. The officers felt and uncovered a nine-millimeter gun in a holster under the appellant's coat. The police also found a third gun on the floor of the van at the feet of Brian McKinney. Appellant's and Germany's guns were loaded, and two additional clips were recovered from the appellant's pockets as well. The men were taken into custody by the police.\nWillis told police that Thomas Sowell could be located at Cleveland Industrial Drum. Police arrested Sowell there, and discovered a nail in his pocket that matched the type of nails Anthony Sanelli had given his father shortly before Peter Sanelli was murdered.\n\nDetective Qualey, along with Lt. John James, questioned the appellant on January 23, 1991, at approximately 4:30 p.m. after the appellant's arrest. After advising the appellant of his Miranda rights, as printed on a standard police card, Det. Qualey questioned the appellant about the nine-millimeter gun that had been found on the appellant's person at the time of the arrest. Appellant stated that he had bought the gun on January 22, 1991, from an individual who was unknown to him. Further, the appellant denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, the murder of Peter Sanelli. After about an hour of interrogation, appellant was returned to his cell.\n\nAbout half an hour later Detective Qualey became aware of the results of ballistics tests. The tests revealed that the three spent shell casings found on the street at the murder scene and the bullet found on Peter Sanelli at the morgue had come from appellant's nine-millimeter gun. The ballistics tests also revealed that the gun confiscated from Reginald Germany at the time of his arrest had fired the spent shell casing found on the sidewalk outside the Dome Grille and the copper bullet jacket found in the stolen car.\n\nDetective Qualey reapproached appellant and asked if he knew his rights, to which appellant responded \u201cyeah.\u201d After being informed of the ballistics tests, appellant changed his story. He stated that he had loaned the nine-millimeter handgun to a stranger known to him only as \u201cDee\u201d the day before the murder of Peter Sanelli. Appellant claimed that Dee had needed protection because he was going to a party. The gun had been returned to the appellant the day after Sanelli's murder. The appellant noticed that the gun had been fired but did not ask why.\n\n* * *\n\nGuilt Phase\n\nThe prosecution called several witnesses in its case against the appellant. Dr. Robert Challener of the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office testified regarding the results of Dr. Kalil Jiraki's autopsy on Peter Sanelli. The state also called Detective Edward Lucey to testify regarding the results of the examination which he and other police experts had conducted on the bullet and shell casings. The prosecution's key witness was Willis, who testified as to the story he told the police.\n\nThe defense attempted to call Carole Mancino, one of the appellant's attorneys,\nto provide testimony to impeach Mr. Willis. The trial court refused to allow her to testify. Ms. Mancino proffered that she would have testified about an interview she had with Timothy Willis on May 2, 1991. At that time, Willis was in jail along with the appellant, Germany, and Sowell, who were awaiting trial for the murder of Peter Sanelli. Ms. Mancino claims that Willis told her the following story. Willis never saw any of the defendants on January 21, 1991. Willis did see the appellant and Germany on January 22, 1991 when they came to his house to get a car part, and on January 23, 1991, the appellant and Germany drove to the front of his house to pick Willis up. Willis stated that the appellant and Germany were \u201cgood guys\u201d and he could not believe they were involved in something like this. When asked how the police knew that the appellant and Germany would be at Willis's house at 4:30 p.m. on January 23, 1991, Willis responded that he suspected his phone was bugged due to his suspected implication in another crime.\n\nOn the witness stand, Willis had testified that he told Ms. Mancino that he did not know anything about the murder of Peter Sanelli. The prosecution pointed out that Willis was in the same jail as the men he had fingered. The trial judge ruled to suppress Ms. Mancino's testimony.\n\nThe appellant's cousin, Curtis Mack, testified that he saw numerous firearms and handmade weapons at Willis's house, and that he knew that Willis carried and sold firearms. The appellant's cousin was not allowed by the court to testify regarding a conversation he had with Willis on the night the appellant was arrested. The defense proffered into the record that Curtis Mack would have testified that Willis said he knew the appellant had nothing to do with Sanelli's murder and that Willis admitted that he, in fact, killed Sanelli.\n\nThe defense called DeMille Blue, Thomas Sowell's girlfriend, who testified that on the day of the murder, January 21, 1991, she cooked dinner for Sowell, Mack, Germany and others. Ms. Blue claimed that she was cooking when Clarence Mack arrived at 5:00 p.m. and that he did not leave until about 8:00 p.m. On cross-examination Ms. Blue asserted that Thomas Sowell did not own any firearms and that Clarence Mack did not have a firearm while he was at her house. The prosecution called Detective Norman Sherwood in rebuttal. Detective Sherwood testified that when he spoke with Ms. Blue on January 25, 1991, she told him that she had not begun cooking her Martin Luther King Day dinner until 6:00 p.m.\n\nJohn Scott, the boyfriend of Clarence Mack's sister, testified for the defense that Timothy Willis owned several firearms and weapons, including nine-millimeters. He identified the gun found on the person of the appellant as one of the firearms owned by Willis in December 1990, testifying that he himself had wished to purchase it, but did not have the cash. Scott asserted that\nhe and the appellant had gone to Willis's house sometime between 1:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. the day after the murder, at which time Clarence Mack purchased the handgun.\n\nBarbara Lackey, Clarence Mack's girlfriend, testified that the first time she ever saw Clarence Mack with the weapon was the day after the murder.\n\n*State v. Mack*, 73 Ohio St. 3d 502, 502-07 (Ohio 1995).\n\n**PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n\n**A. State-Court Proceedings**\n\n1. **Trial Court**\n\nOn February 5, 1991, the Cuyahoga County, Ohio, Grand Jury indicted Mack for two counts of aggravated murder in violation of Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2903.01(B) and one count of aggravated robbery in violation of Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2911.01. (Doc. 149-1 at 23-25.) The first count of aggravated murder charged Mack with purposely causing the death of Peter Sanelli with prior calculation and design; the second, causing death while committing, or attempting to commit or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery. (*Id.* at 23-24.) Each aggravated-murder count carried a death penalty specification under Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.04(A)(7), charging that Mack committed the aggravated murder during an aggravated robbery, and either was the principal offender of the murder or committed the aggravated robbery with prior calculation and design. (*Id.*) They also had attached prior-offender and firearm specifications. (*Id.*)\n\nMack entered pleas of not guilty to all charges. (*Id.* at 30.) The State dismissed the\n\n---\n\n2 For ease of reference, all citations to page numbers of documents filed in the court\u2019s electronic court filing system (\u201cECF\u201d) are to the ECF-assigned page numbers of the individual document, not to the original document\u2019s page numbers or the ECF \u201cPageID\u201d numbers.\nfirst aggravated-murder count before trial. (Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 39-40.)\n\nMack\u2019s trial began on July 1, 1991. (See Doc. 150-1 (Trial Tr.) at 3.) He was represented by Attorneys Paul Mancino and Carole Mancino. (See id. at 2.)\n\nThe jury convicted Mack on all charges and specifications on July 11, 1991. (Doc. 149-1 at 108.) The penalty phase of the trial began on July 17, 1991, and the next day, the jury recommended that Mack be sentenced to death. (Id. at 109-10.) On August 1, 1991, the trial court accepted the jury\u2019s recommendation and imposed a death sentence. (See id. at 125-27.) The court also imposed consecutive sentences of three years\u2019 imprisonment for the firearms-specification conviction and fifteen to twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment for the aggravated-robbery conviction. (Id. at 128.)\n\nMeanwhile, on July 24, 1991, Mack filed a motion to merge for the purpose of sentencing his convictions for aggravated robbery and aggravated murder. (Id. at 111-12.) In addition, the next day, he filed a motion for a new trial on the ground that the State had suppressed exculpatory evidence. (Id. at 113-19.) The trial court denied both motions on August 2, 1991. (Id. at 120.)\n\n2. Direct Appeal\n\nOn August 30, 1991, Mack filed a timely appeal of his convictions and sentences to the Eighth Judicial District Court of Appeals. (Id. at 147-48.) He was represented by former trial counsel Paul Mancino and new counsel, Hyman Friedman, Cuyahoga County Public Defender, and Robert Ingersoll, Assistant Public Defender. (Id. at 159.) In his appellate brief, Mack raised twenty-seven assignments of error, stated as follows:\n\n1. Clarence Mack was denied due process of law when the court denied his motion for discovery and inspection.\n2. The trial court denied Clarence Mack due process, when it overruled his motion for grand jury testimony.\n\n3. The court denied Clarence Mack\u2019s right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure by overruling a motion to suppress evidence seized during a warrantless arrest of Clarence Mack.\n\n4. The trial court denied Clarence Mack his right to a jury from a fair, impartial cross-section of the community, when it dismissed for cause jurors who expressed concern about the death penalty but stated they could follow the law.\n\n5. The trial court denied Clarence Mack\u2019s right to a jury from a fair, impartial cross-section of the community, when it did not dismiss for cause jurors who believed death was the only proper sentence for someone convicted of felony murder.\n\n6. Clarence Mack was denied his right of confrontation when a non-examining coroner, Dr. Robert Challener, to testify [sic] concerning an autopsy made by a non-testifying coroner.\n\n7. Clarence Mack was denied the right to confrontation when State witness Anthony Sanelli testified about out-of-court conversations he had with Timothy Willis.\n\n8. Clarence Mack was denied due process of law when the court permitted Detective Edward Lucey to testify as an expert.\n\n9. Clarence Mack was denied his right against self-incrimination by the introduction of a statement made by Clarence Mack when he had not been advised of his constitutional rights.\n\n10. Clarence Mack was denied his right [to] defend himself by the exclusion of impeachment testimony against Timothy Willis.\n\n11. Clarence Mack\u2019s convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n12. Clarence Mack\u2019s constitutional right to life is violated by his conviction for a felony murder specification that was not supported by sufficient evidence to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n13. Clarence Mack was denied his constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury at his trial by the introduction of gruesome and\ninflammatory photographs.\n\n14. Clarence Mack was denied his right to a trial by a jury by the improper jury instructions given during his trial.\n\n15. Clarence Mack was denied due process of law by the refusal to instruct on the lesser included offenses of murder and involuntary manslaughter.\n\n16. Clarence Mack was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel by counsel\u2019s failure to preserve the record.\n\n17. Clarence Mack was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial by the cumulative effect of all the errors that occurred during his trial.\n\n18. Repeated prosecutorial misconduct denied Clarence Mack a fair trial.\n\n19. The court denied Clarence Mack his right to a fair, impartial jury when it allowed gruesome and inflammatory photographs during the penalty phase of his trial.\n\n20. Clarence Mack was denied due process of law when the court improperly instructed the jury during the penalty phase.\n\n21. Clarence Mack was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of his trial.\n\n22. Clarence Mack was denied his right to a fair tribunal as the court had prepared its sentencing memorandum prior to the sentencing hearing of the trial.\n\n23. Clarence Mack was deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial by the cumulative effect of all the errors that occurred during his penalty phase.\n\n24. The trial court erred and denied Clarence Mack his constitutional right to a fair trial by denying his motion for a new trial.\n\n25. Clarence Mack was denied due process and equal protection of the law [by] his conviction of a death penalty specification that does not require proof of prior calculation and design for principal offenders but does require proof of prior calculation and design for an aider and abettor.\n\n26. Clarence Mack\u2019s death sentence has denied him due process under the\nlaw as the trial court erred in adopting the recommendation of the jury and in finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors.\n\n27. Imposition of the death sentence violates the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Sections 2, 9, 10 and 16, Article I, of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n(Doc. 149-2 at 2-5.) The State filed a responsive brief. (Id. at 213-313.)\n\nThe appellate court affirmed Mack\u2019s convictions and sentences on December 2, 1993. State v. Mack, No. 62366, 1993 WL 497052 (Ohio Ct. App. Dec. 2, 1993). Mack filed an application for reconsideration on December 13, 1993. (Doc. 149-3 at 314-16.) The court denied the application on January 4, 1994. (Id. at 320.)\n\nMack, now represented by Attorneys Thomas Gill and Kevin Spellacy, filed a timely notice of appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. (Id. at 329-31.) In his appellate brief, he presented the following twenty-eight propositions of law, stated as:\n\n1. Ohio public records statute, R.C. 149.43 enables discovery of statements made by potential witnesses at a trial, and denial of this discovery by a court denies a defendant of due process.\n\n2. Where a particularized need is demonstrated by the defense for the examination of grand jury testimony the failure of the trial court to provide defense counsel with said grand jury testimony deprives a defendant of a fair trial.\n\n3. Absent an arrest or search warrant independent probable cause to search passengers of a vehicle is necessary even if there exists probable cause to search the driver.\n\n4. A trial court\u2019s dismissal for cause of jurors who express concern over recommending the death penalty but otherwise stated that they could follow the instruction of law provided by the trial court violates a defendants [sic] right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\n5. A trial court\u2019s failure to remove for cause jurors with a predisposition for recommending the death penalty in applicable cases violates a\ndefendants [sic] right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\n6. Allowing coroner\u2019s testimony by way of someone other than the coroner who performed the autopsy denies a defendant his constitutional right to confront witnesses against him.\n\n7. By allowing a witness to testify as to the out of court statements of another a trial court commits prejudicial error and violates a defendants [sic] right [to] confront witnesses against him.\n\n8. The admission of expert testimony by one who is not properly qualified as an expert pursuant to Evid. R. 702 violates a defendant\u2019s due process.\n\n9. The introduction of a statement of a defendant prior to his being advised of his constitutional rights to remain silent violates a defendant\u2019s right against self[-]incrimination.\n\n10. A defendant is denied his right to a fair trial when a trial court improperly denies him the right to call witnesses for impeachment purposes.\n\n11. A conviction which is against the manifest weight of the evidence must be overturned on appeal.\n\n12. A defendant is denied due process of law when his conviction for a felony-murder is not supported by sufficient evidence to prove the corresponding felony offenses.\n\n13. The introduction of gruesome photographs at trial denies a defendant the right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\n14. The trial court must properly charge of [sic] jury on the law and failure to do so denies a defendant the right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\n15. At a trial for aggravated murder with specifications, a trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct on the lesser included offenses of murder and voluntary manslaughter amount to reversible error.\n\n16. Failure of trial counsel to preserve the record for appealable issues necessitate [sic] reversal if a substantial right of the defendant has been violated.\n\n17. The right to effective assistance applies to an appeal as of right and the\nfailure of appellate counsel to raise reversible assignments of error on appeal constitutes ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\n\n18. Although no one error in and of itself supplies grounds for reversal, the cumulative effect of several errors can be grounds for reversing a criminal conviction.\n\n19. Repeated prosecutorial misconduct denies a defendant the right to a fair trial and is grounds for reversing a conviction.\n\n20. The introduction of gruesome photographs during the penalty phase of trial denies a defendant the right to a fair and impartial jury.\n\n21. Due process requires the proper instructions be given to the jury during the penalty phase of a capital case.\n\n22. The right to effective assistance of counsel extends to the penalty phase of a capital trial.\n\n23. A trial court\u2019s preparation of its sentencing memorandum prior to the sentencing hearing denies a defendant his right to a fair trial.\n\n24. The cumulative effect of errors that occur during the penalty phase of a trial may deprive a defendant his right to a fair trial.\n\n25. Failure of the prosecutor to comply with pre-trial discovery is grounds for a new trial if the thing discovered during trial prejudiced the rights of the defendant.\n\n26. Required proof of prior calculation and design necessary to convict aiders and abettors of a capital offense, and a lower standard for the mental state of principal offenders, denies a defendant due process and equal protection under the law.\n\n27. A trial court\u2019s improper weighing of aggravating circumstances with mitigating factors requires a reversal of the death penalty imposed thereunder.\n\n28. Imposition of the death sentence violates the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Sections 2, 9, 10 and 16, Article I, of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n(Doc. 149-3 at 361-78.) The Stated filed a responsive brief. (Id. at 615-730.) The court\naffirmed the judgment of the appellate court on August 30, 1995. *Mack*, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 516.\n\nMack filed a petition for writ of *certiorari* in the United States Supreme Court. (Doc. 149-3 at 771.) The Court denied the petition on January 22, 1996. (*Id.* at 776.)\n\n3. **First Post-Conviction Proceedings**\n\nOn August 2, 1996, Mack, now represented by J. Dean Carro, filed a petition for post-conviction relief with the trial court. (Doc. 149-4 at 23-45.) He asserted that his trial counsel were ineffective by failing to:\n\n1. Hire an independent ballistics examiner of the gun and bullets to kill the decedent when the State\u2019s evidence was inconsistent on whether the decedent died by a hollow-point, or regular, bullet.\n\n2. Properly introduce into evidence the inconsistent statements of Tim Willis.\n\n3. Investigate other evidence that would have impeached the credibility of Tim Willis.\n\n4. Investigate a phone call Mr. Mack received from William Payne at a home several blocks from the place where the victim was shot and other alibi evidence.\n\n(*Id.* at 24.) The State moved to dismiss the petition. (Doc. 149-5 at 28-34.)\n\nThe trial court denied the petition on September 13, 1996. (*Id.* at 43.) The court issued its findings of fact and conclusions of law on January 25, 1999. (*Id.* at 45-48.)\n\nMack filed a timely appeal of that judgment in the Eighth District Court of Appeals. (*Id.* at 69-70.) In his appellate brief, he raised two assignments of error, stated as:\n\n1. The trial court abused its discretion and violated Mr Mack\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of trial counsel; Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution; and R.C. 2953.21 by denying post-conviction relief to Mr. Mack because the petition contained sufficient\noperative facts and was not barred by res judicata.\n\n2. The trial court abused its discretion and violated R.C. 2953.21(E) by denying post-conviction relief to Mr. Mack without an evidentiary hearing.\n\n(Id. at 107 (capitalization altered and citations omitted).) The State also filed a brief. (Id. at 193-249.)\n\nOn October 26, 2000, the appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment dismissing Mack\u2019s post-conviction petition. State v. Mack, No. 77459, 2000 WL 1594117 (Ohio Ct. App. Oct. 26, 2000).\n\nMack filed a timely appeal of the appellate court\u2019s judgment in the Ohio Supreme Court. (Doc. 149-5 at 332-33.) In his memorandum in support of jurisdiction, he presented the following propositions of law, stated as:\n\n1. Where a criminal defendant is represented by trial counsel on direct appeal, along with co-counsel who is new to the case, res judicata does not bar consideration of ineffective assistance of counsel claims on post-conviction relief.\n\n2. A trial court should hold a hearing on a post-conviction relief petition in a capital case when the affidavits and other evidence filed with the Petition contain facts that demonstrate that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n(Id. at 340.) The State filed a memorandum in opposition. (Id. at 377-87.)\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court declined jurisdiction over the appeal on March 7, 2001. (Id. at 388.)\n\n4. Application to Reopen Direct Appeal\n\nOn June 15, 2001, Mack, represented by Jeffry Kelleher and Michael Benza, filed an application for reopening pursuant to Ohio Appellate Rule 26(B). (Doc. 149-6 at 41-50.)\nRule 26(B) permits defendants to request to reopen the direct appeal from a judgment to present claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel within ninety days from issuance of the court\u2019s direct-appeal mandate, or later for \u201cgood cause.\u201d Ohio R. App. P. 26(B); see also State v. Murnahan, 63 Ohio St. 3d 60 (Ohio 1992). In Mack\u2019s application, he asserted that he was denied the effective assistance of appellate counsel for failing to raise on direct appeal the following assignments of error:\n\n1. The prosecutors\u2019 misconduct tainted the entire proceeding and deprived Mr. Mack of a fair and impartial trial.\n\n2. Improper and misleading jury instructions deprived Mr. Mack of a fair trial and a fair and reliable sentencing proceeding.\n\n3. Mr. Mack was denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial.\n\n4. The trial court committed numerous errors of fact and law depriving Mr. Mack of his due process and equal protection rights.\n\n5. Ohio\u2019s death penalty scheme is unconstitutional.\n\n(Doc. 149-6 at 42, 43, 44, 46, 47 (capitalization altered).) The State filed a brief in opposition. (Id. at 327-37.) The appellate court denied the application on May 19, 2003. State v. Mack, No. 62366, 2003 WL 21185786 (Ohio Ct. App. May 19, 2003).\n\nMack filed a timely appeal of the appellate court\u2019s judgment in the Ohio Supreme Court. (Doc. 149-6 at 439-40.) He presented the following propositions of law, stated as:\n\n1. The prosecutors\u2019 misconduct tainted the entire proceeding and deprived Mr. Mack of a fair and impartial trial.\n\n2. Improper and misleading jury instructions deprived Mr. Mack of a fair trial and a fair and reliable sentencing proceeding.\n\n3. Counsel for a capitaly charged client are ineffective under the Sixth Amendment when they fail to conduct a full investigation into their client\u2019s character, history and background in anticipation of a capital\nsentencing proceeding.\n\n4. Objective standards for the performance of counsel defending capitally charged clients in the courts of Ohio, required under the Sixth Amendment, are codified in the ABA Guidelines for the appointment and performance of counsel in death penalty cases.\n\n5. Absent a full investigation into their client\u2019s character, history, and background in anticipation of a capital sentencing proceeding, a decision by counsel not to present such evidence in mitigation of sentence cannot be deemed a reasonable strategic decision precluding a finding their client was denied the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment.\n\n6. The performance of Mack\u2019s lawyers during and in preparation for the trial phase of his case deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel.\n\n7. The numerous errors of fact and law committed by the trial court deprived Mack of his due process and equal protection rights.\n\n8. Mr. Mack was denied the effective assistance of counsel on appeal.\n\n9. Ohio\u2019s death penalty scheme is unconstitutional.\n\n10. Ohio\u2019s Murnahan process is not an adequate and independent process to protect defendants\u2019 constitutional rights.\n\n(Id. at 485-86 (capitalization altered).) The State filed a brief in response. (Id. at 669-719.)\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court\u2019s judgment on April 14, 2004. State v. Mack, 101 Ohio St. 3d 397 (Ohio 2004) (per curiam).\n\nB. Initial Federal Habeas Corpus Proceedings\n\nMack filed a notice of intent to initiate this habeas action on May 4, 2004. (Doc. 1.) He requested appointment of counsel and permission to proceed in forma pauperis. (Docs. 3, 4.) After several substitutions of counsel, he was represented by appointed counsel John Gibbons and Timothy Sweeney. (See, e.g., Docs. 12, 15, 32.)\nMack filed his original petition for a writ of habeas corpus on December 15, 2004. (Doc. 24.) He asserted twenty-nine grounds for relief, including a claim under *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), alleging that the State had improperly withheld exculpatory, mitigation and/or impeachment evidence from the defense, and numerous claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. (See Doc. 24-1 at 28-32, 80-89.)\n\nRespondent filed a return of writ on February 14, 2005. (Doc. 26.) Mack filed his traverse on May 16, 2005 (Doc. 35), to which Respondent replied (Doc. 44).\n\nAlso on May 16, 2005, Mack filed a motion for leave to conduct discovery and for the appointment of experts, which Respondent opposed. (Docs. 36, 42.) The court granted Mack\u2019s motion in part on March 31, 2008, permitting certain discovery relating to his ineffective-assistance and *Brady* claims, including depositions, document production, and funds to retain a mitigation expert and criminal investigator. (Doc. 52.)\n\nOn June 17, 2009, Mack filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing, which Respondent opposed. (Docs. 65, 69.) The court granted Mack\u2019s motion in part on May 31, 2010, directing that an evidentiary hearing be held on Mack\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to conduct a reasonable investigation into the credibility of Timothy Willis and to conduct a proper mitigation investigation, and certain of Mack\u2019s *Brady* claims. (Doc. 74 at 16.)\n\nOn April 23, 2010, Respondent moved to dismiss three claims on exhaustion grounds: (1) ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to conduct a reasonable mitigation investigation; (2) the failure of the State to disclose prior inconsistent statements of Timothy Willis; and (3) the failure of the State to disclose evidence of a deal given by\nthe State to Willis in exchange for his testimony against Mack and Sowell. (Doc. 76.) Mack opposed the motion. (Doc. 77.)\n\nThe court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Mack\u2019s ineffective-assistance and Brady claims on June 28 through June 30, 2010, and July 9, 2010. (See Docs. 99-102 (Hrg. Trs.).) The court also permitted Mack to supplement the record of the hearing with the deposition testimony of Cleveland Police Detective Earl Brown and former Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Anthony Manning. (Docs. 105 (Manning Dep.), 106 (Brown Dep.).) Mack and Respondent filed post-hearing briefs on September 13, 2010, and November 12, 2010, respectively. (Docs. 107, 110.)\n\nOn November 23, 2011, the court denied Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss. (Doc. 115.) It agreed with Respondent that certain of Mack\u2019s ineffective-assistance and Brady claims were unexhausted, but found that state-court remedies existed for Mack to exhaust the claims in state courts. (See, e.g., id. at 41-43, 45, 47-50.) It therefore stayed Mack\u2019s federal habeas case and held it in abeyance pending Mack\u2019s exhaustion of the claims in state court. (Id. at 52.)\n\nC. Second State Post-Conviction Petition and Motion for New Trial\n\nOn December 21, 2011, Mack filed a successor post-conviction petition and motion for leave to file a motion for new trial in the state trial court. (Doc. 151-1 at 37-65 (Mot. for New Trial), 66-123 (Post-Conviction Pet.).) He continued to be represented by attorneys Gibbons and Sweeney. (See id. at 38, 122-23.)\n\nIn his post-conviction petition, Mack asserted the following grounds for relief, stated as:\n1. Mack was denied due process of law and a fair trial as the result of the State\u2019s suppression of evidence and materials discoverable under *Brady v. Maryland*.\n\n   a. The State suppressed the handwritten notes authored by the victim\u2019s son-in-law Mike Barone of the Sanelli family\u2019s first meeting with Timothy Willis on January 23, 1991.\n\n   b. The State suppressed CPD\u2019s reports from Tim Willis\u2019 first communications with police regarding the Sanelli murder and Willis\u2019 written statement to the police dated January 23, 1991.\n\n   c. The State suppressed the CPD\u2019s reports regarding Sanelli\u2019s stolen vehicle as or after it crashed on Holton Avenue and the names of witnesses to that crash and its aftermath.\n\n   d. The State suppressed evidence of an agreement by the prosecutor to provide favorable consideration to Timothy Willis in his pending felony case involving Robert Burgess in exchange for Willis\u2019 testimony and cooperation in the prosecutions of Mack and Willis\u2019 testimony and cooperation in the prosecutions of Mack and Sowell.\n\n   e. The State suppressed CPD reports and other evidence that indicates Timothy Willis\u2019 house was searched at least four (4) times by police during the relevant time and Willis was considered a suspect in the Sanelli murder.\n\n   f. The State suppressed CPD reports indicating that Timothy Willis was, during the relevant time, believed by police to himself be a suspect in other ski-mask robberies and murders that were believed to be related to the Sanelli murder.\n\n   g. The State suppressed Willis\u2019 oral statement to prosecutors in or about June 1991 alleging that Mack admitted to shooting his gun after Sowell had fired the first shots.\n\n   h. The State allowed Timothy Willis to present perjured testimony and suppressed information that would have enabled Mack to challenge Willis\u2019 false testimony.\n\n   i. The State suppressed other police reports and statements.\n\n2. Mack\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel during\nboth the guilt/innocence and sentencing phases of the trial and in the preparation therefor.\n\na. Mack\u2019s trial counsel failed to investigate and pursue arguments and evidence that, even under the State\u2019s theory of the case, Mack was not the principal offender and thus not eligible for the death penalty.\n\nb. Mack\u2019s trial counsel failed during the mitigation phase to conduct a sufficient mitigation investigation into Mack\u2019s social, educational, and psychological background, or to develop a coherent mitigation strategy.\n\n(See id. at 79, 82, 85, 88, 90, 96, 98, 100, 102, 105, 109, 116 (capitalization altered and citations omitted).) Mack\u2019s motion for new trial asserted Brady claims also presented in his post-convictions petition. (See id. at 49 n.1, 51-53.)\n\nOn April 20, 2012, the State moved to dismiss the post-conviction petition and motion for new trial. (Id. at 138-69.) Mack opposed the motion. (Id. at 181-212.)\n\nThe court conducted an evidentiary hearing on August 27, 2013, and September 10, 2013. (See Doc. 151-9 (Hrg. Tr.).) It denied the petition and motion on March 20, 2014. (Doc. 151-2 at 260-69.)\n\nMack filed a timely appeal of the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Eighth District Court of Appeals. (Doc. 151-4 at 4-5.) In his appellate brief, he raised the following assignments of error:\n\n1. The trial court erred when it denied Mack\u2019s second-in-time petition for post-conviction relief for not meeting the jurisdictional requirements of R.C. \u00a7 2953.23, or for any other reason. All requirements for the court\u2019s jurisdiction under R.C. \u00a7 2953.53 were met, and Mack\u2019s claims are meritorious, thereby entitling Mack to relief from his unconstitutional convictions and/or sentence of death.\n\n2. Mack\u2019s convictions and death sentence are void and voidable because Ohio\u2019s post-conviction procedures do not provide an adequate\ncorrective process and violates the Constitution.\n\n3. Mack\u2019s convictions and/or sentence of death are void and/or voidable because Mack\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in the guilt/innocence phase of Mack\u2019s trial by unreasonably failing to investigate and pursue arguments and evidence that, even under the State\u2019s theory, Mack was not the principal offender and thus not eligible for death, in violation of Mack\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\n4. Mack\u2019s convictions and/or sentence of death are void and/or voidable because Mack\u2019s trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in the sentencing phase of Mack\u2019s trial, in violation of Mack\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\n5. Mack\u2019s convictions and/or sentence of death are void and/or voidable because the State of Ohio suppressed material exculpatory and/or impeachment information from Mack during and after his trial, in violation of Brady v. Maryland and its progeny and Mack\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\n6. The trial court erred in denying Mack\u2019s motion for leave to file a motion for new trial and in failing to grant a new trial.\n\n(Id. at 40-42.) The State filed a brief in response. (Id. at 126-67.)\n\nThe court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. State v. Mack, No. 101261, 2015 WL 3540451 (Ohio Ct. App. June 4, 2015). Mack moved for reconsideration, arguing that the appellate court erred in failing to consider the transcripts of the trial and successor post-conviction evidentiary hearings. (Doc. 151-4 at 222-77; Doc. 151-5 at 1-307.) The State did not oppose the application. (See Doc. 151-5 at 308-10.) The court denied Mack\u2019s application on September 16, 2015. (Id. at 311.)\n\nMack filed a timely appeal of the appellate court\u2019s judgment with the Ohio Supreme Court. (Id. at 312-14.) In his memorandum in support of jurisdiction, he asserted as his first of six propositions of law:\n\nAn Ohio appellate court must review and consider in adjudicating a capital\npost-conviction petitioner\u2019s appeal the transcripts of the underlying capital trial and of those other proceedings that are already on file with the court, were cited and relied upon by both parties to the appeal, and were reviewed and considered by the trial court in its opinion under review, and may not disregard those transcripts because of perceived clerical and/or procedural mistakes by the clerk or others, and the appellate court\u2019s failure to review and consider the transcripts on file in Appellant\u2019s case denied Appellant his right to an appeal and violated his rights as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Sections 1, 2, 9, 10, and 16, and Article IV, Sections 1, 2, 3, and 5, of the Ohio Constitution and Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2953.21 et. seq.\n\n(Doc. 151-6 at 82.)\n\nOn February 22, 2017, the Ohio Supreme Court accepted the appeal on Mack\u2019s first proposition of law, vacated the appellate court\u2019s decision, and remanded the cause to the court of appeals to reconsider the merits of Mack\u2019s appeal. *State v. Mack*, 148 Ohio St. 3d 1409 (Ohio 2017) (Table).\n\nOn November 2, 2017, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. *State v. Mack*, No. 101261, 2017 WL 5036648 (Ohio Ct. App. Nov. 2, 2017). Mack again moved for reconsideration. (Doc. 151-5 at 353-400.) On January 25, 2018, the appellate court granted Mack\u2019s application for reconsideration and ordered *sua sponte* that the court\u2019s November 2, 2017, decision was vacated and substituted with the judgment issued on that same date. (*Id.* at 409.) In that decision, it again affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. *State v. Mack*, No. 101261, 2018 WL 565704 (Ohio Ct. App. Jan. 25, 2018).\n\nMack filed a timely appeal of the appellate court\u2019s judgment with the Ohio Supreme Court. (Doc. 151-7 at 2-4.) In his memorandum in support of jurisdiction, he asserted the following five propositions of law:\n\n1. Ohio\u2019s post-conviction procedures do not provide an adequate corrective process and violate the Constitution. Ohio Const. Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7\n2, 5, 9, 10 and 16; U.S. Const. Amends. V, VI, VIII and XIV; *Montgomery v. Louisiana*, 136 S. Ct. 718 (2016).\n\n2. An Appellant\u2019s right to due process is violated when the lower courts find that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider claims in Appellant\u2019s postconviction petition pursuant to R.C. \u00a7 2953.21 and R.C. \u00a7 2953.23(A), when he satisfied all statutory requirements. Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5, 9, 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution; U.S. Const. Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n3. The lower courts unreasonably determined the facts and misapplied the law when they failed to grant relief on Appellant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. The right to effective assistance of trial counsel is violated when counsel\u2019s deficient performance results in prejudice to the defendant. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 688 (1984). Ohio Const. Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5, 9, 10 and 16; U.S. Const. Amends. V, VI, VIII and XIV.\n\n4. The lower courts unreasonably determined the facts and misapplied the law when they failed to grant relief on Mack\u2019s claims that the State of Ohio suppressed material exculpatory and/or impeachment information from Mack during and after his trial, which denied Mack a fair trial and reliable sentencing proceeding. *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). Ohio Const. Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 16; U.S. Const. Amends. V, VI, VIII and XIV.\n\n5. An Appellant\u2019s right to due process is violated when his motion for leave to file a motion for new trial is denied, and upheld on appeal, even though Appellant met all applicable requirements for being granted a new trial. Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 5, 9, 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution; U.S. Const. Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n(Doc. 151-7 at 57-58.)\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court declined to accept the appeal on June 6, 2018. *State v. Mack*, 152 Ohio St. 3d 1489 (Ohio 2018) (Table).\n\n**D. Reinstated Federal Habeas Proceedings**\n\nHaving exhausted his remedies in state court, Mack moved to reinstate his case on this court\u2019s docket on July 5, 2018. (Doc. 143.) Mack filed an amended habeas petition on\nApril 19, 2019. (Doc. 155.) Respondent filed a return of writ on August 5, 2019. (Doc. 158.) Mack filed a traverse on January 2, 2020. (Doc. 162.)\n\nIn addition, Mack filed a second motion for evidentiary hearing (Doc. 163) on January 30, 2020, which Respondent opposed (Doc. 164). The court denied the motion on September 22, 2020, as the motion merely \u201crenew[ed] and/or submit[ted]\u201d the motion for an evidentiary hearing that Mack filed in 2005 (Doc. 36) as to those claims the court had previously denied a hearing (see Doc. 52). (Doc. 165.)\n\n**PETITIONER\u2019S GROUNDS FOR RELIEF**\n\nMack asserts twenty-nine grounds for relief in his amended petition, stated as:\n\n1. The State\u2019s improper, discriminatory and unconstitutional use of peremptory challenges to remove African-Americans and women from the jury denied Mr. Mack his constitutional rights.\n\n2. The trial court applied the wrong standard in reviewing Mr. Mack\u2019s challenges to the State\u2019s improper, discriminatory and unconstitutional exercise of peremptory challenges, thereby obliterating his rights under *Batson v. Kentucky* and its progeny.\n\n3. Mr. Mack was denied his right to a fair trial with an impartial jury that was representative of the community because prospective jurors who expressed reservations about the death penalty were excused while jurors who expressed a predisposition for the death penalty in cases of felony murder were retained.\n\n4. Mr. Mack was denied the effective assistance of counsel during the voir dire stage of his trial.\n\n5. The State improperly, illegally and unconstitutionally withheld exculpatory, mitigation and/or impeachment evidence from the defense in violation of its obligations under *Brady v. Maryland*.\n\n6. Mr. Mack was subjected to an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n7. Mr. Mack\u2019s custodial statements were obtained in violation of his\nconstitutional rights. All statements obtained in violation of *Miranda* and its progeny violate the protections under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n8. The refusal to allow Mr. Mack access to the grand jury proceedings, and in particular the testimony of the lying informant Timothy Willis, denied his rights to due process and a fair trial.\n\n9. The trial court\u2019s refusal to allow the defense to present the testimony of witnesses who were prepared to testify about the bias of Timothy Willis and about his prior statements, including Willis\u2019 confession that Willis himself committed the subject murder, deprived Mr. Mack of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n10. The trial court\u2019s failure to allow the defense to confront lying informant Timothy Willis with his lies, and its refusal to permit a meaningful cross-examination of Willis that would challenge his veracity and expose his bias, deprived Mr. Mack of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n11. The trial court made a number of other significant errors in its evidentiary rulings during the trial phase of the case, thereby denying Mr. Mack his rights to due process and to a fair trial.\n\n12. The admission of gruesome and inflammatory photos was prejudicial and denied Mr. Mack due process and a fair trial.\n\n13. Mr. Mack was denied his right to a fair trial because the trial judge provided the jury with a number of erroneous jury instructions in both the guilt/innocence and penalty phases of the trial.\n\n14. Mr. Mack was denied due process and a fair trial because the trial judge refused to instruct on the lesser included offenses of murder and involuntary manslaughter and improperly instructed on purpose to kill.\n\n15. The trial court committed numerous other errors of fact and law thereby depriving Mr. Mack of his rights to a fair trial, due process of law and equal protection under the law.\n\n16. Mr. Mack was denied his right to a fair trial because of repeated instances of prosecutorial misconduct throughout both phases of his trial.\n\n17. The ineffective assistance of trial counsel during the guilt/innocence\nphase of the case denied Mr. Mack his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n18. The ineffective assistance of trial counsel during the sentencing phase of the case denied Mr. Mack his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n19. The ineffective assistance of appellate counsel denied Mr. Mack his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n20. Mr. Mack\u2019s conviction for felony murder is unconstitutional because it was obtained with insufficient evidence that he was the principal offender.\n\n21. Mr. Mack was denied due process and equal protection of the law as a result of his conviction of a death penalty specification that does not require proof of prior calculation and design for principal offenders but does require proof of prior calculation and design for an aider and abettor.\n\n22. Mr. Mack was denied due process because both the trial court and the appellate courts failed to fulfill their statutory duties in imposing and reviewing his sentence of death, and the appellate courts failed to fulfill their obligation to meaningfully review the proportionality of Mr. Mack\u2019s death sentence.\n\n23. Ohio\u2019s post-conviction procedures, and its Murnahan procedures for reopening a direct appeal, neither afford an adequate corrective process nor comply with due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n24. Mr. Mack\u2019s death sentence is unconstitutional because it is not reliable and because the mitigating factors outweigh the sole aggravating circumstance.\n\n25. Mr. Mack\u2019s death sentence is unfairly disproportionate to similar cases, including that of his co-defendants. The Ohio courts denied him due process by failing to properly consider the proportionality of his death sentence.\n\n26. Ohio\u2019s death penalty statute is unconstitutional in numerous respects.\n\n27. Mr. Mack\u2019s conviction and sentence are unconstitutional because of the cumulative effect of the many errors that occurred during his trial and\nin all subsequent proceedings.\n\n28. Mack\u2019s conviction and death sentence violate due process because they are based almost exclusively, if not exclusively, on the uncorroborated testimony of Timothy Willis.\n\n29. Mack is innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted, is innocent of the death penalty, and it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow his conviction and sentence to remain in effect.\n\n(Doc. 155 at 3-9 (capitalization altered).)\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nA. AEDPA Review\n\nIn essence, habeas corpus is \u201can attack by a person in custody upon the legality of that custody, and . . . the traditional function of the writ is to secure release from illegal custody.\u201d Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 484 (1973). Mack\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). See Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 336 (1997) (AEDPA governs federal habeas petitions filed after Act\u2019s effective date). The Act, which amended 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, authorizes federal courts to issue writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners who are \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).\n\nAt the same time, however, AEDPA was intended \u201cto reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in capital cases, and \u2018to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism.\u2019\u201d Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U.S. 202, 206 (2003) (quoting (Michael) Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 436 (2000)). The Act \u201crecognizes a foundational principle of our federal system: State courts are adequate\nforums for the vindication of federal rights.\u201d *Burt v. Titlow*, 571 U.S. 12, 18 (2013). It therefore \u201cerects a formidable barrier to federal habeas relief for prisoners whose claims have been adjudicated in state court.\u201d *Id.* at 19.\n\nMost significantly, \u00a7 2254(d) forbids a federal court from granting habeas relief with respect to a \u201cclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings\u201d unless the state-court decision either:\n\n1. resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or\n\n2. resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nHabeas courts review the \u201clast explained state-court judgment\u201d on the federal claim at issue. *Ylst v. Nunnemaker*, 501 U.S. 797, 805 (1991) (emphasis in original). A state court has adjudicated a claim \u201con the merits,\u201d and AEDPA deference applies, regardless of whether the state court provided little or no reasoning at all for its decision. \u201cWhen a federal claim has been presented to a state court and the state court has denied relief, it may be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the merits in the absence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary.\u201d *Harrington v. Richter*, 562 U.S. 86, 99 (2011).\n\n\u201c[C]learly established Federal law\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u201cis the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its decision.\u201d *Lockyer v. Andrade*, 538 U.S. 63, 71-72 (2003). It includes \u201conly the\nholdings, as opposed to the dicta, of [the Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions.\u201d *White v. Woodall*, 572 U.S. 415, 419 (2014) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). When identifying what a Supreme Court decision actually holds, courts should not frame the decision \u201cat too high a level of generality.\u201d *Woods v. Donald*, 575 U.S. 312, 318 (2015). Clearly established law under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u201csquarely addresses\u201d the issue presented or \u201cclearly establishes\u201d a legal rule developed in a different context applied to the facts of that case. *Wright v. Van Patten*, 552 U.S. 120, 125 (2008).\n\nA state-court decision is contrary to \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) only \u201cif the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d *Williams v. Taylor*, 529 U.S. 362, 412-13 (2000). Under \u00a7 2254(d)(1)'s \u201cunreasonable application\u201d clause, a federal habeas court may not grant relief because it \u201cconcludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly. Rather, that application must also be unreasonable.\u201d *Id.* at 411.\n\nFurther, the state-court decision need not refer to relevant Supreme Court cases or even demonstrate an awareness of them; it is sufficient that the result and reasoning are consistent with Supreme Court precedent. *Early v. Packer*, 537 U.S. 3, 8 (2002) (per curiam). And a state court does not act contrary to clearly established law when the precedent of the Supreme Court is ambiguous or nonexistent. *See, e.g., Mitchell v. Esparza*, 540 U.S. 12, 17 (2003) (per curiam). \u201c[R]eview under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.\u201d *Cullen*\nv. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 181 (2011).\n\nA state-court decision is an \u201cunreasonable determination of the facts\u201d under \u00a7 2254(d)(2) if the court made a \u201cclear factual error.\u201d Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 528-29 (2003). The petitioner bears the burden of rebutting the state court\u2019s factual findings \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Burt, 571 U.S. at 18; Rice v. White, 660 F.3d 242, 250 (6th Cir. 2011). This requirement mirrors the \u201cpresumption of correctness\u201d AEDPA affords state-court factual determinations, which only can be overcome by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). The Supreme Court has cautioned, however, that \u201c\u2018a state-court factual determination is not unreasonable merely because the federal habeas court would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance.\u2019\u201d Burt, 571 U.S. at 18 (quoting Wood v. Allen, 558 U.S. 290, 301 (2010)).\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court repeatedly has emphasized that \u00a7 2254(d), as amended by AEDPA, is an intentionally demanding standard, affording great deference to state-court adjudications of federal claims. The Court has admonished that a reviewing court may not \u201ctreat[] the reasonableness question as a test of its confidence in the result it would reach under de novo review,\u201d and that \u201ceven a strong case for relief does not mean the state court\u2019s contrary conclusion was unreasonable.\u201d Harrington, 562 U.S. at 102; see also Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 473 (2007) (\u201cThe question under AEDPA is not whether a federal court believes the state court\u2019s determination was incorrect but whether\n\n3 Section 2254(e)(1) provides: \u201cIn a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct. The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).\nthat determination was unreasonable \u2013 a substantially higher threshold.\u201d). Rather, \u00a7 2254(d) \u201creflects the view that habeas corpus is a guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems\u201d and does not function as a \u201csubstitute for ordinary error correction through appeal.\u201d Harrington, 562 U.S. at 102-03 (internal quotation marks omitted). A petitioner, therefore, \u201cmust show that the state court\u2019s ruling . . . was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d Id. at 103. This is a very high standard, which the Court readily acknowledges: \u201cIf this standard is difficult to meet, that is because it is meant to be.\u201d Id. at 102.\n\nBut AEDPA \u201cstops short of imposing a complete bar on federal court relitigation of claims already rejected in state proceedings.\u201d Id. \u201c[E]ven in the context of federal habeas, deference does not imply abandonment or abdication of judicial review. Deference does not by definition preclude relief.\u201d Miller-El, 537 U.S. at 340. Federal habeas courts may, for example, review de novo an exhausted federal claim where a state court misapplied a procedural bar and did not review the claim on the merits. See, e.g., Hill v. Mitchell, 400 F.3d 308, 313 (6th Cir. 2005). They likewise may review de novo claims adjudicated on the merits in state court if the petitioner meets the criteria for one of \u00a7 2254(d)\u2019s exceptions. See, e.g., Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534 (performing de novo review under Strickland\u2019s second prong because the state court unreasonably applied the law in resolving Strickland\u2019s first prong).\n\nB. Exhaustion and Procedural Default\n\nUnder AEDPA, state prisoners must exhaust all possible state remedies, or have no\nremaining state remedies, before a federal court will review a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) and (c); see also Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509 (1982). This entails giving the state courts \u201cone full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 845 (1999). In other words, \u201cthe highest court in the state in which the petitioner was convicted [must have] been given a full and fair opportunity to rule on the petitioner\u2019s claims.\u201d Manning v. Alexander, 912 F.2d 878, 881 (6th Cir. 1990). The exhaustion requirement, however, \u201crefers only to remedies still available at the time of the federal petition.\u201d Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 125 n.28 (1982). It \u201cdoes not require pursuit of a state remedy where such a pursuit is clearly futile.\u201d Wiley v. Sowders, 647 F.2d 642, 647 (6th Cir. 1981).\n\nProcedural default is a related but \u201cdistinct\u201d concept from exhaustion. Williams v. Anderson, 460 F.3d 789, 806 (6th Cir. 2006). It occurs when a habeas petitioner fails to obtain consideration of a federal constitutional claim by state courts because he failed to either: (1) comply with a state procedural rule that prevented the state courts from reaching the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claim; or (2) fairly raise that claim before the state courts while state remedies were still available. See, e.g., Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 80, 84-87 (1977); Engle, 456 U.S. at 125 n.28; Williams, 460 F.3d at 806.\n\nWhere a state court declines to address a prisoner\u2019s federal claim because the prisoner has failed to meet a state procedural requirement, federal habeas review is barred as long as the state judgment rested on \u201cindependent and adequate\u201d state procedural grounds. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 729 (1991). To be independent, a state\nprocedural rule and the state courts\u2019 application of it must not rely in any part on federal law. *Id.* at 732-33. To be adequate, a state procedural rule must be \u201c\u2018firmly established\u2019 and \u2018regularly followed\u2019\u201d by the state courts at the time it was applied. *Beard v. Kindler*, 558 U.S. 53, 60-61 (2009).4\n\nA petitioner also may procedurally default a claim by failing to raise the claim in state court and pursue it through the state\u2019s \u201c\u2018ordinary appellate review procedures,\u2019\u201d if, at the time of the federal habeas petition, state law no longer allows the petitioner to raise the claim. *Williams*, 460 F.3d at 806 (quoting *O'Sullivan*, 526 U.S. at 848); see also *Baston v. Bagley*, 282 F. Supp. 2d 655, 661 (N.D. Ohio 2003) (\u201cIssues not presented at each and every level [of the state courts] cannot be considered in a federal habeas corpus petition.\u201d). Under these circumstances, while the exhaustion requirement is technically satisfied\n\n4 In *Maupin v. Smith*, 785 F.2d 135 (6th Cir. 1986), the Sixth Circuit established the now-familiar test to be followed when the state argues that a habeas claim is defaulted because of a prisoner\u2019s failure to observe a state procedural rule. It is:\n\nFirst, the federal court must determine whether there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner\u2019s claim and whether the petitioner failed to comply with that rule. Second, the federal court must determine whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction \u2013 that is, whether the state courts actually based their decisions on the procedural rule. Third, the federal court must decide whether the state procedural rule is an adequate and independent state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose federal review of a federal constitutional claim. Fourth, if the federal court answers the first three questions in the affirmative, it would not review the petitioner's procedurally defaulted claim unless the petitioner can show cause for not following the procedural rule and that failure to review the claim would result in prejudice or a miscarriage of justice.\n\n*Williams v. Coyle*, 260 F.3d 684, 693 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing *Maupin*, 785 F.2d at 138) (further citations omitted).\nbecause there are no longer any state-court remedies available to the petitioner, the petitioner\u2019s failure to have the federal claims fully considered in the state courts constitutes a procedural default of those claims, barring federal habeas review. *Williams*, 460 F.3d at 806 (\u201cWhere state court remedies are no longer available to a petitioner because he or she failed to use them within the required time period, procedural default and not exhaustion bars federal court review.\u201d); *see also Gray v. Netherland*, 518 U.S. 152, 161-62 (1996) (\u201cBecause the exhaustion requirement \u2018refers only to remedies still available at the time of the federal petition,\u2019 . . ., it is satisfied \u2018if it is clear that [the habeas petitioner\u2019s] claims are now procedurally barred under [state] law\u2019 . . . .\u201d (internal citations omitted)).\n\nFurthermore, to \u201cfairly present\u201d a claim to a state court, a petitioner must assert both its legal and factual basis. *Williams*, 460 F.3d at 806 (citing *McMeans v. Brigano*, 228 F.3d 674, 681 (6th Cir. 2000)). Most importantly, a \u201c\u2018petitioner must present his claim to the state courts as a federal constitutional issue \u2013 not merely as an issue arising under state law.\u2019\u201d *Id.* (quoting *Koontz v. Glossa*, 731 F.2d 365, 368 (6th Cir. 1984)).\n\nIn determining whether a claim is procedurally defaulted and barred from consideration on federal habeas review, the federal court again looks to the last state court rendering a reasoned opinion on that claim. *Ylst*, 501 U.S. at 805. If the state court \u201cclearly and expressly states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar,\u201d then the claim is procedurally defaulted.5 *Harris v. Reed*, 489 U.S. 255, 263 (1989). Conversely, if the last\n\n5 Where a later state-court decision rests upon a prohibition against further state review, the decision \u201cneither rests upon procedural default nor lifts a pre-existing procedural default, [and] its effect upon the availability of federal habeas is nil . . . .\u201d *Ylst*, 501 U.S. at 804 n.3. In that case, habeas courts \u201clook through\u201d that later decision to the prior reasoned state-court judgment. *Id.* at 805 (\u201cstate rules against [a] superfluous recourse [of state habeas proceedings] have no bearing\nstate court presented with the claim reaches its merits, then the procedural bar is removed and the federal habeas court may consider the merits of the claim in its review. *Ylst*, 501 U.S. at 801.\n\nA petitioner may overcome procedural default by demonstrating cause for the default and actual prejudice that resulted from the alleged violation of federal law, or that there will be a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice\u201d if the claim is not considered. *Coleman*, 501 U.S. at 750. \u201c\u2018[C]ause\u2019 under the cause and prejudice test must be something external to the petitioner, something that cannot be fairly attributed to him.\u201d *Id.* To establish prejudice, a petitioner must demonstrate that the constitutional error \u201cworked to his actual and substantial disadvantage.\u201d *Perkins v. LeCureux*, 58 F.3d 214, 219 (6th Cir. 1995) (quoting *United States v. Frady*, 456 U.S. 152, 170 (1982)). \u201cA fundamental miscarriage of justice results from the conviction of one who is \u2018actually innocent.\u2019\u201d *Lundgren v. Mitchell*, 440 F.3d 754, 764 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing *Murray v. Carrier*, 477 U.S. 478, 496 (1986)).\n\nA fundamental miscarriage of justice in capital cases also means actually innocent of the death penalty. *See Sawyer v. Whitley*, 505 U.S. 333, 347 (1992). In this sense, \u201c[t]o show \u2018actual innocence\u2019 one must show by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a constitutional error, no reasonable jury would have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty under the applicable state law.\u201d *Id.* at 336. This \u201cactual innocence\u201d standard \u201cmust focus on the elements that render a defendant eligible for the death penalty.\u201d *Hutton v. Mitchell*, 839 F.3d 486, 498 (6th Cir. 2016) (citing *Sawyer*, 505 U.S. at 347).\n\n________________________\n\nupon [a petitioner\u2019s] ability to raise the [federal] claim in federal court\u201d).\nC. Cognizability\n\nFederal habeas courts also must consider whether the petitioner\u2019s claims are cognizable. To the extent a claim alleges state-law violations, it is not reviewable by a federal habeas court and must be dismissed on that basis. \u201cIt is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions. In conducting habeas review, a federal court is limited to deciding whether a conviction violated the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d *Estelle v. McGuire*, 502 U.S. 62, 68 (1991) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241); *see also Lewis v. Jeffers*, 497 U.S. 764, 780 (1990) (\u201c[F]ederal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.\u201d); *Engle v. Isaac*, 456 U.S. 107, 121 n.21 (1982) (\u201cWe have long recognized that a \u2018mere error of state law\u2019 is not a denial of due process.\u201d) (citation omitted)).\n\nMoreover, \u201ca state court\u2019s interpretation of state law, including one announced on direct appeal of the challenged conviction, binds a federal court sitting in habeas corpus.\u201d *Bradshaw v. Richey*, 546 U.S. 74, 76 (2005) (citing *Estelle*, 502 U.S. at 67-68). A federal habeas court does not function as an additional state appellate court reviewing state courts\u2019 decisions on state law or procedure. *Allen v. Morris*, 845 F.2d 610, 614 (6th Cir. 1988).\n\nState-court rulings on issues of state law may, however, \u201crise to the level of due process violations [if] they \u2018offend[] some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\u2019\u201d *Seymour v. Walker*, 224 F.3d 542, 552 (6th Cir. 2000) (quoting *Montana v. Egelhoff*, 518 U.S. 37, 43 (1996)). But they must be \u201cso egregious that [they] result in a denial of fundamental fairness.\u201d *Bugh v. Mitchell*, 329 F.3d 496, 512 (6th Cir. 2003). Courts, therefore, \u201chave defined the category\nof infractions that violate \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 very narrowly.\u201d\u2019 Id. (quoting Wright v. Dallman, 999 F.2d 174, 178 (6th Cir. 1993)).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nI. First and Second Grounds for Relief: Juror Selection\n\nFor his first and second grounds for relief, Mack contends that the prosecution\u2019s discriminatory use of peremptory challenges to exclude African-American and female members of the jury pool from serving on the jury violated his constitutional rights. (Doc. 155 at 49-56.) Respondent argues that these claims are procedurally defaulted and meritless. (See Doc. 158 at 48-51.)\n\nA. Procedural Posture\n\nAs Respondent asserts, these claims are procedurally defaulted. They arise out of the record of proceedings in the trial court, and therefore could have been raised on direct appeal. But Mack failed to do so, and under Ohio law, res judicata now prohibits him from raising the issues in any post-conviction proceeding. See Wong v. Money, 142 F.3d 313, 322 (6th Cir. 1998) (\u201cUnder Ohio law, the failure to raise on appeal a claim that appears on the face of the record constitutes a procedural default under the State\u2019s doctrine of res judicata.\u201d); State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St. 2d 175 (Ohio 1967) (holding that res judicata bars a criminal defendant from raising in post-conviction proceedings those claims that could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal). With no state-court remedies still available to him, Mack has defaulted the claims. See Gray v. Netherland, 518 U.S. 152, 161\u201362 (1996) (\u201cBecause the exhaustion requirement refers only to remedies still available at the time of the federal petition . . ., it is satisfied if it is clear that [the petitioner\u2019s] claims are now\nprocedurally barred under [state] law.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); *Alley v. Bell*, 307 F.3d 380, 385 (6th Cir. 2002) (\u201c[I]f an unexhausted claim would be procedurally barred under state law, that claim is procedurally defaulted for purposes of federal habeas review.\u201d).\n\nMack strenuously contests the procedural default. He notes that he presented the claims to Ohio courts in an application to reopen his direct appeal pursuant to Ohio Appellate Rule 26(B) as the underlying grounds of claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. *See Mack*, 2003 WL 21185786, at *3-4. And he argues that the claims are not defaulted because either: (1) the claims are exempt from AEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement under \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(B) since Rule 26(B) does not provide an adequate corrective process for redressing constitutional violations; or (2) he fairly presented the claims to state courts in the Rule 26(B) reopening application. (Doc. 162 at 34-67, 104-07.)\n\nAs Mack concedes, however, this court already has carefully considered these arguments and rejected them. (*See* Doc. 115 at 16-22.) In short, as to Mack\u2019s first argument, Rule 26(B) proceedings are a \u201cseparate collateral opportunity\u201d to raise appellate-counsel ineffective-assistance claims, and not part of the original appeal. *E.g.*, *Goldberg v. Maloney*, 692 F.3d 534, 537 (6th Cir. 2012). As such, Ohio courts have wide latitude in governing the process, which courts have declined to find unconstitutional. *See, e.g.*, *Sneed v. Johnson*, No. 1:04 CV 588, 2007 WL 709778, at *24 (N.D. Ohio March 2, 2007).\n\nSecond, the Sixth Circuit repeatedly has held that a state application to reopen the direct appeal does not preserve the underlying substantive arguments of appellate-counsel ineffective-assistance claims for habeas review. *See, e.g.*, *Wogenstahl v. Mitchell*, 668 F.3d\n307, 338 (6th Cir. 2012) (\u201c[P]ermitting an Ohio prisoner to revive procedurally defaulted claims by raising them in a Rule 26(B) application \u2018would eviscerate the continued vitality of the procedural default rule; every procedural default could be avoided, and federal court merits review guaranteed, by claims that every act giving rise to every procedural default was the result of constitutionally ineffective counsel.\u2019\u201d) (quoting Lott v. Coyle, 261 F.3d 594, 612 (6th Cir. 2001)); Davie v. Mitchell, 547 F.3d 297, 312 (6th Cir. 2008) (\u201c[B]ringing an ineffective assistance claim in state court based on counsel\u2019s failure to raise an underlying claim does not preserve the underlying claim for federal habeas review because the two claims are analytically distinct.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); White v. Mitchell, 431 F.3d 517, 526 (6th Cir. 2005) (same). This court is bound by that precedent.\n\nMack argues that even if these claims are procedurally defaulted, he can establish cause and prejudice or his actual innocence to excuse the defaults. (Doc. 162 at 68-76; 106-07.) He points to the ineffective assistance of trial counsel in failing to preserve the claims, and of appellate counsel in failing to raise these claims on direct appeal. (Id.) Attorney error that constitutes ineffective assistance, including that of appellate counsel, is cause. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 754 (1991); Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 492 (1986). But claims of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot provide cause for the procedural default of another claim if the ineffective-assistance claim itself is procedurally defaulted. Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 453 (2000). For the reasons discussed below with regard to Mack\u2019s independent ineffective-assistance claims, the ineffective-assistance claims Mack cites here as cause either lack merit or are themselves procedurally\ndefaulted and do not establish cause for the default of Mack\u2019s jury-selection claims. Similarly, as the court explains with regard to Mack\u2019s independent claim of actual innocence, that claim, too, lacks merit and cannot excuse the default of Mack\u2019s jury-selection claims. Mack\u2019s first and second grounds for relief, therefore, are procedurally defaulted.\n\nB. Merits Analysis\n\nAlthough Mack\u2019s jury-selection claims are procedurally defaulted, they also lack merit. Because no state court has addressed these claims, AEDPA deference does not apply and the court reviews them de novo. Rice v. White, 660 F.3d 242, 252 (6th Cir. 2011) (\u201cIt is well settled that we may review de novo an exhausted federal claim that was not adjudicated on the merits in state court.\u201d).\n\n1. Factual basis\n\nMack\u2019s claim of purposeful discrimination to exclude African-American members of the venire focuses on prospective jurors Theodore Griggs, Christal Martin, and Maralyn Wiley. His claim of purposeful discrimination to exclude women focuses again on potential jurors Martin and Wiley, and also Eleanor George. (See Doc. 155 at 49-50.)\n\nProspective Juror Griggs. After three black jurors were seated on the jury without challenge from the prosecution, the prosecutor used his first peremptory challenge to exclude Mr. Griggs, a black man, after brief questioning by the prosecutor and defense attorney. (Doc. 150-1 (Trial Tr.) at 129-31, 167-68.) Defense counsel objected:\n\nI would object to [the] excus[al] of Mr. Griggs on peremptory challenge. Clarence Mack is a black individual, only two of the first 12, there are two black individuals on this jury and Mr. Griggs is a black prospective juror and I would object to him being excused.\nThe trial court then responded:\n\nThe Court at this point would note that the juror who will take his place is also black and that there are numerous black prospective jurors in the pool yet to be questioned. And it would appear to the Court that the jury that will ultimately be selected will be representative of the community. And at this point I don\u2019t see any basis to refuse the peremptory challenge. Obviously the make-up of the jury after all 12 are selected would be the determining factor.\n\nYou may re-raise your objection at that time if it appears the jury is not representative.\n\nDefense counsel did not raise this objection again.\n\nProspective Juror Martin. During voir dire, Ms. Martin stated that she had a second cousin she did not see frequently who worked for the Cleveland Police Department. She also said she was employed by a group of physicians and had been for six years. And she admitted that eight or nine years earlier she had plead guilty to a misdemeanor welfare crime arising from being employed and receiving benefits at the same time, for which she had made restitution and was placed on probation. Ms. Martin further stated that she would not believe that a person was guilty just because they were charged, or that the testimony of persons in positions of authority should be given more weight; and the fact that the defendant was black and the victim was white would not prevent her from rendering a just verdict.\n\nThe prosecutor exercised his second peremptory strike to remove Ms. Martin. The defense objected: \u201c[T]he prosecutor excused juror Christal Martin, that was after they had come to the bench and tried to get her excused for cause. And she\u2019s a black juror and we would object to her being excused on a peremptory.\u201d The trial court overruled the objection, finding a \u201creasonable basis for the peremptory challenge\nProspective Juror Wiley. The prosecution\u2019s questioning of Ms. Wiley focused on whether she would be able to sentence the defendant to death; she agreed that she could follow the law. (Id. at 227-52.) The State used a peremptory challenge to excuse her. (Id. at 252.)\n\nAfter the jury was seated, defense counsel raised an objection to Ms. Wiley\u2019s excusal:\n\nYes, Judge, for the record we want to enter an objection to the excusal of Maralyn Wiley by the prosecutor.\n\nThe record should indicate she was a black individual. In addition to that, she had been previously passed over for cause and accepted as a juror when that panel was, and then she was excused by the prosecutor.\n\n(Id. at 301.)\n\nThe court stated, \u201cI assume at this time the State would like to present their reasons for the excusal on the record.\u201d (Id.) The prosecutor replied:\n\nYes, your Honor. First of all, I won\u2019t give you my reason[.] There hasn\u2019t been systematic excusal of blacks pursuant to Griffith versus Kentucky. There are three blacks presently seated on this jury, I didn\u2019t challenge any of those. The reason I kicked off Miss Wiley, upon further reflection I find that it has nothing to do with race, she has circumstances in her life that I got from this questionnaire; she\u2019s 35 years old, she has three children, presently unemployed, and in the last 18 years has worked a total of five years. That combination, based upon my past experience, and plus her facial mannerisms that I saw looking at her, in my past experience, your Honor, I just felt uncomfortable about it.\n\n(Id. at 301-02.)\n\nThe court then overruled the defense\u2019s objection, stating:\n\nI have been observing the peremptory challenges to make sure there have been no violations of existing Court rules or constitutional precedents and it\u2019s my\nbelief that there have been legitimate reasons for all of the excuses in this case, and therefore, I have not intervened.\n\n(Id. at 302.)\n\nProspective Juror George. After Ms. Wiley was excused from the jury but before the defense objected to her removal, the prosecutor used his third peremptory challenge to excuse Ms. George, a white woman. (Id. at 282-83.) Defense counsel did not object.\n\nWhen the jury was seated, of fourteen jurors, three were black and five were women. (See Doc. 149-1 at 84-85.)\n\n2. Legal standards\n\n\u201c[T]he Equal Protection Clause forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race or on the assumption that black jurors as a group will be unable impartially to consider the State\u2019s case against a black defendant.\u201d Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 89 (1986), modified on other grounds by Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400 (1991). The Supreme Court extended this protection to the area of gender discrimination in J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127 (1994).\n\nThe trial court\u2019s determination of whether the prosecutor is using peremptory challenges for an improper purpose involves three steps. First, the court must determine whether the defendant has made a prima facie showing that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge on a discriminatory basis. Batson, 476 U.S. at 96-97. Once the proponent explains the challenge and the trial court rules on the ultimate issue of discrimination, whether or not a prima facie case was established becomes moot. Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 359 (1991).\n\nSecond, if the showing is made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to present a\nrace-neutral explanation for striking the juror in question. *Batson*, 476 U.S. at 97-98.\n\n\u201cAlthough the prosecutor must present a comprehensible reason, \u2018[t]he second step of this process does not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible\u2019; so long as the reason is not inherently discriminatory, it suffices.\u201d *Rice v. Collins*, 546 U.S. 333, 338 (2006) (quoting *Purkett v. Elem*, 514 U.S. 765, 767-68 (1995)).\n\nThird, the court must then determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination. *Batson*, 476 U.S. at 98. \u201cThis final step involves evaluating \u2018the persuasiveness of the justification\u2019 proffered by the prosecutor, but \u2018the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never shifts from, the opponent of the strike.\u2019\u201d *Rice*, 546 U.S. at 338 (quoting *Purkett*, 514 U.S. at 768). In making this determination, \u201c\u2018the court presumes that the facially valid reasons proffered by the [party exercising the peremptory challenge] are true.\u2019\u201d *Braxton v. Gansheimer*, 561 F.3d 453, 459 (6th Cir. 2009) (quoting *Lancaster v. Adams*, 324 F.3d 423, 433 (6th Cir. 2003)). The issue, therefore, \u201ccomes down to whether the trial court finds the prosecutor\u2019s race-neutral explanations to be credible.\u201d *Miller-El v. Cockrell*, 537 U.S. 322, 339 (2003). \u201cCredibility can be measured by, among other factors, the prosecutor\u2019s demeanor; by how reasonable, or how improbable, the explanations are; and by whether the proffered rationale has some basis in accepted trial strategy.\u201d *Id.*\n\nThe Supreme Court has emphasized that trial-court findings on the issue of discriminatory intent must be afforded \u201cgreat deference.\u201d *See Hernandez*, 500 U.S. at 364-66. This makes \u201cparticular\u201d sense, it has explained, because\n\n[t]here will seldom be much evidence bearing on that issue, and the best evidence often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the\nchallenge. As with the state of mind of a juror, evaluation of the prosecutor\u2019s state of mind based on demeanor and credibility lies \u201cpeculiarly within a trial judge\u2019s province.\u201d\n\nId. at 365 (quoting Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 428 (1985)). Indeed, \u201c[t]he credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation goes to the heart of the equal protection analysis, and once that has been settled, there seems nothing left to review.\u201d Id. at 367. \u201c[I]n the absence of exceptional circumstances,\u201d therefore, habeas courts must \u201cdefer to state-court factual findings, even when those findings relate to a constitutional issue.\u201d Id. at 366.\n\n3. Analysis\n\nMack\u2019s trial counsel did not make a prima facie case of discrimination against prospective jurors Martin, Wiley, and George on the basis of gender. In fact, defense counsel never objected to the State\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to these prospective jurors on that ground at all. This aspect of Mack\u2019s Batson claim, therefore, lacks merit.\n\nFurthermore, after reviewing the voir dire, the court defers to the trial court\u2019s rulings on defense counsel\u2019s objections. As to Mr. Griggs, the court did not overrule defense counsel\u2019s objection. It stated the defense could raise the objection again once the jury was set and the court could evaluate its composition as a whole. (Id. at 173.) The defense did not raise its objection to Mr. Griggs\u2019 excusal again. There is no basis, therefore, for a constitutional violation in Mr. Griggs\u2019 removal from the jury.\n\nMack asserts that under Batson, the prosecution was required to provide an explanation for its challenged strike of Mr. Griggs. (Doc. 162 at 91.) But because the trial court noted the objection and reserved ruling on it until the defense raised it again at a later stage in the jury-selection process, which it did not, there was no need at that point for the\nprosecution to explain the strike. Mack also argues that the trial court\u2019s reference to the jury\u2019s final composition in his remarks on the objection was inappropriate under *Batson* because it stressed the jury\u2019s representation of the community rather than racial discrimination. (*Id.* at 98-99.) The trial court\u2019s remarks with regard to Mr. Griggs are not relevant to its final determination on the *Batson* issue, however, which it made later in the proceedings regarding the State\u2019s peremptory challenge of Ms. Wiley.\n\nThe court did overrule defense counsel\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenge of Ms. Martin. Defense counsel objected on the basis of her race and the timing of the State\u2019s challenge \u2013 the prosecutor initially attempted to excuse her for cause but was unsuccessful and used a peremptory challenge instead. (Doc. 150-1 (Trial Tr.) at 226-27.) The court found the peremptory challenge had a \u201creasonable basis.\u201d (*Id.* at 227.) And this court agrees. Mack did not make a *prima facie* case of racial discrimination given that Ms. Martin admitted to having a criminal history.\n\nThe defense also objected to the prosecution\u2019s peremptory challenge of Ms. Wiley based on her race and the fact that the prosecutor had changed his mind after initially accepting her on the jury. This time the trial court asked the prosecutor to respond. The prosecutor stated the challenge \u201chad nothing to do with race.\u201d (*Id.* at 301-02.) He cited Ms. Wiley\u2019s family responsibilities as a mother of three children, lack of work history, and \u201cfacial mannerisms,\u201d that, based on his \u201cpast experience,\u201d made him \u201cuncomfortable\u201d about her service as a juror. (*Id.*) The court found that in context of the entire process, he did not find any constitutional violations and there were \u201clegitimate reasons for all of the excuses in this case . . . .\u201d (*Id.* at 302.)\nMack argues that the prosecutor\u2019s explanation was \u201cnot facially valid [or] neutral, and is discriminatory on its face,\u201d or, at most, \u201camounted to little more than vague and general claims . . . that he was acting in good faith and not on the basis of discriminatory intent.\u201d (Doc. 162 at 93-94.) The court disagrees. The prosecutor made specific, particularized observations about Ms. Wiley\u2019s personal circumstances and demeanor that, based on his trial experience, were concerning. The trial court found this explanation credible, and nothing leads this court to question that. \u201cThe fact that a prosecutor\u2019s reasons may be founded on nothing more than a trial lawyer\u2019s instincts about a prospective juror . . . does not diminish the scope of acceptable invocation of peremptory challenges, so long as they are the actual reasons for the prosecutor\u2019s actions.\u201d United States v. Power, 881 F.2d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 1989) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). As the prosecutor\u2019s reasons were \u201cnot inherently discriminatory,\u201d the trial court properly found \u201c[they] suffice[d].\u201d Collins, 546 U.S. at 338.\n\nAccordingly, this case does not present any \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d to overcome the great deference owed to the trial court\u2019s factual findings. Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 366. Mack\u2019s first and second grounds for relief, therefore, are denied.\n\nII. Third Ground for Relief: Juror Bias\n\nFor his third ground for relief, Mack claims the trial court erred in dismissing for cause potential jurors who articulated misgivings about the death penalty and in denying his motions to remove prospective jurors who favored the death penalty. (Doc. 155 at 56-60.) Respondent argues that this claim is partially procedurally defaulted and meritless. (Doc. 158 at 51-54.)\nA. Procedural Posture\n\nAs the Ohio Supreme Court explained on direct review of Mack\u2019s case, during the jury selection process, a \u201ckey question\u201d arose concerning the potential jurors\u2019 \u201cviews on the death penalty and their ability to apply the law as given to them by the judge.\u201d Mack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 505. It recounted:\n\nTwo potential jurors, Mr. Spelic and Ms. Davis, were dismissed at the prosecution's request because they stated that due to moral concerns or personal beliefs they could never consider imposing the death penalty even if so instructed by the law as defined by the judge. Three jurors expressed strong support for the application of the death penalty. Mr. Leib stated that he personally felt that if someone kills someone else, \u201cthey've got it coming.\u201d Mr. Jurecki and Ms. Frankel also stated personal support for the use of the death penalty. Each of these three jurors, however, stated that he or she would apply the law as given by the trial court judge, which might necessitate finding the appellant innocent, or sentencing him to life in prison. Ms. Frankel was removed by a peremptory challenge by the defense. The defense never moved to remove Mr. Jurecki for cause. The defense did move to have Mr. Leib removed for cause, but this motion was denied by the court.\n\nId.\n\nMack presented a claim of juror bias to the Ohio Supreme Court on direct appeal related to these prospective jurors. See Mack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 509-10. As Respondent notes, however, the state court found the claim waived as to one of the jurors, Thomas Jurecki, because defense counsel failed to move to have him removed for cause at trial. Id. at 510. Respondent argues that this claim is therefore procedurally defaulted as to Mr. Jurecki. (Doc. 158 at 52-53.) Ohio\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule requires that a party preserve an error for appeal by calling it to the attention of the trial court at a time when the error could have been avoided or corrected. E.g., State v. Mason, 82 Ohio St. 3d 144, 162 (Ohio 1998); State v. Glaros, 170 Ohio St. 471 (Ohio 1960), paragraph one of the syllabus.\nFailure to adhere to this \u201cfirmly-established\u201d rule is \u201can independent and adequate state ground\u201d upon which to find federal habeas claims procedurally defaulted. See, e.g., Keith v. Mitchell, 455 F.3d 662, 673 (6th Cir. 2006).\n\nMack acknowledges that the state court invoked the waiver as to Mr. Jurecki but notes that the court \u201cotherwise addressed and rejected the claim.\u201d (Doc. 162 at 110.) The court did not address the merits of the claim as it related to Mr. Jurecki, however, see Mack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 510, and that portion of this claim is procedurally defaulted. Moreover, Mack does not make any showing regarding either the cause for, or prejudice resulting from, this procedural default.\n\nThe Ohio high court adjudicated Mack\u2019s juror-bias claim relating to the other jurors on the merits, however, and that portion of the claim is ripe for federal habeas review.\n\nB. Merits Analysis\n\nEven if this claim were entirely preserved for habeas review, it would fail. The Ohio Supreme Court, the last state court to address Mack\u2019s claim that the jury was not impartial due to certain of the jurors\u2019 stance on the death penalty, reasoned:\n\nAppellant's fourth and fifth propositions of law claim that the trial court abused its discretion when it dismissed for cause potential jurors who expressed reservations on recommending the death penalty and when it denied motions to remove potential jurors for cause who favored the death penalty. Neither of these propositions is supported by the record.\n\nAppellant argues that the trial court failed to allow an impartial jury to hear the case by overruling appellant's motions for dismissal for cause of prospective jurors Leib, Jurecki, and Frankel, who were allegedly predisposed towards the death penalty, and by sustaining the state's motions for dismissal of prospective jurors Spelic and Davis, who stated they could not vote for the death penalty.\n\nIn order for a defendant to be properly convicted of a crime, a guilty verdict must be returned by a fair and impartial jury composed of a fair and\nrepresentative cross-section of the community as mandated by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution. This court in State v. Tyler (1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 553 N.E.2d 576, stated that a prospective juror must be willing to follow the applicable law as given by the trial judge in the jury instructions. \u201c'[A] juror may not be challenged for cause based on his views about capital punishment unless those views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.'\u201d Id. at 30, 553 N.E.2d at 586, quoting Adams v. Texas (1980), 448 U.S. 38, 45, 100 S.Ct. 2521, 2526, 65 L.Ed.2d 581, 585. Improperly conducted voir dire may constitute reversible error only upon a showing of abuse of discretion by the trial court. State v. Rogers (1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 174, 179, 17 OBR 414, 418, 478 N.E.2d 984, 990.\n\nApplying the above standards to the record shows that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the anti death-penalty jurors because they indicated that they could not recommend the imposition of the death penalty under any circumstances. When asked whether he could fairly consider the death penalty, potential juror Spelic stated, \u201cI don't think I could ever recommend it, no.\u201d Furthermore, in response to the trial court's questioning about his ability to sign a verdict recommending the death penalty, Spelic stated, \u201cI don't think so. No matter what the circumstances were I wouldn't be able to sign anything recommending the death penalty, no.\u201d Similarly, potential juror Davis answered \u201cno\u201d to the trial court's questions of whether she could sign a verdict form recommending the death penalty under any set of circumstances and whether she could follow the law if it mandated the death penalty. When the evidence in the record shows that a potential juror will not follow the law concerning the death penalty, the trial court does not abuse its discretion in dismissing that juror for cause. The responses of these two prospective jurors gave the trial court ample reason to believe that they would be unable to follow their oath and would be substantially impaired in performing their duties as jurors. A juror must be able to follow the law as provided in the jury instructions, and if during voir dire the trial court feels that a juror cannot follow the law and the record supports this decision, then it is not an abuse of discretion to excuse the juror for cause.\n\nWith regard to potential jurors Leib, Jurecki, and Frankel, appellant argues in his fifth proposition of law that the trial court erred in overruling his challenges for cause to dismiss these jurors. Leib and Jurecki were members of the final jury. Frankel was excluded by defense counsel's third peremptory challenge. Appellant subsequently exhausted his six peremptory challenges.\n\nThe record reflects that defense counsel failed to move to have Jurecki removed for cause. According to State v. Greer (1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 236, 244, 530\nN.E.2d 382, 394, the doctrine of waiver applies in capital cases and therefore appellant waived this error, if any existed, as it pertains to potential juror Jurecki.\n\nTo determine whether potential jurors Leib and Frankel should have been dismissed for cause, we apply the previously mentioned Witt standard of whether the prospective juror\u2019s views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of their duties according to their instructions and oath. State v. Rogers, 17 Ohio St.3d 174, 17 OBR 414, 478 N.E.2d 984, paragraph three of the syllabus. The transcript reveals that Leib and Frankel initially revealed a predisposition toward imposing the death penalty; however, both later stated to the trial judge that they would follow the law set forth in his instructions. Because the trial court's denials of appellant's challenges for cause are supported by the record, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and hereby overrule appellant's fifth assignment of error.\n\nMack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 509-10.\n\nIn a capital case, \u201ca criminal defendant has the right to an impartial jury drawn from a venire that has not been tilted in favor of capital punishment by selective prosecutorial challenges for cause.\u201d Uttech v. Brown, 551 U.S. 1, 9 (2007). At the same time, the State has a \u201clegitimate interest in excluding those jurors whose opposition to capital punishment would not allow them to view the proceedings impartially, and who therefore might frustrate administration of a State\u2019s death penalty scheme.\u201d Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 416 (1985).\n\nIt is permissible, therefore, to ask prospective jurors about their views concerning the death penalty during voir dire in capital cases. These \u201cdeath-qualifying\u201d questions ensure the impartiality of jurors by allowing the State to properly exercise challenges for cause against potential jurors unwilling to return a capital sentence. Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 520-23 (1968). The standard for determining whether a potential juror may be excluded for cause because of the juror\u2019s views on capital punishment is \u201cwhether the\njuror\u2019s views would \u2018prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\u2019\u201d Witt, 469 U.S. at 424. This standard \u201cdoes not require that a juror\u2019s bias be proved with \u2018unmistakable clarity.\u2019\u201d Id.\n\nThe Supreme Court repeatedly has emphasized that habeas courts are to accord \u201cspecial deference\u201d to trial courts in applying these standards, because trial judges are in the best position to assess the demeanor and credibility of the jurors. See, e.g., Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 176-78 (1986); Patton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025, 1038 (1984).\n\nMack does not specify how the state court\u2019s decision rejecting this claim contravenes or misapplies Witherspoon or Witt or rests on an unreasonable determination of fact under \u00a7 2254(d). Nevertheless, he contends the trial court erred in excluding prospective jurors Richard Spelic and Mary Davis because \u201c[t]here was no evidence that either . . . would not have been able to carry out their duties as jurors in this case.\u201d (Doc. 155 at 58.) The Ohio Supreme Court, however, cited to persuasive evidence of just that, quoting evidence in the record indicating that the potential jurors would not follow the law concerning the death penalty. Mack notes that Mr. Spelic agreed that he would follow the law as instructed by the judge, and Ms. Davis stated that she would \u201ctry\u201d to consider the options during deliberations. (Id. (citing Doc. 150-1 (Trial Tr.) at 62, 163-72).) But that is not sufficient to override the judge\u2019s conclusion, based on the jurors\u2019 testimony and his observations of their demeanor, that their views would \u201c\u2018prevent or substantially impair the performance of [their] duties as [jurors] in accordance with his instructions and [their] oath.\u2019\u201d Witt, 469 U.S. at 424.\n\nSimilarly, Mack points to statements of prospective jurors Leib, Jurecki, and\nFrankel that they made during voir dire demonstrating they were predisposed to the death penalty. (Doc. 155 at 59.) Ms. Frankel, however, was excused from the jury. And, as noted, defense counsel did not object to Mr. Jurecki\u2019s presence on the jury. As to Mr. Leib, he was extensively questioned by the prosecutor. (See Doc. 150-1 (Trial Tr.) at 97-105.) He initially expressed doubt that he could disregard evidence as he had seen jurors instructed to do on television, and professed that \u201cif somebody takes another person\u2019s life they\u2019ve got it coming to them.\u201d (Id. at 99-103.) But he also swore, after the prosecutor explained to him the juror\u2019s obligation to follow the judge\u2019s instructions, that he could do that, earnestly citing his four years of military service. (Id. at 101-05.) The Ohio Supreme court, therefore, was reasonable in upholding the trial court\u2019s denial of Mack\u2019s challenge for cause regarding Mr. Leib.\n\nAccordingly, Mack has not demonstrated that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, Witherspoon or Witt, or was based on an unreasonable determination of fact.\n\nIII. Fifth Ground for Relief: Prosecutorial Misconduct / Suppressed Evidence\n\nMack claims for his fifth ground for relief that the prosecution failed to disclose to the defense material exculpatory and impeachment evidence and knowingly presented perjured testimony, violating his due process rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959). (See Doc. 155 at 65-105.) Specifically, he alleges that prosecutors suppressed the following seven categories of information, primarily relating to the State\u2019s key witness, Timothy Willis:\n\n1. Handwritten notes authored by Mr. Sanelli\u2019s son-in-law regarding the family\u2019s first meeting with Willis on January 23, 1991.\n2. Cleveland Police Department (\"CPD\") reports regarding Willis\u2019 first communications with police about the Sanelli murder.\n\n3. CPD reports regarding Mr. Sanelli\u2019s stolen car and its crash on Holton Avenue.\n\n4. Evidence of an agreement between the prosecution and Willis in which the State provided favorable consideration to Willis in an unrelated, pending felony case in exchange for his testimony and cooperation in the prosecutions of Mack and Sowell for the Sanelli murder.\n\n5. CPD reports and related evidence regarding the police\u2019s consideration of Willis as a suspect in the Sanelli murder investigation and trial and police searches of Willis\u2019 house at that time.\n\n6. CPD reports concerning Willis\u2019 involvement in the so-called ski-mask robberies and murders.\n\n7. Willis\u2019 oral statement to prosecutors in June 1991 alleging that Mack admitted to shooting Mr. Sanelli after Sowell fired the first shots and the prosecutor\u2019s notes regarding that statement.\n\n(See Doc. 162 at 121-23.) Mack further argues that the prosecution permitted Willis to present perjured testimony. (See id. at 122.)\n\nRespondent concedes that Mack presented these claims to state courts, which adjudicated them on the merits, and they are properly preserved for habeas review. (Doc. 158 at 56.) But she contends they lack merit. (Id. at 56-62.)\n\n6 Mack asserts an eighth category of alleged Brady material: \u201cother police reports and statements.\u201d (Doc. 155 at 94.) He specifies a statement William Lekas, who owned a bar next to Mr. Sanelli\u2019s business, gave to the police and the full report of Detective Norman Sherwood pertaining to his January 25, 1991, interview of Ms. Demill Blue. (Id.) But Mack does not explain the basis for this claim or provide any legal or factual argumentation whatsoever in either his petition or traverse, and the court will not address it. See, e.g., United States v. Crosgrove, 637 F.3d 646, 663 (6th Cir. 2011) (\u201cBecause there is no developed argumentation in these claims, the panel declines to address [the defendant\u2019s] general assertions of misconduct in witness questioning and closing statements.\u201d); United States v. Hall, 549 F.3d 1033, 1042 (6th Cir. 2008) (\u201c[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\u201d) (quoting United States v. Johnson, 440 F.3d 832, 846 (6th Cir. 2006)).\nA.  *Brady v. Maryland and Napue v. Illinois*\n\nIn *Brady v. Maryland*, the Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant\u2019s due process rights are violated if the prosecution suppresses favorable evidence that is material to the defendant\u2019s guilt or punishment. *See Brady*, 373 U.S. at 87. This duty to disclose applies even though there has been no request by the accused and encompasses impeachment as well as exculpatory evidence. *Strickler v. Greene*, 527 U.S. 263, 280 (1999). Nevertheless, to win relief under *Brady*, the petitioner must show that the improperly withheld evidence \u201ccould reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d *Kyles v. Whitley*, 514 U.S. 419, 435 (1995).\n\nA related claim falling within the *Brady* disclosure doctrine arises when a state \u201cknowingly use[s] false evidence, including false testimony, to obtain a tainted conviction . . .\u201d *Napue*, 360 U.S. at 269. To establish a due process violation based on the knowing use of perjured testimony, the petitioner must demonstrate that \u201cthe false testimony could . . . in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d *Id.* at 271; *see also Giglio v. United States*, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972).\n\nB.  **Procedural History**\n\n1.  **Trial-Court proceedings**\n\nMonths before Mack\u2019s trial began, defense counsel, led by Paul Mancino, filed numerous discovery requests for information about State witnesses and for State evidence that was potentially exculpatory or mitigatory. (*See* Doc. 154-9 at 232-39 (Federal Evidentiary Hearing (\u201cFEH\u201d) Ex. 44).) In a general response, the State represented that\n\u201c[n]o exculpatory material [was] available to or in the possession of the Prosecuting Attorney.\u201d (Id. at 255 (FEH Ex. 45).) This response was never updated or corrected. (Doc. 154-8 (FEH Tr.) at 668-70 (Mancino Test.).)\n\nAt a pretrial conference, however, the parties informed the trial court that discovery was being provided. (Doc. 150-1 (Trial Tr.) at 8.) Ohio Criminal Procedural Rule 16(B) at the time did not provide for pretrial production of hard copies of witness statements or police reports, and the policy of the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor\u2019s Office was to discourage prosecutors from disclosing them. (See Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 11 (Bombik Test.); Doc. 99 (FEH Tr.) at 153-54 (Ghazoul Test.).) But prosecutors had discretion concerning what information they could divulge to defense counsel, and both the lead prosecutor in Mack\u2019s case, Richard Bombik, and his first chair, John Ghazoul, testified at the federal evidentiary hearing that they generally disclosed all relevant information contained in police reports and witness statements to defense attorneys. Bombik testified that it was his \u201cconsistent policy\u201d over the years to \u201c[go] over every police report in the file\u201d with defense counsel at pretrials. (Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 27-28.) Ghazoul similarly recalled that his \u201cpractice was to always open the file and let the defense attorney read anything, what anyone has said.\u201d (Doc. 99 (FEH Tr.) at 151.)\n\nOhio Criminal Procedure Rule 16(B)(2) provided that, aside from certain evidence specified in section (B)(1) that prosecutors were required to disclose to defendants, the rule [did] not authorize the discovery or inspection of reports, memoranda, or other internal documents made by the prosecuting attorney or his agents in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case, or of statements made by witnesses or prospective witnesses to state agents.\n\nOhio R. Crim. P. 16(B)(2). This rule has since been amended. See Ohio R. Crim. P. 16(B).\nIn particular, Bombik and Ghazoul testified that they believed they read or summarized the initial police reports about Willis and Willis\u2019 written statement to defense counsel at pretrials. Bombik stated that \u201cover a series of pre-trials, every page of every report was gone over with Mr. Mancino, you know. There is no reason not to, really . . . .\u201d (Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 27.) Ghazoul recalled that \u201cthe evidence was all ascertained by the Macinos that was involved in that file.\u201d (Doc. 99 (FEH Tr.) at 151.) And Paul Mancino testified that, although he did not specifically remember the pretrials in this case, \u201c[n]ormally, they read over some police reports,\u201d and he agreed his notes from the pretrials reflect that the prosecution disclosed information from the police investigation. (Doc. 100 (FEH Tr.) at 142-43.)\n\nIn fact, the State represented in a response to a discovery request, filed several months before trial, that Willis\u2019 statement had been produced. (See Doc. 154-9 at 262 (FEH Ex. 46).) In addition, in accordance with then-existing Ohio Criminal Procedure Rule 16(B), after Willis testified at trial, prosecutors disclosed Willis\u2019 written statement to defense counsel for in camera inspection to determine if any inconsistencies existed between Willis\u2019 testimony and a prior statement. 8 (See Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 112-13\n\n8 At the time of Mack\u2019s trial, Ohio Criminal Procedure Rule 16(B)(1) required that prosecutors disclose to defendants certain information, including:\n\nIn camera inspection of witness\u2019 statement. Upon completion of a witness\u2019 direct examination at trial, the court on motion of the defendant shall conduct an in camera inspection of the witness\u2019 written or recorded statement with the defense attorney and prosecuting attorney present and participating, to determine the existence of inconsistencies, if any, between the testimony of such witness and the prior statement. If the court determines that inconsistencies exist, the statement shall be given to the defense attorney for use in cross-examination of the witness as to the inconsistencies. If the court determines that inconsistencies do not exist the statement shall not be given\nSee also Mack, 1993 WL 497052, at *7 (noting that Willis was the only witness to supply a written statement before Mack\u2019s trial, and during his cross-examination, defense counsel requested and was provided an opportunity to review that statement pursuant to Criminal Procedure Rule 16).\n\nShortly after Mack\u2019s trial ended, defense counsel filed a motion for a new trial on the ground that the State had suppressed exculpatory and impeachment evidence regarding Willis\u2019 attempt to earn a reward from the Sanelli family. (Doc. 154-9 at 308-14 (FEH Ex. 51 (Motion for New Trial)).) The trial court denied the motion. (Id. at 307 (Judgment)).\n\n2. Federal habeas proceedings\n\nAfter exhausting his state-court appeals and post-conviction review, Mack initiated habeas proceedings in this court on May 4, 2004. (Doc. 1.) Mack filed his original petition on December 15, 2004. (Doc. 24.) In it, he asserted a Brady claim based on the following allegedly suppressed information: (1) Willis\u2019 prior statements to the police, Crime Stoppers, and the Sanelli family; (2) notes of interviews, conferences and/or meetings with Willis concerning his testimony; (3) notes taken by a Sanelli family member about the family\u2019s meeting with Willis; (4) any evidence of a deal between the prosecutors and Willis in which the State provided Willis with assistance in his criminal matters in exchange for\n\n______________________________\n\nto the defense attorney and he shall not be permitted to cross-examine or comment thereon.\n\nWhenever the defense attorney is not given the entire statement, it shall be preserved in the records of the court to be made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal.\n\nOhio R. Crim. P. 16(B)(1)(g). This rule has since been amended. See Ohio R. Crim. P. 16(B).\nhis testimony against Mack; (5) William Lekas\u2019 statement to police; (6) the police report regarding their interview of Demill Blue; and (7) the fact that Gerry Kirkland was going to testify for the State about the Holton crash. (Doc. 24-1 at 33-37.)\n\nOn May 16, 2005, Mack filed a motion for leave to conduct discovery and for the appointment of experts, which Respondent opposed. (Docs. 36, 42.) This court granted Mack\u2019s motion in part on March 31, 2008, permitting certain discovery relating to his ineffective-assistance and Brady claims, including depositions, document production, and funds to retain a criminal investigator. (Doc. 52.)\n\nOn June 17, 2009, Mack filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing, which Respondent also opposed. (Docs. 65, 69.) The court granted Mack\u2019s motion in part on May 31, 2010, and conducted an evidentiary hearing on certain of Mack\u2019s ineffective-assistance and Brady claims on June 28 through June 30, 2010, and July 9, 2010. (See Docs. 99-102 (FEH Trs.).)\n\nOn November 23, 2011, the court denied a motion to dismiss filed by Respondent (Doc. 76). (Doc. 115.) It agreed with Respondent that certain of Mack\u2019s ineffective-assistance and Brady claims were unexhausted, but found that there was good cause for Mack\u2019s failure to exhaust his claims first in state court, the unexhausted claims were not \u201cplainly meritless,\u201d and state-court remedies existed for Mack to exhaust the claims in state court. (See, e.g., id. at 41-43, 45, 47-50, 52.) It therefore stayed Mack\u2019s federal habeas case and held it in abeyance pending Mack\u2019s exhaustion of the claims in state court. (Id. at 52.)\n\n3. Second state post-conviction proceedings\nOn December 21, 2011, Mack filed a successor post-conviction petition and motion for leave to file a motion for new trial in the state trial court. (Doc. 151-1 at 37-65 (Mtn. for New Trial), 66-123 (Post-Conviction Pet.).) In them, he asserted *Brady* claims based on the State\u2019s suppression of: (1) the Sanelli family notes; (2) the initial Willis police reports and Willis\u2019 written statement; (3) the Holton Avenue crash reports; (4) the Willis deal evidence; (5) the police searches of Willis\u2019 property; (6) police reports regarding the Ski Mask Task Force; (7) Willis\u2019 oral statement; and (8) other police reports and statements. (*See id.*) Mack also claimed the State improperly presented Willis\u2019 perjured testimony under *Napue*. (*See id.*)\n\nOn April 20, 2012, the State moved to dismiss the post-conviction petition and motion for new trial (*id.* at 138-69), which Mack opposed (*id.* at 181-212). The court conducted an evidentiary hearing on August 27 and September 10, 2013. (*See Doc. 151-9 at 23-256 (Hrg. Tr.).*) It denied the petition and motion on March 20, 2014. (Doc. 151-2 at 260-69.)\n\nMack appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Eighth District Court of Appeals and Ohio Supreme Court, but the appeals were unsuccessful. *See State v. Mack*, 2018 WL 565704 (Ohio Ct. App. Jan. 25, 2018) (affirming trial court on remand and on reconsideration); *State v. Mack*, 152 Ohio St. 3d 1489 (Ohio 2018) (declining jurisdiction).\n\n4. **Reinstated federal habeas proceedings**\n\nMack\u2019s amended habeas petition asserts the identical *Brady* and *Napue* claims that he raised in his second state post-conviction pleadings. (Doc. 155 at 65-105.) Mack and Respondent agree that the merits of the claims were fully litigated in state courts and the\nclaims are therefore ripe for federal habeas review. (See Doc. 158 at 56; Doc. 162 at 124.)\n\nC. Standard of Review\n\nAs noted above, habeas courts look to the \u201clast explained state-court judgment\u201d on the federal claim at issue to determine whether AEDPA\u2019s deferential review applies. Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797, 805 (1991) (emphasis in original). The last state court to address Mack\u2019s Brady and Napue claims was the state appellate court on successor post-conviction review. See Mack, 2018 WL 565704. Mack argues that the state court\u2019s decision is not entitled to AEPDA deference in two respects: (1) the entire decision was not an \u201cadjudication on the merits\u201d under AEDPA\u2019s \u00a7 2254(d) because Ohio\u2019s procedural requirements for successive post-conviction petitions is less protective of federal constitutional rights than federal law; and (2) even if the decision was an adjudication on the merits for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d), the state appellate court failed to consider the impact of alleged Brady evidence on Mack\u2019s sentencing and that issue must be reviewed de novo. (Doc. 162 at 126-34.) Respondent does not address either argument.\n\n1. Ohio\u2019s procedural requirements for successive post-conviction petitions\n\nMack first argues that AEDPA deferential review does not apply to his Brady / Napue claims because the state appellate court\u2019s decision resolving them was not an \u201cadjudication on the merits\u201d under AEDPA\u2019s \u00a7 2254(d). (Doc. 162 at 126-31.) \u201cThe denial of a federal constitutional claim by a state court,\u201d he posits, \u201cusing state law standards which are less protective of the federal right does not constitute an \u2018adjudication on the merits\u2019 of the federal claim.\u201d (Id. at 130 (citing Morgan v. Dickaut, 677 F.3d 39, 49 (1st Cir. 2012)).) And here, he contends, the state appellate court \u201cultimately applied\u201d the\njurisdictional standards of Ohio\u2019s successor post-conviction relief statute, Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2953.23, to his claims by affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition based on Mack\u2019s failure to meet those standards, which were \u201cmuch less protective\u201d of the federal due process rights recognized in Brady and of other federal constitutional rights that impose lower standards of proof. (Id. at 127 (citing Mack, 2018 WL 565704, at *7-8 (\u00b6\u00b6 10-12)).) In particular, Mack asserts, the Ohio statute required that the petitioner show by clear and convincing evidence that but for constitutional trial error, \u201cno reasonable factfinder\u201d would have found the petitioner guilty or eligible for a death sentence. (Id. (quoting Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2953.23(A)(1)).) Mack cites no controlling authority to support his position.\n\nMack also does not address the fact that he raised this argument with the state post-conviction appellate court, although in support of a different claim \u2013 one challenging the adequacy of Ohio\u2019s post-conviction procedures. Mack, 2018 WL 565704, at *7-8. The\n\n9 Section 2953.23(A)(1) provided that a court may not entertain an untimely or successive petition unless the petitioner is able to demonstrate each of the following:\n\n(a) Either the petitioner shows that the petitioner was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which the petitioner must rely to present the claim for relief, or, subsequent to the period prescribed in division (A)(2) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code or to the filing of an earlier petition, the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons in the petitioner's situation, and the petition asserts a claim based on that right.\n\n(b) The petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted or, if the claim challenges a sentence of death that, but for constitutional error at the sentencing hearing, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner eligible for the death sentence.\n\nOhio Rev. Code \u00a7 2953.23(A)(1). This provision was amended in 2017 but remains substantively the same. See Mack, 2018 WL 565704, at *8 n.5.\nstate court rejected Mack\u2019s contention, explaining that it and other Ohio appellate courts have concluded that, because post-conviction relief is not a constitutional right but a state statutory right, \u00a7 2953.23(A)(1)\u2019s clear-and-convincing standard is a \u201creasonable procedural hurdle\u201d for successive petitions for post-conviction relief and the statutory scheme \u201cis not unconstitutional on its face or as applied . . . .\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\nThe state appellate court further relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Weaver v. Massachusetts, 582 U.S. \u2013 , 137 S. Ct. 1899 (2017). Id. at *8. In that case, the Court held that prejudice is not presumed when a defendant raises a violation of the right to a public trial in the context of a post-conviction claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, applying the higher standard of the petitioner\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim, which requires a showing of prejudice, than the structural-error standard of the underlying public-trial claim. Weaver, 137 S. Ct. at 1911. The state appellate court, in considering Mack\u2019s argument that Ohio\u2019s successive post-conviction statute requires a greater showing than federal constitutional claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or suppressed evidence, construed Weaver as establishing that \u201cthe standard of review does depend on the procedural posture of the case, and requiring a defendant to satisfy a higher burden does not violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights.\u201d Mack, 2018 WL 565704, at *8.\n\nThis court need not reach this issue, however, as it rejects the very premise of Mack\u2019s argument: that the Ohio appellate court \u201cultimately\u201d rejected his Brady claims based on the jurisdictional requirements of \u00a7 2953.23. (Doc. 162 at 127.) It is true that in overruling Mack\u2019s first assignment of error, the appellate court appeared to uphold the trial\ncourt\u2019s conclusion that Mack failed to satisfy \u00a7 2953.23\u2019s jurisdictional requirements for successive or untimely post-conviction petitions. *Mack*, 2018 WL 565704, at *5-6 (\u00b612).\n\nBut the court went on to observe that the trial court \u201cdid not deny the petition outright, but held a hearing, and analyzed the petition properly under R.C. 2953.23.\u201d *Id.* at *6. And the court then limited the trial court\u2019s procedural judgment to Mack\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims: \u201cTherefore,\u201d it concluded, \u201cthe remainder of the discussion of this assigned error will include [Mack\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel] where he argues the merits of his petition.\u201d *Id.* It proceeded to find Mack\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims procedurally barred, either by *res judicata* or because they were not \u201cnewly discovered\u201d under \u00a7 2953.23(A)(1)(a). *Id.*\n\nBy contrast, the state appellate court analyzed Mack\u2019s *Brady* claims independently of the trial court\u2019s procedural ruling and entirely on the merits; it referred to \u00a7 2953.23 in its *Brady* discussion only once as a side note and never applied the provision\u2019s procedural requirements to Mack\u2019s *Brady* claims. *See id.* at *8-14. In habeas, \u201cif the decision of the last state court to which the petitioner presented his federal claims fairly appeared to rest primarily on resolution of those claims, or to be interwoven with those claims, and did not clearly and expressly rely on an independent and adequate state ground, a federal court may address the petition.\u201d *Coleman v. Thompson*, 501 U.S. 722, 735 (1991). Here, as both parties apparently agree, since neither argues the claims are defaulted, the state appellate\n\n---\n\n10 The state appellate court found, in its *Brady* analysis of Willis\u2019 written statement, that Mack\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s notes and the trial record itself demonstrated that the evidence was not suppressed. *Mack*, 2018 WL 565704, at *10. But it also remarked that this \u201cindicat[ed] that a lack of disclosure was not newly discovered and . . . this claimed *Brady* violation [could have been] brought in the prior postconviction relief petitions.\u201d *Id.*\ncourt did not clearly and expressly invoke the procedural bar of Ohio\u2019s successor post-conviction statute to foreclose Mack\u2019s *Brady* claims.\\(^{11}\\) Rather, the state court conducted a merits review of the claims, applying *Brady* and other controlling federal constitutional law. AEDPA deference, therefore, applies to Mack\u2019s *Brady* claims.\n\n2. **State appellate court\u2019s failure to consider the impact of alleged *Brady* evidence on sentencing**\n\nMack further argues that even if the state appellate court\u2019s decision regarding his *Brady* claims were generally governed by \u00a7 2254(d), AEDPA deference still would not apply to this court\u2019s analysis of whether the allegedly suppressed evidence impacted his death sentence, because no state court addressed that particular issue. (Doc. 162 at 131-34.)\n\nAs Mack asserts, where a state court explicitly relies on one element of a multi-prong test to resolve a claim to the exclusion of others, AEDPA deference does not apply and federal habeas courts review the unanalyzed issue *de novo*. See, e.g., *Brumfield v. Cain*, 576 U.S. 305, 323 (2015) (applying *de novo* review to unanalyzed portion of *Atkins* claim); *Porter v. McCollum*, 558 U.S. 30, 39 (2009) (per curiam) (\u201cBecause the state court did not decide whether [petitioner\u2019s] counsel was deficient, we review this element of [petitioner\u2019s] *Strickland* claim *de novo*.\u2019\u2019); *Rompilla v. Beard*, 545 U.S. 374, 390 (2005) (\u201cBecause the state courts found the representation adequate, they never reached the issue of prejudice, . . . and so we examine this element of the *Strickland* claim *de novo*.\u2019\u2019 (citation omitted)); *Rayner v. Mills*, 685 F.3d 631, 637 (6th Cir. 2012) (\u201c[W]here the state court\n\n\\(^{11}\\) It is unclear how Mack reconciles his analysis of the state appellate court\u2019s decision as \u201cultimately\u201d a rejection of his *Brady* claims on state procedural grounds with his conflicting position that the claims are not procedurally defaulted but are preserved for federal habeas review.\nadjudicated only one prong [of an ineffective-assistance claim], we have . . . reviewed the remaining prong de novo.\u201d). 12\n\nMack argues that, contrary to Brady, the state appellate court considered the impact of the allegedly suppressed evidence only on his conviction, not on his sentencing. (Doc. 162 at 132-34.) Indeed, the Brady Court was clear that the prosecution must disclose favorable evidence to the defense that is \u201cmaterial either to guilt or to punishment.\u201d Brady, 373 U.S. at 87 (emphasis added). The Court later emphasized this point in Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. 449 (2009), holding that while it agreed with the lower courts that the withheld evidence would not likely have affected the jury\u2019s verdict on the petitioner\u2019s insanity defense at the guilt phase of trial, they erred in failing to \u201cfully consider[] whether the suppressed evidence might have persuaded one or more jurors that [the petitioner\u2019s] drug addiction\u2014especially if attributable to honorable service of his country in Vietnam\u2014was sufficiently serious to justify a decision to imprison him for life rather than sentence him to death.\u201d Id. at 475. When reviewing Brady claims, it explained, courts must \u201cdistinguish between the materiality of the evidence with respect to guilt and the materiality of the evidence with respect to punishment . . . .\u201d Id. at 472. The Court remanded the case to the district court for a de novo review of the cumulative effect of the improperly suppressed evidence.\n\n12 The Sixth Circuit has found no conflict between this rule, which applies when a state court partially adjudicates a multi-prong claim, and the rule established in Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 99 (2011), which holds that when state court summarily denies a federal constitutional claim with no analysis at all, it is presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim \u201con the merits\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d) and AEDPA deference applies. Rayner, 685 F.3d at 638-39 (explaining that in Richter, \u201cthe Supreme Court expressly limited application of its holding to cases in which the state court\u2019s decision is unaccompanied by an explanation[,]\u201d and the Court has continued to rely on the rule regarding de novo review of partially adjudicated claims since that decision) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\nevidence regarding the seriousness of petitioner\u2019s drug problem on his sentence. *Id.* at 476.\n\nSimilarly, here, the state appellate court did not adjudicate the issue of whether any alleged suppression of material evidence impacted Mack\u2019s sentencing. In setting forth the standards governing *Brady* claims, the state court explained that in order to prevail on a *Brady* claim, \u201cevidence must be material to the conviction in order to warrant a new trial,\u201d but did not mention sentencing. *Mack*, 2018 WL 565704, at *9 (emphasis added). And in its analysis of the materiality of the evidence at issue, the court again stated that the evidence \u201cmust be material to the convictions,\u201d with no mention of sentencing. *Id.* at *14 (emphasis added). Moreover, in its analysis of the claim, the court never discussed any potential impact of the alleged *Brady* evidence on Mack\u2019s capital sentence. *See id.* at *9-13. And it concluded, \u201cthe evidence adduced does not undermine the confidence in the verdicts of guilt, and therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\u201d Mack\u2019s post-conviction petition. *Id.* at *15 (emphasis added). This court agrees with Mack, therefore, that it must consider *de novo* whether any improperly withheld evidence would have been material to the jury\u2019s determination of Mack\u2019s punishment.\n\n**D. *Brady* Claims**\n\nMack argues that the decision of the Ohio post-conviction appellate court denying his *Brady* claims was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, *Brady* and its progeny under \u00a7 2254(d)(1), and was based on unreasonable determinations of fact in light of the evidence presented under \u00a7 2254(d)(2). (*See Doc. 162 at 134-67.*) As noted above, in order to establish a *Brady* violation, a petitioner must demonstrate that: (1) the evidence at issue is favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory or impeaching; (2) the\nevidence was suppressed by the state, either willfully or inadvertently; and (3) prejudice ensued. *Strickler*, 527 U.S. at 281-82.\n\nEvidence is considered favorable under *Brady* if it would have had \u201csome value . . . [or] weight and its tendency would have been favorable\u201d to the defendant. *Kyles*, 514 U.S. at 450\u201351 (rejecting the state\u2019s argument that the evidence was \u201cneither impeachment nor exculpatory evidence\u201d because the jury might not have substantially credited it, as \u201c[s]uch argument . . . confuses the weight of the evidence with its favorable tendency\u201d); see also *United States v. Blackwell*, 459 F.3d 739, 758 (6th Cir. 2006) (\u201cEvidence is favorable to the accused if it exculpates the accused or enables the accused to impeach witnesses.\u201d).\n\nTo meet the suppression requirement, the petitioner must show that the evidence was in the prosecution\u2019s exclusive control. *Coe v. Bell*, 161 F.3d 320, 344 (6th Cir. 1998). There is no *Brady* violation \u201cwhere a defendant knew or should have known the essential facts permitting him to take advantage of any exculpatory information, or where the evidence is available . . . from another source, because in such cases there is really nothing for the government to disclose.\u201d *Id.* (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\nPrejudice, or materiality, in the *Brady* context is a far more difficult test to meet than the threshold questions of suppression and favorability. *Jamison v. Collins*, 291 F.3d 380, 388 (6th Cir. 2002). Evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d when there is \u201ca reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d *Cone*, 556 U.S. at 469-70. \u201cA reasonable probability does not mean that the defendant \u2018would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,\u2019 only that the likelihood of a different result is great enough to \u2018undermine[ ] confidence in\nthe outcome of the trial.\u201d\u201d Smith v. Cain, 565 U.S. 73, 75-76 (2012) (quoting Kyles, 514 U.S. at 434 (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\nCourts examine each item of alleged Brady evidence individually for suppression and favorability, then consider the cumulative impact of any Brady evidence for materiality. Kyles, 514 U.S. at 436-37 & n.10 (\u201cWe evaluate the tendency and force of the undisclosed evidence item by item; there is no other way. We evaluate its cumulative effect for purposes of materiality separately . . . .\u201d).\n\nThe court will first review each alleged item of Brady material individually for suppression and favorability.\n\n1. Sanelli family notes\n\nMack first contends that the prosecution improperly suppressed handwritten notes that Mr. Sanelli\u2019s son-in-law, Michael Barone, took during the family\u2019s first meeting with Willis on January 23, 1991 (Doc. 154-9 at 50 (FEH Ex. 8)). (Doc. 155 at 69-72.) In addressing this claim on post-conviction review, the Ohio court of appeals reasoned:\n\n{\u00b6 32} Willis met with the family of the victim a day or two after the murder at their glass store that was run by Peter. Peter's son-in-law, Mike Barone, took notes of this conversation. At trial, Anthony Sanelli, Peter's son, testified that the notes were not given to police. During the previous appeals, it was the state's argument that these notes were not turned over to police. However, during the federal proceedings, appellant was able to show that police were given the notes shortly after the meeting. Appellant argues that his name does not appear in the notes memorializing the conversation, although the name of the codefendant, Thomas Sowell, does.\n\n{\u00b6 33} The trial prosecutor from appellant's criminal trial (the \u201ctrial prosecutor\u201d) testified in the federal proceedings that these notes were not disclosed to him and were not in his file at trial. He appeared to assert that he had no duty to turn over items not in his possession. However, the Kyles court specifically rejected this argument. Kyles, 514 U.S. at 438, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490. But these notes were cumulative of evidence gathered by\nappellant in preparation for trial. One of appellant's trial attorneys interviewed members of the Sanelli family and both attorneys were aware that Willis met with the family soon after the murder. Anthony Sanelli testified at trial about this meeting, and the notes also mirror Willis's first statement to the police.\n\n\u00b6 34 It is true that the notes do not include appellant's name, but they indicate that two people were involved and specifically mention one of the codefendants. The notes indicate that Willis identified the codefendant, Thomas Sowell, as the shooter, but that is not inconsistent with Willis's testimony. Both Sowell and appellant fired shots at Sanelli, as the forensic evidence established. Therefore, the notes are not contradictory in nature. They identify one perpetrator by name, and Willis identified the second perpetrator, appellant, to police shortly thereafter. These notes, while helpful in the cross-examination of Willis, were cumulative of other evidence and do not cast serious doubt on the verdicts in this case. The notes indicate two people were involved in the shooting of Peter even though only Sowell was named in this initial conversation.\n\nMack, 2018 WL 565704, at *9-10.\n\nRespondent does not contest the state appellate court\u2019s finding that the prosecution withheld the Sanelli notes from the defense. Indeed, Barone testified at the federal evidentiary hearing that he gave the notes to the police soon after the meeting with Willis. (Doc. 102 (FEH Tr.) at 74-75 (Barone Test.)) See also Mack, 2018 WL 565704, at *9 (citing Kyles, 514 U.S. at 437-38 (holding that individual prosecutors have a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case, including police)).\n\nMack asserts that this evidence also was favorable, as it has significant exculpatory and impeachment value. He first argues that the notes support Mack\u2019s defense at trial that\n\n13 In fact, Respondent offers little argument or analysis in countering the merits of any of Mack\u2019s Brady and Napue claims. She devotes just six pages of her return of writ to address these claims (compared to Mack\u2019s combined 87 pages in his amended petition and traverse), and provides little more on the merits than a summary of the state appellate court\u2019s opinion and brief, conclusory remarks regarding the state court\u2019s conclusion. (See Doc. 158 at 56-62.)\nhe did not participate in the murder and the only reason he became a suspect was because Willis was actually the perpetrator and set Mack up. (Doc. 162 at 138-40.) The notes also show, according to Mack, that Willis never mentioned Mack at all while meeting with the Sanelli family; instead, he repeatedly referred to a \u201cman\u201d rather than \u201cmen,\u201d and identified only Sowell. They could have established, therefore, that even if Mack were present at the murder, Sowell was the lone shooter and Mack was not the principal offender, rendering him ineligible for the death penalty as charged by the State. (Id. at 140.) See also Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.04(A)(7) (providing the death penalty may be imposed for aggravated murder if it was committed during certain felony offenses, including aggravated robbery, and the defendant was either the principal offender in the murder or committed the aggravated robbery with prior calculation and design); State v. Taylor, 66 Ohio St. 3d 295, 306-07 (Ohio 1993) (defining \u201cprincipal offender\u201d under \u00a7 2929.04(A)(7) as the \u201cactual shooter\u201d); Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 39-40 (State dismissing premeditated murder count before trial).\n\nMack argues that the Sanelli notes also would have had great impeachment value at trial. They would have been most helpful, according to Mack, in impeaching the credibility of Willis, whom Mack describes as \u201cthe singularly most important witness in the State\u2019s weak death-penalty case.\u201d (Doc. 162 at 141.) Mack contends that, over time, Willis changed his story of the events surrounding the crime, altering and embellishing facts along the way, and he benefitted financially through rewards and in a pending criminal case against him from his cooperation with the police and prosecution. (Id. at 141-48.) The notes also could have been used, Mack asserts, to impeach the detectives who testified, by\nchallenging the State\u2019s investigation and \u201crush to judgment\u201d in relying on Willis. (Id. at 141, 149.) Finally, Mack argues that the defense could have impeached Tony Sanelli with the notes, as he testified at trial that his family did not turn over the notes to police and he did not know where they were. (Id. at 148-49 (citing Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 181).)\n\nThe state appellate court apparently considered the Sanelli notes favorable, stating that they would have been \u201chelpful in the cross-examination of Willis . . . .\u201d Mack, 2018 WL 565704, at *10. This court agrees.\n\nThe Sanelli family notes, therefore, constitute Brady material: the State had these notes in its possession and they were favorable to Mack\u2019s defense. The prosecution should have produced them to Mack\u2019s counsel before trial.\n\n2. Initial Willis written statement and related police reports\n\nMack further argues that the prosecution wrongfully suppressed Willis\u2019 written\n\n14 The court notes that in its analysis of Mack\u2019s Brady claims, the state appellate court did not strictly adhere to the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that courts examine each item of alleged Brady evidence individually for suppression and favorability and then consider the cumulative impact of any Brady evidence for materiality. Kyles, 514 U.S. at 436-37 & n.10. At times, it appeared to conflate the favorability and materiality factors, making individual determinations of materiality of the alleged Brady material. Regarding this claim, for example, the state court concluded that the Sanelli notes, \u201cwhile helpful in the cross-examination of Willis, were cumulative of other evidence and do not cast serious doubt on the verdicts in this case.\u201d Mack, 2018 WL 565704, at *10. Nonetheless, the state court separately evaluated the cumulative impact of all of the alleged Brady evidence on the jury\u2019s verdict. See id. at *14 (\u00b6\u00b6 61, 62). And, as this court will explain below, its ultimate conclusion was objectively reasonable: that the prosecution\u2019s wrongful suppression of evidence, examined as a whole, did not prejudice Mack such that it violated his due process rights. See Cone, 556 U.S. at 473\u201374 (\u201cAlthough we take exception to the Court of Appeals\u2019 failure to assess the effect of the suppressed evidence \u2018collectively\u2019 rather than \u2018item by item,\u2019 see Kyles, 514 U.S., at 436, . . . we nevertheless agree that even when viewed in the light most favorable to Cone, the evidence falls short of being sufficient to sustain his insanity defense.\u201d).\nstatement to the police (Doc. 154-9 at 60-61 (FEH Ex. 11)) and two police reports of Willis\u2019 first communications with them about the Sanelli murder, one that essentially summarized Willis\u2019 written statement (id. at 52-58 (FEH Ex. 9)) and one that reported Willis\u2019 second visit with the Sanelli family (id. at 85 (FEH Ex. 16)). (See Doc. 155 at 73-76.) As to this claim, the state appellate court opined:\n\n\u00b6 35 In the first police report documenting Willis's contact with police, he relayed that Sowell was the person that shot Peter and that appellant and Reginald Germany were also involved. A second supplemental police report documented Willis's initial phone contact with police and contained materially the same statement. Willis's written statement also indicates that police asked Willis to identify Peter's vehicle prior to giving a written statement. Appellant claims this is all information that could have been used to impeach Willis's testimony. Appellant further claims that the fact that Willis identified Sowell as the shooter and appellant and Germany were involved constitutes a Brady violation.\n\n\u00b6 36 The transcript from the federal proceedings indicates trial counsel's notes included the disclosure or summary of Willis's written statements. This court has also previously found the trial record indicates disclosure of the written statement during trial. Mack I, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 62366, 1993 WL 497052, at *7, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 5758, at *18. Appellant raised this in an assignment of error taking issue with the court's denial of a motion for discovery and inspection. This court found a lack of prejudice. Id. This also indicates that a lack of disclosure was not newly discovered and appellant does not explain why this claimed Brady violation was not brought in the prior postconviction relief petitions. The supplemental police reports documenting Willis's contact with police were duplicative of his written statement that resulted from that contact.\n\nMack, 2018 WL 565704, at *10.\n\nMack argues that the initial police reports about Willis and Willis\u2019 written statement contained valuable impeachment evidence that was never disclosed to his trial counsel, such as: (1) Willis first identified Sowell as the shooter, not Mack, and initially did not attribute any statements to Mack about shooting Mr. Sanelli; (2) the police showed Willis\nMr. Sanelli\u2019s car before they took Willis\u2019 statement, while the prosecutor told the jury that Willis provided important details about the car to police before he saw the car; (3) Willis later embellished his story about the crime, adding that Germany offered Sowell his gun before the murder and Mack said he wanted to \u201ckill\u201d an \u201cArab\u201d after the crime; and (4) Willis visited the Sanelli store a second time, though he and Tony Sanelli testified that he had been there only once. (Doc. 155 at 73-76.)\n\nThe court agrees with the state appellate court, however, that Willis\u2019 written statement and the related police report were not suppressed. Foremost, as noted above, the record shows that the prosecution provided Willis\u2019 written statement to defense counsel after its direct examination of Willis for an in camera inspection pursuant to Ohio Criminal Procedure Rule 16. (See Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 110); Doc. 102 (FEH Tr.) at 6-7 (Bombik Test.); Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 111-13 (Mancino Test.).\n\nThe record further demonstrates that the prosecution disclosed the information contained in Willis\u2019 written statement and the related police report at a pretrial conference well before trial. The State\u2019s response to a discovery request, filed several months before trial, represented that Willis\u2019 statement had been produced. (See Doc. 154-9 at 262 (FEH Ex. 46).) And Paul Mancino acknowledged at the federal evidentiary hearing that it appeared from notes he took of pretrial proceedings that the prosecutor read him Willis\u2019 written statement. (Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 109-10; see also Doc. 154-9 at 188-98 (FEH Ex. 38) (Mancino notes). Mancino\u2019s pretrial notes closely follow both Willis\u2019 statement and the report summarizing it. In his statement, Willis recounted that Mack, Sowell, and Germany stopped by his house and Sowell asked him if he had a gun because, Sowell said,\n\u201cwe need a car tonight, we fixin to ride downtown, and get a hotty.\u201d (Doc. 154-9 at 60 (FEH Ex. 11).) The report, for example, states: \u201cSowell, Mack and Germany came over his house and asked for a gun. . . . [T]hen told Willis they were going down town [sic] to get a car.\u201d (Doc. 154-9 at 54 (FEH Ex. 9) (capitalization altered).) Mancino wrote in his notes: \u201cTim Willis \u2013 before incident went down \u2013 Reggie, Tom, Clarence there \u2013 needed car \u2013 going downtown[.] Tom needed a gun . . . .\u201d (Id. at 188 (FEH Ex. 38).) Willis\u2019 written statement and the information in the police report summarizing it, therefore, were disclosed to defense counsel, before trial and then again during it.\n\nAs to the fact contained in a second police report that Willis appeared at Mr. Sanelli\u2019s store a second time, even if prosecutors did not disclose that evidence to the defense, it does not meet Brady\u2019s favorability requirement. The police report stated: \u201cAlso while at the [Sanelli store] Timothy Willis came to the store and informed the victim\u2019s [sic] that he had contacted the police and provided the information that he knew, and he states he would stay in contact with the police.\u201d (Doc. 154-9 at 85 (FEH Ex. 16) (capitalization altered).) Mack claims this was valuable impeachment evidence because it contradicted Willis\u2019 and Tony Sanelli\u2019s testimony that they met only once, and buttressed Mack\u2019s theory that Willis was \u201clurking around\u201d the investigation to further his goal of obtaining the reward money and a deal regarding his own felony case. (Doc. 155 at 75-76.) The court disagrees. If the jury had been informed of the second meeting, they may have found that Willis and Tony Sanelli simply forgot about the brief and uneventful meeting rather than lied about it. And Willis\u2019 reported statement to the family is consistent with Willis\u2019 testimony that he was trying to assist the family and police in the investigation, even if he\ndenied that he was motivated by the reward. (See Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 134 (Willis Test.).)\n\nAccordingly, the information contained in Willis\u2019 statement and the related police reports was either disclosed to defense counsel or was not favorable to Mack\u2019s defense and does not qualify as *Brady* material.\n\n3. **Holton Avenue crash reports**\n\nMack next asserts that the prosecution should have disclosed two police reports regarding the crash and recovery of Mr. Sanelli\u2019s stolen car on Holton Avenue. (Doc. 155 at 76-78; Doc. 154-9 at 36-38 (FEH Ex. 4), 45-46 (FEH Ex. 6).) In considering this claim, the state appellate court opined:\n\n{\u00b6 43} A witness reported to Cleveland Police that he saw a man fitting Sowell's description crash Peter's car on Holton Avenue. A police report also indicated that someone was seen entering the stolen vehicle after it had been crashed into a utility pole and abandoned. The individual moved the car some distance and took the keys.\n\n{\u00b6 44} Appellant argues that the witness to the crash gave a description of the driver that matched Sowell, rather than appellant. Appellant argues this indicates that it was Sowell, rather than appellant, who shot Peter. Appellant also argues that the individual seen moving the car could have returned to the vehicle to retrieve evidence rather than being an individual who happened upon an abandoned vehicle.\n\n{\u00b6 45} This evidence is not exculpatory or readily used for impeachment. Willis testified that appellant told him that Sowell crashed the car into a pole. So that information was adduced at trial. Further, simply because Sowell was driving the car does not conflict with the evidence adduced or the state's theory of the case. Appellant claims that it only makes sense that if Sowell was seen driving the car, he must have been the person on the driver's side of the vehicle when the car was stolen. Therefore, he must have been the one who actually killed Peter. The fact that Sowell was driving the car does not lead to the conclusion that Sowell was the person that killed Peter. This post hoc argument does not cast doubt on appellant's conviction. It is also possible that Sowell wanted to drive the car and appellant let him, or that as appellant was pulling\nPeter from the vehicle after shooting and searching him, Sowell came around to the driver's side of the car and got in so the two could make a quick escape.\n\n\u00b6 46 All this evidence tends to establish is that Sowell was the person who was driving the car after the murder. This does not mean that Sowell, rather than appellant, was the person that caused Peter's death. This evidence is not exculpatory nor does it contradict Willis's statements at trial. Willis testified that Sowell was the driver of the vehicle when he encountered him and appellant soon after the murder. The accident reports that were not turned over do not amount to a Brady violation.\n\nMack, 2018 WL 565704, at *11-12.\n\nMack argues that the two police reports regarding the recovery of Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car on Holton Avenue contained two pieces of suppressed evidence that would have had exculpatory and impeachment value to the defense. (See Doc. 155 at 76-78; Doc. 162 at 154-56.) One is the statement of Jerry Kirkland, who told police that he and his two daughters witnessed a man crash what turned out to be Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car into a utility pole on Holton Avenue and then saw the man, who was wearing a gray Chicago Bulls coat, emerge from the damaged car holding his nose. (Doc. 154-9 at 45-46 (FEH Ex. 6).) Prosecutors, however, included Kirkland and his daughter, Lashanda, along with their Holton Avenue home address, on their witness list, which was served on defense counsel on February 26, 1991, nearly five months before the trial. (Id. at 268-69 (FEH Ex. 46).) No Brady violation occurs \u201cwhere a defendant knew or should have known the essential facts permitting him to take advantage of any exculpatory information, or where the evidence is available . . . from another source, because in such cases there is really nothing for the government to disclose.\u201d Coe, 161 F.3d at 344 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). This evidence, therefore, was not suppressed and is not Brady material.\n\nThe other piece of evidence from these police reports that Mack contends the\nprosecution improperly withheld is the report that a man and his mother told the police that, as they were walking near Mr. Sanelli\u2019s abandoned car on Holton Avenue, they saw a man with a mustache, wearing a reddish sweater, drive up to the car, get in, and then move it a couple feet back from the utility pole. (Doc. 154-9 at 37-38 (FEH Ex. 4).) The man then got out of the car, and with his female companion yelling at him \u201chysterically\u201d to \u201cget away from that car [because] it might be stolen,\u201d returned to his car and drove away. (Id.) Mack argues that this evidence, in conjunction with the suppressed fact from the Sanelli notes that, according to Willis, Sowell left a 9 mm clip in the car, \u201clead[s] to the inference that the man who moved the car was involved in the crime and was seeking to recapture the left-behind clip[,]\u201d which was not in the car when it was recovered. (Doc. at 162 at 155.) He suggests this \u201cunknown man\u201d was Sowell or Willis himself. (Id.) But he was unable to use this evidence at trial or \u201cto timely pursue any leads that this information revealed,\u201d including that Sowell was the actual shooter or that Sowell had an accomplice other than Mack, possibly Willis. (Id.)\n\nThere is nothing in the record to suggest that the prosecution disclosed this evidence to the defense, and the court agrees that this evidence had some exculpatory or impeachment value. The police report regarding the Holton Avenue car crash, therefore, qualifies as Brady material.\n\n4. Willis deal evidence\n\nIn May 1991, nearly two months before Mack\u2019s trial, Willis was charged with felonious assault with a violence specification, aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and possession of criminal tools for severely beating and stealing a revolver from 83-year-old\nold Robert Burgess. (Doc. 154-9 at 398-401 (FEH Ex. 63).) According to police records, Mack was wearing a ski mask at the time of the offense, but Burgess pulled it off and recognized him as \u201cTim,\u201d whom he had once hired to repair his washing machine. (Id. at 394, 396.) Burgess was hospitalized for three days due to injuries sustained in the assault. (Id. at 397.) He then identified Willis as the assailant from a lineup and provided a written statement about the crime. (Id.) However, Burgess died in October 1991 for reasons \u201cunrelated to the beating,\u201d and the assault case against Willis was dismissed a short time later. (Id. at 366.) Mack claims that the prosecution wrongfully withheld evidence of an unwritten agreement between it and Willis that the State would drop the charges against Willis in the Burgess case in exchange for Willis\u2019 testimony and cooperation in the prosecutions of Mack and Sowell for Mr. Sanelli\u2019s murder. (Doc. 155 at 78-83.)\n\nThe state appellate court, in reviewing this claim, reasoned:\n\n{\u00b6 51} In the weeks leading up to appellant's trial, it was disclosed to appellant's counsel that Willis was charged with aggravated robbery involving Robert Burgess. The charges in this case were ultimately dismissed. Appellant points to a note in the state's file of this prosecution that the trial prosecutor called the prosecutor assigned to Willis's case and asked him to hold the case to investigate it further. This conversation, documented by the prosecutor in Willis's case, occurred on July 30, 1991, a few weeks after the conclusion of appellant's trial, and a few days after Willis finished testifying against Sowell.\n\n{\u00b6 52} The evidence adduced at the federal evidentiary hearing and below indicates Willis received no deal from the state for his testimony. The trial prosecutor testified that no consideration with other criminal matters was ever exchanged with Willis for his testimony against appellant. Willis's attorney testified that he was unaware of any deal. There is no evidence of the terms of any deal between the state and Willis in the record before this court.\n\n{\u00b6 53} However, appellant makes an inference, based on the sequence of events that took place in Willis's criminal matter, that a deal was reached. O'Malley also indicated during his testimony during a bail hearing involving federal charges against Willis, that he thought Willis received some type of deal. He\ntestified, at the hearing below, that this impression was his personal opinion based on, his best recollection, some notes he read at the time.\n\n\u00b6 54 The trial prosecutor explained the conversation, stating he asked the other prosecutor to reinvestigate the case because, according to Willis, people were trying to set him up to discredit him.\n\n\u00b6 55 The notes of the prosecutor in Willis's case indicate that the case was dismissed because the victim, Burgess, died of unrelated causes, and without a witness, they could not prosecute. The trial court found that appellant had not demonstrated that a deal was reached to secure Willis's testimony. This court agrees.\n\nMack, 2018 WL 565704, at *12-13.\n\nMack claims the state appellate court\u2019s determination that no deal existed between Willis and the prosecution relating to Willis\u2019 testimony in the Sanelli cases and his prosecution in the Burgess case was an unreasonable determination of fact in light of the evidence presented under \u00a7 2254(d)(2). (See, e.g., Doc. 162 at 156.) To prove this, Mack must establish that the state court\u2019s factual finding that there was no undisclosed deal was clearly erroneous. See Williams v. Coyle, 260 F.3d 684, 707 (6th Cir. 2001) (to prevail on his Brady claim, petitioner \u201cmust show that the court\u2019s factual finding that no deal existed was clearly erroneous\u201d). Mack has not made that showing.\n\nAs Mack points out, even a \u201cless formal, unwritten or tacit agreement\u201d between a prosecutor and cooperating witness are \u201csubject to Brady\u2019s disclosure mandate.\u201d Bell v. Bell, 512 F.3d 223, 233 (6th Cir. 2008) (en banc); see also Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154-55. And Mack alleges that \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d undisclosed evidence demonstrates that Willis and prosecutors had such an unwritten agreement in this case. (Doc. 162 at 158.) He points to a supervisor\u2019s instruction to Bombik in February 1991 that he \u201c[b]etter make sure that T. Willis doesn\u2019t get scared off.\u201d (Doc. 154-9 at 171 (FEH Ex. 34).) Mack also\ncites a police report and Bombik\u2019s notes showing that Bombik knew about the Burgess case as early as June 1991 and had discussed with Willis at a trial-preparation meeting at least who was representing him, who the judge was, and the trial date in the case. (Id. at 137-38 (FEH Ex. 30) (Police Report); 173 (FEH Ex. 35) (Bombik Notes).)\n\nBut even more telling, according to Mack, is a case log entry in the prosecution\u2019s Burgess case file for July 30, 1991, which states,\n\nTalk[ed] to R. Bombik who used [Willis] on murder case. Bombik believes [Willis] did not do this crime and wants case cont\u2019d for further invest. [Willis\u2019] counsel notified [and] agrees. Case to be continued at least a month.\n\n(Id. at 366 (FEH Ex. 63).) Mack points out that July 30 was the same day that testimony in the Sowell trial concluded and the case was sent to the jury for deliberations (Doc. 154-10 at 855 (FEH Ex. 79-2 (Sowell Trial Tr.))); thirteen days after Mack\u2019s conviction (see Doc. 149-1 at 108); and just six days before the Burgess case\u2019s trial date (see Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 88 (Bombik Test.)). Nothing in the Burgess case log indicates that any further investigation was conducted after July 31. (Id.)\n\nFinally, Mack offers the testimony of Michael O\u2019Malley, a detective in the CPD\u2019s homicide unit who was assigned to a task force investigating the so-called ski-mask homicides and robberies taking place in Cleveland at the time of the Sanelli murder investigation. (Doc. 102 (FEH Tr.) at 94-95, 98-99.) O\u2019Malley testified at a federal court detention hearing in 1996 regarding Willis\u2019 then-pending federal firearms charges that, in his \u201cpersonal opinion,\u201d and based on case notes he read, there \u201cappeared\u201d to have been a \u201cdeal\u201d between prosecutors and Willis that the charges against him relating to the Burgess case would be dropped if he testified against the defendants in the Sanelli cases. (Doc. 154-\nO\u2019Malley later testified at the federal evidentiary hearing in this case that this was just his \u201copinion\u201d about Willis and the Burgess case, but he \u201cstill st[ood] by it . . . .\u201d (Doc. 102 (FEH Tr.) at 135.)\n\nAs the state appellate court found, however, there is also substantial countervailing evidence that there was no deal rewarding Willis for testifying against Mack. The prosecution\u2019s case log states that Burgess\u2019 doctor confirmed that Burgess\u2019 death was not related to the beating, and \u201cthere [was] no case without the victim.\u201d (Doc. 154-9 at 366 (FEH Ex. 63).) And the cover of the prosecution\u2019s case file stated that the case was dismissed because the victim had died. (Id. at 365.) There was a reasonable explanation, therefore, for the Burgess case\u2019s dismissal other than a deal with Willis.\n\nMoreover, the prosecutors in both the Sanelli and Burgess cases and Willis\u2019 defense attorney in the Burgess case all testified in the federal proceedings that no tacit agreement existed between Willis and the State relating to his testimony against Mack and the Burgess case. Bombik was emphatic that he never made any deal with Willis for him to testify against Mack, nor did he ask the prosecutor in the Burgess case to give Willis special consideration of any kind in that case. (Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 99-100.) Bombik testified that he reviewed a police report about the Burgess case once he learned of the charges against Willis. (Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 89.) He learned from the report that Burgess alleged Willis was wearing a face mask at the time of the offense but Burgess had pulled it off; had identified Willis from a lineup; and was hospitalized after the assault. (Id. at 89-90.) But he knew nothing else about the case. (Id. at 89-92.) The only reason he intervened in the Burgess case at all, Bombik testified, was because Willis told him at a meeting on July 1,\nthe day Mack\u2019s trial began, that the weekend before, he and his children were threatened twice by several men and Mack himself had called Willis to threaten him, mentioning the Burgess case. (Id. at 63-64.) Bombik said he believed \u201cWillis had been placed in serious danger\u201d (id. at 93) and he \u201cwas beginning to wonder whether or not Mr. Willis had not been set up on that case\u201d (id. at 64). Indeed, \u201c\u2018[t]he government is free to reward witnesses for their cooperation with favorable treatment in pending criminal cases without disclosing to the defendant its intention to do so, provided that it does not promise anything to the witnesses prior to that testimony.\u2019\u201d Bell, 512 F.3d at 234 (quoting Shabazz v. Artuz, 336 F.3d 154, 165 (2d Cir. 2003)) (emphasis in original).\n\nProsecutor David Zimmerman, who supervised the Burgess case, recalled that Burgess was \u201cseriously injured\u201d by an \u201cextensive beating.\u201d (Doc. 99 (FEH Tr.) at 40.) He testified that there was \u201csome evidence\u201d that Burgess\u2019 death was \u201cdue at least in part to this beating[,]\u201d but he wrote in the case log that he spoke to Burgess\u2019 doctor, who said his death was \u201cnot related to [the] beating.\u201d (Id. at 63-64.) Zimmerman testified that after Burgess died, he evaluated the case against Willis and, based on a thorough investigation of the case and his professional judgment, he determined that because Burgess had died, \u201cwe did not have sufficient information to continue forward on the case.\u201d (Id. at 29, 47, 88.) He denied ever speaking to Bombik about the Burgess case. (Id. at 49, 57, 78, 88.) He further noted that if any deal had been given to Willis, it would have been noted on the case log in the file. (Id. at 88.) Prosecutor Anthony Manning, the prosecutor assigned to the Burgess case, also testified that he could not recall any agreement with Willis related to the case. (Doc. 105 (Manning Depo.) at 26.) Manning specifically remembered that he tried to get Willis\nto plead guilty even after Burgess had died. (Id. at 27-28.) Finally, Willis\u2019 defense attorney, Jim McDonnell, testified that he could not recall anyone offering a deal to Willis in order to secure his testimony against Mack. (Doc. 100 (FEH Tr.) at 70.)\n\nWillis himself also denied that any deal existed. At trial, Mack\u2019s attorney questioned Willis about whether he hoped to receive consideration in his pending criminal case in exchange for testifying against Mack. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 151-52.) Willis testified that the cases had nothing to do with one another. (Id. at 152.) At the federal evidentiary hearing, Willis again testified that he did not receive a deal to testify against Mack, and professed that he did not expect any help from the State in the Burgess case because he \u201cdidn\u2019t do it\u201d and had no need for a deal. (Doc. 99 (FEH Tr.) at 216, 223, 241, 249.) He had wanted the Burgess case to go to trial, Willis explained, but the case was dismissed because the victim had died. (Id. at 216, 223, 249.)\n\nGiven this evidence, the state court\u2019s determination that Willis received no deal from prosecutors for his testimony against Mack was not clearly erroneous. True, the timing and stated purpose of Bombik\u2019s intervention in the Burgess case are curious. It is difficult to square the serious and credible allegations against Willis in the Burgess case with Bombik\u2019s explanation for why he told the prosecutor in that case to continue its investigation while the Sanelli trials were unfolding: that he was concerned Willis was being \u201cset up\u201d for the Burgess assault because he testified against Mack. Nevertheless, the fact that Bombik intervened in this relatively minor way \u2013 requesting a continuance for further investigation \u2013 and the Burgess case ultimately was dismissed, without more, is insufficient to establish that some kind of tacit agreement existed. This is especially true\nwhen the prosecutors in both the Sanelli and Burgess cases and Willis\u2019 attorney at the time all uniformly and unequivocally denied it happened and Burgess died of other causes before the trial could take place, leaving no witness to the crime. See Williams, 260 F.3d at 707 (\u201cThe mere fact that [some witnesses\u2019] sentences were later altered is not evidence that a deal existed prior to their testimony at trial.\u201d); Matthews v. Ishee, 486 F.3d 883, 896 (6th Cir. 2007) (\u201cThe fact [a witness] entered into a favorable plea bargain within two weeks after [petitioner\u2019s] conviction and sentence is not evidence, or is at most weak circumstantial evidence, that a deal existed at the time of trial[,]\u201d especially when, \u201clike in Williams, the assistant prosecutor testified categorically that there was no preexisting deal with [the witness].\u201d); Abdur-Rasheed v. Jones, 100 Fed. Appx. 357, 359 (6th Cir. 2004) (finding that being subsequently charged with a lesser offense is not evidence a witness had a preexisting agreement with the prosecution).\n\nThus, \u201c[w]ithout an agreement, no evidence was suppressed, and the state\u2019s conduct not disclosing something it did not have, cannot be considered a Brady violation.\u201d Bell, 512 F.3d at 234. And even if the court were to assume that such a deal existed, as will be discussed below, the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose it did not prejudice Mack.\n\n5. Willis\u2019 status as Sanelli murder suspect\n\nMack next contends that prosecutors should have disclosed evidence that the police considered Willis a suspect in the Sanelli murder investigation and searched Willis\u2019 property four times. (Doc. 155 at 84-86.) The state court of appeals reviewed this claim, deciding:\n\n\u00b6 47 Appellant argues that he should have been informed that Willis's house had been searched four times by police.\nThe trial prosecutor testified during the federal proceedings that the searches were consensual searches conducted at Willis's request. He also testified he did disclose the police reports indicating police searched Willis's home and property, although the notes taken by appellant's attorney do not include disclosure of that fact. Further, notes taken by one of appellant's attorneys indicate she was aware that property was recovered from Willis's home that tied appellant to other robberies. Appellant was identified by the victims of those robberies as the person who stole the items. This further casts doubts on appellant's arguments that Willis was setting appellant up to escape his own responsibility in the murder. This is not beneficial to appellant such that it deprived appellant of an opportunity to properly cross-examine Willis and does not constitute a *Brady* violation.\n\n*Mack*, 2018 WL 565704, at *12.\n\nThe record supports the state court\u2019s findings regarding the State\u2019s disclosure of the police searches of Willis\u2019 property, and, indeed, Mack does not explicitly contest them (*see* Doc. 155 at 84-86). As the state court noted, Mack\u2019s trial attorneys\u2019 notes reference Willis \u201cturn[ing] over\u201d to police various items on January 22 or 23, 1991, that Willis claimed Mack \u201cand his companions\u201d left on his property and were connected to one of the ski-mask robberies. (Doc. 154-9 at 193 (FEH Ex. 38).) And Bombik testified at the federal evidentiary hearing that Mack\u2019s trial counsel \u201cprobably did know\u201d about the searches, since, as explained above, his long-standing practice was to go over police reports in his files with defense counsel at pretrials. (Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 33.) The state court reasonably determined, therefore, that the prosecution disclosed to defense counsel that the police had searched Willis\u2019 property.\n\nThe record also does not support Mack\u2019s contention that Willis was a suspect in the Sanelli murder case. Mack infers from materials produced by the State and testimony given in the federal habeas proceedings relating to those searches that Willis was a suspect in the ski-mask crimes and the Sanelli murder, which the prosecution never disclosed. (*See* Doc.\n155 at 84-86.) He cites an extensive array of documents: police reports regarding the Sanelli murder investigation (Doc. 154-9 at 73-81 (FEH Ex. 14), 83 (FEH Ex. 15), 120 (FEH Ex. 24), 124 (FEH Ex. 26), 135 (FEH Ex. 29)); police records regarding the ski-mask crimes and police task force (id. at 673 (FEH Ex. 78), 675 (FEH Ex. 79)); the transcript of the 1996 federal detention hearing at which former detective Michael O\u2019Malley testified about Willis (Doc. 154-11 at 26-95 (FEH Ex. 81)); and testimony of former detectives Gray and O\u2019Malley at the federal evidentiary hearing (Doc. 99 (FEH Tr.) at 104, 114-25 (Gray Test.); Doc. 102 (FEH Tr.) at 103-49 (O\u2019Malley Test.)).\n\nBut nowhere in the police records is Willis identified as a suspect in the Sanelli murder. And Bombik emphatically denied that Willis was a suspect in the case at the federal evidentiary hearing; the evidence against Mack and Sowell was \u201cclear,\u201d he recalled, and \u201chad nothing to do with Tim Willis.\u201d (Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 31-33.) The fact that the police searched Willis\u2019 property, Bombik explained, did not mean Willis was a \u201csuspect [in the Sanelli case,] trying to exonerate himself by blaming other people.\u201d (Id. at 30.) After all, he continued, Willis consented to the searches and was a cooperating witness in the Sanelli case. (Id. at 29-30; see also Doc. 154-9 at 83 (FEH Ex. 15), 120 (FEH Ex. 24) (police reports showing searches were consensual).)\n\nMack focuses on a police report describing the purpose of one of the searches of Willis\u2019 property as \u201clocat[ing] any clothing or items that may have been used in the [Sanelli] Homicide or the robberies . . . .\u201d (Doc. 154-9 at 120 (FEH Ex. 24).) But that is because, the report explains, Willis told the police that \u201cthe males arrested in this crime changed clothing regularly [on Willis\u2019 property] and fired weapons [there] on many\noccasions.\u201d (Id.) O\u2019Malley also testified that a report about the search of Willis\u2019 property in which the police found a spent pellet, two Halloween masks, and an overnight bag indicated that Willis was a \u201ccooperative witness,\u201d not a suspect. (Doc. 102 (FEH Tr.) at 112; Doc. 154-9 at 120 (FEH Ex. 24).)\n\nThe only direct evidence Mack offers that Willis was classified as a suspect in the Sanelli murder investigation is O\u2019Malley\u2019s testimony at the 1996 detention hearing in federal court in which Willis was facing federal firearms charges. He testified there that, in his opinion based on reading police reports, Willis \u201csupplied the weapons to the defendants\u201d in the Sanelli cases, but Willis was not charged for any crime related to Mr. Sanelli\u2019s murder because \u201c[h]e turned state witness.\u201d (Doc. 154-11 at 42-43 (FEH Ex. 81).) When questioned about Willis\u2019 status as a suspect in the Sanelli murder investigation at the federal evidentiary hearing in this case, however, O\u2019Malley revised and clarified his earlier testimony. He stressed that he was only \u201c[o]n the peripheral\u201d of the Sanelli murder investigation. (Doc. 102 (FEH Tr.) at 97.) And he testified that he could not recall if Willis was a suspect in the Sanelli case. (Id.) He held to this position when pressed on the issue in this exchange:\n\nQ: And you knew at that time [of the Sanelli investigation], did you not, that Timothy Willis was going to be the key witness for the state in that case; isn\u2019t that correct?\n\nA: I learned as the investigation was going on, yes.\n\nQ: And you learned, did you not, during the time as the investigation went on the decision was made by Timothy Willis to turn state\u2019s witness and testify against the defendants; isn\u2019t that correct?\n\nA: As the investigation was going on, I learned that.\nQ: And you knew then, and concluded as a result of the fact that he was turning state\u2019s witness, that he was in fact a suspect in that case, correct?\n\nA: Again, I was on the peripheral. I wasn\u2019t the lead detective in the case. I can\u2019t honestly answer that.\n\n(Id. at 97-98.) On further questioning, O\u2019Malley testified that he had \u201csome personal belief\u201d or \u201ca gut feeling\u201d that Willis \u201cmay have been involved\u201d in the Sanelli murder, but he \u201cdidn\u2019t have anything to back it up if [he] did believe that.\u201d (Id. at 127-28.)\n\nAccordingly, because the fact that the police had searched Willis\u2019 property during the Sanelli murder investigation was disclosed to defense counsel before trial, and there is little, if any, evidence that Willis was a suspect in the Sanelli murder investigation, this evidence does not qualify as Brady material.\n\n6. Willis\u2019 possible involvement in the ski-mask crimes\n\nIn a related claim, Mack contends that the prosecution improperly withheld information contained in police reports and other records concerning Willis\u2019 possible involvement in the ski-mask robberies and murders that occurred in Cleveland around the same time as the Sanelli murder. (Doc. 155 at 86-89.) The state appellate court wrote about this claim:\n\n\u00b6 49 Appellant argues that Willis was a person of interest in several aggravated robberies and homicides being investigated by a Cleveland Police task force, dubbed the \u201cSki Mask Task Force.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 50 The testimony of the trial prosecutor indicated that these task force records were not a part of his file and no charges were pending or about to be filed before or during trial relating to this investigation. Willis did have a pending criminal indictment at the time of trial, but appellant's attorney testified he knew that. The evidence in the task force investigation goes only so far to name Willis as a person of interest. This fact was established at the hearing below by the testimony of Michael O'Malley. The fact that Willis was a person\nof interest in certain crimes, and his picture was included in a book, along with roughly 30 others used by police investigating a series of robberies, does not amount to material that was required to be disclosed. The testimony adduced at the federal and state hearings indicates that appellant was not identified by any witness as a perpetrator of these crimes. The Robert Burgess prosecution was disclosed and trial testimony indicated that this case was pending against Willis at the time of trial. Therefore, this information does not constitute Brady material that was required to be turned over.\n\nMack, 2018 WL 565704, at *12.\n\nMack does not address the state court\u2019s findings on this claim. (See Doc 155 at 86-89.) Instead, he reasserts his contention that \u201c[t]he State suppressed [police] reports indicating that Timothy Willis was, during the relevant time, believed by police to himself be a suspect in other ski-mask robberies and murders that were believed by police to be related to the Sanelli murder.\u201d (Id. at 86.) He points to hundreds of pages of police records regarding the crimes. (Id. (citing Doc. 154-9 at 364-401 (FEH Ex. 63), 632-35 (FEH Ex. 71), 673 (FEH Ex. 78); Doc. 154-12 at 311-596 (FEH Ex. 90/96)).) Mack cites, for example, references in police reports to a \u201cblue spiral binder\u201d compiled by the homicide unit that contained photographs of \u201cpotential suspects,\u201d including Willis (Doc. 154-12 at 425, 426 (listing names of potential suspects), 432, 434 (FEH Ex. 90/96)); and the fact that the police were interested in Willis\u2019 black van because witnesses had seen suspects of one of the ski-mask homicides in a similar black van (id. at 484, 496-98, 518-22 (FEH Ex. 90/96)).\n\nThis court agrees with the state court that this information does not constitute Brady material. First, it is not clear that the prosecution had a duty to disclose information about Willis\u2019 possible involvement in the ski-mask crimes. Former detective O\u2019Malley, who was assigned to the police ski-mask task force at that time, testified at the federal evidentiary\nhearing that he would classify Willis as a \u201cperson of interest\u201d in the ski-mask crimes investigation, but Willis was not \u201cconsidered a suspect [or] charged as a suspect\u201d for those offenses. (Doc. 102 (FEH Tr.) at 126.) In his \u201copinion,\u201d he explained, Willis was \u201cinvolved\u201d in the crimes, \u201c[p]ossibly not [as] an active participant, but maybe on the peripheral . . . as a receiver.\u201d (Id.) And while there was some overlap between the police investigations of the Sanelli murder and ski-mask crimes, as O\u2019Malley explained at the federal evidentiary hearing (see Doc. 102 (FEH Tr.) at 96-98), Bombik was adamant in his testimony that when he prosecuted Mack for Mr. Sanelli\u2019s murder, he did not view that case as related at all to the ski-mask crimes (Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 14-16, 56-58). Bombik noted that if Willis had been \u201cunder indictment, or charges [were] going to be pressed against him, or if there [was] . . . a meaningful investigation against him\u201d as a named suspect in the ski-mask crimes, that information may have been relevant to the Sanelli investigation. (Id. at 19.) But as it was, Bombik continued, any information about Willis\u2019 possible role in those crimes would have been inadmissible and speculative, and not subject to Brady\u2019s disclosure rules. (Id. at 19-20.) Bombik contrasted his disclosure to defense counsel that Willis was charged in the Burgess case. (Id. at 21-22.) Further, as the state court noted, Bombik did not even believe the police reports relating to the ski-mask crimes were originally in his file. (Id. at 57.)\n\nMoreover, the record shows that Mack\u2019s defense team was aware of many of the basic facts regarding Willis\u2019 possible connection to the ski-mask crimes before Mack\u2019s trial took place. Just two weeks after Mack was arrested for the Sanelli murder, on February 7, 1991, Mack was charged with aggravated robbery in two of the ski-mask cases. (See Doc.\nNotes of Mack\u2019s trial counsel indicate they also represented Mack in these matters and Bombik was at least initially the prosecutor on those cases. (See Doc. 154-9 at 192-93 (FEH Ex. 38).) Mack\u2019s attorneys were informed at a pretrial in the ski-mask cases shortly after the Sanelli indictment was issued that the victims had identified Mack at a lineup and their stolen possessions, which Willis turned over to police, telling them that Mack and Germany and others had \u201cdumped\u201d them on his property. (Id.; see also id. at 54 (FEH Ex. 9), 93-94 (FEH Ex. 18), 120 (FEH Ex. 24).) Mack\u2019s counsel knew before Mack\u2019s trial, therefore, that Willis was involved in the ski-mask crimes at least to the extent that he admitted to police he had received stolen property connected to those robberies from Mack and others. The defense also knew, as explained above, that the police searched Willis\u2019 property at least once and Willis was arrested and charged with robbery and assault in the Burgess case, in which he allegedly wore a ski mask.\n\nPolice and prosecutors, therefore, disclosed sufficient information about Willis\u2019 involvement in the ski-mask crimes to indicate that Mack \u201cknew or should have known the essential facts permitting him to take advantage of any exculpatory information, or where the evidence [was] available . . . from another source . . . .\u201d Coe, 161 F.3d at 344 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The Ohio appellate court reasonably concluded that this information was not suppressed and does not qualify as Brady material.\n\n7. Willis\u2019 oral statement and Bombik-Willis meeting notes\n\nMack\u2019s final Brady claim involves an allegation Willis made about Mack at a meeting he had with Bombik to prepare for his testimony about a month before trial and\nBombik\u2019s notes from that meeting. (Doc. 155 at 89-91 (citing Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 45-47 (Bombik Test.); Doc. 154-9 at 173 (FEH Ex. 35) (Bombik Notes)).) Willis claimed \u2013 and later testified at trial \u2013 that after Sowell explained to Mack why he fired at Mr. Sanelli the night of the murder, Mack said to Sowell, \u201cI shot because you shot.\u201d The notes do not include the \u201cI shot because you shot\u201d statement, but Bombik testified at the federal evidentiary hearing that he \u201cimagine[d]\u201d Willis told him about the statement then. (Doc. 101 (FEH Tr.) at 47.) The notes also reference the trial date, judge, and defense counsel in the Burgess case, a criminal assault case then pending against Willis. (Id. at 48-49.)\n\nMack asserts that this alleged admission of Mack\u2019s, which Mancino testified at the federal evidentiary hearing that he heard for the first time when Willis testified at trial, together with Bombik\u2019s meeting notes, demonstrate how Willis changed his story over time to further implicate Mack, conceal his own involvement in the crime, and curry favor with the prosecutors. (Id. (citing Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 75; Doc. 100 (FEH Tr.) at 100).)\n\nThe state appellate court reviewed this claim and concluded:\n\n\u00b6 37 According to the trial prosecutor's testimony in the federal proceedings, he met with Willis within one month of trial to discuss his trial testimony. Appellant argues the notes from this meeting indicate that, for the first time, Willis remembered that appellant stated, \u201cI shot because you [meaning Sowell] shot.\u201d No prior statement contains this line Willis claimed was uttered by appellant when appellant, Sowell, and Willis were discussing the murder shortly after it happened. Appellant argues the changing nature of Willis's story as trial approached means this is relevant impeachment evidence that should have been disclosed prior to trial. Appellant also argues that the trial prosecutor made note of Willis's pending burglary case. Appellant asserts these notes\n\n15 The court examined these notes above in connection with Mack\u2019s Brady claim that the prosecution suppressed materials demonstrating the existence of an implicit agreement between Bombik and Willis in which he would testify against Mack in exchange for favorable treatment in the Burgess case. See supra Section III.D.4.\nshould also have been disclosed because they could be used to infer that an undisclosed deal had been struck between Willis and the state.\n\n\u00b6 38 The notes do not contain an \u201cI shot because you shot\u201d reference. A statement contained in the notes indicates that Willis told the trial prosecutor that Sowell said he shot because Peter was uncooperative: \u201c\u2018I told the fool to get out, instead he got in & locked the door. I shot him.\u2019\u201d This is consistent with Willis's prior written statement. The trial prosecutor's testimony in the federal proceedings indicates that he did not remember taking notes of the meeting. However, when asked about the \u201cI shot because you shot\u201d statement appellant allegedly made to Willis, the trial prosecutor said he likely learned about the statement at that meeting. His answer was \u201cI imagine I did. Yes. I would imagine I did, sure.\u201d The notes of the conversation that we now know exist do not indicate such a statement was made by Willis at the meeting.\n\n\u00b6 39 Other statements Willis made to police did not contain this statement, and therefore, these statements serve the same impeachment purposes that appellant alleges this undisclosed statement would have served. Further, the notes do not indicate that a deal was reached to secure Willis's testimony.\n\nMack, 2018 WL 565704, at *10-11.\n\nMack contends the state court\u2019s opinion is based on unreasonable determinations of fact and the court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law, but Mack does not identify any erroneous factual determinations or misapplied federal law. (Doc. 162 at 162-64.) Rather, he argues that instead of focusing on the fact that Bombik\u2019s notes do not contain the statement at issue, the state court should have recognized the \u201cfurther impeachment value\u201d of the evidence in showing that Willis was still \u201cshap[ing]\u201d and \u201cembellish[ing]\u201d his story \u201cto harm Mack\u201d and protect himself. (Id. at 163.) The court disagrees.\n\nThe state court correctly determined that the prosecution had no duty to disclose to the defense before trial the \u201cI shot because you shot\u201d statement or the meeting notes as they relate to that statement, despite their impeachment value. Brady generally does not apply to\nthe delayed disclosure of exculpatory or impeachment information, but only to a complete failure to disclose. *United States v. Bencs*, 28 F.3d 555, 560 (6th Cir. 1994). \u201cIf previously undisclosed evidence is disclosed during trial, no *Brady* violation occurs unless the defendant has been prejudiced by the delay in disclosure.\u201d *United States v. Holloway*, 740 F.2d 1373, 1381 (6th Cir. 1984); see also *United States v. Patrick*, 965 F.2d 1390, 1400 (6th Cir. 1992), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 507 U.S. 956 (1993) (\u201cDelay only violates *Brady* when the delay itself causes prejudice.\u201d).\n\nThere was no prejudice to Mack here. Willis\u2019 testimony about Mack\u2019s statement was made \u201c\u2018in time for full and adequate correction.\u2019\u201d *Holloway*, 740 F.2d at 1381 (quoting *United States v. Enright*, 579 F.2d 980, 989 (6th Cir. 1978)). Mack\u2019s counsel had the opportunity to cross-examine Willis and impeach him by exploring the differences between his new account of Mack and Sowell\u2019s conversation after the murder and his prior statements to police about Mack\u2019s involvement in the shooting. Moreover, defense counsel did not request a recess or continuance after Willis testified about the statement in order to further prepare or adjust his cross-examination of Willis, indicating that he was \u201csatisfied he had sufficient opportunity to use the evidence advantageously.\u201d *United States v Osorio*, 929 F.2d 753, 758 (1st Cir. 1991). The Sixth Circuit has noted that where defense counsel makes no request for a continuance after the State has introduced surprise testimony like Willis\u2019, it \u201cconclude[s] that the timing of the disclosure did not prejudice [the defendant].\u201d *Holloway*, 740 F.2d at 1381; see also *United States v. Diaz\u2013Villafane*, 874 F.2d 43, 47 (1st Cir. 1989) (\u201c[i]f, indeed, this was a sneak attack, then a continuance would have been a complete cure\u201d).\nIt was not unreasonable, therefore, for the state court of appeals to have concluded that prosecutors had no obligation under *Brady* to disclose before trial Willis\u2019 allegation that Mack stated \u201cI shot because you shot\u201d or the prosecutor\u2019s notes from his meeting with Willis as they may relate to that statement.\n\n**E. Napue Claim**\n\nFinally, Mack argues that his due process rights under *Napue* were violated when the prosecution permitted Willis to present perjured testimony and failed to disclose information that would have enabled Mack to challenge Willis\u2019 false testimony. (See Doc. 155 at 91-93.) Specifically, he alleges the prosecution knew but did not disclose that Willis falsely testified that: (1) he encountered Sowell and Mack while walking home from the Fairfax Recreation Center with his daughter the night of the murder, even though the center was closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day (see Doc. 100 (FEH Tr.) at 2-8 (Henderson Test.); Doc. 154-9 at 466 (FEH Ex. 68) (Aff. of Fairfax Rec. Ctr. Mgr.); Doc. 154-11 at 101 (FEH Ex. 83) (City Records); (2) he never owned a gun, even though he was under indictment for the Burgess case, the police had found a spent bullet on his property, and he was a person of interest in the ski-mask crimes investigation (see supra Sections III.D.5, 6); (3) he did not see the Sanelli family again until February 1991 after his initial meeting with them on January 23, 1991, even though he saw them the next day (see supra Section III.D.2); and (4) he was not interested in any reward for his assistance in the Sanelli murder investigation and trials, even though he was \u201cmotivated to testify falsely by his expectation of[] a favorable deal from the State\u201d in the Burgess and Sanelli cases (see supra Section III.D.4). (Id.)\nIn reviewing this claim, the state court of appeals opined:\n\n\u00b6 56 Appellant claims the state withheld evidence that indicated Willis was lying or that his story changed over time.\n\n\u00b6 57 The trial transcript indicates Willis testified that he was waiting outside of a recreation center while his child was inside on January 21, 1991. At approximately 5:30, he saw Sowell, Reginald Germany, and appellant in a car, and they stopped to talk. Sowell exited the car and asked Willis if he had a gun. Sowell indicated the three were going downtown to get a \u201chottie,\u201d i.e., a stolen car.\n\n\u00b6 58 Willis testified that at about 7:15 he was walking his daughter back from The Fairfax Recreation Center. He saw Sowell and appellant in a different vehicle than they were driving previously. Sowell was driving a car that matched a description of the car stolen from Peter during the murder. Willis testified that he asked them where they got the car, and Sowell said they got it on Prospect Avenue. Appellant then asked Sowell why Sowell shot the man. After Sowell explained that he shot because the man didn't do what he said, Willis testified appellant stated, \u201cI shot because you shot.\u201d The gun that fired the bullets that killed Peter was also found in appellant's possession.\n\n\u00b6 59 Appellant claims the state should have known Willis's testimony was fabricated because the recreation center was closed that day. During the federal proceedings, appellant introduced testimony from a city of Cleveland employee that on the day Willis testified he saw appellant and Sowell in the car, the recreation center was actually closed because it was Martin Luther King, Jr., Day. However, Willis testified there was a big festival or a talent show or something. This does not indicate that the state knew Willis's testimony constituted perjury.\n\n\u00b6 60 Also, the fact that Willis's testimony differed somewhat from his previous statements to police does not indicate the state knew or should have known that Willis's testimony was untrue. Willis's testimony was substantially similar to his prior statements. This does not amount to a Brady violation.\n\nMack, 2018 WL 565704, at *13.\n\nMack does not address the state court\u2019s findings regarding his Napue claim based on Willis\u2019 testimony. Furthermore, he presents no evidence here to refute the state court\u2019s factual findings or conclusions. He has not shown that at the time of the trial, the\nprosecutors knew or should have known that Willis was lying about his daughter being at the recreation center the night of the murder, on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Nor has Mack proven that Willis lied about never owning guns, or that prosecutors knew or should have known that he was lying about that. Even if they may have suspected that was not true, police had searched Willis\u2019 property several times before Mack\u2019s trial and apparently had not found any guns. Mack also has not demonstrated that Willis was lying, as opposed to forgetting, when he testified that he did not meet the Sanelli family again after their first encounter until the following month. Finally, as demonstrated above, Mack has not shown that Willis did in fact have a deal with prosecutors to receive consideration for testifying against Mack and Sowell. It follows, therefore, that he has no proof that prosecutors knew that such a deal drove Willis\u2019 decision to testify in Mack\u2019s trial. This claim is without merit.\n\nF. Prejudice\n\nAs noted above, the \u201ctouchstone of materiality\u201d for purposes of a Brady claim is \u201ca \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 of a different result, . . . shown when the government\u2019s evidentiary suppression \u2018undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u2019\u201d Kyles, 514 U.S. at 434 (quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 678). To obtain relief, the petitioner must show that the State\u2019s failure to turn over the suppressed evidence can \u201creasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d Id. at 435.\n\nBased on the analysis above, only three categories of the alleged Brady material meet Brady\u2019s favorability and suppression requirements and will be included in the court\u2019s consideration of whether their nondisclosure collectively impacted the result of Mack\u2019s trial.\nsuch that it undermines confidence in its outcome. They are: (1) the notes of Willis\u2019 initial meeting with the Sanelli family; (2) police reports showing that someone moved Mr. Sanelli\u2019s damaged and abandoned car on Holton Avenue; and (3) evidence of an unspoken agreement between Willis and the prosecution, assuming one existed, that Willis would receive favorable treatment in the Burgess case in consideration for his testimony against Mack and Sowell in the Sanelli cases.\n\nThe state appellate court, which considered all of the alleged *Brady* evidence collectively for materiality, concluded:\n\n{\u00b6 61} Assuming the evidence appellant claims to have been wrongly withheld should have been disclosed prior to trial, the evidence must be material to the convictions in order to warrant a new trial. \u201cThe question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\u201d *Kyles*, 514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490. The Court went on to set forth that a reasonable probability of a different result is shown \u201cwhen the government's evidentiary suppression \u2018undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u2019 \u201d *Id.*, quoting *Bagley*, 473 U.S. at 678, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481.\n\n{\u00b6 62} Considering this evidence as a whole does not lead this court to the conclusion that there is a reasonable probability of a different result. The evidence does not undermine the confidence in the outcome of the trial given the nature of the evidence that is alleged to constitute *Brady* violations and the other evidence adduced at trial.\n\n*Mack*, 2018 WL 565704, at *14.\n\nMack contends that the state court\u2019s decision both contravened and misapplied *Brady* and the Supreme Court cases that followed it. (*See, e.g.*, Doc. 162 at 164-67.) One of his chief complaints is that the court did not adhere to the Supreme Court\u2019s directive in *Kyles*, 514 U.S. at 434, that *Brady* materiality \u201cis not a sufficiency-of-the-evidence test.\u201d (*See* Doc. 162 at 149-50, 155-56, 165-66.) The *Kyles* Court explained that \u201c[a] defendant\nneed not demonstrate that after discounting the inculpatory evidence in light of the undisclosed evidence, there would not have been enough left to convict.\u201d *Kyles*, 514 U.S. at 434\u201335. Mack cites three instances where he believes the Ohio court improperly applied a sufficiency-of-the-evidence standard in finding Mack suffered no prejudice from the suppressed evidence, when the court concluded: (1) the Sanelli notes \u201cwere cumulative of other evidence and [did] not cast serious doubt on the verdicts in this case[,]\u201d (Doc. 162 at 149-50 (quoting *Mack*, 2018 WL 565704, at *10 (\u00b6 34))); (2) \u201cthe fact that Sowell was driving the car [when it crashed into the pole] does not lead to the conclusion that Sowell was the person that killed Peter . . . [and] does not cast doubt on appellant\u2019s conviction\u201d (id. at 155-56 (quoting *Mack*, 2018 WL 565704, at *11 (\u00b6 45))); and (3) considering the alleged *Brady* evidence as a whole, \u201c[t]he evidence does not undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial given the nature of the evidence that [was] alleged to constitute *Brady* violations and the other evidence adduced at trial\u201d (id. at 149-50 (quoting *Mack*, 2018 WL 565704, at *14 (\u00b6 62))). According to Mack, these statements show the court \u201cessentially concluded that, despite the withheld evidence, the jury could still have convicted Mack of being the shooter and principal offender on the basis of the forensic and other evidence.\u201d (Id. at 165.)\n\nIt is true that the first two statements Mack identifies, when parsed from the court\u2019s detailed analysis of his *Brady* claim, suggest the court found no *Brady* violation in one group of evidence (the Holton Avenue crash reports) because it was insufficiently exculpatory, and in another (the Sanelli notes) because it was insufficiently damaging to Willis\u2019s credibility such that it would create reasonable doubt about Mack\u2019s guilt. The state court seems to have moved beyond *Brady*\u2019s suppression and favorability requirements in its\nindividualized analysis of the alleged Brady material into a consideration of materiality, which should be examined collectively. See Kyles, 514 U.S. at 436-37 & n.10 (\u201cWe evaluate the tendency and force of the undisclosed evidence item by item . . . [and] its cumulative effect for purposes of materiality separately . . .\u201d). This may have resulted in the court placing too much emphasis on the weaknesses, or insufficient weight, of particular items of alleged Brady evidence. Nevertheless, when the state court conducted its cumulative review of all of the alleged Brady evidence, albeit in a summary fashion, the court did not impose the higher burden of a sufficiency-of-the-evidence test, or \u201cwhether the [Brady evidence] necessarily exculpates [Mack], or discounts so much of the incriminating evidence that [Mack\u2019s] conviction beyond a reasonable doubt cannot stand.\u201d Montgomery v. Bobby, 654 F.3d 668, 696 (6th Cir. 2011) (Clay, J., dissenting). Rather, it addressed the \u201crelevant question\u201d for a Brady materiality analysis: \u201cwhether, after considering the relative strength and relevance of the inculpatory and exculpatory evidence, including the [Brady material], [Mack\u2019s] conviction [was] \u2018worthy of confidence.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Jells v. Mitchell, 538 F.3d 478, 502 (6th Cir. 2008)). Or, as the state court properly put it, whether \u201c[t]he evidence . . . undermine[d] confidence in the outcome of the trial given the nature of the evidence that [was] alleged to constitute Brady violations and the other evidence adduced at trial.\u201d Mack, 2018 WL 565704, at *14 (\u00b6 62). And the state court reasonably concluded that it did not.16\n\n16 Mack also argues that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law by requiring that Mack show by a preponderance of the evidence that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have resulted in his acquittal, also proscribed by the Supreme Court in Kyles. (See Doc. 162 at 165 (citing Kyles, 514 U.S. at 434).) Mack does not elaborate on this argument, however, and, as explained above, this court finds the state court\u2019s ultimate conclusion regarding\n1. **Impeachment value of *Brady* material**\n\nMack\u2019s principal materiality argument is that the state court improperly discounted the \u201cenormous\u201d impeachment value of the suppressed *Brady* evidence in attacking the credibility of the State\u2019s key witness, Willis. (Doc. 162 at 142.) He argues that \u201cthe entirety of the State\u2019s weak case against Mack, for conviction and death, hung by the thread of whether Willis was credible or not,\u201d and \u201cevery single key piece of evidence . . . swirled from and around Willis, and only Willis.\u201d (Doc. 162 at 141 (emphasis in original).) Mack asserts that the undisclosed notes of Willis\u2019 meeting with the Sanelli family and evidence of some tacit agreement between Willis and the prosecutors relating to his testimony would have demonstrated how Willis \u201cshaped\u201d his story over time, increasingly implicating Mack and Sowell, in an effort to earn financial rewards, gain assistance from the prosecution in his own criminal case, and conceal his involvement in the Sanelli murder. (See, e.g., id. at 141-45, 154-56, 156-58.) Without credible testimony from Willis, he contends, it is reasonably probable that the jury would have had reasonable doubt about both his guilt and the materiality of the alleged *Brady* evidence did not unreasonably apply *Kyles* or other clearly established Supreme Court precedent.\n\n17 Mack contends that the undisclosed evidence also would have been useful in challenging the State\u2019s investigation and \u201crush to judgment with its imprudent over-reliance on the pliable, unreliable, and benefit-seeking Willis.\u201d (Doc. 162 at 141.) But Mack does not develop this argument, and given that Mack was arrested with a gun in his possession that was used in the murder, it is difficult to see how the police \u201crushed to judgment.\u201d The court, therefore, will not address this issue. In addition, Mack argues that the Sanelli notes could have been used to impeach Tony Sanelli\u2019s testimony that the family never gave police the notes and did not have them. (Id. at 148-49 (citing Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 181).) It is reasonable to assume, however, that if the notes had been disclosed prior to trial, Sanelli would not have testified this way. And, Michael Barone, who took the notes, testified at the federal evidentiary hearing that he gave them to the police (Doc. 102 (FEH Tr.) at 74), so it is possible that Sanelli just did not know what happened to them at the time of Mack\u2019s trial.\neligibility for a death sentence as the actual shooter and principal offender. (Id. at 151.) As Mack notes, \u201c\u2018withheld evidence is more likely material when the State presents a weaker case for guilt.\u2019\u201d (Id. at 164-65 (quoting Floyd v. Vannoy, 894 F.3d 143, 166 (5th Cir. 2018))).\n\nWillis certainly was a key witness for the State. As Ohio Supreme Court Justice Wright wrote in a dissenting opinion in Mack\u2019s direct appeal:\n\nAny sort of rational review of the record in this case reveals that Willis's testimony was critical to the state's case. Willis is the only witness who places appellant at the scene of the crime. Willis is the only witness who testified that appellant was in a position to fire a shot at Sanelli. Willis is the only witness who in any way related that appellant had a motive to commit the crime. Willis is the only witness who described in any sort of detail the automobile that appellant and co-defendant Thomas Sowell were allegedly driving on the day of the crime. In a word, Willis was a key witness for the state whose testimony was critical to the conviction of appellant. If his credibility would have been impugned, the issue of the appellant's guilt would have been a close call at best.\n\nMack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 517 (Wright, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, the suppressed evidence at issue here \u2013 which Mack presented in state post-conviction proceedings years after Justice Wright penned his dissent \u2013 would not have so impugned Willis\u2019 credibility that it would have \u201cput the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d Kyles, 514 U.S. at 435.\n\nSanelli notes. Mack identifies few significant inconsistencies between Willis\u2019 trial testimony and the information contained in the Sanelli notes (Doc. 154-9 at 50 (FEH Ex. 8)) that could have been used to impeach Willis. He points out that the notes record Willis\u2019 description of Sowell\u2019s jacket as a black Lakers or Raiders coat, when Willis testified at trial that Sowell was wearing a Chicago Bulls jacket the night of the murder (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 73). (Doc. 162 at 143.) He also cites the notes\u2019 notation \u201cINFORMER use\nname \u2018Mickey,\u2019\u201d while Willis denied being a police informant at trial (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 130). (Doc. 162 at 141.) These inconsistencies, however, did not relate to \u201can important issue of guilt,\u201d but merely \u201ctangential issues,\u201d and are not strong impeachment evidence. *Beuke v. Houk*, 537 F.3d 618, 635 (6th Cir. 2008) (finding withheld impeachment evidence against state witness not material). The notes also show that Willis was able to accurately describe the color (black) and type of jacket (a sports starter jacket) that Sowell was wearing when arrested. (See Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 296 (Bornfeld Test.).) And the notes do not indicate whether Willis called himself an informer and told them to use the name Mickey, or the note taker, Michael Barone, labeled Willis an informer and suggested that name. Barone testified at the federal evidentiary hearing that he could not recall. (Doc. 102 (FEH Tr.) at 76-77.)\n\nMost significant, according to Mack, is that the notes indicate that Willis told the Sanelli family that Sowell was the shooter and do not mention Mack at all, yet Willis testified at trial that he heard both Sowell and Mack admit to firing shots at Mr. Sanelli (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 75-76). (See Doc. 162 at 139-41.) This information is not wholly contradictory, however, when placed into the broader context of how Willis divulged his story to the Sanelli family and the police and other evidence adduced at trial.\n\nFirst, the notes do not say that Sowell was the sole shooter or anything to that effect; they state, \u201cman called TOM SOLWELL [sic],\u201d along with personal information about him. Mack infers Willis said Sowell was the sole shooter because he was the only assailant named in the notes, but Barone testified at the state evidentiary hearing that Willis never told him there was only one person involved in the murder. (Doc. 151-9 (State Evidentiary\nFurther, although, as Mack argues, the notes describe a \u201cman talking\u201d and a \u201cman called [Sowell],\u201d and state that \u201che left clip in the car,\u201d the notes also state, \u201cwere 2 guys.\u201d (Doc. 154-9 at 50 (FEH Ex. 8) (emphasis added).) Barone testified at the federal evidentiary hearing that his reference to \u201c2 guys\u201d in the notes referred to there being two men Willis overheard discussing the crime, Sowell and another man. (Doc. 102 (FEH Tr.) at 87.) Still, the notes do not unambiguously identify Sowell as the sole shooter or rule out anyone else\u2019s participation, such as the other man Willis alleged he overheard Sowell talking to.\n\nNevertheless, Mack asserts that the notes are valuable impeachment evidence because, as the contemporaneously-recorded notes of Willis\u2019 first recorded remarks about the shooting, they demonstrate how Willis \u201cshaped\u201d or \u201cembellished\u201d his story over time: from Sowell being the only shooter, to Mack being involved in the murder and Germany offering Sowell his gun (which was used in the crime and found by the police on Germany when he was arrested), to Mack stating he wanted \u201cto kill me an Arab any old way,\u201d to Mack admitting to Sowell, \u201cI shot because you shot.\u201d (Doc. 162 at 142-44.) But the time frame is key here: The same day Willis met with the Sanelli family, he also provided a detailed account of the events surrounding Mr. Sanelli\u2019s murder to the police in a written statement, identifying Mack, Germany, and Sowell as being involved.\n\nWillis met with the Sanellis on January 23, 1991, just two days after the murder. According to a police report, later that same day, Willis called the police and informed them that \u201cthe person who shot the guy who has the glass store[] was Tom Sowell,\u201d and \u201cthe other guys in the killing\u201d were Mack and Germany. (Doc. 154-9 at 53 (FEH Ex. 9)\nWillis then met with the police later that day, and after being interviewed and viewing Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car, he gave police his written statement. (Doc. 154-9 at 60-61 (FEH Ex. 11)). From that point on, Willis never wavered from his identification of Sowell, Mack, and Germany as the perpetrators of this crime. And, although he added details to his story in his trial testimony (most notably, Mack\u2019s admission \u201cI shot because you shot\u201d), his testimony was consistent with his initial account of the key events, such as the three men planning to go downtown to steal a car; Germany offering Sowell his \u201cnine\u201d after Willis refused to provide a gun; later seeing Sowell and Mack in Mr. Sanelli\u2019s damaged car; Sowell admitting to shooting Mr. Sanelli and Mack being disappointed that Mr. Sanelli was not Arab because, he said, he \u201cwant[ed] to kill . . . an Arab any old way\u201d; and Sowell crashing Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car into a pole and hurting his nose. (Compare id. with Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 65-97 (Willis Test.).) The fact that the Sanelli notes mention only Sowell, therefore, is not the compelling and decisive impeachment evidence that Mack contends, given that they do not expressly identify Sowell as the sole shooter and when viewed in the context of Willis\u2019 consistent statements to police both that same day and afterward.\n\nFurthermore, much of the information in them was corroborated by, and cumulative of, evidence presented at trial. See Brooks v. Tennessee, 626 F.3d 878, 893 (6th Cir. 2010) (\u201cEvidence that is merely cumulative to evidence presented at trial is not material for purposes of Brady analysis.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Willis told the Sanelli\n\n---\n\n18 Willis also testified at trial that he called Crime Stoppers before meeting the Sanellis and told them that both Sowell and Mack committed the murder. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 83-84.)\nfamily, for instance, before he had viewed Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car at the impound lot, that the \u201c2 guys . . . had [a ] gray car with back window broken out.\u201d (Doc. 154-9 at 50 (FEH Ex. 8).) Detective Allen testified that Mr. Sanelli\u2019s abandoned, damaged car was light blue with the driver\u2019s and rear passenger\u2019s windows broken out. (Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 210-11.) The notes state, \u201chad 9MM gun.\u201d (Doc. 154-9 at 50 (FEH Ex. 8).) Mack and Germany had nine millimeter guns in their possession when they were arrested, which fired the bullets found in Mr. Sanelli\u2019s clothing and at the crime scene. (Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 264-65 (Horval Test.).) And the notes record that Willis said the \u201cman had black case [with] binoculars.\u201d (Doc. 154-9 at 50 (FEH Ex. 8).) Tony Sanelli testified that his father always kept a pair of binoculars in his car. (Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 167.)\n\nThus, given that Willis informed police of Mack and Germany\u2019s involvement in the murder within hours of meeting with the Sanelli family and the notes were otherwise consistent with Willis\u2019 testimony and other evidence introduced at trial, the Sanelli notes are not the strong impeachment evidence that Mack contends, showing that Willis \u201cshaped\u201d his story in a deceitful and self-interested way.\n\nAgreement regarding testimony. Mack further asserts that the undisclosed evidence of a tacit agreement between Willis and prosecutors, in which Willis received favorable treatment in the Burgess case in exchange for his testimony against Mack and Sowell in the Sanelli cases, would have greatly damaged Willis\u2019 credibility with the jury. (Doc. 162 at 156-62.) Even assuming such an agreement existed, however, \u201c\u2018where the undisclosed evidence merely furnishes an additional basis on which to challenge a witness whose credibility has already been shown to be questionable or who is subject to extensive attack\nby reason of other evidence, the undisclosed evidence may be cumulative, and hence not material.\u201d\u201d *Byrd v. Collins*, 209 F.3d 486, 518 (6th Cir. 2000) (quoting *United States v. Avellino*, 136 F.3d 249, 257 (2d Cir. 1998)). And here, Mack\u2019s lead trial counsel, Paul Mancino, sufficiently impeached Willis at trial to alert the jury that such a deal may have transpired.\n\nMancino began his cross-examination of Willis by asking him why Prosecutor Bombik called him Timmy, and whether he and Bombik were \u201cgood friends\u201d or had known each other before this case. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 98.) Willis denied any relationship. (Id.) Mancino also asked Willis if he was police informant, which he denied. (Id. at 130.) He established that Willis was in prison on May 2, 1991, just months before the trial, though the judge sustained Bombik\u2019s objection when Mancino asked why. (Id. at 145.) Finally, Mancino was able to elicit from Willis that Willis had a pending criminal case in this exchange:\n\nQ: Did you tell her you were in jail because you were charged with felonious assault and aggravated robbery?\n\nMR. BOMBIK: Objection, your Honor.\n\nA: I didn\u2019t tell her, she \u2013\n\nTHE COURT: Objection sustained.\n\nQ: Is that right?\n\nMR. BOMBIK: Objection, your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: Objection sustained.\n\nQ: You do have a pending criminal case, do you not?\n\nA: Do I got a pending criminal case?\nQ: That\u2019s not that difficult a question, is it?\nA: I got a case that they say I did, you know.\nQ: I mean, is the case over with?\nA: Nah.\nQ: It\u2019s still pending, still active, right?\nA: Pending, active, yeah. Yes, I do have a pending criminal case.\nQ: And you hope to get some help on that case by your testimony in this case, right?\nA: Nothing to do with this case.\nQ: The same prosecutor\u2019s offices [sic] is going to be after you in that case, isn\u2019t it?\nA: I don\u2019t know. How many prosecutor\u2019s office is there? I don\u2019t know. If they\u2019re a prosecutor for the State, I guess so.\nQ: Same police department?\nA: I don\u2019t know.\nQ: Now, how many police departments are there?\nA: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know who is going to be investigating.\nQ: One of the items they charged you with having is a ski mask; isn\u2019t that correct.\n\nMR. GHAZOUl: Objection.\nMR. BOMBIK: Objection.\nTHE COURT: Objection sustained. I instructed you not to address that, Mr. Mancino.\n\nThe jury is instructed to disregard all of that.\n\n(Id. at 151-52.)\nMack is correct that the trial court limited defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Willis on the subject of the Burgess case and any agreement with prosecutors regarding his testimony against Mack. But the court did not preclude any \u201cmeaningful\u201d or \u201ceffective\u201d impeachment of Willis\u2019 trial testimony, as Mack asserts. (Doc. 162 at 146-48.) The jury understood, through the defense\u2019s cross-examination of Willis, that Willis had been imprisoned and charged in a criminal matter and had a motive to testify against Mack, standing to benefit significantly by cooperating with the prosecution. Thus, it \u201cwould arguably have been more effective if evidence of the [alleged] mutual understanding [with the prosecutor] had been disclosed prior to trial, but only incrementally so.\u201d Akrawi v. Booker, 572 F.3d 252, 264 (6th Cir. 2009) (emphasis in original) (holding that where the jury heard evidence of the potential for a charge-reduction deal, the failure of the prosecution to disclose an informal agreement with a witness did not meet the prejudice prong of the Brady analysis); see also Jefferson v. United States, 730 F.3d 537, 553 (6th Cir. 2013) (finding any undisclosed agreement with prosecutors would have been cumulative where witness admitted to having pending criminal charges against him and the jury understood he may benefit from cooperating); Bell v. Bell, 512 F.3d 223, 237 (6th Cir. 2008) (holding that, although prosecutor\u2019s notes from meeting with government witness would have provided support for defense theory that witness, who had been jailed with defendant and thus was not credible witness, defense counsel was able to challenge the witness\u2019 credibility without those notes during closing arguments, and therefore meeting notes were not material under Brady); Williams v. Coyle, 260 F.3d 684, 708 (6th Cir. 2001) (noting \u201cthe jury knew of this reason to question the veracity of [the witnesses\u2019] testimony\u201d\nand that \u201cknowledge of the existence of an actual deal prior to deliberation would [not] have given the jury a greater reason to question the veracity of [the witnesses\u2019] testimony\u201d \u2013 \u201c[a]t least, not to the level that not knowing undermines confidence in the outcome\u201d).\n\nEvidence of a tacit deal between Willis and prosecutors, therefore, in which Willis obtained leniency in the Burgess case for his cooperation in the Sanelli cases \u2013 if such a deal took place \u2013 would not have significantly bolstered defense counsel\u2019s efforts to undermine Willis\u2019 credibility with the jury such that the inclusion of the withheld evidence would have put case the whole case in a different light so as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\n\n**Strength of State\u2019s case.** Finally, even if one accepts Mack\u2019s argument that the Sanelli notes and deal evidence would have severely impugned Willis\u2019 credibility, that evidence \u201cmay not be material if the State\u2019s other evidence is strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict.\u201d *Smith*, 565 U.S. at 76 (citing *Agurs*, 427 U.S. at 112-13, & n. 21). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in *Beuke v. Houk*, supra, is instructive. Like Mack, the petitioner in *Beuke* argued that undisclosed impeachment evidence was material because the prosecution\u2019s proof of the murder at issue depended on the credibility of that witness\u2019 testimony, who recounted for the jury the story the petitioner told him about how he committed the murder at issue. *Beuke*, 537 F.3d at 635. The circuit court first found that the impeachment evidence related to \u201cinconsistencies on tangential issues\u201d and would not have \u201cdo[ne] much to undermine [the witnesses\u2019] testimony relating to [the petitioner\u2019s] confession.\u201d *Id.* But even if it had, the court reasoned, the prosecution had presented other \u201cconcrete\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d evidence in addition to the witness\u2019 testimony, linking the\npetitioner to the crime, including, as here, forensic evidence indicating that the bullets removed from the victim\u2019s body were fired from the petitioner\u2019s gun. *Id.* at 635-36. The court found, therefore, that, \u201ccontrary to [the petitioner\u2019s] assertions, [the witness\u2019] testimony was not the central piece of evidence holding together an otherwise feeble case, but was merely one piece of a cumulative evidentiary puzzle.\u201d *Id.* at 636. And it held that \u201cbecause the objective evidence sufficiently linked [the petitioner] to [the] murder, the suppressed evidence undermining [the witness\u2019] credibility [did] not tend to undermine our confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d *Id.*\n\nSimilarly, here, the State\u2019s case against Mack was neither weak nor entirely reliant on Willis\u2019 testimony, as Mack contends. The State\u2019s strongest evidence: the gun found in Mack\u2019s possession when he was arrested fired the bullets recovered in Mr. Sanelli\u2019s clothing. The state appellate court on direct review provided this summary of the State\u2019s physical evidence:\n\nThe evidence presented at trial established that Peter Sanelli was shot while seated in the driver's seat of his car. The evidence also demonstrated that the front driver's side window and the back passenger window were shattered and missing following the robbery. Additionally, ballistic tests revealed that the gun confiscated from Clarence Mack fired three of the four spent nine millimeter shell casings recovered from the murder scene. The ballistic tests also revealed that the gun confiscated from Clarence Mack two days after the murder fired the copper jacketed pellet which was removed from the right shoulder area of the murder victim's inner clothing. The autopsy of Peter Sanelli revealed that he sustained three gunshot wounds to the upper left side of his body. The coroner testified that the bullet which exited the victim's right shoulder area caused the most significant internal damage by perforating the victim's lung and the sack which surrounds the heart. It is thus apparent that the bullet recovered from the murder victim's inner clothing caused the most significant internal damage and was fired by the gun confiscated from Mack.\n\nMoreover, the coroner's testimony also established that the other gunshot wound to the victim's left shoulder was simply a flesh wound and the gunshot\nwound to the left side of the victim's face only struck the victim's left and right jaw and larynx. Significantly, there is no indication that the bullet which caused the facial wound impacted or damaged the victim's brain or any other vital body parts.\n\nMack, 1993 WL 497052, at *19. (See also Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 264-65 (Horval Test.); Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 21-26, 34 (Lucey Test.).)\n\nMack\u2019s statement also strengthened the State\u2019s case. Detective Qualey, who interviewed Mack after he was arrested, testified that when Mack was initially questioned, he said that he purchased the gun found in his possession on January 22, 1991, the day after Mr. Sanelli\u2019s murder, from someone whose name he did not know, and he was home taking a bath the night of the murder. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 193-94.) However, when Qualey confronted Mack with the fact that the ballistic tests revealed that the gun found in his possession was involved in the shooting, Mack stated he loaned his gun to someone named Dee, whose address and real name he did not know, \u201ca couple days\u201d before the murder and noticed it had been fired but did not ask the person why. (Id. at 195-97.) And Mack\u2019s own witnesses contradicted his story. Defense witness John Scott testified that Mack bought the gun from Willis the day after the murder. (Doc. 150-4 (Trial Tr.) at 8 (Scott Test.).) And Demill Blue testified that Mack was at her house the night of the murder. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 228-32 (Blue Test.).)\n\nFinally, Willis\u2019 testimony was corroborated by other evidence adduced at trial on key points. Willis testified that, after the time of the murder, he saw Sowell and Mack driving a small, silver, \u201clittle mini station wagon,\u201d with the driver\u2019s side and rear passenger\u2019s windows broken out and red license plates. (Id. at 71-72.) Detective Allen testified that Mr. Sanelli\u2019s abandoned, damaged car was a light blue small car (a Horizon)\nwith the driver\u2019s side and rear passenger\u2019s windows broken out and red licence plates.\n\n(Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 210-11.) Willis testified that when he saw Sowell and Mack after the murder, Sowell was wearing a black Bulls starter jacket the night of the murder. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 73.) Sowell was arrested at work, wearing a black Bulls starter jacket with a nail in the pocket that matched nails found in Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car when it was recovered. (Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 295-97 (Bornfeld Test.).) Willis also said Sowell was handling a pair of binoculars in a pouch when he saw him that night. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 76.) Tony Sanelli testified that his father always kept a pair of binoculars in his car. (Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 167.) Lastly, Willis testified that Mack told him Sowell crashed Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car into a pole. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 79.) Detective Allen testified that Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car was discovered abandoned and damaged from apparently crashing into a nearby pole. (Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 210-11.)\n\nThe record, therefore, belies Mack\u2019s contention that the State had a weak case, hinging entirely on Willis\u2019 credibility. And the prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose the Sanelli notes and evidence of an agreement between Mack and the prosecutors relating to his testimony, if such an agreement existed, did not prejudice Mack in his ability to impeach Willis to the extent that it undermines confidence in Mack\u2019s conviction or sentence. See Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 293-94 (1999) (refusing to find prejudice where the record contained \u201cconsiderable forensic and other physical evidence linking petitioner to the crime,\u201d because this objective evidence indicated that the \u201cpetitioner would have been convicted . . ., even if [the witness] had been severely impeached\u201d by the undisclosed evidence); cf. Kyles, 514 U.S. at 441, 453 (finding Brady materiality satisfied where, unlike\nhere, the physical evidence was \u201cinconclusive,\u201d so \u201cthe essence of the State\u2019s case\u2019 was the testimony of eyewitnesses\u201d); *Wearry v. Cain*, 577 U.S. 385, 392-93 (2016) (finding prejudice \u201c[b]eyond doubt\u201d where \u201c[t]he State\u2019s trial evidence resembles a house of cards, built on the jury crediting Scott\u2019s account rather than Wearry\u2019s alibi\u201d); *Smith*, 565 U.S. at 76 (undisclosed statements of eyewitness that he \u201ccould not ID anyone because [he] couldn\u2019t see faces\u201d and \u201cwould not know them if [he] saw them\u201d were \u201cplainly material\u201d where his testimony was the \u201conly evidence\u201d linking defendant to the crime and the statement \u201cdirectly contradict[ed] his testimony\u201d); *Banks v. Dretke*, 540 U.S. 668, 701 (2004) (witness\u2019 undisclosed informant status was \u201cmaterial\u201d where witness gave \u201ccritical\u201d and \u201cuncorroborated\u201d testimony); *Giglio v. United States*, 405 U.S. 150,154-55 (1972) (where prosecution \u201cdepended almost entirely\u201d on witness\u2019 testimony, government\u2019s undisclosed promise of immunity to witness was \u201cmaterial\u201d); *Bies v. Sheldon*, 775 F.3d 386, 401 (6th Cir. 2014) (noting materiality of the undisclosed evidence \u201cbecomes even more apparent when viewed in light of the paltry evidence that the State did present[,]\u201d especially with no physical evidence linking the petitioner to the crime); *Jamison v. Collins*, 291 F.3d 380, 391 (6th Cir. 2002) (finding prejudice where, unlike here, the undisclosed evidence would have impeached vital prosecution testimony, leaving only one piece of highly suspect physical evidence upon which to base the conviction).\n\n2. **Exculpatory value of Brady material**\n\nMack argues that the Sanelli notes also would have provided potent exculpatory evidence to support, or lead to other evidence that would have supported, either: (1) his theory of defense at trial, that he had an alibi that he was elsewhere and had nothing to do\nwith the crime, and Willis set him up either because Willis committed the murder alone or with someone else, such as Sowell; (2) an alternative defense that Sowell was the lone assailant; or (3) a defense to capital punishment that even if Mack were involved in the crime, he was an \u201cunwitting accomplice\u201d and not the actual shooter or principal offender. (See, e.g., Doc. 162 at 139, 142, 145, 149, 155.)\n\nMack asserts the Sanelli notes would have been critical exculpatory evidence because they show Willis mentioned only Sowell as participating in the crime, made several references to a lone \u201cman,\u201d and state that \u201che left clip in the car.\u201d (Id. at 139.) As discussed above, however, the notes actually were ambiguous regarding the number of participants in the crime; Willis named Mack and Germany as perpetrators in the Sanelli murder soon after meeting with the Sanelli family and afterward remained consistent on that fact; and much of the information in the notes was also contained in Willis\u2019 statement to the police, which was available to the defense and cumulative to evidence adduced at trial.\n\nThe police report that someone moved Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car after it crashed on Holton Avenue is similarly weak. As the state court noted, the fact that someone moved the car\u2014whether it was Sowell, Willis, or someone else\u2014does little to prove that person\u2019s involvement in the Sanelli murder at all, much less that person\u2019s specific role in the murder. Cf. Bies, 775 F.3d at 400 (\u201cOn its face, the nondisclosure of the identities of the other suspects\u2014two of whom were reported to have confessed to the murder\u2014was an egregious breach of the State\u2019s Brady obligations.\u201d).\n\nMoreover, the Supreme Court has rejected Mack\u2019s argument that the Brady\nmateriality standard should focus on the impact of the undisclosed evidence on the defendant\u2019s ability to prepare for trial, rather than the materiality of the evidence to the issue of guilt or innocence. *United States v. Agurs*, 427 U.S. 97, 112 n.20 (1976). Such an approach, it explained, \u201cwould primarily involve an analysis of the adequacy of the notice given to the defendant by the State, and it has always been the Court\u2019s view that the notice component of due process refers to the charge rather than the evidentiary support for the charge.\u201d *Id.*\n\nAt the same time, Mack\u2019s defense was weak. He presented several witnesses: Sowell\u2019s girlfriend, Demill Blue, who testified that Mack was at her house the time of the murder (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 228-32); Johnny Scott, Mack\u2019s sister\u2019s boyfriend, who testified that he knew Willis well and Willis owned many guns, which they frequently shot together on Willis\u2019 property (Doc. 150-4 (Trial Tr.) at 2-3); Barbara Lackey, Mack\u2019s girlfriend, who testified that Willis was looking for Mack the day after the murder (*id.* at 43-44); and Curtis Mack, Mack\u2019s cousin and Germany\u2019s brother, who testified that Willis kept many guns in his house and regularly sold them (*id.* at 84-86). None of these witnesses offered strong evidence supporting Mack\u2019s alibi or Willis\u2019 involvement in the murder, and the Sanelli notes and Holton Avenue crash information would not have helped in any significant way.\n\nSimilarly unpersuasive is Mack\u2019s argument that this evidence would have prompted defense counsel to pursue a theory at his sentencing hearing that even if Mack were present at the shooting, he was only an unwitting accomplice and not the actual killer or principal offender \u2013 even when reviewed *de novo*. There was evidence introduced at trial to support\nthis argument. Willis testified that Sowell admitted he shot Mr. Sanelli first through \u201cthe\nglass\u201d because Mr. Sanelli would not get out of the car, and Sowell was driving Mr.\nSanelli\u2019s car after the murder, suggesting Sowell fired the fatal shots through the driver\u2019s\nside window at Mr. Sanelli. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 71-76.) And the defense could have\nargued that Sowell used Mack\u2019s gun, which fired the bullets found in Mr. Sanelli\u2019s body\nand clothes, and Mack used Germany\u2019s gun. Mancino testified at the federal evidentiary\nhearing, however, that he never considered presenting this actual-shooter theory at trial, as\nit would have conflicted with and discredited Mack\u2019s defense that \u201che wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n(Doc. 100 (FEH Tr.) at 149-50.) And the Sanelli notes and Holton Avenue crash\ninformation would not have strengthened this principal-offender argument so much that\ndefense counsel undoubtedly would have altered their trial strategy.\n\nAccordingly, the suppressed evidence \u2013 the Sanelli notes, the evidence of a tacit\nagreement between Willis and the prosecution regarding his testimony against Mack, and\nthe police reports about Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car after it was crashed into a pole on Holton Avenue\n\u2013 could not \u201creasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to\nundermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d Kyles, 514 U.S. at 435.\n\nG. Conclusion\n\nThe Ohio court of appeals\u2019 decision rejecting Mack\u2019s post-conviction claim that the\nState suppressed material exculpatory and impeachment evidence, therefore, was neither\ncontrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, Brady, Napue, and their progeny. Nor was\nthe decision based on an unreasonable determination of fact in light of the evidence\npresented. Mack\u2019s fifth ground for relief is denied.\nIV. Sixth Ground for Relief: Unreasonable Search and Seizure\n\nMack alleges for his sixth ground for relief that the police subjected him to an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of his constitutional rights during his warrantless arrest. (Doc. 155 at 105-07.) Mack presented this claim to state courts on direct appeal, which reviewed and rejected it on the merits. See Mack, 1993 WL 497052, at *8-9. Respondent counters that this claim is not cognizable on federal habeas review. (Doc. 158 at 62.) The court agrees.\n\nIn Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465 (1976), the Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere the State has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim, a state prisoner may not be granted federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search or seizure was introduced in his trial.\u201d Id. at 494 (footnotes omitted). Powell\u2019s limitation on federal habeas relief is not jurisdictional in nature, but rests on \u201cprudential concerns counseling against the application of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule on collateral review.\u201d Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, 686 (1993). Two considerations underpin Powell\u2019s general rule against federal habeas review of Fourth Amendment claims: first, \u201cthe key purpose of federal habeas corpus is to free innocent prisoners[, and] whether an investigation violated the Fourth Amendment has no bearing on whether the defendant is guilty\u201d; and, second, \u201cexclusion is a prudential deterrent prescribed by the courts, not a personal right guaranteed by the Constitution[, so] [a]ny deterrence produced by an additional layer of habeas review is small, but the cost of undoing final convictions is great.\u201d Good v. Berghuis, 729 F.3d 636, 637 (6th Cir. 2013) (citing Powell, 428 U.S. at 490, 493).\nThe Sixth Circuit interpreted and applied *Powell* in *Good v. Berghuis*, supra. The court clarified that \u201copportunity for \u2018full and fair consideration\u2019\u201d under the *Powell* standard \u201cmeans an available avenue for the prisoner to present his claim to the state courts, not an inquiry into the adequacy of the procedure actually used to resolve that particular claim.\u201d *Good*, 729 F.3d at 639. Thus, \u201c[i]n the absence of a sham proceeding, there is no need to ask whether the state court conducted an evidentiary hearing or to inquire otherwise into the rigor of the state judiciary\u2019s procedures for resolving the claim.\u201d *Id.* Instead, federal habeas courts \u201cmust . . . presume that, once a federal claim comes before a state court, the state judge will use a fair procedure to achieve a just resolution of the claim . . . .\u201d *Id.* Applying these principles, the court held that *Powell* precluded federal habeas review of the petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim because, even though he was not granted an evidentiary hearing on his motion to suppress, he was able to present his motion to the state trial and appellate courts, which considered and rejected it. *Id.* at 640.\n\nSimilarly, here, the state courts clearly afforded Mack \u201ca full and fair consideration\u201d of his Fourth Amendment claim under *Powell*. The trial court conducted a hearing on Mack\u2019s motion to suppress on the record. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 1-38.) After hearing testimony from several witnesses and argument from the prosecution and defense, the judge denied the motion. (*Id.* at 37-38.) Mack then raised this claim on direct appeal in state courts. The state court of appeals addressed the merits of the claim and denied relief. *See Mack*, 1993 WL 497052, at *8-9. And the Ohio Supreme Court summarily affirmed the appellate court\u2019s judgment. *See Mack*, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 507, 518.\n\nMack offers no evidence, and does not even contend, that the trial court\u2019s review of\nhis suppression motion was a \u201csham proceeding.\u201d Good, 739 F.3d at 639. Because Mack received a full and fair consideration of his Fourth Amendment claim by the state courts, this claim is not cognizable on federal habeas review. Powell, 428 U.S. at 494. Mack\u2019s sixth ground for relief, therefore, is denied.\n\nV. Seventh Ground for Relief: Right to Remain Silent\n\nFor his seventh ground for relief, Mack contends that he was denied his constitutional right against self-incrimination. (Doc. 155 at 107-11.) Mack raised this claim in state courts on direct appeal and it is preserved for federal habeas review. See Mack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 512-14. Respondent argues the claim lacks merit. (Doc. 158 at 63-65.)\n\nThe last state court to review this claim, the Ohio Supreme Court, opined:\n\nIn his ninth proposition of law, appellant claims he was denied his constitutional right against self-incrimination as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. His contention rests on the failure of investigators fully to re-administer the Miranda warnings to him at the outset of a second interview, where the first interview preceded the second by a relatively short period of time and the investigators fully informed appellant of his Miranda rights at the beginning of the first interview. For the following reasons we find appellant's claim to be without merit.\n\nIn Miranda v. Arizona (1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, the United States Supreme Court enunciated the standards by which custodial police interrogations are to be conducted in order to safeguard defendants' rights under the Constitution. The purpose of the Miranda warnings is \u201cto dissipate the compulsion [by police] inherent in custodial interrogation and, in so doing, guard against abridgment of suspect's Fifth Amendment rights.\u201d Moran v. Burbine (1986), 475 U.S. 412, 425, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 1143, 89 L.Ed.2d 410, 421. The threshold requirement of Miranda is that the suspect must be informed in clear and unequivocal terms that he has the right to remain silent. 384 U.S. at 467\u2013468, 86 S.Ct. at 1624, 16 L.Ed.2d at 719. Only after such warning may a suspect be deemed capable of \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d waiving his rights and agreeing to answer questions or make a statement. Id. at\n479, 86 S.Ct. at 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d at 726.\n\nAppellant here takes issue with investigators' failure fully to readminister the *Miranda* warnings before beginning interrogation for a second time. On January 23, 1991, appellant was transported after his arrest by Detective Qualey and Lt. James to an interview room in the Homicide Unit in the Justice Center. Detective Qualey informed appellant of his *Miranda* rights and asked him if he understood those rights, to which he responded in the affirmative. Thereafter Lt. James began to question appellant and Detective Qualey took notes. Appellant answered voluntarily, stating that he did not know anything about the death of Peter Sanelli. The interview lasted approximately forty-five minutes to one hour.\n\nAfter returning appellant to his cell, Detective Qualey received the ballistics report from the forensic laboratory matching the morgue bullet recovered from the victim and the shell casings found at the crime scene with the gun confiscated from appellant. With this new information in hand, Detective Qualey and Lt. James brought appellant back to the Homicide Unit to resume questioning approximately one-half hour to one hour after the first interview had ended. Without explicitly reciting the *Miranda* warnings again, Detective Qualey asked appellant if he understood his rights and he said yes. When confronted with the new evidence, appellant provided a brief explanation and denied any involvement in the killing of Peter Sanelli. Questioning ceased soon thereafter when appellant made a request for counsel, and he was returned to his cell. The second interview lasted approximately thirty minutes.\n\nAppellant's contention that he was denied his right against self-incrimination is not borne out by the facts. After being read his *Miranda* rights, appellant voluntarily submitted to questioning by Detective Qualey and Lt. James. When the interview ended, appellant had yet to invoke his right to silence or to counsel. When Detective Qualey and Lt. James sought to resume questioning they asked appellant, again, if he understood his rights, and again appellant answered in the affirmative and voluntarily answered questions.\n\nMoreover, the cases give no indication of a requirement upon police to re-administer the *Miranda* warnings, when questioning a suspect again after a relatively short period of time. In fact, the time between the first and second interviews in question is significantly shorter than that sustained in other cases. See, e.g., *Stumes v. Solem* (C.A.8, 1985), 752 F.2d 317 (five hours); *Evans v. McCotter* (C.A.5, 1986), 790 F.2d 1232 (one to one and one-half hours).\n\nAccordingly, we reject appellant's ninth proposition of law.\n\n*Mack*, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 512-14.\nThe Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is implicated whenever an individual is \u201ctaken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning . . . .\u201d *Miranda v. Arizona*, 384 U.S. 436, 478 (1966). Because custodial interrogations are said to be inherently coercive, *Miranda* established that a suspect must be apprised of certain rights to protect the privilege against self-incrimination, including the right to remain silent. *Id.* at 444.\n\nA suspect may waive his *Miranda* rights, however, \u201cprovided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d *Id.* \u201cEven absent the accused\u2019s invocation of the right to remain silent, the accused\u2019s statement during a custodial interrogation is inadmissible at trial unless the prosecution can establish that the accused \u2018in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived [Miranda] rights\u2019 when making the statement.\u201d *Berghuis v. Thompkins*, 560 U.S. 370, 382 (2010) (quoting *North Carolina v. Butler*, 441 U.S. 369, 373 (1979)). The prosecution must establish waiver by a preponderance of the evidence. *Id.* at 384 (citing *Colorado v. Connelly*, 479 U.S. 157, 168 (1986)).\n\n\u201cThe waiver inquiry \u2018has two distinct dimensions\u2019: waiver must be \u2018voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception,\u2019 and \u2018made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u2019\u201d *Id.* at 382-83 (quoting *Moran v. Burbine*, 475 U.S. 412, 421 (1986)). Coercive police activity \u201cis a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary\u2019 . . . .\u201d *Connelly*, 479 U.S. at 167. Whether a defendant has waived his *Miranda* rights and \u201cvoluntarily\u201d confessed cannot rest on his state of mind alone. *Id.* at 165. The second prong of the\nMiranda inquiry focuses not on whether the \u201ccriminal suspect [knew] and [understood] every possible consequence of a waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege[,]\u201d but on whether the \u201csuspect [knew] that he [could] choose not to talk to law enforcement officers, to talk only with counsel present, or to discontinue talking at any time.\u201d Colorado v. Spring, 479 U.S. 564, 574 (1987).\n\n\u201cOnly if the \u2018totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u2019 reveal both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the Miranda rights have been waived.\u201d Burbine, 475 U.S. at 421 (quoting Fare v. Michael C., 442 U.S. 707, 725 (1979)). Courts must examine \u201cthe particular facts and circumstances surrounding [the] case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused.\u201d Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464 (1938).\n\nThe prosecution, therefore, does not need to show that a waiver of Miranda rights was express. Thompkins, 560 U.S. at 384. \u201cAn \u2018implicit waiver\u2019 of the \u2018right to remain silent\u2019 is sufficient to admit a suspect\u2019s statement into evidence.\u201d Id. (citing Butler, 441 U.S. at 376). A waiver of Miranda rights may be implied through the defendant\u2019s silence, as long as the defendant understands his rights and his conduct indicates waiver. Id.\n\nMack first contends the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision was based on unreasonable factual determinations that: (1) the police officers read him his Miranda rights, which Mack denies ever happened; and (2) Mack made a statement to them during the second interview, which Mack claims was untrue and \u201cmanufactured by the police.\u201d (Doc. 162 at 169-70.) But Mack offers no clear and convincing evidence of this, only conclusory assertions.\nDetective Qualey testified under oath that before his initial questioning of Mack he read Mack his *Miranda* rights and Mack stated that he understood and agreed to talk to him and another office; and before the second interview he asked Mack if he still understood his rights, and Mack said he did. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 173-75.) Furthermore, Mack\u2019s testimony at the trial court\u2019s hearing on his motion to suppress his statements supports the state court\u2019s finding that Mack\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary. Mack admitted on cross-examination that he had heard *Miranda* rights before on at least three occasions. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 186.) And he conceded that, although he knew and understood his rights, he continued to talk to the officers and was never coerced. Mack testified:\n\nQ: So you knew that you had the right to remain silent when Lt. James and Detective Qualey interviewed you? You knew that from past experience, you\u2019ve known that, correct?\n\nMrs. Mancino: Objection.\n\nThe Court: Overruled.\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And nonetheless, you did as Detective Qualey testified a few minutes ago, he and Lt. James sat down with you in the Homicide Unit and asked you questions and you gave them answers to various questions that they asked, correct?\n\nA: Lieutenant James asked me questions.\n\nQ: Oh, okay. And Detective Qualey is jotting down perhaps your answers to those questions. Is that a fair statement?\n\nA: To the questions I knew the answers to, yes.\n\nQ: Well he was jotting something down right on his little note pad?\n\nA: Yeah.\nQ: You weren\u2019t coerced to make a statement, were you? Did he hit you or threaten to hit you or anything along those lines, did they?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: You weren\u2019t under the influence of any alcohol or drugs at the time, were you?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Clear-headed, clear-minded, so to speak?\n\nA: Well I was kind of confused because I didn\u2019t really understand what was going on and everything that had took place and what they was accusing me of.\n\nQ: But you did talk to them?\n\nA: Yes, I talked to them.\n\nQ: The only item of dispute here is you contend they did not advise you of your constitutional rights?\n\nA: Yes.\n\n(Id. at 186-87.) Mack further demonstrated that he understood those rights when he invoked his right to silence and counsel in this exchange:\n\nQ: And how long did the second interview last?\n\nA: It didn\u2019t last long because I told them that I had wanted my attorney here. So they cancelled the interview then.\n\nQ: And then you were brought back to the cell?\n\nA: Yes.\n\n(Id. at 185.)\n\nBased on this record, the state court reasonably affirmed the trial court\u2019s findings that the police officers administered *Miranda* rights to Mack; Mack knowingly, voluntarily,\nand intelligently waived those rights before providing statements to the officers; and the detectives recorded Mack\u2019s statements and later included them in a police report.\n\nMack also argues that the Ohio Supreme Court unreasonably concluded that Mack\u2019s rights were not violated when the officers did not fully administer the *Miranda* warnings before resuming their interview with Mack. As the state court explained, however, there is no legal authority, much less Supreme Court precedent, requiring police \u201cto re-administer the *Miranda* warnings, when questioning a suspect again after a relatively short period of time.\u201d *Mack*, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 514. Indeed, as the state court noted, many circuit courts have found such warnings uncalled for even when the time between the first and second interviews was longer than in this case. *Id.* (citing *Stumes v. Solem*, 752 F.2d 317 (8th Cir. 1985) (five hours); *Evans v. McCotter*, 790 F.2d 1232 (5th Cir. 1986) (one to one and one-half hours)).\n\nAs Mack argues, however, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in *Wyrick v. Fields*, 459 U.S. 42 (1982) (per curiam), controls. (Doc. 162 at 169-70.) In that case, the petitioner, who had been criminally charged but released from custody and was represented by counsel, requested a polygraph examination at which, after receiving *Miranda* warnings, he had expressly waived his right to have counsel present. *Fields*, 459 U.S. at 44. At the conclusion of the test, which took less than two hours, the agent who administered the test\n\n---\n\n19 Respondent further cites as support for this proposition: *United States ex rel. Patton v. Thieret*, 791 F.2d 543, 547-48 (7th Cir. 1986) (forty minutes); *Jarrell v. Balkcom*, 735 F.2d 1242, 1254 (11th Cir. 1984) (three hours); *United States ex rel. Henne v. Fike*, 563 F.2d 809, 814 (7th Cir. 1977) (nine hours); *United States v. Anthony*, 474 F.2d 770, 773 (5th Cir. 1973) (\u201cThere is no requirement that an accused be continually reminded of his rights once he has intelligently waived them[.]\u201d). (Doc. 158 at 65.)\ntold the petitioner that the test indicated some deceit and asked him if he would like to explain why. *Id.* In response, the petitioner made an incriminating statement. *Id.* at 44-45. The agent asked him if he would like to discuss it further with other authorities and the petitioner again agreed. *Id.* at 45. These officers then read him the *Miranda* warnings again, and the petitioner repeated his incriminating statement. *Id.* The trial court denied the petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the statements on the ground that he had waived his right to counsel. *Id.* The state courts affirmed that ruling, as did the district court on habeas review. *Id.* The Eighth Circuit, however, reversed, holding that, while the petitioner had waived his right to have counsel present at the polygraph examination, he did not knowingly and intelligently waive that right at the \u201cpost-test\u201d interrogation because the authorities did not re-administer \u201cmeaningfully timed *Miranda* warnings.\u201d *Id.* at 46-47 (quoting *Fields v. Wyrick*, 682 F.2d 154, 160 (8th Cir. 1982) (emphasis in original)).\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed. It found that by requesting the polygraph examination, the petitioner not only waived his right to have counsel present at that test, but he \u201cinitiated interrogation\u201d by requesting the test and thereby validly waived his right to have counsel present at \u2018post-test\u2019 questioning under *Edwards v. Arizona*, 451 U.S. 477, 484-87 (1981). *Fields*, 459 U.S. at 45-47. *Edwards* holds that \u201conce a suspect invokes his right to counsel, he may not be subjected to further interrogation until counsel is provided unless the suspect himself initiates dialogue with the authorities.\u201d *Id.* at 45-46. The Court noted, however, that the case presented a further issue of more relevance here: whether, in examining the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d as required under *Edwards*, the court found that \u201cthe circumstances changed so seriously that [the petitioner\u2019s] answers no longer were\nvoluntary, or unless he no longer was making a \u2018knowing and intelligent relinquishment or abandonment\u2019 of his rights.\u201d *Id.* at 47 (quoting *Edwards*, 451 U.S. at 482). The Court rejected the circuit court\u2019s belief that \u201cthe use of polygraph \u2018results\u2019 in questioning, although it does not necessarily render a response involuntary, is inherently coercive.\u201d *Id.* at 48. Instead, the Court recognized the petitioner\u2019s \u201cvoluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of the right to have counsel present at a polygraph examination, and . . . clear evidence that the suspect understood that right and was aware of his power to stop questioning at any time or to speak to an attorney at any time\u201d during questioning after the test. *Id.* \u201cMerely disconnecting the polygraph equipment,\u201d it remarked, \u201ccould not remove this knowledge from [the petitioner\u2019s] mind.\u201d *Id.*\n\nMack distinguishes *Fields* on the ground that in his case, the detectives\u2019 second interview of him occurred under \u201cdrastically changed circumstance[s]\u201d: the ballistics test results recast him as the \u201cprincipal suspect\u201d in the Sanelli murder. (Doc. 162 at 170.) \u201cConfronting Mack in such an unguarded fashion,\u201d he contends, \u201cwas precisely the type of confrontation that would cause a reasonable person to forget the rights of which he had (supposedly) only recently been advised.\u201d (*Id.*) The police, therefore, according to Mack, had a duty to repeat the *Miranda* warnings before questioning him. (*Id.*)\n\nThis court disagrees. In examining the circumstances of Mack\u2019s two-part interrogation, it is apparent that when the examination resumed, the circumstances had not \u201cchanged so seriously that [Mack\u2019s] answers no longer were voluntary, or . . . he no longer was making a \u2018knowing and intelligent relinquishment or abandonment\u2019 of his rights.\u201d *Fields*, 459 U.S. at 47. As in *Fields*, Mack was administered full *Miranda* warnings at the\nonset of his interview and it was clear he understood them, especially given his criminal history and prior experience with *Miranda* warnings. When the interview resumed less than an hour later, he was asked if he understood his rights and he said yes. After being informed of the results of the ballistics tests, Mack again voluntarily talked to the detectives. He testified that he was not coerced, and he understood his rights well enough to terminate the questioning and request counsel. The thirty to sixty minutes that lapsed before the detectives\u2019 second examination of Mack, therefore, \u201cwould not have caused him to forget the rights of which he had been advised and which he had understood [less than an hour] before.\u201d *Id.* at 49. Mack\u2019s waiver of his right to remain silent at the start of the first part of his examination remained valid throughout the second part.\n\nAccordingly, the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision rejecting Mack\u2019s *Miranda* claim was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of *Miranda, Fields*, or any other Supreme Court precedent, and was not based on unreasonable determinations of fact in light of the evidence presented.\n\nVI. Eighth Ground for Relief: *Grand Jury Transcript*\n\nFor his eighth ground for relief, Mack claims that the trial court violated his right to due process when it denied his motion for disclosure of the grand jury transcript of State witness Timothy Willis\u2019 testimony. (Doc. 155 at 111.) Respondent contends this claim does not warrant relief in federal habeas. (Doc. 158 at 66-67.)\n\nMack presented this claim on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, which reviewed the merits of the claim and denied relief. *See Mack*, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 507-09. The state high court, citing only Ohio law, found that Mack had not established a\nparticularized need for the grand jury testimony. *Id.* \u201c[A] state court\u2019s interpretation of state law, including one announced on direct appeal of the challenged conviction, binds a federal court sitting in habeas corpus.\u201d *Bradshaw v. Richey*, 546 U.S. 74, 76 (2005).\n\nMoreover, Mack has identified no clearly established Supreme Court precedent that the Ohio Supreme Court either contravened or misapplied under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) in rejecting this claim. *See Coley v. Bagley*, 706 F.3d 701, 752-53 (6th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[Petitioner] does not meet his burden of proving that state court rejection of his claim [based on trial court\u2019s rejection of his motion to disclose grand jury transcripts] was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent.\u201d) (citing *Cullen v. Pinholster*, 131 S. Ct. 1388, 1398 (2011)).\n\nAccordingly, Mack\u2019s eighth ground for relief is denied.\n\n**VII. Ninth through Twelfth Grounds for Relief: Trial-Court Evidentiary Rulings**\n\nMack argues in his ninth through twelfth grounds for relief that the trial court violated his constitutional rights through several evidentiary rulings. Specifically, he claims the trial court erred when it: (1) excluded the testimony of Carole Mancino and Curtis Mack, who were prepared to testify about the State\u2019s key witness, Timothy Willis\u2019, bias and prior inconsistent statements (ground nine); (2) did not permit a meaningful cross-examination of Willis (ground ten); (3) admitted hearsay testimony of Dr. Robert Challener (ground eleven); (4) admitted Tony Sanelli\u2019s out-of-court statements to Willis (ground eleven); (5) permitted Detective Edward Lucey to testify as an expert (ground eleven); (6) admitted Willis\u2019 testimony about hearsay statements made to him (ground eleven); and (7) admitted gruesome photographs (ground twelve). (Doc. 155 at 112-25.) Respondent\ncontends two of these claims are procedurally defaulted and they are all meritless. (Doc. 158 at 68-73.)\n\nA. Procedural Posture\n\nRespondent argues that sub-claims (2) and (6), as listed above, are procedurally defaulted. (Id. at 69, 71.) The court agrees. Mack did not raise these claims on direct appeal, and because they are record-based, Mack is barred by Ohio\u2019s res judicata rule from raising the issues in any state post-conviction proceeding, and the claims are procedurally defaulted.\n\nMack counters that he fairly presented these claims to state courts in an application to reopen his direct appeal pursuant to Ohio Appellate Rule 26(B) as the underlying grounds of claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, or the claims are exempt from AEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement under \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(B) because Rule 26(B) does not provide an adequate corrective process for redressing constitutional violations. (Doc. 162 at 34-67, 104-07, 180, 182.) See also Mack, 2003 WL 21185786, at *9. As explained in this court\u2019s discussion of grounds one and two, the court has rejected both of these arguments in a previous ruling (see Doc. 115 at 16-22). Sub-claims (2) and (6) are procedurally defaulted. Moreover, as will be explained below in relation to Mack\u2019s separate and independent claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel and actual innocence, Mack has not demonstrated cause and prejudice for the defaulted claims.\n\nMack raised the remaining evidentiary claims on direct appeal in state courts, which adjudicated and denied them. See Mack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 507, 510-12, 514-15. These claims are preserved for federal habeas review.\nB. Merits Analysis\n\nRegardless of any procedural default, each of these claims also would fail on their merits. As a general rule, to the extent Mack\u2019s claims allege violations of Ohio evidentiary law, they are not cognizable on federal habeas review. See, e.g., Moreland v. Bradshaw, 699 F.3d 908, 923 (6th Cir. 2012) (generally, \u201calleged errors in evidentiary rulings by state courts are not cognizable in federal habeas review.\u201d). Federal habeas courts presume that state courts correctly interpret state law in their evidentiary rulings. Small v. Brigano, No. 04-3328, 2005 WL 1432898, at *5 (6th Cir. June 17, 2005). Their review of state-court evidentiary rulings, therefore, \u201cis limited to whether [a petitioner] can demonstrate a violation of his federal constitutional rights.\u201d Haliym v. Mitchell, 492 F.3d 680, 700 (6th Cir. 2007) (citing Bell v. Arn, 536 F.2d 123, 125 (6th Cir. 1976)).\n\nState-court evidentiary rulings may \u201crise to the level of due process violations [if] they \u2018offend[] some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\u2019\u201d Seymour v. Walker, 224 F.3d 542, 552 (6th Cir. 2000) (quoting Montana v. Egelhoff, 518 U.S. 37, 43 (1996)). But they must be \u201cso egregious that [they] result in a denial of fundamental fairness.\u201d Bugh v. Mitchell, 329 F.3d 496, 512 (6th Cir. 2003). Courts, therefore, \u201c\u2018have defined the category of infractions that violate \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 very narrowly.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Wright v. Dallman, 999 F.2d 174, 178 (6th Cir. 1993)).\n\n1. Exclusion of defense witnesses\u2019 proffered testimony\n\nMack first argues that the trial court erred by not permitting one of his trial attorneys, Carole Mancino, and cousin, Curtis Mack, to testify about prior inconsistent\nstatements made by State witness Timothy Willis. Carole Mancino would have testified that when she interviewed Willis while he was in jail, he told her: \u201c\u2018he can\u2019t believe Clarence [Mack] would do anything like this\u2019\u201d; he did not see Mack on the day of the murder; he did not call the police the day they arrested Mack near his house \u2013 they came to his house that day because his phone line may have been tapped, as the police suspected his van was involved in one of the ski-mask homicides; and he \u201c\u2018can make [his] statements fit into any story anyone wants to hear.\u2019\u201d (Doc. 155 at 114 (quoting Doc. 150-4 (Trial Tr.) at 122-26 (Proffered Mancino Test.)).) Curtis Mack would have testified that Willis admitted to him that Mack did not murder Mr. Sanelli; he (Willis) did. (Id. at 115.)\n\nThe last state court to address this claim, the Ohio Supreme Court on direct appeal, opined:\n\nIn his tenth proposition of law, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to allow the defense to introduce extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a key state witness. Appellant contends the trial court's refusal inhibited his ability to impeach the testimony of the witness and, therefore, effectively denied his right to a fair trial. We disagree.\n\nIn an effort to impeach the testimony of the state's witness, Timothy Willis, appellant sought to introduce extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statements made by Willis at different times to Carole Mancino, co-counsel for appellant, and Curtis Mack, cousin of appellant. Appellant proffered the testimony of both Mancino and Curtis Mack, after the trial court refused to allow them to testify.\n\nEvid.R. 613(B) states: \u201cExtrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is not admissible unless the witness is afforded a prior opportunity to explain or deny the same and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to interrogate him thereon, or the interests of justice otherwise require. * * *\u201d\n\nIn her proffer to the record, Carole Mancino testified that Willis had told her that \u201che [Willis] can't believe Clarence would do anything like this.\u201d This statement is actually consistent with those made by Willis while on the stand during the trial. Willis stated that he had told Carole Mancino that he \u201ccan't believe that Clarence would do something like this.\u201d Because there is no\ncontradiction between the statement made by Willis to Carole Mancino and his statement made on the stand, the statement is not a prior inconsistent statement and was properly excluded.\n\nCarole Mancino's proffered testimony also states that during their conversation, Willis said he didn't think he had seen Clarence Mack on the murder date. We hold that this portion of Mancino's proffered testimony was properly excluded because appellant failed to lay a proper foundation for its admission under Evid.R. 613(B). \u201cWhen extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement * * * is offered into evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 613(B), a foundation must be established through direct or cross-examination in which: (1) the witness is presented with the former statement; (2) the witness is asked whether he made the statement; (3) the witness is given an opportunity to admit, deny or explain the statement; and (4) the opposing party is given an opportunity to interrogate the witness on the inconsistent statement.\u201d State v. Theuring (1988), 46 Ohio App.3d 152, 155, 546 N.E.2d 436, 439. By examining the record, we find that Willis was never specifically asked if he had told Carole Mancino that he had not seen appellant on the day of Sanelli's murder. Willis was asked on the stand if he told Mancino that Clarence Mack had visited him at his home on the murder day. Because Willis was never specifically asked about this statement on the stand, no foundation was laid for its introduction into evidence.\n\nCarole Mancino also proffered that during their conversation, Willis had denied calling the police. During his trial testimony, Willis stated that he did not remember if he had made this statement to Mancino. While we find that Mancino's testimony to impeach Willis's ambiguous answer should have been admitted by the trial court, we also find that the trial court's exclusion of this testimony did little to prejudice Clarence Mack. There was an abundance of other credible inculpatory evidence even if the jury were to conclude that Willis did not call the police.\n\nThe statements made by Willis to Curtis Mack were also inadmissible extrinsic evidence because appellant failed to lay a proper foundation for their admission. Curtis Mack claimed that Willis had admitted murdering Peter Sanelli. Appellant, however, never asked Willis during the trial whether he had ever made this statement to Curtis Mack. Thus, a proper foundation was not laid for admission of the extrinsic evidence. We, therefore, reject appellant's tenth proposition of law.\n\nMack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 514-15.\n\nTwo justices dissented to this ruling. See id. at 516-18. As to Curtis Mack\u2019s proffered testimony, they disagreed with the majority\u2019s application of Ohio evidentiary\nrules regarding the admission of extrinsic evidence for impeachment purposes. *Id.* at 517. And they concluded that this was not harmless error because \u201cWillis was the linchpin of the state\u2019s case, and to a large extent the prosecution\u2019s case would stand or fall on Willis\u2019s credibility.\u201d *Id.* at 518. The dissent did not find Carole Mancino\u2019s proffered testimony \u201cas strong\u201d as Curtis Mack\u2019s, but, aside from the ethical problem of Mancino testifying in a case in which she was counsel, found \u201cit obvious that she had a perfect right to testify.\u201d *Id.*\n\nMack concedes that this court is bound by the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Ohio evidentiary rules. (Doc. 155 at 116.) But he argues that the state court\u2019s decision was so fundamentally unfair that it infringed on his due process rights. He cites his Sixth Amendment right to present a defense and \u201c\u2018to call witnesses in one\u2019s own behalf . . . [, which has] long been recognized as essential to due process.\u2019\u201d (Doc. 155 at 112 (quoting *Chambers v. Mississippi*, 410 U.S. 284, 294 (1973))). In *Chambers*, the Supreme Court noted that \u201cthe hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice[,]\u201d and held that given the \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d of that case, and \u201ccoupled with the State\u2019s refusal to permit Chambers to cross-examine [the third party]\u201d due process required that the petitioner should have been permitted to present testimony of three witnesses to whom a third party had confessed to the crime in question. *Chambers*, 410 U.S. at 302-03. Mack contends that, as in *Chambers*, Carole Mancino and Curtis Mack\u2019s testimony was \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201ccredible\u201d evidence that \u201cchallenged Willis on key aspects of his testimony and exposed at least one source of his very substantial bias\u201d \u2013 his confession to Mr. Sanelli\u2019s murder. (Doc. 162 at 176.)\n\nIn the context of this case, however, the court does not find the proffered testimony\nof either Carole Mancino or Curtis Mack so probative or reliable that its exclusion rises to the level of fundamental unfairness and a violation of Mack\u2019s due process rights. Defense counsel cross-examined Willis about his meeting with Ms. Mancino while he was in prison on charges for the Burgess assault. (See Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 145-50 (Willis Test.).) When asked whether he said to her, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that Clarence would do something like that[,]\u201d Willis admitted that he \u201cprobably\u201d did. (Id. at 149.) He explained he \u201cain\u2019t lying, I didn\u2019t believe that Clarence would kill a man.\u201d (Id.) As the state court observed, this statement was not inconsistent with Willis\u2019 testimony, and excluding Ms. Mancino\u2019s testimony about it was not fundamentally unfair.\n\nWhen cross-examined about whether he told Ms. Mancino that Mack did not visit his house the day of the murder and he did not call the police the day of Mack\u2019s arrest, Willis testified that he did not recall saying those things and explained that he was not about to tell Mancino anything incriminating about Mack, Sowell, or Germany while he was incarcerated in the same jail as them, for fear of his own safety. (Id. at 148-50.) Given the circumstances of Ms. Mancino\u2019s interview of Mack, and the fact that \u2013 unlike in Chambers \u2013 Willis was subject to cross-examination by the defense on these issues, Mancino\u2019s testimony about these statements would not have significantly added to the defense\u2019s impeachment of Willis\u2019 credibility through cross-examination. The exclusion of her testimony about these statements, therefore, was not fundamentally unfair.\n\nThe defense did not cross-examine Willis about his alleged statement to Ms. Mancino that he \u201ccan make [his] statements fit into any story anyone wants to hear.\u201d This statement, then, also was not inconsistent with Willis\u2019 trial testimony. Moreover, it was\ngiven in the context of a jailhouse interview, and, as explained above in great detail in connection with Mack\u2019s Brady claim, the defense was able to thoroughly cross-examine Willis about his statements to the police. It was not fundamentally unfair, therefore, to exclude Ms. Mancino\u2019s testimony about this statement.\n\nFinally, the state trial court\u2019s exclusion of Curtis Mack\u2019s proffered testimony that Willis admitted to him that he murdered Mr. Sanelli also was not fundamentally unfair. As Mack\u2019s cousin and Germany\u2019s brother, Curtis Mack had every reason to be biased himself, and his testimony that Willis admitted to the Sanelli murder was not so credible that its exclusion violated Mack\u2019s due process rights. This claim lacks merit.\n\n2. Defense\u2019s cross-examination of Willis\n\nIn a related claim, Mack asserts that the trial court prevented the defense from conducting a \u201cmeaningful\u201d cross-examination of Willis such that it violated his due process rights. He complains that in addition to preventing Carole Mancino and Curtis Mack from testifying about Willis\u2019 prior inconsistent statements, the judge limited the defense\u2019s cross-examination of Willis concerning Willis\u2019 ongoing welfare fraud, responsibility for the Sanelli murder, and pending criminal case. (Doc. 155 at 117-18.) Mack never raised this claim in state court and provides little argumentation here. Nevertheless, the court has reviewed defense counsel\u2019s entire cross-examination of Willis and finds that not one of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings at issue so constricted the questioning that it rendered his trial so fundamentally unfair. This claim is procedurally defaulted and meritless.\n\n3. Dr. Robert Challener\u2019s expert testimony\n\nMack further objects to the trial court\u2019s admission of the testimony and\naccompanying exhibits of the county deputy coroner, Dr. Robert Challener, on the basis that his testimony was hearsay because he did not personally conduct Mr. Sanelli\u2019s autopsy, and it therefore violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him.\n\n(Doc.155 at 119-20.)\n\nThe state appellate court, the last state court to address this claim, reasoned:\n\nAppellant argues that he was impermissibly denied an opportunity to confront and cross-examine witnesses when Dr. Challener was permitted to testify concerning Peter Sanelli's autopsy protocol which was prepared by Dr. Kalil Jiraki. At the time of trial, Dr. Jiraki, the deputy coroner who performed the autopsy on Peter Sanelli, was employed out of state and was no longer a member of the staff of the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office.\n\nR.C. 313.10 provides that certified records of a coroner are public records and shall be received as evidence in any criminal or civil court. Furthermore, pursuant to Evid.R. 902(4), certified copies of public records are self-authenticating. In an analogous situation, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that R.C. 2317.422, which provides for the admission into evidence of certified hospital records, absent the testimony of their custodian, their author, or the person under whose supervision they were made, preserves the confrontation rights of a criminal defendant. State v. Spikes (1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 405. Similarly, we find that R.C. 313.10, which establishes a procedure for admitting certified records of a coroner into evidence, preserves the confrontation rights of a criminal defendant since the coroner's records possess a strong indicia of reliability and a particularized guarantee of trustworthiness.\n\nFurthermore, we note that this court has previously held that an autopsy protocol is admissible as a business exception under Evid.R. 803(6) and a defendant is not denied his right to confrontation where a coroner who did not personally perform an autopsy is permitted to testify concerning the autopsy and its results. State v. Boyd (May 28, 1992), Cuyahoga App. No. 60639, unreported.\n\nIn the present case, Dr. Challener identified State's Exhibit 1 as an autopsy protocol prepared by Dr. Jiraki. Dr. Challener further revealed that the autopsy protocol was a regularly prepared document and contained the seal of the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office. Dr. Challener also revealed on cross-examination, that consistent with his supervisory responsibilities at the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office, he reviewed the findings with Dr. Jiraki before the case was closed. Additionally, Dr. Challener related that he reviewed\nthe autopsy report, the microscopic slides prepared in connection with the case, the photographs and the trace evidence findings, prior to testifying at appellant's trial.\n\nWe find that Dr. Challener testified to facts obtained through his personal observations and review. Moreover, it is uncontroverted that he was qualified as an expert to testify regarding the autopsy protocol. We further find that appellant has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by Dr. Challener's testimony concerning the autopsy protocol. We note that defense counsel, during cross-examination of Dr. Challener, made it perfectly clear to the jury that Dr. Challener had not personally performed the Sanelli autopsy. We also note that appellant could have made use of his right to compulsory process to compel the presence of Dr. Jiraki if he disputed the reliability of the autopsy protocol.\n\nAdditionally, appellant's claim that he was denied his confrontation rights when Dr. Challener testified concerning the discovery of a bullet in the victim's inner clothing is misplaced. The record clearly reflects that Sharon Rosenberg, an employee of the trace evidence department of the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office, testified that she discovered the bullet and photographically documented its discovery. She further testified that she submitted the bullet to the pathologist who was conducting the autopsy. The record further reflects that Ms. Rosenberg was cross-examined by defense counsel concerning the discovery of the bullet.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that appellant was not impermissibly denied an opportunity to confront and cross-examine witnesses when Dr. Challener was permitted to testify concerning Peter Sanelli's autopsy. Appellant's sixth assignment of error is therefore overruled.\n\nMack, 1993 WL 497052, at *11-12.\n\nThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment states that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. CONST. amend. VI. The provision\u2019s \u201ccentral concern . . . is to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact.\u201d Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836, 845 (1990).\nMack argues that the admission of Dr. Challener\u2019s testimony violated his confrontation rights. As Respondent argues, however, Mack does not identify any clearly established Supreme Court precedent at the time of the state court\u2019s opinion that specifically addressed the issue here: whether an expert\u2019s consideration of hearsay violates a defendant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause. See Wright v. Van Patten, 552 U.S. 120, 125 (2008) (reversing grant of habeas relief because no Supreme Court decision had \u201csquarely address[ed]\u201d the issue or \u201cclearly establish[ed]\u201d that law developed in a different context applied to the facts of that case). Mack has not demonstrated that admitting Dr. Challener\u2019s autopsy testimony rendered his trial so fundamentally unfair as to violate his due process rights.\n\n4. Tony Sanelli\u2019s testimony regarding Willis statements\n\n20 Mack cites Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 564 U.S. 647 (2011), and Melendez\u2013Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 (2009), to support this claim. (Doc. 155 at 119-20.) Those cases, however, were not decided at the time of the state courts\u2019 adjudication of Mack\u2019s claim. See, e.g., Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 71-72 (2003) (\u201c[C]learly established Federal law\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u201cis the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its decision.\u201d). And they are not directly on point. See, e.g., Wright v. Van Patten, 552 U.S. 120, 125 (2008) (clearly established law under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u201csquarely addresses\u201d the issue presented). The cases held that scientific reports could not be used as substantive evidence against a defendant unless the analyst who prepared and certified the report was subject to confrontation. Bullcoming, 564 U.S. at 652; Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 311. However, as Respondent notes, after deciding Bullcoming and Melendez-Diaz, the Supreme Court clearly established law that more directly applies here (but, obviously, also was decided too late to apply to this case). It held in Williams v. Illinois, 567 U.S. 50 (2012), that an expert witness does not violate the Confrontation Clause when he or she voices an opinion based on facts concerning the events at issue even if the expert lacks first-hand knowledge of those facts. Id. at 58 (\u201cWhen an expert testifies for the prosecution in a criminal case, the defendant has the opportunity to cross-examine the expert about any statements that are offered for their truth. Out-of-court statements that are related by the expert solely for the purpose of explaining the assumptions on which that opinion rests are not offered for their truth and thus fall outside the scope of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d).\nMack further argues, with scant argumentation, that Tony Sanelli\u2019s testimony also violated his confrontation right. (Doc. 155 at 122.)\n\nThe state appellate court was the last state court to address the claim, deciding:\n\nAppellant argues that he was impermissibly denied the right to confront witnesses against him when state's witness Anthony Sanelli testified on redirect examination. Specifically, appellant objects to Anthony Sanelli's testimony, wherein, he recounted a conversation he had with Timothy Willis two days after the murder concerning the death of his father.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause, made applicable through the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, see *Pointer v. Texas* (1965), 380 U.S. 400, 403-405, provides as follows:\n\n\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d\n\nMoreover, it has been held that a defendant's right to confront witnesses is not violated so long as the accused has an opportunity to effectively cross-examine the witnesses against him. See, *Ohio v. Roberts* (1980) 448 U.S. 56 and *Delaware v. Fensterer* (1985), 474 U.S. 15.\n\nIn the present case, the appellant was not denied his right to confrontation by the admission of Anthony Sanelli's testimony. The record reflects that Timothy Willis testified at trial which afforded the appellant the opportunity to cross-examine Willis concerning the statements he made to Anthony Sanelli. The record further reflects that defense counsel fully and effectively cross-examined Willis on all relevant areas of inquiry including the fact that a reward was offered. We thus conclude that appellant was not denied his right to confrontation. Accordingly, appellant's seventh assignment of error is overruled.\n\n*Mack*, 1993 WL 497052, at *12.\n\nMack argues that \u201cthis testimony is clear hearsay and its admission deprived Mack of his rights to due process and a fair trial.\u201d (Doc. 155 at 122.) But he concedes, as the state court found, that the State \u201cput Timothy Willis on the stand to testify as to the substance of what he had told Anthony Sanelli,\u201d and defense counsel had the opportunity to\ncross-examine both Sanelli and Willis on Sanelli\u2019s testimony. (Id. at 121.) As explained above, a defendant\u2019s confrontation right is not violated when he or she was able to effectively cross-examine the declarant, as Mack was here. See, e.g., Crawford, 541 U.S. at 59 n.9. This claim, too, fails.\n\n5. **Detective Lucey\u2019s expert testimony**\n\nMack also complains that the trial court improperly permitted Detective Thomas Lucey to testify as an expert on ballistics evidence. (Doc. 155 at 122-23.) He claims Lucey should have been precluded from offering his opinions because the State failed to lay a proper foundation as to his expert qualifications and because he relied on hearsay opinions of others who did not testify. (Id at 122.)\n\nThe last state court to address this claim, the Ohio Supreme Court, stated:\n\nIn his eighth proposition of law, appellant contends that he was denied due process of law when the trial court admitted the expert testimony of Detective Thomas L. Lucey. Appellant argues that Detective Lucey was improperly qualified as an expert witness, that Lucey's opinions were improperly based on hearsay opinions of others, and, thus, the admission of his testimony violated appellant's right to due process of law. We disagree.\n\nThe question here turns on whether Detective Lucey's testimony as a ballistics expert satisfied the requirements of both Evid.R. 702 and 703. For the following reasons we believe that it did.\n\nFormer Evid.R. 702 provided: \u201cIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d As appellant notes in his brief, the testimony of Detective Lucey was critical in establishing the relationship between the bullets and casings found at the crime scene and the weapon found on the appellant at the time of his arrest. Clearly, Detective Lucey's testimony assisted the jury in its understanding of the technical ballistics report submitted into evidence and \u201caid[ed] [the jury] in the search for the truth.\u201d Alexander v. Mt. Carmel Med. Ctr. (1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 155, 159, 10 O.O.3d 332, 334, 383 N.E.2d 564, 566.\nHowever, appellant questions Detective Lucey's qualifications as an expert witness.\n\nThe record shows that Detective Lucey's qualifications satisfied the requirements of Evid.R. 702. Detective Lucey has performed firearm and tool mark examinations for the Scientific Investigation Unit of the Cleveland Police Department for the past five years. During his tenure with the forensic laboratory, he has examined in excess of one thousand guns. He was trained in firearm identification by Victor Kovacic, a twenty-five-year veteran in the field. Detective Lucey is a member of the Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners and Ohio Criminalists Associations. Moreover, he has testified over sixty times as an expert witness in various courts throughout Ohio.\n\n\u201cThe qualification of an expert is a matter for determination by the court on the facts, and rulings with respect to such matters will ordinarily not be reversed unless there is a clear showing that the court abused its discretion.\u201d State v. Maupin (1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 473, 479, 71 O.O.2d 485, 488, 330 N.E.2d 708, 713; see, also, State v. Tomlin (1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 724, 728, 590 N.E.2d 1253, 1256. Qualifications which may satisfy the requirements of Evid.R. 702 are multitudinous. This court has held that there is no \u201cdegree\u201d requirement, per se. Professional experience and training in a particular field may be sufficient to qualify one as an expert. State v. Beuke (1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 29, 43, 526 N.E.2d 274, 289. Detective Lucey's extensive background was, indeed, sufficient to qualify him as an expert in the field of ballistics. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing his expert testimony.\n\nAppellant further argues that Detective Lucey's testimony was improperly based upon inadmissible hearsay opinions of others within the forensic laboratory. Evid.R. 703 requires that an expert base an opinion or inference on facts or data either perceived by him or admitted into evidence. Here, Detective Lucey test-fired the gun confiscated from appellant upon his arrest. Detective Lucey compared the test shot with the morgue bullet recovered from the victim, Peter Sanelli, and the spent shell casings recovered from the crime scene, concluding that all had been discharged from appellant's gun. Doubtlessly based on his own observations, the findings of the ballistics examination were well within Detective Lucey's personal knowledge.\n\nNotwithstanding Detective Lucey's personal analysis of the evidence, appellant is troubled by the corroborative procedure of the forensic laboratory, where \u201ctwo or three or even more individuals view the findings\u201d of any one examination. Appellant cites Zelenka v. Indus. Comm. (1956), 165 Ohio St. 587, 594, 60 O.O. 524, 528, 138 N.E.2d 667, 671, for the proposition that \u201cthe opinion of an expert witness cannot be predicated either in whole or in part upon the opinions, inferences and conclusions of others, whether expert or lay\nAppellant's reliance on Zelenka is, however, misplaced. In a case decided since Zelenka, this court found admissible the opinions of doctors to be \u201cbased on facts or data perceived by [them]\u201d within the meaning of Evid.R. 703, despite their being partially based on medical reports not in evidence, where the doctors had personally examined the defendant. State v. Solomon (1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 124, 570 N.E.2d 1118. Speaking for the majority, Justice Douglas opined, \u201c[w]here an expert bases his opinion, in whole or in major part, on facts or data perceived by him, the requirement of Evid.R. 703 has been satisfied.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at syllabus.\n\nIn this case, Detective Lucey conducted extensive analysis upon appellant's gun, the morgue bullet recovered from the victim, and the shell casings recovered from the crime scene. The fact that his colleagues in the laboratory may have confirmed, or even debated, his findings does not remove his opinion beyond the boundaries for admissible expert testimony prescribed by Evid.R. 703. Accordingly, we reject appellant's eighth proposition of law.\n\nMack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 510-12.\n\nMack argues that the state court\u2019s decision contravenes or misapplies numerous Supreme Court decisions, but does not explain how. (Doc. 162 at 180-81.) He also asserts that the decision is based on unreasonable determination of facts, but does not identify any factual errors. (Id. at 181.) Indeed, Mack\u2019s argument is based primarily on Ohio evidentiary rules. (See Doc. 155 at 122-24.) The Ohio Supreme Court carefully considered this claim and found no error under Ohio law, and this court is bound by that determination. Further, Mack has provided no argument as to how the admission of this testimony, other than that it was important evidence in the case, was so egregious that it rendered his trial fundamentally unfair. This claim also is meritless.\n\n6. Willis testimony\n\nMack also argues that the trial court erred by allowing Willis to testify about numerous hearsay statements made to him by Mack\u2019s co-defendants, Crime Stoppers, and\nthe Sanelli family. (Doc. 155 at 121-22.) Again, Mack offers only conclusory assertions regarding hearsay with no argument as to how the admission of this testimony was so egregious that it rendered his trial fundamentally unfair. This claim, therefore, is unfounded as well as procedurally defaulted.\n\n7. Gruesome photographs\n\nFinally, Mack argues that the trial court\u2019s admission of gruesome photographs violated his due process rights. (Doc. 155 at 124-25.) The state appellate court rejected this claim, stating:\n\nAppellant argues that he was denied the right to a fair trial during both the guilt and penalty phases of his trial by the admission of State's Exhibits 2 through 8, autopsy photographs of Peter Sanelli. Appellant initially contends that the photographs were inadmissible under Evid.R. 403, as their probative value was outweighed by the inflammatory and prejudicial effect on the jurors.\n\nIn State v. Maurer (1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, the Supreme Court of Ohio set forth the standard for reviewing the admissibility of photographs in a capital case. The court stated:\n\nProperly authenticated photographs, even if gruesome, are admissible in a capital prosecution if relevant and of probative value in assisting the trier of fact to determine the issues or are illustrative of testimony and other evidence, as long as the danger of material prejudice to a defendant is outweighed by their probative value and the photographs are not repetitive or cumulative in number. Id. at paragraph seven of the syllabus.\n\nUnder Evid.R. 403 and 611(A), the admission of photographs is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Jackson (1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 37.\n\nReview of the photographs reveals they are illustrative of testimony from the state's witnesses concerning the manner of the victim's death. Each photograph shows the entrance points and exit points of the three gunshot wounds sustained by the victim. Furthermore, the photographs are not unnecessarily cumulative or repetitive. They were thus properly admitted.\n\nAppellant also contends it was error to introduce the autopsy photographs\nduring the penalty phase of his trial citing *State v. Thompson* (1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 13 in support.\n\nIn *State v. DePew* (1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 282, the Ohio Supreme Court clarified the Thompson decision by stating:\n\nOur decision in *Thompson* is being misconstrued, we assume unintentionally, as holding that the introduction of gruesome photographs in the penalty state is reversible error. It is not. *Thompson* was meant principally to focus on the question of prosecutorial misconduct, especially the issue of commenting on a defendant's silence at any stage of the proceedings. In fact, we find that the introduction of photographs, even if gruesome, in the penalty stage is not error and is indeed authorized by R.C. 2929.03(D)(1), which provides in part that during the penalty stage, the court and the trial jury shall consider \u201c* * * any evidence raised at trial that is relevant to the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing * * *.\u201d In addition, this section provides that the court and the trial jury \u201c* * * shall hear testimony and other evidence that is relevant to the nature and circumstances of the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added).\n\nThus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the autopsy photographs during the penalty phase of trial. Accordingly, appellant's thirteenth and nineteenth assignments of error are overruled.\n\n*Mack*, 1993 WL 497052, at *19-20.\n\nMack again does not specify how this decision contravenes or unreasonably applies Supreme Court precedent, or is based on an erroneous determination of fact. Indeed, the Sixth Circuit repeatedly has held that a trial court\u2019s admission of gruesome photographs of a murdered victim does not violate the Constitution when there is some legitimate evidentiary purpose for demonstrating the nature of the injuries. *See, e.g., Biros v. Bagley*, 422 F.3d 379, 391 (6th Cir. 2005) (\u201cThe [state] court found, however, that the photographs were properly admitted as they demonstrated that Biros beat Engstrom rather severely and meticulously dissected her body with two different knives.\u201d); *Frazier v. Huffman*, 343 F.3d 780, 789 (6th Cir. 2003) (\u201cThe Ohio Supreme Court directly addressed this evidentiary\nissue, concluding that the multiple photographs \u2018were introduced during the coroner\u2019s testimony to illustrate the testimony,\u2019 that \u2018[e]ach photograph presents a different perspective of the victim,\u2019 and that the photographs \u2018were used to illustrate\u2019 the nature of the encounter that immediately preceded Skiba\u2019s death.\u201d) (citation omitted).\n\nSimilarly, here, the Ohio Supreme Court reasonably concluded that the photographs were probative demonstrative evidence of the manner of Mr. Sanelli\u2019s death, showing the entrance points and exit points of the three gunshot wounds he sustained, and were not unnecessarily cumulative or repetitive. These photographs were far less inflammatory than in Biros, for example, where the Sixth Circuit upheld the admission of photographs depicting a victim\u2019s severed head, severed breast, and severed body parts placed near the victim\u2019s torso. See Biros, 422 F.2d at 391. Accordingly, this evidence also did not deprive Mack of a fundamentally fair trial, and this claim, therefore, is not cognizable on habeas.\n\nMack\u2019s ninth through twelfth grounds for relief, therefore, are denied.\n\nVIII. Thirteenth and Fourteenth Grounds for Relief: Jury Instructions\n\nMack argues for his thirteenth ground for relief that the trial court issued several erroneous jury instructions, violating his right to due process. These include jury instructions regarding: (1) purpose and specific intent; (2) reasonable doubt; (3) death sentence as a recommendation; (4) death-first and unanimity instructions; and (5) aggravating circumstances. (Doc. 155 at 125-36.) For his fourteenth ground, he claims that the trial court also erred by: (6) refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offenses of murder and involuntary manslaughter and improperly instructing on purpose to kill. (Id. at 136-37.) Respondent contends these claims are partially procedurally defaulted and\nmeritless. (Doc. 158 at 73-76.)\n\nA. Procedural Posture\n\nRespondent asserts that sub-claims (1) through (4), as listed above, were raised and adjudicated in state courts and are preserved for federal habeas review. (Id. at 75.) She contends sub-claims (5) and (6), however, are procedurally defaulted. (Id. at 75, 77.)\n\nSpecifically, Respondent argues that sub-claim (5) is defaulted because Mack never presented it to state courts. (Id. at 75.) Mack contends the claim was presented to state courts as the underlying ground for an appellate-counsel ineffective-assistance claim in an application to reopen the direct appeal under Ohio Appellate Rule 26(B). (Doc. 162 at 188-89.) As the court discussed in relation to Mack\u2019s first and second grounds for relief, this argument is unavailing. Mack never presented this claim as an independent claim in state court, and because he no longer can do so, it is procedurally defaulted. Moreover, as shown below, Mack has not demonstrated cause and prejudice based on the ineffective assistance of counsel or his actual innocence to excuse the default.\n\nAs to sub-claim (6), Respondent asserts that Mack did not fairly present it to the Ohio Supreme Court because he referred in his state-court pleadings to \u201cinvoluntary\u201d rather than \u201cvoluntary\u201d manslaughter. (Doc. 158 at 77.) Mack counters that the use of the word \u201cinvoluntary\u201d in the state-court pleadings was an obvious mistake. (Doc. 162 at 193-94.) The court agrees. The state appellate court, the last state court to address the merits of this\n\n21 Respondent also argues that Mack presents here a new and different legal argument supporting sub-claim (6) concerning the instruction on \u201cpurpose to kill.\u201d (Doc. 158 at 77.) It appears, however, that the argument is substantially similar to sub-claim (1), which was fairly presented to state courts.\nclaim, quoted Mack\u2019s assignment of error using the term \u201cinvoluntary manslaughter,\u201d but it considered only the instruction on the lesser-included offenses of murder and voluntary manslaughter. See Mack, 1993 WL 497052, at *23-24. Mack fairly presented this sub-claim to state courts and it is preserved for habeas review.\n\nMack also argues that, contrary to Respondent\u2019s assertion that he presented sub-claim (4) to state courts on direct review, he only raised that sub-claim as the underlying basis for appellate-counsel ineffective assistance in his state reopening application. (Doc. 162 at 189-90.) He notes that he did not cite the controlling federal constitutional law in state-court briefs. (Id.) But Mack\u2019s state-court pleadings on direct review cite state case law that relied on the governing federal constitutional authority and framed the issue in a way that sufficiently alleged the denial of a constitutional right. (See Doc. 149-2 at 390-91 (State Appellate Brief); Doc. 149-3 at 283-84 (Ohio Supreme Court Merits Brief).) This claim, therefore, was fairly presented to state courts. See Clinkscale v. Carter, 375 F.3d 430, 437 (6th Cir. 2004) (habeas petitioner fairly presents the substance of a federal constitutional claim to state courts by, among other things, relying upon state cases using a federal constitutional analysis and phrasing his claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege the denial of a specific constitutional right); Jells v. Mitchell, 538 F.3d 478, 504 (6th Cir. 2008) (\u201cTo present a claim fairly, it is sufficient if the substance of the claim was presented to the state courts, such that the ultimate question would have been the same despite variations in the legal theory or factual allegations urged in its support.\u201d). Sub-claim (4), therefore, also was fairly presented to state courts and is\nnot procedurally defaulted.\\textsuperscript{22}\n\n\\textbf{B. Merits Analysis}\n\nAlternatively, these claims each lack merit. Errors in jury instructions generally do not rise to the level of federal constitutional violations. In criminal trials, the state must prove every element of the offense, and a jury instruction violates due process if it fails to meet that requirement. \\textit{Middleton v. McNeil}, 541 U.S. 433, 437 (2004) (citing \\textit{Sandstrom v. Montana}, 442 U.S. 510, 520-21 (1979)). But the Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201cnot every ambiguity, inconsistency, or deficiency in a jury instruction rises to the level of a due process violation.\u201d \\textit{Id}. Indeed, the circumstances under which a federal court would overturn a state court\u2019s determination regarding a requested jury instruction \u201cwould need to be extraordinary.\u201d \\textit{Bagby v. Sowders}, 894 F.2d 792, 795 (6th Cir. 1990). To obtain relief, a habeas petitioner must demonstrate that \u201cthe ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process\u2019, not merely whether \u2018the instruction is undesirable, erroneous, or even universally condemned.\u2019\u201d \\textit{Henderson v. Kibbe}, 431 U.S. 145, 154 (1977) (quoting \\textit{Cupp v. Naughten}, 414 U.S. 141, 147 (1973)).\n\n1. \u201cPurpose\u201d and \u201cspecific intent\u201d; \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cresult\u201d\n\n\\textsuperscript{22} In addition, the court notes that the state appellate court, the last state court to address sub-claim (2), found that claim procedurally barred because Mack\u2019s counsel failed to object to the instruction at trial, violating Ohio\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule. \\textit{Mack}, 1993 WL 497052, at *23; \\textit{see also State v. Mason}, 82 Ohio St. 3d 144, 162 (Ohio 1998). Sub-claim (2), therefore, may be procedurally defaulted. \\textit{See, e.g., Keith v. Mitchell}, 455 F.3d 662, 673 (6th Cir. 2006). But Respondent did not raise a procedural-default defense to this sub-claim, and it is therefore waived. \\textit{See, e.g., Trest v. Cain}, 522 U.S. 87, 89 (1997) (\u201cprocedural default is normally a \u2018defense\u2019 that the State is \u2018obligated to raise\u2019 and \u2018preserv[e]\u2019 if it is not to \u2018lose the right to assert the defense thereafter\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted); \\textit{Baze v. Parker}, 371 F.3d 310, 320 (6th Cir. 2004) (\u201cThe state may waive a defense,\u201d including procedural default, \u201cby not asserting it.\u201d).\nMack first complains that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury on the issues of \u201cpurpose\u201d and \u201cspecific intent\u201d confused the jury as to whether general or specific intent to cause death was necessary to convict him for aggravated murder, and the instructions on \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cresult\u201d transformed the state-of-mind requirement from specific intent to a negligence standard. (Doc. 155 at 125-26.)\n\nThe last state court to address this sub-claim was the state appellate court, which decided:\n\nNext appellant contends the court gave the jury improper and conflicting instructions on the purpose to kill. Appellant maintains the court gave an improper general intent instruction by citing a portion of the court's instruction wherein the court was charging the jury on the purpose requirement of aggravated robbery rather than aggravated murder. Specifically, in describing the purpose to commit aggravated robbery the court stated, \u201cA person acts purposely when the gist of the offense is prohibition against conduct of a certain nature regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, if it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature.\u201d (Tr. 1169). In charging the jury on aggravated murder the court repeatedly emphasized the jury must find that the killing was done purposely and with specific intent. To that effect the following appears in the court's aggravated murder charge:\n\n\u201cYou must further find beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing of Peter Sanelli was done purposely and with specific intent.\n\n\u201cPurposely, purpose to kill is an essential element of the crime of aggravated murder. A person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a certain result.\n\n\u201cIt must be established in this case that at the time in question there was present in the mind of the defendant a specific intention to kill Peter Sanelli.\n\n\u201cPurpose is a decision of the mind to do an act with a conscious objective of producing a specific result. To do an act purposely is to do it intentionally and not accidentally. Purpose and intent mean the same thing. The purpose with which a person does an act is known only to himself unless he expresses it to others or indicates it by his conduct.\n\n\u201cThe purpose with which a person brings about a result is determined from the\nmanner in which it is done, the weapon used, if any, and all the other facts and circumstances in evidence.\u201d\n\n(Tr. 1163-1164).\n\n\u201cSpecific intent. No person may be convicted of aggravated murder unless he is specifically found to have intended to cause the death of another.\n\n\u201cSpecific intent in Ohio is no more nor less than a particular intent prescribed by statute. This statute mandates that the jury must find that the killing must have been done purposely and with specific intent, and that the defendant specifically intended to produce the death of Peter Sanelli.\u201d\n\n(Tr. 1165).\n\nBy reviewing the court's overall charge in its relevant context rather than reviewing it in artificial isolation, it is abundantly clear that the court's aggravated murder charge properly set forth the requirement of specific intent in compliance with R.C. 2903.01(D). See, also State v. Thompson (1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 13. It was thus a proper recitation of the law.\n\nAppellant next contends that the following portion of the court's cause and result charge erroneously allowed him to be convicted under the improper negligence standard of foreseeability. We disagree.\n\n\u201cCause occurs when the death is the natural and foreseeable result of the act. A death is the result of an act when it is produced directly by the act or failure to act in a natural and continuous sequence and would not have occurred without the act.\n\n\u201cResult occurs when the death is naturally and foreseeably caused by the act. Causal responsibility of the defendant for an unlawful act is not limited to its immediate or most obvious result. He is responsible for the natural, logical and foreseeable results that follow in the ordinary course of events from an unlawful act.\u201d\n\n(Tr. 1166).\n\nAppellant incorrectly relies on this court's decision in State v. Jacks (1989), 63 Ohio App.3d 200, in support of his argument. Close review of that case reveals the trial court not only charged the jury on cause and result but also instructed the jury on the issue and definition of foreseeability. In the present case, the court did not provide the jury with an instruction and definition of foreseeability. Additionally, in Jacks, unlike the present case, the prosecutor\nimproperly referred to the foreseeability instruction during closing argument. No such reference was made by the prosecutor in the present case.\n\nMoreover, a defendant's claim that similar jury instructions may have misled a jury into believing that he could be convicted of aggravated murder if he acted recklessly or negligently rather than purposely was rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court in *State v. Thompson*, 33 Ohio St.3d 12-13. The *Thompson* court concluded the jury could not have been misled regarding the element of purpose because the trial court's instruction specifically required the jury to find that the defendant purposely intended to kill the victim. *Id.* In the present case, the trial court's instructions made it abundantly clear that the jury must find that the appellant harbored a specific intent to kill the victim prior to convicting him of aggravated murder. We thus find that the jury could not have been misled on the element of purpose.\n\n*Mack*, 1993 WL 497052, at *21-22.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit considered the constitutionality of similar Ohio jury instructions in *Buell v. Mitchell*, 274 F.3d 337 (6th Cir. 2001), and found that the petitioner had not demonstrated that the instructions were \u201cerroneous, let alone that they rose to this higher constitutional standard necessary to prove a due process violation.\u201d *Id.* at 366. Here, too, Mack makes only conclusory assertions about these instructions and does not even mention the state court\u2019s decision. This claim fails.\n\n2. \u201cReasonable doubt\u201d\n\nMack next challenges the trial court\u2019s instructions on \u201creasonable doubt\u201d in both the guilt and sentencing phases of trial. (Doc. 155 at 126-29.) The state appellate court, after finding the claim waived because counsel did not object to it at trial, reviewed the claim for plain error, stating:\n\nUpon review of the record, we are unable to conclude that the court's reasonable doubt jury instruction prejudiced appellant. The reasonable doubt instruction duplicated the definition set forth in R.C. 2901.05(D) and was therefore proper. See, *State v. Scott* (1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 92, 99-100. Moreover, the Ohio Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of this\nstatutory definition of \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *State v. Jenkins* (1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164.\n\n*Mack*, 1993 WL 497052, at *23. The court further upheld the trial court\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction during the sentencing phase of trial, stating:\n\nAs was previously stated during our disposition of appellant's fourteenth assignment of error, the Ohio Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the statutory definition of \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *State v. Jenkins*, 15 Ohio St.3d 164. Thus, appellant's argument lacks merit.\n\n*Id.* at *28.\n\nMack again fails to address the state court\u2019s decisions. But he asserts that the trial court\u2019s reasonable-doubt instructions were unconstitutional under *Cage v. Louisiana*, 498 U.S. 39 (1990), which held that Louisiana\u2019s definition of reasonable doubt was unconstitutional, and other Supreme Court precedent. (Doc. 155 at 126-29.) The Sixth Circuit, however, repeatedly has held that these reasonable-doubt instructions, which were based on Ohio\u2019s statutory definition of reasonable doubt in Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2901.05(D), do not violate due process. *See, e.g.*, *Buell*, 274 F.3d at 366; *Scott v. Mitchell*, 209 F.3d 854, 883-84 (6th Cir. 2000); *Byrd v. Collins*, 209 F.3d 486, 527-28 (6th Cir. 2000); *Thomas v. Arn*, 704 F.2d 865, 867\u201369 (6th Cir. 1983). This claim, therefore, also fails.\n\n3. **Death sentence as a recommendation**\n\nMack further alleges the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that its recommendation of a death sentence would not be binding on the court, but a life sentence would be, also was deficient. (Doc. 155 at 129-30.) As to this claim, the state appellate court reasoned:\n\nIn this assignment of error appellant argues the trial court improperly instructed the jury during the penalty phase of his trial. . . .\n\n\u201cIf all twelve members of the jury find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe aggravating circumstance which defendant was found guilty of committing outweighs the mitigating factors, then you must return such finding to the Court.\n\n\u201cI instruct you as a matter of law if you make such finding then you have no choice and must recommend to the Court that the sentence of death be imposed upon the defendant.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, if after considering all of the relevant evidence raised at trial, the testimony, other evidence and the arguments of counsel, you are unable to unanimously agree that the aggravating circumstance which the defendant was found guilty of committing, outweighs the mitigating factors, you will then proceed to determine which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to recommend to the Court.\u201d\n\n(Tr. 1312-1322).\n\nR.C. 2929.03(D)(2) provides that if the jury unanimously finds that the aggravating circumstance(s) outweigh any mitigating factor(s) beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury shall recommend that the offender be sentenced to death. State v. Springer (1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 167, 171. R.C. 2929.03(D)(2) also requires that if the jury is unable to unanimously recommend the sentence of death, the jury shall recommend that the offender be sentenced to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving twenty full years of imprisonment, or life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving thirty full years of imprisonment. Id. at 172.\n\nReview of the trial court's instruction reveals that it accurately set forth the law contained in R.C. 2929.03(D)(2). We thus find it was proper.\n\n... Appellant also argues he was denied a fair trial by the trial court's instructions and comments that the jury's death verdict was only a non-binding recommendation. This argument has been repeatedly rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court. State v. Buell (1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 124, 142-144; State v. Rogers (1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 427, 428; State v. Poindexter (1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1; State v. Broom (1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 277; State v. Roe (1989), 41 Ohio St.3d 18.\n\nAccordingly, appellant's twentieth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nMack, 1993 WL 497052, at *27-28.\nWithout addressing the state court\u2019s opinion, Mack contends that these instructions are unconstitutional under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in *Caldwell v. Mississippi*, 472 U.S. 320 (1985). (Doc. 155 at 129-30.) There, the Court held that \u201cit is constitutionally impermissible to rest a death sentence on a determination made by a sentencer who has been led to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant\u2019s death rests elsewhere.\u201d *Id.* at 328-29. Mack argues that Ohio\u2019s death-sentence instructions are improper under *Caldwell* because, by making a death sentence a recommendation, they lessened the jurors\u2019 sense of responsibility in the sentencing and injected irrelevant and arbitrary factors into the decision that biased the jurors in favor of the death penalty. (Doc. 155 at 130.)\n\nThe Sixth Circuit, however, considered and rejected this very argument regarding nearly identical Ohio jury instructions in *Buell v. Mitchell*, supra. It reasoned:\n\nUnlike in *Caldwell*, where the jury was given the uncorrected impression that the appellate courts would make the final decision on the imposition of a death sentence, not merely review the appropriateness of the jury's decision to impose a death sentence, Buell has not demonstrated that the instructions at his trial improperly described the role assigned to the jury by local law. In instructing the jury that they are to make a recommendation as to a death sentence, and that the final decision regarding imposition of a death sentence rests with the trial court, the jury instruction complied with the letter of Ohio law and described with complete accuracy the jury's role in the sentencing process. By doing so, the jury's sense of responsibility was not diminished. Therefore, this claim must fail.\n\n*Buell*, 274 F.3d at 352-53.\n\nHere, too, the state court found that the instructions regarding the death penalty as a whole complied with Ohio law and accurately described the jury\u2019s role in the sentencing process. The jury\u2019s sense of responsibility, therefore, was not reduced, and the state court\u2019s\ndecision did not contravene or misapply *Caldwell*.\n\n4. **Death-first and unanimity instructions**\n\nMack next challenges the constitutionality of the trial court\u2019s sentencing jury instructions on the grounds that they: (1) required the jury to first reject a death sentence before considering the life sentencing options, misleading the jury about its role in the sentencing process; and (2) overemphasized unanimity, creating a \u201csubstantial possibility\u201d that one or more of the jurors might have mistakenly believed that a life sentence also required a unanimous decision. (Doc. 155 at 131-35.)\n\nThe state appellate court rejected this argument, stating:\n\nInitially, appellant contends the following instruction improperly denied the jury an opportunity to consider either of the life sentence options:\n\n\u201cIf all twelve members of the jury find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance which defendant was found guilty of committing outweighs the mitigating factors, then you must return such finding to the Court.\n\n\u201cI instruct you as a matter of law if you make such finding then you have no choice and must recommend to the Court that the sentence of death be imposed upon the defendant.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, if after considering all of the relevant evidence raised at trial, the testimony, other evidence and the arguments of counsel, you are unable to unanimously agree that the aggravating circumstance which the defendant was found guilty of committing, outweighs the mitigating factors, you will then proceed to determine which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to recommend to the Court.\u201d\n\n(Tr. 1312-1322).\n\nR.C. 2929.03(D)(2) provides that if the jury unanimously finds that the aggravating circumstance(s) outweigh any mitigating factor(s) beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury shall recommend that the offender be sentenced to death. *State v. Springer* (1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 167, 171. R.C. 2929.03(D)(2) also requires that if the jury is unable to unanimously recommend the sentence\nof death, the jury shall recommend that the offender be sentenced to life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving twenty full years of imprisonment, or life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving thirty full years of imprisonment. *Id.* at 172.\n\nReview of the trial court's instruction reveals that it accurately set forth the law contained in R.C. 2929.03(D)(2). We thus find it was proper.\n\n*Mack*, 1993 WL 497052, at *27-28.\n\nMack does not address the state court\u2019s decision. But he argues that these \u201cdeath-first\u201d and \u201cunanimity\u201d instructions violated clearly established Supreme Court precedent, citing a host of cases, such as *Mills v. Maryland*, 486 U.S. 367 (1988), for the principle that \u201c[t]he Constitution requires that the jury instructions not be a hindrance to the jury\u2019s role\u201d; *Romano v. Oklahoma*, 512 U.S. 1, 9 (1994), for the proposition that \u201ca capital sentencing jury cannot be \u2018affirmatively misled\u2019 regarding its role in the sentencing process\u201d; and *Dugger v. Adams*, 489 U.S. 401, 407-08 (1989), for the principle that \u201ca capital sentencing jury must receive \u2018materially accurate\u2019 information about its role under local law.\u201d (Doc. 155 at 131, Doc. 162 at 186-87.) None of the decisions Mack cites, however, \u201csquarely address[]\u201d the claim he presents here, *Wright v. Van Patten*, 552 U.S. 120, 125 (2008), and each applies \u201cat too high a level of generality\u201d to constitute clearly established federal law for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d)(1), *Woods v. Donald*, 575 U.S. 312, 318 (2015).\n\nIn fact, the Supreme Court itself has held that it has never found Ohio jury instructions like those at issue here unconstitutional because they \u201c\u2018require[d] the jury to unanimously reject a death sentence before considering other sentencing alternatives,\u2019\u201d and relief therefore was precluded under AEDPA for such a claim. *Bobby v. Mitts*, 563 U.S. 395, 399-400 (2011) (per curiam) (quoting *Smith v. Spisak*, 558 U.S. 139, 149 (2010)). For\nthat same reason, Mack cannot establish that the state court of appeals\u2019 decision rejecting this claim is contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. This sub-claim is meritless.\n\n5. \u201cAggravating circumstance\u201d\n\nMack also claims the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the aggravating circumstances in the case. (Doc. 155 at 136.) The jury instruction provided:\n\nWe further find and specify that the aggravated murder of Peter Sanelli was committed while the defendant was committing or attempting to commit or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery, and the defendant was the principal offender.\n\n(Doc. 150-5 (Trial Tr.) at 175.) Defense counsel did not object to the instruction at trial. (See Doc. 150-5 (Trial Tr.) at 182-86.) As no state court has addressed the merits of this claim, the court reviews it de novo.\n\nMack argues that \u201c[w]hether [he] was the \u2018principal offender\u2019 or not is not an aggravating circumstance, at least not as explained by the court[,]\u201d and the jury\u2019s consideration of this non-statutory aggravating circumstance renders his sentence invalid. (Doc. 155 at 136.) He cites as support the Ohio statute governing capital specifications, Ohio Rev Code \u00a7 2929.04(A), and Ohio Supreme Court decisions in State v. Wogenstahl, 75 Ohio St. 3d 344 (Ohio 1996), State v. Gumm, 73 Ohio St. 3d 413 (Ohio 1995), and State v. Johnson, 24 Ohio St. 3d 87 (Ohio 1986). (Doc. 155 at 136.) In Johnson, Ohio\u2019s high court held that \u201c[p]resenting the jury with specifications not permitted by statute impermissibly tips the scales in favor of death, and essentially undermines the required reliability in the jury\u2019s determination.\u201d Johnson, 24 Ohio St. 3d at 94. In Gumm, it held that trial courts \u201cshould not instruct jurors that \u2018nature and circumstances\u2019 evidence is to be\n\u2018weighed against\u2019 mitigating factors[.]\u201d *Gumm*, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 422. And in *Wogenstahl*, the court held that \u201cit is completely improper for prosecutors in the penalty phase of a capital murder trial to make any comment before a jury that the nature and circumstances of the offense are \u2018aggravating circumstances.\u2019\u201d *Wogenstahl*, 75 Ohio St. 3d at 352. Mack cites only one federal case, with no discussion: *Barclay v. Florida*, 463 U.S. 939 (1983). (Doc. 155 at 136.) In that case, the Supreme Court examined whether a trial judge\u2019s consideration of a non-statutory, \u201cimproper\u201d aggravating circumstance that the murder included the element of racial hatred \u201cso infect[ed] the balancing process created by the Florida statute that it [was] constitutionally impermissible for the Florida Supreme Court [to] let the sentence stand[,]\u201d and found that it did not. *Barclay*, 463 U.S. at 956.\n\nRespondent counters, with no analysis or citation to the record, that this claim fails based on \u201cthe Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s implicit decision to the contrary,\u201d which is binding on this court. (Doc. 158 at 76.)\n\nThis claim fails. First, Mack provides no authority to support his argument that the fact that he was found a \u201cprincipal offender\u201d was not properly included in the trial court\u2019s aggravating-circumstance instruction under Ohio law. Indeed, in *Gumm*, the Ohio Supreme Court directed courts to \u201ccontinue to describe only the statutorily defined elements specified in the indictment as being the \u2018aggravating circumstances\u2019 a jury is to place on one side of the balance, with mitigating factors placed on the other side.\u201d *Gumm*, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 422. And the instruction at issue here did just that: it accurately described the statutorily defined elements specified in the indictment, including Mack\u2019s role in the aggravated murder as a \u201cprincipal offender.\u201d Mack was indicted and convicted for\naggravated murder with the death-penalty specification contained in \u00a7 2929.04(A)(7),\n\nwhich provides:\n\nThe offense was committed while the offender was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit kidnapping, rape, aggravated arson, aggravated robbery, or aggravated burglary, and either the offender was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder or, if not the principal offender, committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design.\n\nOhio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.04(A)(7). The jury found that Mack was the \u201cprincipal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder.\u201d (Doc. 150-5 (Trial Tr.) at 43 (Jury Verdict).) The fact that Mack was a \u201cprincipal offender,\u201d therefore, was not a \u201cnature or circumstance\u201d of the crime, but a \u201cstatutorily defined element specified in the indictment\u201d of the crime itself and properly included under Ohio law in the trial court\u2019s aggravating-circumstance instruction. Gumm, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 422; see also Stallings v. Bagley, 561 F. Supp. 2d 821, 851 (N.D. Ohio 2008) (\u201cWhile the \u2018nature and circumstances\u2019 of the offense are not enumerated aggravating factors, the fact that the murder occurred in the context of an aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery are.\u201d) (citing Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.04(A)(7)) (emphasis in original).\n\nMoreover, even if the instruction were improper under Ohio law, Mack provides no authority to support his contention that the deficiency rises to the level of a constitutional violation. In fact, in Barclay, the Court noted that in an earlier case, Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242 (1976), a plurality of the Court similarly \u201csaw no constitutional defect in a sentence based on both statutory and nonstatutory aggravating circumstances.\u201d Barclay, 463 U.S. at 957. The Court explained that it \u201c[had] never suggested that the United States Constitution requires that the sentencing process should be transformed into a rigid and\nmechanical parsing of statutory aggravating factors[,] . . . and as long as the decision is not so wholly arbitrary as to offend the Constitution, the Eighth Amendment cannot and should not demand more.\u201d *Id.* at 950-51. Here, there was nothing in the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that its finding that Mack was a \u201cprincipal offender\u201d in the murder was an aggravating circumstance that would have led to a decision \u201cso wholly arbitrary\u201d as to violate Mack\u2019s constitutional rights. This claim is meritless.\n\n6. **Refusal to instruct on lesser included offenses**\n\nMack also challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on lesser-included offenses of murder and/or involuntary manslaughter. (Doc. 155 at 136-37.) The state appellate court, in considering this claim, reasoned:\n\nAppellant argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury on the lesser included offenses of murder and voluntary manslaughter. Appellant's argument lacks merit.\n\nIt is well-settled that murder and voluntary manslaughter are lesser included offense of aggravated murder. *State v. Solomon* (1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 214, 219. However, a court need not give an instruction on the lesser included offense unless the offense is supported by the evidence. *State v. Kidder* (1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 279, 281; *State v. Thomas* (1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 213, paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\nAn instruction on murder should be given only if the evidence would reasonably support an acquittal on the felony murder charge and a conviction on the lesser included offense. *State v. Clark* (1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 252, 255. An instruction on voluntary manslaughter should be given only if the jury could have reasonably found that the victim seriously provoked the appellant and that the serious provocation was reasonably sufficient to have incited the use of deadly force. *State v. Lawrence* (1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 24, 26.\n\nIn this assignment of error appellant does not even attempt to show how the evidence supported jury instructions on murder and voluntary manslaughter. Our review of the record reveals that the evidence does not reasonably support the theory that appellant committed either of those crimes. The evidence adduced at trial established that Peter Sanelli was killed during the commission\nof an aggravated robbery. His death was caused by three gunshot wounds to his upper body the most serious of which caused perforations of his left lung and the sack that surrounds the heart. Further, the record contains no evidence of serious provocation and does not support an acquittal on the felony murder charge. Thus, we conclude the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on murder and voluntary manslaughter.\n\nAccordingly, appellant's fifteenth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nMack, 1993 WL 497052, at *23-24.\n\nMack asserts, again without addressing the state court\u2019s decision, that the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct on the lesser-included offenses of murder and involuntary manslaughter violated his due process rights under Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625 (1980), and Hopper v. Evans, 456 U.S. 605 (1982). In Beck, the Supreme Court held that a death sentence violated due process where the \u201cjury was not permitted to consider a verdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and when the evidence would have supported such a verdict[.]\u201d Beck. 447 U.S. at 627 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In Hopper, it held that the defendant was not constitutionally entitled to a lesser-included instruction because the evidence did not support a conviction on the lesser offense, and there was not sufficient evidence to support a rational jury\u2019s conclusion that he should have been acquitted of the greater offense. Hopper, 456 U.S. at 610.\n\nAccording to Mack, evidence adduced at trial showed that he lacked the purpose to kill Mr. Sanelli and was not the actual shooter, if he was even there at all \u2013 supporting verdicts of either murder or involuntary manslaughter. (Doc. 162 at 192.) He points to testimony of Willis and others that Mack told Sowell that he shot Mr. Sanelli only because Sowell shot him first, and Sowell, who was standing on the driver\u2019s side of Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car, fired the fatal shot. (Id. at 192-93.)\nThe state appellate court was reasonable to conclude, however, that the evidence did not support the lesser crimes of murder and involuntary manslaughter or reasonably support an acquittal on the felony-murder charge. The evidence conclusively demonstrated that the fatal shooting occurred during the course of an aggravated robbery and that the bullets that killed Mr. Sanelli were fired from the gun found in Mack\u2019s possession when he was arrested. Moreover, as the state court observed, there was no evidence of a serious provocation that could have supported an acquittal on the felony-murder charge.\n\nThe state court of appeals\u2019 decision, therefore, was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, *Beck* or *Hopper*.\n\n**IX. Fifteenth Ground for Relief: Miscellaneous Trial-Court Errors**\n\nMack argues for his fifteenth ground for relief that the trial court committed numerous other errors that violated his constitutional rights. They are: (1) applying the wrong standard in conducting the death penalty *voir dire*; (2) using the term \u201crecommendation\u201d in describing the jury\u2019s sentencing verdict; (3) failing to prevent the use of victim-impact evidence during the sentencing phase; (4) determining the sentence prior to the sentencing hearing; (5) conducting improper *ex parte* communications with a juror between the trial and sentencing phases; (6) improperly substituting an alternate juror into the jury between the trial and sentencing phases; (7) considering statutory mitigating factors not raised by the defense; (8) considering non-statutory aggravating circumstances in determining that Mack should be sentenced to death; (9) improperly limiting the admission of mitigation evidence; (10) ignoring Mack\u2019s mitigation evidence; and (11) admitting all of the evidence from the trial phase of the case into evidence in the mitigation phase. (Doc.\nRespondent counters that many of these claims are procedurally defaulted and each is meritless. (Doc. 158 at 79-85.)\n\nA. Procedural Posture\n\nRespondent argues that sub-claims (1), (3), (5), (6), (7), (9), and (11), as listed above, are procedurally defaulted. (Doc. 158 at 80-85.) Mack contends that he raised sub-claims (5), (6), (7), (9), and (11) in state courts as the underlying ground for an appellate-counsel ineffective-assistance claim in an application to reopen the direct appeal under Ohio Appellate Rule 26(B). (Doc. 162 at 197-98.) As the court discussed in relation to Mack\u2019s first and second grounds for relief, this argument is meritless. Mack never presented these independent claims in state court, and because he no longer can do so, they are procedurally defaulted. See Wong v. Money, 142 F.3d 313, 322 (6th Cir. 1998).\n\nMoreover, as shown below, Mack has not demonstrated cause and prejudice based on the ineffective assistance of counsel or his actual innocence to excuse the defaults. Sub-claims (1), (3), (5), (6), (7), (9), and (11), therefore, are procedurally defaulted.\n\nB. Merits Analysis\n\nEven if all of these claims were ripe for habeas review, they would fail.\n\n1. Voir dire standard\n\nMack first asserts that the trial court applied the incorrect legal standard in deciding whether to excuse jurors for cause during voir dire based on their beliefs about the death penalty. (Doc. 155 at 138-39.) He contends the judge used the standard set forth in Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412 (1985), rather than the standard required under Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510 (1968), and Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2945.25(C). (Id.) To\nsupport this claim, Mack cites: (1) several instances in which he alleges the trial court articulated an improper standard governing the excusal of potential jurors for cause based on their views of the death penalty (id. at 138 (citing Doc. 150-1 (Trial Tr.) at 52, 72, 81, 275)); (2) the judge\u2019s allegedly improper dismissal of four potential jurors (Gomez, Spelic, Romans, and Davis) because of their opposition to the death penalty (id. (citing Doc. 150-1 (Trial Tr.) at 38-41, 58-63, 211, 263-72)); and (3) the trial court\u2019s refusal to excuse one potential juror (Frankel) on the ground that her support of the death penalty prevented her from considering a life sentence (id. (citing Doc. 150-1 (Trial Tr.) at 221-26)).\n\nRespondent correctly argues that to extent that Mack is alleging a violation of state law, this claim is not cognizable on federal habeas review, although she does not address Mack\u2019s claim under federal law. (Doc. 158 at 80.) This court, however, has reviewed the trial-court voir dire proceedings in relation to Mack\u2019s third ground for relief, and found the Ohio Supreme Court did not contravene or misapply Witt or Witherspoon in upholding the trial court\u2019s dismissal for cause of potential jurors \u2013 including Spelic and Davis \u2013 who articulated misgivings about the death penalty, and in denying Mack\u2019s motions to remove prospective jurors \u2013 including Frankel \u2013 who favored the death penalty. The court further has reviewed the other instances Mack cites here and finds no error in the trial court\u2019s application of federal constitutional standards during voir dire. This claim lacks merit.\n\n2. Use of term \u201crecommendation\u201d\n\nMack argues in this sub-claim that the trial court\u2019s use of the term \u201crecommendation\u201d to describe the jury\u2019s sentencing verdict was constitutionally impermissible under Caldwell v. Mississippi, 471 U.S. 320 (1985). (Doc. 155 at 139-40.)\nMack presented this claim to state courts on direct review in conjunction with his claim challenging the trial court\u2019s jury instruction regarding the recommendation of a death sentence (sub-claim (3) of Mack\u2019s thirteenth ground for relief), and it was last considered on the merits by the state court of appeals. See Mack, 1993 WL 497052, at *27-28. For the same reasons the court set forth in relation to Mack\u2019s jury-instruction claim, the court finds the state appellate court\u2019s decision rejecting this claim was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, Caldwell.\n\n3. Use of victim-impact evidence\n\nMack also claims the trial court erred by allowing the use of victim-impact evidence in the State\u2019s closing argument during the sentencing phase of trial. (Doc. 155 at 140-41.) As discussed in the court\u2019s analysis of Mack\u2019s sixteenth ground for relief, it has found no prosecutorial misconduct based on the alleged use of victim-impact evidence. It follows that the trial court did not err by failing to prevent its use of that evidence.\n\n4. Timing of sentencing opinion\n\nMack further asserts that the trial court improperly determined his sentence before the sentencing hearing, depriving him of his right to a fair and impartial tribunal and his right to allocution. (Doc. 155 at 141-42.) Mack raised this claim in state courts. The last state court to address it, the state appellate court, opined:\n\nAppellant argues he was prejudiced because the trial court prepared its sentencing memorandum subsequent to the conclusion of the penalty phase of his trial but prior to hearing from counsel and the appellant at the subsequent sentencing hearing. Appellant claims the court's action violated Crim.R. 32(A)(1) and R.C. 2947.05.\n\nR.C.2929.03 governs the imposition of sentence for a capital offense. Specifically, R.C. 2929.03(D)(3) provides:\n(3) Upon consideration of the relevant evidence raised at trial, the testimony, other evidence, statement of the offender, arguments of counsel, and, if applicable, the reports submitted to the court pursuant to division (D)(1) of this section, if, after receiving pursuant to division (D)(2) of this section the trial jury's recommendation that the sentence of death be imposed, the court finds, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, or if the panel of three judges unanimously finds, that the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing outweigh mitigating factors, it shall impose sentence of death on the offender. Absent such a finding by the court or panel, the court or the panel shall impose one of the following sentences on the offender:\n\n(a) Life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving twenty full years of imprisonment;\n\n(b) Life imprisonment with parole eligibility after serving thirty full years of imprisonment.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing the trial judge stated he had reviewed the evidence in the case, the exhibits, the arguments of counsel and all of the factors that were introduced in the case. Additionally, the record reflects that prior to imposing sentence, the trial court permitted both defense counsel and the appellant to personally address the court in compliance with Crim.R. 32(A)(1) and R.C. 2947.05. We also note that during the penalty phase of his trial appellant made an unsworn statement, presented mitigation evidence, and presented arguments by defense counsel. We thus find that the trial court's imposition of sentence complied with the sentencing provisions contained in R.C. 2929.03(D)(3), R.C. 2947.05 and Crim.R. 32.\n\nAccordingly, appellant's twenty-second assignment of error is overruled.\n\nMack, 1993 WL 497052, at *29-30.\n\nMack does not address the state court\u2019s decision. Nor does he identify any Supreme Court precedent clearly establishing federal constitutional requirements for what Mack calls a \u201cmeaningful sentencing hearing,\u201d including the timing of a state trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion or a defendant\u2019s allocution, and this court has found none. This claim, too, fails.\n\n5. **Ex parte communication with juror**\n\nMack contends the trial court also erred by engaging in an *ex parte* discussion with\na juror without disclosing the contact, permitting an inquiry into the nature of the meeting, or making a record of what was said. (Doc. 155 at 142.) As Mack never presented this claim to state courts as an independent claim, the court reviews it de novo.\n\nThe record shows that at about 3 a.m. on the morning the trial\u2019s sentencing phase was set to begin, juror Gordon received a phone call in which the caller said, \u201cWe know who you are, and we know what you\u2019ve done.\u201d (Doc. 150-5 (Trial Tr.) at 53.) Gordon spoke to the judge about the call that morning. (Id.) The judge then convened the juror, defense counsel, and the prosecutors in his chambers for a recorded conference, so that he and counsel could question the juror about the call and her feelings about continuing to serve on the jury. (Id. at 53-59.) Ultimately, defense counsel requested that Gordon be removed, to which the court and prosecutors agreed. (Id. at 59-61.)\n\n\u201c[A] defendant has a due process right to be present at a proceeding \u2018whenever his presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fulness of his opportunity to defend against the charge. . . . The presence of a defendant is a condition of due process to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence, and to that extent only.\u2019\u201d United States v. Gagnon, 470 U.S. 522, 526 (1985) (quoting Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105-06, 108 (1934)). As Justice Stevens has observed:\n\n[T]he mere occurrence of an ex parte conversation between a trial judge and a juror does not constitute a deprivation of any constitutional right. The defense has no constitutional right to be present at every interaction between a judge and a juror, nor is there a constitutional right to have a court reporter transcribe every such communication.\n\nRushen v. Spain, 464 U.S. 114, 125-26 (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). In Gagnon, the Supreme Court concluded that an ex parte discussion between a juror and\njudge in that case did not prejudice the defendant, as it \u201cwas a short interlude in a complex trial; the conference was not the sort of event which every defendant had a right personally to attend under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d *Gagnon*, 470 U.S. at 527. \u201cRespondents could have done nothing had they been at the conference,\u201d it observed, \u201cnor would they have gained anything by attending.\u201d *Id.*\n\nGenerally, when an *ex parte* communication relates to some aspect of the trial, the trial judge should disclose the communication to counsel for all parties. *Rushen*, 464 U.S. at 119. The court also should conduct a hearing with all interested parties permitted to participate, to determine the circumstances of the *ex parte* communication, the impact of the contact on the juror, and whether or not it was prejudicial. *Remmer v. United States*, 347 U.S. 227, 230 (1954). The defense has the burden of demonstrating that the *ex parte* communication caused actual prejudice. *Smith v. Phillips*, 455 U.S. 209, 215\u201317 (1982).\n\nMack has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the *ex parte* discussion at issue here. Contrary to Mack\u2019s assertion, the judge\u2019s initial conversation with juror Gordon was disclosed to counsel. Their discussion also did not concern any evidence presented at trial or any legal issue in the case. This was not disputed; Mack\u2019s counsel did not even question the juror about it. Mack and his counsel, therefore, \u201ccould have done nothing had they been [present during that conversation], nor would they have gained anything by [being there].\u201d *Gagnon*, 470 U.S. at 527. Furthermore, the judge took all necessary steps to protect Mack\u2019s due process rights. He promptly notified counsel of his initial conversation with the juror, held a hearing on the matter soon after, and removed the juror at defense counsel\u2019s request to eliminate any risk of unfairness to Mack should the\nthreatening call have affected her impartiality. This claim is meritless.\n\n6. Substitution of juror before sentencing\n\nMack next complains that the trial court improperly substituted an alternate juror for excused juror Gordon between the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial. (Doc. 155 at 142-44.) The substitution violated Ohio sentencing procedures, he claims, which in turn deprived him of due process. (Id. at 143-44.) Mack did not raise this claim in state courts, so the court reviews the claim de novo.\n\nAs Respondent argues, to the extent that Mack challenges Ohio law, this court is bound by state courts\u2019 determinations of their own laws. E.g., Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U.S. 74, 76 (2005). And, as Mack concedes, in State v. Hutton, 53 Ohio St. 3d 36 (Ohio 1990), the Ohio Supreme Court held that the precise procedure the trial court used here \u2013 substituting an alternate juror for an original juror between the two phases of a capital case \u2013 complied with Ohio law, which mandates that only the \u201ctrial jury\u201d can impose a death sentence. Id. at 44-48 (construing Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.03(C)(2)(b); Ohio R. Crim. P. 24(F)).\n\nMack contends his case is distinguishable from Hutton because the alternate juror at issue was not \u201cproperly substituted,\u201d as Hutton requires. (Doc. 155 at 143 (quoting Hutton, 53 Ohio St. 3d at 45).) He argues that, unlike in Hutton, the alternate did not participate in the jury\u2019s guilt-phase deliberations and was therefore \u201cdeprived of critical information, thoughts, and insights regarding one of Mack\u2019s primary mitigating factors, residual doubt.\u201d (Id.) It is not clear, however, that the alternate juror in Hutton joined the jury\u2019s deliberations over guilt. After explaining that the trial court seated the alternate juror after\nthe defendant was convicted, it noted that the alternate \u201csat through the penalty phase and participated in all subsequent deliberations.\u201d *Hutton*, 53 Ohio St. 3d at 44-45 (emphasis added). But, regardless, the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in *Hutton* for finding the alternate juror part of the \u201ctrial jury\u201d for purposes of Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.03(C)(2)(b) still applies here:\n\n> Alternate jurors are selected in the same way as regular jurors and hear the same evidence. Since they see and hear the trial, they are as capable as regular jurors of considering the evidence admitted in the guilt phase, and quite as likely to entertain \u201cresidual doubts\u201d and weigh them in the defendant's favor.\n\n*Id.* at 45.\n\nAccordingly, this court is bound by the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s holding in *Hutton* and finds no legal or factual basis upon which to find a due process violation based on the trial court\u2019s substitution of a juror with an alternate juror before the sentencing phase of Mack\u2019s trial. This claim also lacks merit.\n\n7. **Consideration of statutory mitigating factors not raised by the defense**\n\nFor his next sub-claim, Mack asserts that the trial court improperly considered statutory mitigating factors not raised by the defense, which converted them into aggravating factors. (Doc. 155 at 144.) This claim, also reviewed *de novo*, fails for several reasons.\n\nFirst, Mack alleges only a violation of state law; he cites to no federal constitutional provision or case law. Second, he does not specify which statutory mitigating factors were allegedly improperly raised and exactly how that prejudiced him. Finally, as Respondent points out, even if a trial court\u2019s alleged error rises to the level of a due process violation, a\nstate supreme court can cure that error through its independent reweighing of aggravated and mitigating circumstances in reviewing a death sentence. *Hoffner v. Bradshaw*, 622 F.3d 487, 497 (6th Cir. 2010) (holding that \u201ceven if the trial court\u2019s alleged error rose to the level of a due process violation, the state supreme court cured it through independent reweighing\u201d). Here, the Ohio Supreme Court, in its independent review of Mack\u2019s death sentence, explicitly stated that it \u201c[w]eigh[ed] the aggravated circumstances against the evidence presented in mitigation,\u201d and found the aggravating circumstances outweighed those mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. *Mack*, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 516 (emphasis added).\n\n8. **Consideration of non-statutory aggravating circumstances**\n\nMack also argues that the trial court improperly considered non-statutory aggravating circumstances in determining Mack\u2019s death sentence when it stated in its sentencing opinion that it considered \u201cthe circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime \u2013 the robbery, the violence, and all the other aspects . . . .\u201d (Doc. 155 at 144-45 (quoting Doc. 149-1 at 124).) Mack raised this claim on direct review to state courts.\n\nThe last state court to address the merits of this claim was the state appellate court, which reasoned:\n\nAppellant also argues that the trial court improperly considered the nature and circumstances of the offense as an aggravating factor. Review of the trial court's opinion reveals that it refers to only one aggravating circumstance, the charged course of conduct. Moreover, the trial judge's reference to the nature and circumstances of the offense was permissible to explain why the evidence allowed the jury to find that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors. *State v. Stumpf* (1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, paragraph one of the syllabus. *State v. Combs* (1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 288. We also note that our independent review of the sentence would cure any deficiency in the trial court's sentencing decision. *State v. Landrum* (1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107.\nMack, 1993 WL 497052, at *32.\n\nMack does not discuss the state court\u2019s decision. However, as explained above in relation to Mack\u2019s challenge of a jury instruction that he alleged improperly advised the jury to consider non-statutory aggravating circumstances, a trial court\u2019s consideration of a non-statutory, \u201cimproper\u201d aggravating circumstance does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation unless it \u201cso infect[ed] the balancing process created by [state law] that it [was] constitutionally impermissible . . . .\u201d Barclay, 463 U.S. at 956. The state appellate court reasonably determined that in this case, it did not. As the state court of appeals noted, the trial court specified in its analysis of Mack\u2019s death sentence that it was only considering the one charged statutory aggravating circumstance. (Doc. 149-1 at 122-23.) And the statement of which Mack complains was merely a general reference to the evidence in the case contained in the court\u2019s conclusion paragraph. Moreover, as explained above, even if the trial court\u2019s alleged error rose to the level of a due process violation, the Ohio Supreme Court cured it through independent reweighing. Hoffner, 622 F.3d at 497.\n\nThe state court\u2019s decision, therefore, did not contravene or misapply Barclay or other clearly established Supreme Court precedent.\n\n9. Limitation of mitigating evidence\n\nMack further asserts that the trial court improperly limited the admission of mitigation evidence, including: (1) Carole Mancino\u2019s testimony; (2) Curtis Mack\u2019s testimony; (3) defense counsel\u2019s closing argument about electrocution as a method of execution; and (4) defense counsel\u2019s closing argument about a racist comment he overheard in the court house. (Doc. 155 at 145-46.)\nEven under *de novo* review, this claim lacks merit. As explained above in relation to Mack\u2019s other claims contesting trial-court evidentiary rulings (grounds nine through twelve), to the extent Mack\u2019s claims allege violations of Ohio evidentiary law, they are not cognizable on federal habeas unless they are \u201cso egregious that [they] result in a denial of fundamental fairness.\u201d *Bugh v. Mitchell*, 329 F.3d 496, 512 (6th Cir. 2003).\n\nAs to Carole Mancino and Curtis Mack\u2019s testimony, this court already has determined that the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow them to testify about prior inconsistent statements made by State witness Timothy Willis did not render Mack\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair. Mack does not specify what mitigation evidence Mancino and Mack would have presented had they been permitted to testify, and aside from their testimony concerning Willis\u2019 statements, there seems little they could have offered of such value that its absence resulted in a denial of fundamental fairness. Nor were the trial court\u2019s rulings limiting defense counsel\u2019s closing argument concerning electrocution and an overheard racist comment egregious enough to cause fundamental unfairness. As the judge instructed the jury, counsel\u2019s closing arguments \u201cwere designed to assist [the jury], but they were not evidence.\u201d (Doc. 150-5 (Trial Tr.) at 7.)\n\n10. **Failure to consider mitigating evidence**\n\nMack further maintains that the trial court erred by failing to consider Mack\u2019s arguments at sentencing regarding residual doubt based on \u201cthe facts being developed\u201d in Sowell\u2019s case. (Doc. 155 at 146-47.) He presented this argument to state courts on direct review. The last state court to address the claim, the state appellate court, decided:\n\nAppellant initially argues that the trial court's sentencing opinion failed to consider residual doubt as a mitigating factor. Appellant's claim lacks merit.\nWe acknowledge that residual doubt of a defendant's guilt may be properly considered in mitigation. *State v. Watson* (1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 1, 17. However, the court expressly stated in its opinion that it considered the unsworn statement of Clarence Mack wherein he apologized to the victim's family but denied any involvement in the victim's death. Further, the court in its opinion recognized its duty to consider the relevant evidence raised at trial, the testimony, other evidence, the defendant's statement, and arguments of counsel in order to determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors. Under these circumstances we find that the trial court properly considered residual doubt as a mitigating factor.\n\n*Mack*, 1993 WL 497052, at *31.\n\nMack again does not provide any analysis as to how this decision violates AEDPA\u2019s \u00a7 2254(d). He argues only in a conclusory manner that the failure of the trial court to consider a mitigating factor rendered his death sentence unconstitutional. (Doc. 155 at 146.) The state appellate court reasonably concluded, however, that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion demonstrated that it did in fact properly consider residual doubt as a mitigating factor. This decision was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.\n\n11. Admission of guilt-phase evidence in sentencing phase of trial\n\nFinally, Mack argues that the trial court improperly permitted the prosecutor to reintroduce all of the evidence from the guilt phase of trial into the sentencing phase. (Doc. 155 at 147.) He contends the trial court, in so ruling, misapplied the Ohio Supreme Court decision *State v. DePew*, 38 Ohio St. 3d 275 (Ohio 1988), and allowed the jury to consider non-statutory aggravating circumstances in violation of *Barclay v. Florida*, supra. (Id.) Mack never raised this claim in state court, and this court reviews the claim *de novo*.\n\nIn *DePew*, the Ohio Supreme Court announced:\nWe now hold that, pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(D)(1), the prosecutor, at the penalty stage of a capital proceeding, may introduce \u201c* * * any evidence raised at trial that is relevant to the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing * * *.\u201d While this appears to permit repetition of much or all that occurred during the guilt stage, nevertheless, a literal reading of the statute given to us by the General Assembly mandates such a result, especially in light of the prosecution's obligation to demonstrate, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that the aggravating circumstances the defendant was found guilty of committing are sufficient to outweigh the factors in mitigation. R.C. 2929.03(D)(1).\n\n*DePew*, 38 Ohio St. 3d at 282-83. Mack contends that the trial court erred in applying this holding to evidence of the aggravated murder, much of which was irrelevant to the aggravating circumstance at issue in his sentencing and prejudicial, such as the autopsy photos and autopsy protocol. (Doc. 155 at 147; Doc. 162 at 196.) But he does not provide any authority for this proposition from before the time of the trial. This court, therefore, is bound to the state trial court\u2019s interpretation of state law, as Mack did not present this claim on direct review in state court.\n\nMoreover, as noted above, a trial court\u2019s consideration of a non-statutory, \u201cimproper\u201d aggravating circumstance does not rise to the level of constitutional violation unless it \u201cso infect[ed] the balancing process created by [state law] that it [was] constitutionally impermissible . . . .\u201d *Barclay*, 463 U.S. at 956. And it did not do so here. As Ohio\u2019s high court observed in *DePew*, admitting all the evidence from the guilt phase of Mack\u2019s trial in the sentencing phase, while \u201cappear[ing] to permit repetition of much or all that occurred during the guilt stage,\u201d 38 Ohio St. 3d at 282-83, directly related to the statutory aggravating circumstance for which Mack was convicted: that \u201c[t]he offense was committed while the offender was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit . . . aggravated robbery . . . and . . .\nthe offender was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder . . . .\u201d Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.04(A)(7). This kind of repetition was not unduly prejudicial and did not \u201cso infect the balancing process created by [state law] that it [was] constitutionally impermissible . . . .\u201d Barclay, 463 U.S. at 956. This claim also fails.\n\nX. Sixteenth Ground for Relief: Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\nMack alleges for his sixteenth ground for relief that prosecutors rendered his trial fundamentally unfair through the following improper conduct: (1) vouching for State witnesses; (2) shifting the burden of proof; (3) commenting on Mack\u2019s post-Miranda silence; (4) commenting on Mack\u2019s unsworn statement; (5) misrepresenting aggravating circumstances; (6) commenting on Mack\u2019s alleged lack of remorse; (7) commenting on society\u2019s need for vengeance; (8) thwarting defense counsel\u2019s admission of mitigation evidence and closing argument; (9) arguing that the sentencing verdict was only a recommendation; (10) introducing victim-impact evidence in closing argument; and (11) introducing all of the guilt-phase evidence into sentencing. (Doc. 155 at 148-55.) Respondent contends this ground is partially procedurally defaulted and meritless. (Doc. 158 at 85-90.)\n\nA. Procedural Posture\n\nRespondent concedes that Mack raised sub-claims (3), (4), and (5), as listed above, in state courts on direct appeal, where they were decided on the merits, and they are preserved for habeas review. She argues that sub-claims (1), (2), and (6) through (11), however, are procedurally defaulted because they were never raised on direct appeal and Mack is now precluded from doing so. (Doc. 158 at 86-89.)\nMack correctly counters that he did in fact raise sub-claims (6) and (10) in state courts on direct appeal, where they were adjudicated on the merits, and they are therefore preserved for review. (Doc. 162 at 202.) Sub-claims (7) through (9) and (11), he asserts, were raised in state courts as the underlying grounds for appellate-counsel ineffective-assistance claims in an application to reopen the direct appeal under Ohio Appellate Rule 26(B). (Id. at 203.) As the court discussed in relation to Mack\u2019s first and second grounds for relief, this argument is meritless. Mack never presented these independent claims in state court, and because he no longer can do so, they are procedurally defaulted. Moreover, as shown below, Mack has not demonstrated cause and prejudice based on the ineffective assistance of counsel or his actual innocence to excuse the defaults. Sub-claims (1), (2), and (7) through (9) and (11), therefore, are procedurally defaulted.\n\nB. Merits Analysis\n\nAlternatively, each of these claims also lacks merit. The Supreme Court established the test for claims of prosecutorial misconduct in *Darden v. Wainwright*, 477 U.S. 168 (1986): \u201cThe relevant question is whether the prosecutors\u2019 [conduct] \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019\u201d Id. at 181 (quoting *Donnelly v. DeChristoforo*, 416 U.S. 637, 642 (1974)). The Court emphasized that \u201cthe appropriate standard of review for such a claim on writ of habeas corpus is \u2018the narrow one of due process, and not the broad exercise of supervisory power.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting *Donnelly*, 416 U.S. at 642); see also *Byrd v. Collins*, 209 F.3d 486, 529 (6th Cir. 2000) (\u201cWe do not possess supervisory powers over state court trials.\u201d); *Cook v. Bordenkircher*, 602 F.2d 117, 119 n.5 (6th Cir. 1979) (\u201c[I]t is the responsibility of the [state courts] to\npolice their prosecutors; we have no such authority.\u201d). \u201c[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct,\u201d therefore, \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d Phillips, 455 U.S. at 219.\n\nThe Darden standard \u201cis a very general one, leaving courts \u2018more leeway . . . in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations\u2019 . . .\u201d Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. 37, 48-49 (2012) (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 664 (2004)) (rejecting the Sixth Circuit\u2019s multi-step test for prosecutorial misconduct). As the Supreme Court advised decades ago,\n\nIn reviewing criminal cases, it is particularly important for appellate courts to relive the whole trial imaginatively and not to extract from episodes in isolation abstract questions of evidence and procedure. To turn a criminal trial into a quest for error no more promotes the ends of justice than to acquiesce in low standards of criminal prosecution.\n\nJohnson v. United States, 318 U.S. 189, 202 (1943) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).\n\nTo determine whether a prosecutor\u2019s improper comment was sufficiently flagrant to warrant reversal, courts consider: (1) whether the conduct and remarks of the prosecutor tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the conduct or remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) whether the evidence against the defendant was strong. Macias v. Makowski, 291 F.3d 447, 452 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting United States v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777, 783 (6th Cir. 2001)). \u201c\u2018The prosecution necessarily has \u2018wide latitude\u2019 during closing argument to respond to the defense\u2019s strategies, evidence and arguments.\u2019\u201d Wogenstahl v. Mitchell, 668 F.3d 307, 329 (6th Cir. 2012) (quoting Bedford v. Collins, 567 F.3d 225, 233 (6th Cir. 2009)). Whether the prosecution\u2019s closing argument is improper depends on the\ncircumstances of the case and \u201cwhat the defense has said or done (or likely will say or do).\u201d\n\nId. The Supreme Court has cautioned,\n\n[A] criminal conviction is not to be lightly overturned on the basis of a prosecutor\u2019s comments standing alone, for the statements or conduct must be viewed in context; only by so doing can it be determined whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct affected the fairness of the trial.\n\nUnited States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 11 (1985).\n\nDarden itself concerned comments the prosecution made in closing argument. The Court found some of the comments at issue \u201cundoubtedly were improper.\u201d Darden, 477 U.S. at 180. Some implied that the death penalty would be the only guarantee against a future similar act; others incorporated the defense\u2019s use of the word \u201canimal\u201d; and several were offensive, reflecting an emotional reaction to the case. Id. But the Court concluded that in the broader context of the trial, the prosecutorial statements complained of did not deprive the petitioner of a fair trial. Id. at 181-83. It noted that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument \u201cdid not manipulate or misstate the evidence, nor did it implicate other specific rights of the accused such as the right to counsel or the right to remain silent.\u201d Id. at 182. Also, \u201c[m]uch of the objectionable content was invited by or was responsive to the opening summation of the defense.\u201d Id. The trial court also instructed the jurors several times that their decision was to be made on the basis of the evidence alone, and the arguments of counsel were not evidence. Id. And the weight of the evidence against the petitioner was \u201cheavy,\u201d the Court observed, including \u201coverwhelming eyewitness and circumstantial evidence to support a finding of guilt on all charges,\u201d which \u201creduced the likelihood that the jury\u2019s decision was influenced by argument.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nProsecutorial misconduct may not warrant reversal of a sentence or verdict if the reviewing court finds that the comment amounted to harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. See *Lundgren v. Mitchell*, 440 F.3d 754, 780 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing *Chapman v. California*, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967)). Courts assess the prejudicial impact of prosecutorial misconduct under the \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d standard set forth in *Brecht v. Abrahamson*, 507 U.S. 619 (1993). *Moore v. Mitchell*, 708 F.3d 760, 799 (6th Cir. 2013) (citing *Fry v. Pliler*, 551 U.S. 112, 121\u201322 (2007)).\n\n1. **Improper vouching for State witnesses**\n\nMack\u2019s initial claim of prosecutorial misconduct is that the prosecutor improperly bolstered the testimony of two State witnesses. (Doc. 148-49.) The court reviews this claim *de novo* as Mack never raised it in state courts.\n\n\u201cImproper vouching occurs when a prosecutor supports the credibility of a witness by indicating a personal belief in the witness\u2019s credibility thereby placing the prestige of the [prosecutor] behind that witness.\u201d *United States v. Francis*, 170 F.3d 546, 550 (6th Cir. 1999). It generally involves either \u201cblunt comments,\u201d such as remarks asserting a belief in a witness\u2019 credibility, or comments that \u201cimply that the prosecutor has special knowledge of facts not in front of the jury or of the credibility and truthfulness of witnesses and their testimony,\u201d such as argument that a witness testifying under a plea agreement was in jeopardy if the court or government did not find the testimony truthful. *Id.* (citing *United States v. Kerr*, 981 F.2d 1050, 1053 (9th Cir. 1992); *United States v. Carroll*, 26 F.3d 1380, 1388 (6th Cir. 1994)).\n\nMack first argues that the prosecutor improperly bolstered the testimony of the\nState\u2019s ballistics expert, Detective Thomas Lucey, who opined that, based on his tests and examinations, the gun found on Mack at the time of his arrest fired the bullet that was recovered from Mr. Sanelli\u2019s clothing and three spent shell casings recovered at the murder scene. Mack contends the prosecutors vouched for Lucey\u2019s credibility \u201cwith argument that . . . the defense expert corroborated his testimony . . . [and] other \u2018experts\u2019 in his lab corroborated his work.\u201d (Doc. 155 at 148 (citing Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 29-30, 40).) The defense ballistics expert and Lucey\u2019s colleagues did not testify at trial. The record, however, does not bear this out.\n\nOn direct examination, the prosecutor twice properly elicited Lucey\u2019s testimony about standard procedures in Lucey\u2019s lab, one of which was \u201cto have two or three or even more individuals view [each scientist\u2019s] findings.\u201d (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 40 (Lucey Test.).) The prosecutor made no improper \u201cargument\u201d about Lucy\u2019s colleagues reviewing his work; an expert\u2019s methodology is an appropriate and permissible area of inquiry.\n\nMack\u2019s allegations of three instances where prosecutors vouched for Lucey\u2019s testimony through questioning or argument regarding the defense\u2019s ballistics expert also fail. While questioning Lucey on recross-examination, defense counsel asked Lucey if an opinion was his own or his supervisor\u2019s. (Id. at 59.) Lucey responded that it was \u201c[b]oth of [their] opinions, and also the outside expert that examined the bullets.\u201d (Id.) Then, on redirect examination, the prosecutor asked Lucey if the \u201coutside expert\u201d he had just mentioned worked on the State\u2019s behalf. (Id. at 61.) Defense counsel promptly objected and the court sustained the objection; Lucey did not answer. (Id.) In closing argument, Prosecutor Ghazoul stated:\nMr. Ghazoul: And, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Mancino made or placed a lot of questions in front of Detective Lucey regarding his testing. But the test results are uncontroverted. You didn\u2019t see anybody else getting up there saying they weren\u2019t.\n\nMr. Mancino: Objection.\n\nThe Court: Overruled.\n\nMr. Ghazoul: The outside expert wasn\u2019t hired by the State.\n\nMr. Mancino: Objection.\n\nThe Court: Objection sustained\n\n(Doc. 150-4 (Trial Tr.) at 189.) And on rebuttal closing, Prosecutor Bombik argued:\n\nMr. Bombik: . . . And let me tell you one thing right now, ladies and gentlemen, in a case like this, in any criminal case where there is physical evidence, Mr. Mancino has an opportunity to have any expert in the world if he chooses to examine this gun.\n\nMr. Mancino: Objection.\n\nMr. Bombik: And these findings, he has got that right \u2013\n\nThe Court: Overruled.\n\n(Id. at 272-73.) The court also instructed the jury before its deliberations to disregard any question to which the court had sustained an objection. (Doc. 150-5 (Trial Tr.) at 7-8.)\n\nEven if these comments constituted improper vouching because they signaled that the defense either had a ballistics expert who agreed with Lucey or failed to obtain one who did not, they were not so flagrant as to rise to the level of a due process violation. The comments were few and isolated, and they did not prejudice Mack, as two of the three drew immediate objections, which the court sustained and later instructed the jury to disregard.\n\nSee Greer v. Miller, 483 U.S. 756, 766 (1987) (\u201cThe sequence of events in this case\u2014a\nsingle question, an immediate objection, and two curative instructions\u2014clearly indicates that the prosecutor\u2019s improper question did not violate [the petitioner\u2019s] due process rights.\u201d) (footnote omitted); Puertas v. Overton, 168 Fed. Appx. 689, 701-02 (6th Cir. 2006) (\u201cAny prejudice, moreover, was cured when the trial court sustained [an] objection to the comments and instructed the jury not to consider them in reaching its verdict.\u201d); United States v. Carter, 236 F.3d 777, 787 (6th Cir. 2001) (\u201cOrdinarily, a court should not overturn a criminal conviction on the basis of a prosecutor\u2019s comments alone, especially where the district court has given the jury an instruction that may cure the error. As a general matter, juries are presumed to understand and follow directions from the court.\u201d) (internal citations omitted).\n\nMack also contends the prosecutor improperly bolstered the testimony of Timothy Willis, the State\u2019s key witness, by stating in his closing argument that while in prison for a pending criminal matter, Willis was contacted by defense investigators and told them \u201che didn\u2019t want to say anything at that time.\u201d (Doc. 155 at 149 (quoting Doc. 150-4 (Trial Tr.) at 195).) Mack argues this was improper because prosecutors knew this was not true due to Carole Mancino\u2019s proffered, but excluded, testimony recounting new and conflicting information Willis provided to her regarding Mr. Sanelli\u2019s murder. (Id. (citing Doc. 150-4 (Trial Tr.) at 122-26).) The prosecutor\u2019s remark to the jury, however, accurately reflected Willis\u2019 trial testimony. Willis acknowledged on cross-examination that he spoke to the defense investigators and told them a few things, but \u201cdidn't say nothing pertaining to the situation that I told on these boys. See, I'm trying to protect myself. I\u2019m in jail here. I didn't tell her nothing that would make her believe that I said something about these boys\u2019\ncase. I didn\u2019t want her to know nothing.\u201d (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 145-50 (Willis Test.).) And that testimony did not necessarily contradict what Carole Mancino told the judge Willis said to her in the defense\u2019s proffer of her testimony. (Doc. 150-4 (Trial Tr.) at 123-26.) As the prosecutor explained in opposing Carole Mancino\u2019s proffered testimony, Willis\u2019 testimony that he would not \u201csay anything\u201d to the defense investigators was not untrue; what Willis said was that he may have been willing to tell Carole Mancino some things he knew about the events surrounding the murder, but he would not further implicate Mack or his co-defendants while he was in the same prison with them, which he did not do. (Id. at 126-27.) The prosecutor included this portion of Willis\u2019 testimony in his closing argument in the context of explaining how Willis\u2019 involvement in the case evolved from being an anonymous source to a cooperating witness. This was not improper vouching.\n\nThis claim, therefore, lacks merit.\n\n2. Shifting the burden of proof\n\nMack next asserts that the prosecutor improperly shifted the burden of proof to him by stating in his closing argument that \u201cnow the defense has to try and fill these holes, all these holes in this, in their case.\u201d (Doc. 155 at 149 (quoting Doc. 150-4 (Trial Tr.) at 197).) Even if this claim were not procedurally defaulted, it would fail. This isolated remark did not suggest that it was Mack\u2019s burden to prove his innocence. \u201c[A] prosecutor is allowed \u2013 indeed, expected \u2013 to argue reasonable inferences from the evidence and to point out inconsistencies or holes in the defense.\u201d Jeffries v. Burton, 715 Fed. Appx. 490, 492-93 (6th Cir. 2017) (citing Bates v. Bell, 402 F.3d 635, 646 (6th Cir. 2005)). This was permissible comment.\n3. Commenting on Mack\u2019s post-Miranda silence\n\nMack also claims that the prosecutor made improper comments during his closing argument about his post-Miranda silence when he argued that Mack\u2019s initial account during the police\u2019s post-arrest interrogation of how he obtained the gun that was found in his possession when he was arrested and his alibi changed after the detectives informed him of the results of the ballistics tests and also conflicted with defense witnesses\u2019 trial testimony. (Doc. 155 at 149-50 (citing Doc. 150-4 (Trial Tr.) at 285-86).)\n\nThe state appellate court on direct review was the last state court to address this claim, reasoning:\n\nAppellant initially argues the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct by commenting on his post-Miranda silence.\n\nComments by prosecutors on the post-arrest silence or refusal to testify by defendants have always been looked upon with extreme disfavor because they raise an inference of guilt from a defendant's decision to remain silent. State v. Thompson (1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 4. Such comments penalize a defendant for choosing to exercise a constitutional right and thus prosecutors must take care not to equate the defendant's silence to guilt. See State v. Rogers (1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 70; Doyle v. Ohio (1976), 426 U.S. 610.\n\nIn the present case, the appellant voluntarily chose not to exercise his constitutional right to remain silent. Herein, the alleged improper comments of the prosecutor did not reflect upon the post-arrest silence of the appellant. The comments were directed at the conflicting nature of appellant's initial statements to police and his subsequent statement after being confronted with the ballistics test results which connected the appellant's gun with Peter Sanelli's murder. We thus find that the prosecutor's comments were proper and did not render appellant's trial fundamentally unfair.\n\nMack, 1993 WL 497052, at *25. Mack does not address this decision.\n\nAs Mack argues, the state may not comment on a defendant\u2019s choice to exercise his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to impeach him if the defendant\u2019s silence\noccurred after his arrest and receipt of Miranda warnings. Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 618-19 (1976). Here, however, as the state court noted, Mack waived his right to remain silent during his post-arrest interrogations and voluntarily answered many of Detective Qualey\u2019s questions until he eventually requested counsel and the interview ended. (See Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 191-92 (Qualey Test.).)\n\nMoreover, as the state court reasonably determined, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not concern Mack\u2019s assertion of his right to counsel and silence at all, but accurately highlighted the inconsistencies between Mack\u2019s initial statement to the police about where and when he obtained the gun and his alibi, his later statement to police about the gun after learning of the results of the ballistics test, and the trial testimony of his witnesses on those issues. After his arrest, Mack initially told the police that he bought the gun the night before from someone whose name he did not know and was home taking a bath the night of the murder. (Id. at 193-94.) Then, after being confronted with the results of the ballistics tests on his gun that same evening, Mack told them he lent his gun to a man named Dee, whose address and real name he did not know, \u201ca couple days\u201d before and noticed it had been fired. (Id. at 196.) At trial, however, defense witness John Scott testified that Mack bought the gun from Willis the day after the murder. (Doc. 150-4 (Trial Tr.) at 8 (Scott Test.).) And Demill Blue testified that Mack was at her house the night of the murder. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 228-32 (Blue Test.).) The prosecutor\u2019s comments about Mack\u2019s statements to police, therefore, were proper, and this claim lacks merit.\n\n23 For a full discussion of Mack\u2019s waiver of his right to remain silent, see the court\u2019s analysis of Mack\u2019s seventh ground for relief, concluding that the detectives\u2019 post-arrest interrogation of Mack did not violate his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\n4. Commenting on Mack\u2019s unsworn statement\n\nMack further complains that the prosecutor improperly commented on his unsworn statement during his sentencing-phase closing argument, violating Mack\u2019s Fifth Amendment right not to testify. (Doc. 155 at 150.) Mack chose to make an unsworn statement to the jury during the penalty phase of his trial, as he was entitled to do under Ohio law. See Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.03(D)(1) (permitting a capital defendant to present an unsworn statement during the sentencing phase without being subjected to cross-examination). Before Mack gave his statement, the trial court advised the jury of his right to do so. (Doc. 150-5 (Trial Tr.) at 134.) The prosecutor later commented on Mack\u2019s unsworn statement in the following portion of his closing argument:\n\nMr. Bombik: Clarence Mack took the witness stand. And he was the only witness in this whole case who did not have to take an oath.\n\nMr. Mancino: Objection.\n\nThe Court: Overruled.\n\nMr. Bombik: And he gave you a statement. And he said, \u201cI don't know nothing about it. I don\u2019t know nothing about it.\u201d\n\nDoes he offer you any explanation in his statement as to why two days later he is caught carrying the murder weapon that killed Peter Charles Sanelli?\n\nDoes he offer you any explanation in his statement as to why he was in the company two days afterwards with Reginald Germany and that Reginald Germany so happened to have the other murder weapon on his person?\n\nDoes he offer you any explanation in his statement as to why that little nail was found in his buddy, Tom Sowell\u2019s, pocket \u2013\n\nMr. Mancino: Objection.\nThe Court: Overruled.\n\nMr. Bombik: \u2013 two days after the murder of Peter Charles Sanelli, Sr.? And why that nail was remarkably similar in size to the nails that were found in Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car?\n\nDoes he offer you any explanation as to why in his house in January, with a dated receipt January 3rd is a holster package which matches up as identical to the make, size and brand of the holster he was carrying two days after the murder?\n\nDoes he offer you any explanation whatsoever? And he\u2019s in a perfect position to give you that explanation.\n\n\u201cI know nothing about it.\u201d\n\n(Id. at 165-66.)\n\nMack raised this claim on direct review in state courts, which adjudicated it on the merits. The state appellate court, the last state court to address the claim, decided:\n\nAppellant next argues that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct by improperly commenting on the unsworn nature of his statement made during the penalty phase of his trial. Specifically, appellant objects to the prosecutor's comments that the appellant did not offer any explanation as to why he was found in the company of others who also possessed weapons involved in the fatal shooting.\n\nIn the penalty phase of a capital trial, a prosecutor may only make limited remarks concerning the defendant's unsworn statement. The prosecution may comment that the defendant's statement has not been made under oath or affirmation. However, in so commenting, the prosecution must carefully tailor its remarks so as only to remind the jury that the defendant's statements, in contrast to the testimony of all other witnesses, was not made under oath. State v. Durr (1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 86, 94-95, citing State v. DePew (1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275.\n\nThe prosecutor's statement does violate the DePew standard as it improperly comments on the appellant's unsworn statement. However, in light of the overwhelming nature of the aggravating circumstance compared to the mitigating factors, we find the prosecutor's remark was harmless and did not rise to a level sufficient to warrant a reversal.\nMack, 1993 WL 497052, at *27. Again, Mack does not address this decision and how it violates AEDPA\u2019s \u00a7 2254(d).\n\nA prosecutor\u2019s comment about a criminal defendant\u2019s failure to testify violates the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 614 (1965); see also Lundgren, 440 F.3d at 780 (\u201cA prosecutor\u2019s comment on a defendant\u2019s silence is improper and may rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct requiring reversal on appellate review.\u201d). In Ohio, if a defendant chooses to make an unsworn statement, the prosecution \u201cmay remind[] the jury that the defendant\u2019s statement was not made under oath, in contrast to the testimony of all other witnesses.\u201d DePew v. Anderson, 311 F.3d 742, 745 (6th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). But it \u201cmay go no further and may not disparage the defendant\u2019s decision not to testify under oath.\u201d Bedford, 567 F.3d at 236. It may not comment \u201cextensively\u201d on the issue. Moore, 708 F.3d at 799.\n\nThis court agrees with state appellate court that the prosecutor\u2019s extended argument regarding Mack\u2019s unsworn statement constituted impermissible comment on Mack\u2019s assertion of his right to refrain from testifying. Rather than limiting his remarks to Mack\u2019s choice to make an unsworn statement, the prosecutor\u2019s series of rhetorical questions \u201carguably invit[ed] the jury to draw an adverse inference from the fact that [Mack] never testified under oath at all.\u201d Bedford, 567 F.3d at 236; see also Moore, 708 F.3d at 800 (finding prosecutor\u2019s rhetorical question about why the petitioner did not explain an aspect of his criminal conduct \u201cdrew attention to [his] choice not to testify under oath and may have encroached upon [his] Fifth Amendment right not to testify against himself\u201d).\nNonetheless, as the state court reasonably concluded, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not have a substantial and injurious effect upon the jury\u2019s sentence. Given the judge\u2019s admonition to the jury regarding Mack\u2019s right to present an unsworn statement, the remarks did not tend to mislead the jury. Nor did the comments address the aggravating circumstances or mitigating factors. See Moore, 708 F.3d at 800. Finally, the state court reasonably relied on its reweighing of the aggravating circumstances and mitigating factors to eliminate the potential for prejudice. See id.; Bedford, 567 F.3d at 236; Lundgren, 440 F.3d at 781-83.\n\nThe state appellate court, therefore, did not contravene or misapply clearly established Supreme Court precedent in rejecting this claim.\n\n5. Misrepresenting aggravating circumstances; and commenting on Mack\u2019s alleged lack of remorse\n\nMack further contends that, in its closing argument in the penalty phase of trial, the prosecution improperly misrepresented the aggravating circumstances by: referring to the nature of the murder as aggravating circumstances, including the number of times Mr. Sanelli was shot; using the term \u201caggravating circumstances\u201d in the plural when there was just one; and commenting on Mack\u2019s alleged lack of remorse. (Doc. 155 at 150-52, 154 (citing Doc. 150-5 (Trial Tr.) at 72, 139, 143, 144-45, 147, 163, 167).)\n\nMack raised this claim in state court on direct appeal, and the state appellate court, the last court to address the claim, reasoned:\n\nAppellant next argues that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct when he argued that the nature and circumstances of the offense were aggravating circumstances and also commented on appellant's lack of remorse. Specifically, appellant contends the following comments by the prosecutor denied him a fair trial:\nAggravating circumstances, I would hope they are clearer now, you can define what they are now. Look at some of the examples in this case.\n\nPeter Charles Sanelli, shot, not once * * * not twice, but three times with the use of a firearm, a gun. He could have been ordered from that car. He could have been given a chance to abandon the 1987 Plymouth Horizon. * * *\n\nPeter Charles Sanelli, left to die in the cold in the snow. And the laughing afterwards of Clarence Mack. Peter Charles Sanelli was not important to Clarence Mack.\n\nThis was senseless * * * It was brutal. It was revolting. * * *\n\nIn *State v. Jackson* (1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 39, the Supreme Court of Ohio concluded that defendant was not denied a fair trial despite the prosecutor's improper remarks on the defendant's lack of remorse and the assertion that the nature and circumstances of the offense were aggravating circumstances. In so holding the court noted that the trial judge correctly instructed the jury on the aggravating circumstance and that only one existed. *Id.* at 40.\n\nSimilarly, in the present case, the trial judge correctly instructed the jury on the aggravating circumstance and that only one existed. We thus find that the prosecutor's argument when viewed in its entirety did not deny appellant a fair trial.\n\n*Mack*, 1993 WL 497052, at *26. Mack does not address this decision.\n\nEven assuming the challenged remarks of the prosecutor about aggravating circumstances and Mack\u2019s apparent lack of remorse were improper, the state court reasonably found that the comments did not \u201cso infect[] the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d *Darden*, 477 U.S. at 181 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The remarks did not tend to mislead the jury or unduly prejudice Mack. *See Wickline v. Mitchell*, 319 F.3d 813, 823-24 (6th Cir. 2003) (finding prosecutor\u2019s comments about nonstatutory aggravating circumstances and the petitioner\u2019s lack of remorse, even if improper, did not rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct because they did not mislead the sentencer or prejudice the petitioner). They\nalso did not constitute overly heated rhetoric that might have \u201cresult[ed] in inflamed passions\u201d against Mack. *Darden*, 477 U.S. at 182. Finally, the trial court instructed the jury on just one aggravating circumstance (Doc. 150-5 (Trial Tr.) at 174-75), and defense counsel addressed the inaccuracy of the prosecutor\u2019s comments in his closing argument (*id.* at 149). *See Jackson v. Anderson*, 141 F. Supp. 2d 811, 870 (N.D. Ohio 2001) (Economus, J.) (finding no due process violation where, as here, prosecutor referred to aggravating \u201ccircumstances\u201d although only one aggravating circumstance existed, remarked on petitioner\u2019s lack of compassion and remorse, and asserted that the nature and circumstances of the offense were \u201cwhat really warrants the death penalty,\u201d but trial judge correctly instructed the jury on the one aggravating circumstance).\n\nThe state court\u2019s decision, therefore, did not contravene or misapply Supreme Court precedent.\n\n6. **Introducing all of the guilt-phase evidence into sentencing and preventing defense counsel\u2019s admission of mitigation evidence and closing argument**\n\nMack also claims that the prosecution violated his due process rights during the sentencing phase of his trial by introducing all of the guilt-phase evidence and preventing defense counsel\u2019s admission of mitigation evidence and closing argument. (Doc. 155 at 151-52.) This court already has found on *de novo* review, in considering Mack\u2019s fifteenth ground for relief, that the trial court did not err in allowing all of the State\u2019s guilt-phase evidence into sentencing and in not permitting defense counsel\u2019s admission of certain mitigation evidence and closing argument. Accordingly, it finds no constitutionally impermissible prosecutorial conduct based on the same State actions.\n7. Commenting on society\u2019s need for vengeance as an aggravating circumstance\n\nMack further contends that the prosecution improperly \u201cargued that society\u2019s need for vengeance was an aggravating circumstance.\u201d (Doc. 155 at 151.) He cites the prosecutor\u2019s remark, for example, that the death penalty \u201creflects a limit that the State, the people of Ohio, our society will tolerate to a certain degree, past that degree, the toleration ends.\u201d (Doc. 150-5 (Trial Tr.) at 144.) In another instance, Mack complains, the prosecutor said of Ohio\u2019s death penalty, \u201cAnd basically what they\u2019re saying is that there comes a point in time when society becomes fed up, completely fed up with certain behavior.\u201d (Id. at 163.) And the prosecutor exhorted the jury to \u201cexpress the conscience of the community\u201d in rendering its sentence. (Id. at 168.) Mack never presented this claim to state courts, so the court reviews it de novo.\n\nThese comments did not rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor was not suggesting that society\u2019s need for vengeance was an aggravating circumstance, as Mack argues. Rather, he was expounding on the purpose of the death penalty and urging the jury to find that the aggravating circumstance in the case called for that harshest of society\u2019s punishments. As the Sixth Circuit has observed in rejecting a similar claim, \u201cWhen considered in context, these statements are general background information on the death penalty and the need to punish guilty people, rather than an impassioned command that the jurors must recommend death based on some amorphous societal obligation.\u201d Beuke v. Houk, 537 F.3d 618, 647 (6th Cir. 2008); see also Byrd, 209 F.3d at 538-39 (noting that the prosecutor\u2019s comments about the death penalty were not necessarily improper because he did not \u201cask the jury to send a message to other potential\nmurderers or robbers,\u201d rather he discussed \u201cthe purpose of capital punishment as a way of arguing that the jury should find that these purposes would be served by imposing the death penalty on [p]etitioner\u201d); *Hicks v. Collins*, 384 F.3d 204, 219 (6th Cir. 2004) (acknowledging that a prosecutor may properly make \u201cgeneral references to the societal need to punish guilty people\u201d). Indeed, \u201c[n]othing prevents the government from appealing to the jurors\u2019 sense of justice.\u201d *Bedford*, 567 F.3d at 234 (citing *Coe v. Bell*, 161 F.3d 320, 351 (6th Cir. 1998)). Also, the trial court instructed the jurors to \u201cmake [their] findings with intelligence and impartiality and without bias, sympathy or prejudice\u201d (Doc. 150-5 (Trial Tr.) at 32), and that counsel\u2019s arguments were not evidence (id. at 7). \u201c[J]uries are presumed to follow their instructions,\u201d *Richardson v. Marsh*, 481 U.S. 200, 211 (1987), and there is no reason to believe that the jury did not follow those admonitions. This claim lacks merit.\n\n8. **Arguing that the sentencing verdict was only a recommendation**\n\nMack next argues that the prosecutor \u201cimproperly misled the jury and minimized the jury\u2019s sense of duty by arguing that the sentencing verdict was only a recommendation.\u201d (Doc. 155 at 153.) The court reviews this claim *de novo*, as Mack never presented it to state courts. However, Mack raised this same claim in relation to the trial court\u2019s sentencing jury instructions in his thirteenth ground for relief, and the claim fails for the reasons already discussed.\n\n9. **Introducing victim-impact evidence in closing argument**\n\nFinally, Mack contends that the prosecutor improperly presented victim-impact evidence in his closing argument. (Doc. 155 at 153-54.) Mack raised this claim on direct\nappeal in state courts. The last state court to address the claims\u2019 merits, the state appellate court, decided:\n\nAppellant next argues that the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct by introducing victim impact evidence in closing argument during the penalty phase of trial. Specifically, appellant contends statements by the prosecutor that Peter Sanelli was shot \u201cnot once, not twice, but three times\u201d and that he could have been ordered out of the car, but was not given the chance (Tr. 1288) and that there was much more to Peter Sanelli \u201cother than a name\u201d (Tr. 1290) constitutes improper victim impact statements by the prosecutor.\n\nIn *Booth v. Maryland* (1987), 482 U.S. 496, the United States Supreme Court held unconstitutional the introduction of victim impact evidence during the sentencing phase of a capital trial. The court found that victim impact evidence included the emotional trauma suffered by the victim's family and personal characteristics of the victim. In *State v. Post* (1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 380, the Ohio Supreme Court noted that while the Ohio General Assembly did not specifically prohibit the use of victim impact statements, it would follow the Supreme Court's mandate in Booth. Moreover, in *State v. Williams* (1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 346, it was held that such evidence is admissible if offered to establish facts relevant to the crime.\n\nIn *Payne v. Tennessee* (1991), 501 U.S. 808, 111 S.Ct. 2597, the United States Supreme Court overruled *Booth* and permitted the use of victim impact evidence in some situations. In *State v. Evans* (1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 238, the Ohio Supreme Court recently acknowledged Payne and held that victim impact statements were \u201cno longer precluded per se.\u201d\n\nWe find that the challenged remark of the prosecutor does not constitute a victim impact statement as it is only a recitation of the facts brought out during trial. We further find that the prosecutor's comments in this case fall within the prescribed limits of *Payne* and *Evans*.\n\n*Mack*, 1993 WL 497052, at *26. Mack does not address this decision.\n\nAs the state court explained, while the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in *Payne v. Tennessee*, 501 U.S. 808 (1991), removed any *per se* constitutional bar to a prosecutor\u2019s use of victim-impact evidence, it recognized that where \u201cevidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair, the Due Process Clause . . .\nprovides a mechanism for relief.\u201d *Id.* at 825 (citing *Darden*, 477 U.S. at 179-83).\n\n\u201c[E]xcessive or prejudicial references to victim-impact evidence might \u2018so infect[ ] the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019\u201d *Beuke*, 537 F.3d at 648 n.9 (citations omitted). The Sixth Circuit has rejected a habeas petitioner\u2019s prosecutorial-misconduct claim based on the prosecutor\u2019s introduction of victim-impact evidence during the guilt-phase closing argument, where, even if improper, the remarks were \u201crelatively isolated, were not extensive, and were only a small part of a closing argument that focused heavily on summarizing the evidence presented at trial.\u201d *Byrd*, 209 F.3d at 532. The court also noted in that case that the trial court instructed the jury that the closing arguments were not evidence, and the prosecutor began his closing argument by asking the jurors to bear that in mind. *Id.* at 533. And in another case, the circuit court found testimony about a victim\u2019s children was not constitutionally improper, as it was \u201cminimal and largely insignificant\u201d at less that one-half page of transcript testimony and \u201cnot inflammatory.\u201d *Beuke*, 537 F.3d at 640.\n\nHere, too, the prosecutor\u2019s challenged remarks were isolated \u2013 accounting for less than one page of the transcript \u2013 relatively insignificant, and not inflammatory. The comments, therefore, cannot be said to have \u201crendered the entire trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d *Byrd*, 209 F.3d at 533 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Ohio court of appeals reasonably found no due process violation with regard to these comments, and its decision neither contravened nor misapplied Supreme Court precedent.\n\n10. **Cumulative impact**\n\nFinally, Mack asserts that the cumulative effect of this alleged misconduct rendered\nhis trial unfair. (Doc. 155 at 154-55.) The \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of multiple acts of misconduct may be considered. See Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 89 (1935).\n\nHowever, courts must consider the impropriety or effect of a prosecutor\u2019s conduct at trial in the broader context in which the prosecutor\u2019s conduct took place. Darden, 477 U.S. at 182.\n\nViewing all of Mack\u2019s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct cumulatively and in the context of the entire trial, his claims do not entitle him to habeas relief. There are few instances of improper conduct among these claims, and even when those that verge on improper are viewed cumulatively, Mack has failed to demonstrate that the misconduct was \u201cso pronounced and persistent that it permeate[d] the entire atmosphere of the trial . . . .\u201d Beuke, 537 F.3d at 656 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As the Supreme Court has long held, \u201c[a litigant] is entitled to a fair trial but not a perfect one, for there are no perfect trials.\u201d McDonough Power Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 553 (1984) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). This claim, too, is denied.\n\nXI. Fourth, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Grounds for Relief: Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel\n\nMack claims that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of trial counsel in his fourth, seventeenth, and eighteenth grounds for relief. (Doc. 155 at 60-65; 155-89.) Specifically, he alleges that his trial counsel failed to: (1) question potential jurors about race and capital punishment during voir dire; (2) investigate and pursue arguments and evidence that Mack was not the principal offender in the guilt phase of trial; (3) lodge timely and relevant objections to (a) Willis\u2019 testimony regarding his fear of Mack and his co-defendants, (b) the trial court\u2019s reasonable-doubt jury instruction, and (c) the court\u2019s verdict-as-recommendation jury instruction; (4) protect Mack\u2019s right to be present at the\njury view; (5) act as counsel (Carole Mancino); (6) lay a proper foundation to impeach Willis and ensure that Carole Mancino testified; (7) obtain an independent ballistics test; (8) conduct a reasonable investigation into the State\u2019s case in chief during the guilt phase of trial by (a) investigating and calling five witnesses to testify, (b) obtaining the statements of State witnesses Timothy Willis and William Lekas, and (c) discovering that the Fairfax Recreational Center was closed on the day of the murder; (9) conduct a sufficient investigation of mitigation evidence; and (10) argue that Mack was not the principal offender in the sentencing phase of trial. Respondent argues these claims are either procedurally defaulted or meritless. (Doc. 158 at 54-56, 90-101.)\n\nA. Procedural Posture\n\n1. Sub-claims (3)(b), (5), and (6)\n\nRespondent concedes that Mack raised sub-claims (3)(b), (5), and (6), as listed above, in state courts, and those claims are properly preserved for federal habeas review. (Id. at 92, 93 n.4, 94 n.5.) She asserts that the remaining sub-claims, however, are procedurally defaulted.\n\n2. Sub-claims (1), (3)(a), (3)(c), (4), 8(b), and 8(c)\n\nRespondent correctly asserts that Mack sub-claims (1), (3)(a), (3)(c), (4), 8(b), and 8(c), as listed above, are procedurally defaulted. (Id. at 54-55, 74-75, 97.) Although Mack raised these claims as underlying grounds for appellate-counsel ineffective-assistance\n\n24 Mack\u2019s fourth ground for relief relates to trial counsel\u2019s performance during the voir dire phase of trial (sub-claim 1); his seventeenth ground for relief, during the guilt phase of trial (sub-claims 2 through 8); and his eighteenth ground for relief, during the sentencing phase of trial (sub-claims 9 and 10).\nclaims in a reopening application under Ohio Appellate Rule 28(B), he never presented them to state courts as independent claims.\n\n3. **Sub-claims (7) and (8)(a)**\n\n   Respondent further contends that sub-claims (7) and (8)(a), as listed above, are procedurally defaulted, because the state appellate court on initial post-conviction review, the last state court to consider these ineffective-assistance claims, found them barred under the *res judicata* doctrine, even though it conducted an alternative merits review of the claims. (*Id.* at 95-96.) Indeed, federal habeas courts may not review claims to which a state court has explicitly invoked a state procedural bar, even if it did so as an alternative basis for its decision. *Harris v. Reed*, 489 U.S. 255, 264 n.10 (1989).\n\n   Mack counters, however, that, as Respondent conceded in her original return of writ, these sub-claims are preserved for habeas review because the state court did not assert a *res judicata* bar to them but conducted a merits review of them. (Doc. 162 at 226 (citing Doc. 26 at 189-90).) This court agrees.\n\n   Federal habeas courts presume there is no independent and adequate state procedural ground to bar AEDPA review of a state-court decision when the decision\n\n---\n\n25 The court notes that the state appellate court found that Mack did \u201cnot aver that trial counsel failed to find or interview most of the[] witnesses [at issue], but instead contend[ed] that they should have been called to testify at trial.\u201d *Mack*, 2000 WL 1594117, at *4. A review of the state-court pleadings, however, demonstrates that Mack fairly presented his claim that counsel failed both to investigate and present these witnesses. (*See* Doc. 149-5 (First Post-Conviction App. Brf.) at 125 (alleging that the evidence the witnesses at issue would have presented was \u201cavailable to counsel at the time of trial . . . [but] was not introduced\u201d), and 126 (\u201cHad counsel properly investigated the phone call from Mr. Payne and the information from Mr. Carrington, other evidence would have been introduced to offset that deficiency.\u201d).\n\u201cfairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion.\u201d Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 735 (1991) (quoting Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1040-41 (1983)); see also Gulertekin v. Tinnelman-Cooper, 340 F.3d 415, 422-23 (6th Cir. 2003) (\u201ca state court invoking a state procedural bar must provide a \u2018clear and express\u2019 statement to that effect (the \u2018plain statement\u2019 rule\u201d). Here, the state appellate court in Mack\u2019s initial post-conviction proceedings found two of Mack\u2019s four ineffective-assistance claims barred by res judicata because they could have been raised on direct appeal. See Mack, 2000 WL 1594117, at *3. The court then proceeded to examine the evidence and merits of the two remaining claims, sub-claims (7) and (8)(a). Id. at *3-5. In its analysis, the court cited an Ohio Supreme Court case as authority for the standard for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St. 3d 136 (Ohio 1989), but that decision in turn adopted the governing federal law, see id., paragraph two of the syllabus. Therefore, because the state court did not clearly invoke the res judicata bar to Mack\u2019s ineffective-assistance sub-claims (7) and (8)(a) and applied federal law to those claims, the \u201cplain statement\u201d rule governs, and the court\u2019s examination of those claims was an adjudication on the merits for purposes of triggering AEDPA review.\n\n4. Sub-claims (2), (9), and (10)\n\nLastly, Respondent correctly argues that Mack has defaulted sub-claims (2), (9), and (10), as the state courts found them barred by res judicata and untimely under Ohio\u2019s post-conviction statute when he raised them in his second post-conviction petition. (Id. at 91,\n5. Cause and prejudice\n\nMack argues that any default of his ineffective-assistance claims should be excused for cause due to the ineffective assistance of his post-conviction counsel. (Doc. 162 at 116-17, 220-22, 240-42.) Respondent does not address this argument.\n\nDefendants have no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings, and an attorney\u2019s negligence in those proceedings, therefore, generally cannot establish cause to excuse a habeas petitioner\u2019s procedural default of claims in state court. Coleman, 501 U.S. at 756-57; see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(i). In Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.S. 1 (2012), however, the Supreme Court held that the \u201c[i]nadequate assistance of counsel at initial-review collateral proceedings may establish cause for a prisoner\u2019s procedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance at trial.\u201d Id. at 9. And in Trevino v. Thaler, 569 U.S. 413 (2013), the Court elaborated on and expanded the Martinez exception. It held that federal habeas courts may find cause to excuse a petitioner\u2019s procedural default where: (1) the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel claim was \u201csubstantial\u201d; (2) the \u201ccause\u201d\n\n26 Mack counters that any procedural bar based on Ohio\u2019s post-conviction statute is neither an adequate nor independent rule upon which to foreclose federal habeas review. (Doc. 162 at 212-20.) The state appellate court also premised his procedural default of these claims, however, on Ohio\u2019s res judicata doctrine, which the Sixth Circuit long has recognized as a valid basis for barring federal review of habeas claims. See, e.g., Lundgren v. Mitchell, 440 F.3d 754, 765 (6th Cir. 2006). This court, therefore, need not reach the issue of whether Ohio\u2019s post-conviction statute is an \u201cadequate and independent\u201d rule for purposes of procedural default of federal habeas claims. In addition, Mack adds to this claim that counsel were ineffective for failing to obtain the statements of Timothy Willis and William Lekas, and discovering that the Fairfax Recreational Center was closed on the day of the murder, contradicting Willis\u2019 testimony. (Doc. 155 at 168-69.) Respondent correctly notes that Mack never raised these claims in state court (Doc. 158 at 97), and they, too, are therefore procedurally defaulted.\nconsists of there being \u201cno counsel\u201d or \u201cineffective\u201d counsel during the state collateral-review proceeding; (3) the state collateral-review proceeding was the \u201cinitial\u201d review of the petitioner\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim; and (4) state law requires that the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim be raised in the initial review post-conviction proceedings. *Trevino*, 569 U.S. at 423. But the Court modified the fourth requirement so that *Martinez* would apply in Texas, where state criminal procedure \u201con its face appears to permit (but does not require) the defendant to raise the claim [of ineffective assistance of trial counsel] on direct appeal.\u201d *Id.* (emphasis in original).\n\nThe Sixth Circuit has held that *Martinez* does not apply in Ohio because the state permits ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims on direct appeal, and, until recently, had questioned whether *Trevino* applies to Ohio prisoners. *Williams v. Mitchell*, 792 F.3d 606, 615 (6th Cir. 2015); *see also Hill v. Mitchell*, 842 F.3d 910, 937 (6th Cir. 2016) (\u201cWe have yet to decide whether *Trevino* applies in Ohio, but we have suggested it may not on multiple occasions.\u201d) (collecting cases); *McGuire v. Warden, Chillicothe Corr. Inst.*, 738 F.3d 741, 752 (6th Cir. 2013) (observing that *Trevino*\u2019s application to Ohio cases was neither \u201cobvious nor inevitable\u201d as, \u201c[a]rguably, . . . the review of trial counsel ineffectiveness claims in Ohio is more \u2018meaningful\u2019 than in Texas, because in Ohio there is \u2018ordinarily\u2019 the availability of direct review with constitutionally required counsel, with the back-up of collateral attack where evidence outside the record is required\u201d).\n\nIn *White v. Warden, Ross Corr. Inst.*, 940 F.3d 270 (6th Cir. 2019), however, the circuit court applied the *Martinez/Trevino* exception to excuse the default of an Ohio prisoner\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim. In that case, the petitioner\u2019s\nappellate counsel had advised him that the claim at issue could be adequately addressed on\ndirect appeal, but the appellate court determined that the claim needed factual development\nbeyond the record and suggested it should be raised in post-conviction proceedings. *Id.* at\n273-74. By the time the appellate court issued its opinion, however, the deadline to file a\npost-conviction petition had passed, and the prisoner had no post-conviction counsel. *Id.*\nThe circuit court held that, under those circumstances, *Trevino* applied to the petitioner\u2019s\nclaim, because \u201c[t]he confluence of Ohio\u2019s general rule requiring the presentation of\nineffective-assistance claims on direct review *unless* the record lacks sufficient evidence,\nthe incorrect advice from [the prisoner\u2019s] appellate counsel that his record *did* contain\nsufficient evidence, and the tight procedural timeline imposed by Ohio\u2019s post-conviction-\nrelief statute left [the pro se prisoner] without a \u2018meaningful opportunity\u2019 to obtain review\nof his substantial ineffective-assistance claim.\u201d *Id.* at 278 (citing *Trevino*, 569 U.S. at 428)\n(emphasis in original).\n\nIt is unclear whether *White* applies in Mack\u2019s case. Unlike in *White*, Mack had both\nappellate and post-conviction counsel in state court and he does not allege that either set of\nattorneys failed to adhere to the proper procedures for filing his trial counsel ineffective-\nassistance claims. In essence, he makes no equitable argument that he was not provided a\n\u201cmeaningful opportunity\u201d to obtain review of his ineffective-assistance claims under Ohio\u2019s\nprocedural scheme \u2013 the premise of the *Martinez*, *Trevino*, and *White* decisions. See\n*Martinez*, 566 U.S. at 14; *Trevino*, 569 U.S. at 428; *White*, 940 F.3d. at 278. Instead, he\nclaims his appellate and post-conviction counsel were ineffective for failing to raise his\ndefaulted claims at all. The *Martinez/Trevino* exception, therefore, may not apply here.\nSee Hale v. Shoop, No. 1:18-cv-504, 2021 WL 1215793, at *78 (N.D. Ohio Mar. 31, 2021) (Lioi, J.) (distinguishing White and finding it did not apply to Ohio prisoner\u2019s claim); Statzer v. Marquis, No. 1:18-cv-626, 2020 WL 1510241, at *15 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 30, 2020) (Merz, M.J.) (same). But even if the exception does apply, as the court will explain below, Mack cannot meet its requirement that the defaulted ineffective-assistance claims were \u201csubstantial.\u201d\n\nMack also argues that the default should be excused because he is actually innocent of his sentence, as he was not Mr. Sanelli\u2019s \u201cactual killer\u201d and therefore was ineligible for the death penalty under Ohio law. (Doc. 155 at 222-24.) As discussed below in relation to Mack\u2019s independent ground for relief asserting actual innocence, the court rejects that claim.\n\nB. Merits Analysis\n\nAlthough many of Mack\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims are procedurally defaulted, each of the claims also lacks merit. The Supreme Court has long recognized the Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial as a \u201cbedrock principle in our justice system.\u201d Martinez, 566 U.S. at 12; see also Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 342-44 (1963). The Court announced a two-prong test for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). First, the petitioner must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s errors were so egregious that \u201ccounsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Id at 687. To determine if counsel\u2019s performance was \u201cdeficient\u201d pursuant to Strickland, a reviewing court must find that the representation fell \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d\nId. at 688. It must \u201creconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct\u201d and \u201cevaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d Id. at 689.\n\nSecond, the petitioner must show that he or she was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s errors. He or she must demonstrate a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id. at 694. A reasonable probability is \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id. Counsel\u2019s errors must be \u201cso serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u201d Id. at 687. If a petitioner fails to prove either deficiency or prejudice, his ineffective-assistance claim will fail. Id.\n\nThe Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201c\u2018[s]urmounting Strickland\u2019s high bar is never an easy task.\u2019\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 105 (2011) (quoting Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 371 (2010)). It has explained,\n\nAn ineffective-assistance claim can function as a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture and raise issues not presented at trial, and so the Strickland standard must be applied with scrupulous care, lest intrusive post-trial inquiry threaten the integrity of the very adversary process the right to counsel is meant to serve.\n\nId. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Thus, \u201c[j]udicial scrutiny of a counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential\u201d and \u201cevery effort [must] be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight . . . .\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689. \u201cStrickland specifically commands that a court \u2018must indulge [the] strong presumption\u2019 that counsel \u2018made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment[,]\u2019\u201d recognizing \u201c\u2018the constitutionally protected independence of counsel and . . . the wide\nlatitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions.\u201d\u201d *Cullen v. Pinholster*, 563 U.S. 170, 195 (2011) (quoting *Strickland*, 466 U.S. at 689).\n\nThe Court further has observed that the standards imposed by *Strickland* and \u00a7 2254(d) are both \u201chighly deferential,\u201d so that in applying them together, \u201creview is \u2018doubly\u2019 so.\u201d *Richter*, 562 U.S. at 105 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). It has cautioned:\n\nFederal habeas courts must guard against the danger of equating unreasonableness under *Strickland* with unreasonableness under \u00a7 2254(d). When \u00a7 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable. The question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied *Strickland*\u2019s deferential standard.\n\n*Id.*\n\n1. **Conducting voir dire**\n\nMack first contends that his trial counsel performed deficiently in conducting *voir dire*, particularly in the superficiality and brevity of their inquiry into potential jurors\u2019 attitudes about race and capital punishment. (Doc. 155 at 60-65.) Mack acknowledges that his counsel questioned potential jurors about their views of racial matters and the death penalty, but claims they did not ask enough questions or pose questions that were sufficiently probing. (*See id.* at 62-63.) Mack never presented this claim to state courts, and the court reviews it *de novo*.\n\nTrial counsel\u2019s questioning during *voir dire* is presumed to be a matter of sound trial strategy. *See, e.g., Keith v. Mitchell*, 455 F.3d 662, 676 (6th Cir. 2006) (noting the \u201cparticular deference\u201d owed to counsel\u2019s decisions when conducting *voir dire*) (citing *Hughes v. United States*, 258 F.3d 453, 457 (6th Cir. 2001)); *Stanford v. Parker*, 266 F.3d\n442, 454 (6th Cir. 2001) (\u201cStanford presents no evidence to counteract our presumption that his counsel\u2019s failure to ask life-qualifying questions during general voir dire constituted trial strategy.\u201d).\n\nMack offers no evidence at all to rebut the presumption that his trial counsel were employing sound trial strategy in their performance during voir dire. This leaves room only for speculation about why counsel did not inquire more into the potential jurors\u2019 views on race and the death penalty. Stanford, 266 F.3d at 454. It is possible, for example, that counsel was concerned such questions would be offensive to potential jurors or unlikely to actually uncover conscious or unconscious bias. Accordingly, there is no basis for Mack\u2019s claim that his counsel were ineffective in failing to question potential jurors about their views on race or capital punishment, and this claim fails. See Stojetz v. Ishee, 892 F.3d 175, 194-95 (6th Cir. 2018) (rejecting petitioner\u2019s per se ineffective-assistance claim based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to ask venire questions about racial attitudes).\n\n2. Failure to present principal-offender defense in both guilt and sentencing phases of trial\n\nMack next argues that his trial counsel should have presented an alternative defense at both the guilt and sentencing phases of trial that he was not the \u201cactual shooter\u201d of Mr. Sanelli and therefore not a \u201cprincipal offender\u201d under Ohio law, rendering him ineligible for the death penalty. (Doc. 155 at 155-64.) This claim, too, is reviewed de novo, as it was never adjudicated on the merits in state court.\n\nMack recounts that evidence introduced at trial showed that one suspect stood next to the driver\u2019s side of Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car and fired three shots through the window that struck and killed Mr. Sanelli, while a second suspect stood on the passenger\u2019s side of the car and\nslightly behind Mr. Sanelli and fired several bullets from a different gun, including one that shot through the back passenger-side window but none of which struck Mr. Sanelli. (Id. at 156-57.) And although Mack acknowledges that he was in possession of the murder weapon when he was arrested, he claims anyone, including the State\u2019s key witness, Timothy Willis, or his co-defendant Thomas Sowell, could have gained possession of that gun and used it to murder Mr. Sanelli. (Id. at 158.) Yet, Mack notes, defense counsel did not investigate, develop or present evidence to establish that he was not the actual shooter at trial, and instead argued only that he was not involved in the murder and was somewhere else when it was committed. (Id.)\n\n\u201c[W]here there is more than one possible defense, and counsel conducts a substantial investigation into the possible defenses, the strategic choice made as a result of the investigation is \u2018virtually unchallengeable\u2019 . . . .\u201d Meeks v. Bergen, 749 F.2d 322, 328 (6th Cir. 1984) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690). Mack\u2019s lead counsel, Paul Mancino, testified at the state post-conviction evidentiary hearing that he chose to mount an alibi defense at Mack\u2019s trial, arguing that Mack was not at the scene of the crime, and presented witnesses who testified to that. (Doc. 151-9 (SEH Tr.) at 224.) He said he did not consider the principal-offender argument because \u201c[w]e wanted to distance [Mack] from involvement in any manner.\u201d (Id. at 237.) This is a sound strategy, since the evidence adduced at trial showing Mack was not the actual killer was not as compelling as Mack contends and Mack does not identify any new evidence supporting the theory that defense counsel could have, but failed to, discover. Mack focuses on Willis\u2019 testimony that he saw Sowell get out of Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car from the driver\u2019s side, shaking off pieces of glass, and\nheard Sowell tell Mack that he \u201cshot the window\u201d because Mr. Sanelli would not leave the car. (Doc. 155 at 158-59 (quoting 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 71-75).) But this testimony does not prove that Sowell \u201cadmitted that he, Sowell, shot Sanelli through the driver-side window,\u201d as Mack asserts. (Doc. 155 at 158-59.) Both suspects shot through the car\u2019s windows, and even if one believes that Willis\u2019s testimon that he saw Sowell driving the victim\u2019s car after the murder, that does not prove that Sowell was the one who shot the fatal bullets through the driver\u2019s-side window.\n\nThe principal-offender defense had other weaknesses as well. As Mancino acknowledged at the state post-conviction hearing, the fact that Mack was arrested with the murder weapon in his possession was \u201cproblematic\u201d to a principal-offender line of defense. (Doc. 151-9 (SEH Tr.) at 225.) Mancino also agreed that advancing this alternative argument could have undermined his credibility with the jury. (Id. at 224.) Not to mention, it could have weakened the credibility of his alibi witnesses and of his client, who stated in an unsworn statement to the jury at the sentencing phase of trial that he \u201cwasn\u2019t involved in [the murder] and [he] didn\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d (Doc. 150-5 (Trial Tr.) at 135.) Finally, Mancino actually touched on this theory when he argued in his closing argument at the guilt phase of trial that Willis either committed the murder or had someone else commit the murder on his behalf \u2013 an argument the jury did not accept. (Doc. 150-4 (Trial Tr.) at 238-39.)\n\nIt was not unreasonable or poor trial strategy, therefore, for defense counsel to fail to consider presenting an alternative defense to a straightforward alibi defense, in which counsel would have had to have argued that: even if Mack were present at the scene of the\nmurder, and even though he was apprehended with the murder weapon, and even though both he and Sowell fired at Mr. Sanelli through the car windows, he was not the actual killer because circumstantial evidence showed that Sowell was closer to the victim and Mack\u2019s shots happened to miss their target. As the Strickland Court noted, \u201cThere are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case. Even the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689. This claim is meritless.\n\n3. Failure to object\n\nMack further complains that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to object to: (a) Willis\u2019 testimony regarding his fear of Mack and his co-defendants; (b) the trial court\u2019s reasonable-doubt jury instruction; and (c) the court\u2019s verdict-as-recommendation jury instruction. (Doc. 155 at 164-65.)\n\nThe Constitution \u201cdoes not insure that defense counsel will recognize and raise every conceivable constitutional claim.\u201d Engle v. Isacc, 456 U.S. 107, 134 (1982). In fact, as the Sixth Circuit has observed,\n\nin a trial of any size, numerous potentially objectionable events occur. . . . [E]xperienced trial counsel learn that objections to each potentially objectionable event could actually act to their party's detriment. Learned counsel therefore use objections in a tactical manner. In light of this, any single failure to object usually cannot be said to have been error unless the evidence sought is so prejudicial to a client that failure to object essentially defaults the case to the state. Otherwise, defense counsel must so consistently fail to use objections, despite numerous and clear reasons for doing so, that counsel's failure cannot reasonably have been said to have been part of a trial strategy or tactical choice.\n\nLundgren v. Mitchell, 440 F.3d 754, 774 (6th Cir. 2006).\nWillis\u2019 testimony regarding his fear of Mack and his co-defendants. Mack first asserts that his lawyers should have objected to Willis\u2019 testimony that, at various stages of the investigation and prosecution of this case, he was afraid of Mack and his co-defendants. (Doc. 155 at 164.) Even applying de novo review, as Mack did not raise this claim in state court, the claim fails. The fact that a witness who provides testimony in a capital murder trial was apprehensive about doing so did not so prejudice Mack that counsel\u2019s failure to object to that testimony \u201cessentially default[ed] the case to the state.\u201d Lundgren, 440 F.3d at 774.\n\nReasonable-doubt jury instruction. Mack further argues, in just a partial sentence, that his attorneys should have objected to the trial court\u2019s jury instruction on the statutory definition of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. (Doc. 155 at 165.) The last court to address it was the state appellate court on direct review. After setting forth the Strickland standard for ineffective assistance of counsel, it concluded:\n\nAppellant has failed to establish a substantial violation of any of defense counsel's essential duties to his client by failing to object to the court's reasonable doubt instruction. As we stated in our disposition of appellant's fourteenth assignment of error, the trial court's definition of \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d has been upheld in State v. Jenkins, 15 Ohio St.3d 164. Accordingly, appellant's sixteenth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nMack, 1993 WL 497052, at *24.\n\nMack advances no argument as to why the state court\u2019s decision was unreasonable. Regardless, as this court has previously found no merit in Mack\u2019s challenge of the trial court\u2019s reasonable-doubt instruction, Mack cannot establish that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to it, and the claim fails. See Henness v. Bagley, 644 F.3d 308, 319 (6th Cir. 2011) (finding that because petitioner had not demonstrated that his Fourth\nAmendment claim had merit, his underlying ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim fails, along with the ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim).\n\nVerdict-as-recommendation. Lastly, Mack claims his trial counsel were ineffective in failing to object to the trial court\u2019s jury instruction regarding the fact that the death sentence verdict was a non-binding recommendation. (Doc. 155 at 165.) Again, because this court has found no error in this jury instruction, no prejudice could result from trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to it. The claim is meritless.\n\n4. Waiver of presence at jury view\n\nFor this sub-claim, Mack contends that his trial counsel improperly waived his right to be present at a jury view of the crime scene. (Doc. 155 at 165-66.) He asserts they failed to obtain his consent or make a record of the visitation. (Id.) Mack did not raise this claim in state court, so this court reviews it de novo.\n\nThe Constitution guarantees a criminal defendant the right to be present at trial. United States v. Gagnon, 470 U.S. 522, 526 (1985). But this right is not absolute. It exists only \u201cat [a] stage of the criminal proceeding that is critical to its outcome\u201d and \u201cif [the defendant\u2019s] presence would contribute to the fairness of the procedure.\u201d Kentucky v. Stincer, 482 U.S. 730, 745 (1987). It is not protected \u201cwhen presence would be useless, or the benefit but a shadow.\u201d Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 106-07 (1934) (overruled in part on other grounds).\n\nIn Snyder v. Massachusetts, supra, the Court held that the denial of a defendant\u2019s presence at a jury view did not violate due process where the defendant\u2019s attorney was present and participated, along with the prosecutor, in directing the jury\u2019s attention to\nvarious aspects of the location. *Id.* at 107-08. The Court explained that \u201cthe presence of the defendant is a condition of due process to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence, and to that extent only.\u201d *Id.* And a defendant\u2019s presence at a jury view is not among those constitutional rights \u201cconferred so explicitly as to leave no room for an inquiry whether prejudice to a defendant has been wrought through their denial.\u201d *Id.* at 116. In that case, the Court found no prejudice, noting that the presence of counsel at the jury view \u201csupplie[d] an additional assurance that nothing helpful to either side [would] be overlooked upon the view.\u201d *Id.* at 113.\n\nHere, Mack argues that \u201c[i]t is clear that [he] never waived his right to be present\u201d at the jury view. (Doc. 155 at 166.) Mack produces no evidence, however, that counsel failed to advise him of his right to be present or that the waiver was not voluntary. Mack further complains that counsel failed to make a record of the jury view, so it is unknown whether the view was conducted properly, his counsel attended, or his presence would have been useful to his defense. (*Id.*) The record shows only that the trial judge asked counsel for both parties to submit a list of anything they wanted the bailiff to point out to the jury, and that there were some \u201cmatters concerning the jury view\u201d that defense counsel had raised and were resolved. (Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 39.) The record, therefore, also does not indicate that anything improper occurred during the jury view or that Mack could have benefitted from being there such that his absence prejudiced him. Mack offers only conjecture, and this claim, too, fails.\n\n5. **Carole Mancino failed to act as counsel**\nMack also faults one of his trial attorneys, Carole Mancino, for failing \u201cto act as counsel.\u201d (Doc. 155 at 166-67.) He complains that Carole Mancino acted \u201cprincipally\u201d as the investigator on the case, as the trial court denied Mack\u2019s request for an independent investigator, and was defense counsel \u201cin name only\u201d because she did not take an active role in argument or examining witnesses during the trial. (Id.) This claim is meritless. As Respondent argues, there is no Sixth Amendment or any other constitutional right to more than one attorney, or requirement that counsel perform any particular function at trial, and it is commonplace for lead trial counsel to engage other attorneys during the course of a criminal case, who may assist in any number of ways. (Doc. 158 at 93-94.) And it is apparent from the record that Carole Mancino provided valuable legal and investigative services to Mack.\n\n6. **Laying a proper foundation to impeach Willis and ensure Carole Mancino testified**\n\nMack further argues that his trial counsel were ineffective in failing to lay a proper foundation to impeach Willis and to take all appropriate steps to remove impediments to Carole Mancino being permitted to testify about her conversation with Willis. (Doc. 155 at 167.) He claims she should have withdrawn as counsel or \u201cotherwise advis[ed] the court long before trial of the issue posed by her dual role as defense counsel and investigator.\u201d (Id.) It is entirely speculative, however, that the actions Mack asserts Carole Mancino should have taken would have altered the course of the trial. Mack cannot show prejudice, therefore, and this claim is meritless.\n\n7. **Obtaining an independent ballistics test**\nMack also faults his counsel for not obtaining an independent ballistics test on the murder weapon and bullets. (Doc. 155 at 168.) The state appellate court on initial post-conviction review was the last state court to review the claim and decided:\n\nDefendant's assertion that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his trial attorneys did not obtain an independent ballistics test on the bullets and gun at issue is not supported by the record. The gun, a nine millimeter handgun that was confiscated from defendant, and a pellet and three nine millimeter shell casings involved in the victim's murder, were tested by Thomas Lucey, a firearms expert and examiner in the Cleveland Police Department Forensic Lab. State v. Mack (Dec. 2, 1993), Cuyahoga App. No. 62366, unreported at 7, 8. (Mack I). The defense did not employ an independent examiner.\n\nIn Mack I, this Court stated:\n\n[Det.] Lucy [sic] testified that ballistics tests performed on the semi-jacketed bullet recovered from the victim's inner clothing revealed that the handgun recovered from [defendant] at the time of his arrest fired the bullet. He further testified that the gun found on [defendant] fired the three spent shell casings that were recovered on the street at the murder scene. Lucey indicated that he was unable to analyze the other morgue pellet which was submitted because it lacked an adequate copper jacket. Lucey also testified that the gun confiscated from Reginald Germany fired the spent shell casing that was recovered on the sidewalk at the murder scene and the fragment of the copper jacket recovered from the driver's side floor of the victim's vehicle.\n\nId. at 8-9.\n\nBased on the above, the ballistic tests revealed that the gun confiscated from defendant fired the pellet jacket recovered from inside the victim's shirt. The same gun fired three of the four casings found at the murder scene. Defendant offers nothing more than pure conjecture of what an independent ballistics report might show. Since an independent test was never conducted, we have no evidence that defendant was prejudiced by counsel's failure to obtain the test. Furthermore, the decision to obtain, or not to obtain, an independent ballistics test is a matter of trial strategy. See State v. Miller (July 19, 1975), Lucas App. No. L-84-235, unreported at 5. As the Miller court correctly noted, the decision of trial counsel not to pursue ballistics tests * * * did not constitute a violation\nof defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. *Id.* The decision is aptly within the broad brush strokes of overall trial strategy **Id.**\n\n*Mack,* 2000 WL 1594117, at *3\u20134.\n\nMack does not address the state court\u2019s decision. He argues that Detective Lucey\u2019s testimony about some of the bullets being semi-jacketed hollow points was not clear as to whether the pellets found at the scene and/or on the victim\u2019s body were hollow point or not, since hollow point bullets are known to \u201cmushroom\u201d on impact and that was not evident in the morgue bullets. (Doc. 155 at 168.) An independent expert, he contends, could have \u201cexplored this and other issues and discrepancies in the State\u2019s ballistics evidence. (*Id.*)\u201d The state court reasonably concluded, however, that the decision to obtain, or not to obtain, testing of evidence, such as an independent ballistics test, is a matter of trial strategy. *Strickland,* 466 U.S. 689. Moreover, Mack offers only speculation as to what such testing might have shown, so he cannot demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to obtain the testing. This claim, therefore, is unavailing.\n\n8. **Reasonable investigation into State\u2019s case**\n\nMack argues that counsel were ineffective in failing to conduct a reasonable investigation into the State\u2019s case. (Doc. 155 at 168-70.) Specifically, he asserts his attorneys should have: (a) obtained statements from State witnesses Willis and Lekas; (b) discovered that the Fairfax Recreation Center was closed the day of the murder; and (c) presented five witnesses at trial: Mike Carrington, Gerald Kates, William Payne, Bernice Alford (Mack\u2019s mother), and John Mack (Mack\u2019s uncle). (*Id.*) Mack raised only sub-claim (c) in state court, in his first state post-conviction petition.\nThe state appellate court, in rejecting Mack\u2019s claim sub-claim (c), as listed above, reasoned:\n\nDefendant also asserts the ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel did not call as witnesses five individuals, i.e., Mike Carrington, Gerald Kates, William Payne and defendant's mother and uncle. Defendant does not aver that trial counsel failed to find or interview most of these witnesses, but instead contends that they should have been called to testify at trial. This claim is also without merit.\n\nDecisions regarding the calling of witnesses are within the purview of defense counsel's trial tactics. State v. Coulter (1992), 75 Ohio App.3d 219,230. The mere failure to subpoena witnesses for trial is not a substantial violation of defense counsel's essential duty absent a showing of prejudice. Id at 230; State v. Hunt (1984), 20 Ohio App.3d 310,312; State v. Mitts (September 28, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 76963, unreported.\n\nIn this case, defendant has not demonstrated prejudice. A review of the affidavits does not reveal that counsel was deficient in choosing not to call them and, had they been called, the outcome of the trial would have been different. In fact, the affidavits indicate that if the witnesses had been called, they would have only added confusion and implausibility to the defense strategy.\n\nFirst, Mike Carrington could very well have seen defendant at 6:30 p.m. the day of the murder driving a Lincoln Continental. Testimony at trial revealed the murder occurred sometime between 5:45 p.m. and 6:10 p.m. Carrington also stated that defendant purchased the gun the day after the murder from Willis. This actually contradicted defendant's own version where he stated he bought the gun a few days prior to the murder, first from an unknown person and then from a man named Dee. Carrington's testimony would have discredited defendant's version. His affidavit states that he met with trial counsel and told them of this information. It is entirely fair to state that it was a matter of trial strategy not to put Carrington on the stand.\n\nSecond, Gerald Kates' affidavit reveals that the center from which Willis allegedly walked his daughter home the day of the murder was actually closed. The information that the center was closed was available at trial and could have been raised without resort to evidence outside the original record. Hence, this affidavit is barred by the doctrine of res judicata. See Cole, supra.\n\nThird, trial counsel interviewed defendant's mother, Bernice Alford, and chose not to call her as well. Her affidavit details that she carved defendant's initials\non the gun but the gun introduced at trial did not have the initials on it. She also averred that the police, during a search of defendant's room, planted evidence. Again, the implausibility of this explanation counseled against calling defendant's mother as a matter of trial strategy. Trial counsel was in the best position to determine the veracity of the witnesses who would actually help, not hurt, the defense.\n\nFourth, William Payne's affidavit states that he phoned defendant at about 5:00 p.m. on the day of the murder and then again a short time later. While this may have been true, the murder occurred after 5:00 p.m., but before 6:10 p.m. Again, this would not have helped the defense.\n\nFinally, John Mack, defendant's uncle, essentially corroborated Bernice Alford's statement that during jail visits with co-defendant Germany, Germany stated defendant was not involved. This is hearsay, going to the truth of the matter asserted, and would not have been admissible at trial.\n\nAssignment of Error I is overruled.\n\nMack, 2000 WL 1594117, at *4\u20135.\n\nAgain, Mack does not discuss the state court\u2019s decision. He instead presents the same arguments here that he raised in state courts. (Doc. 155 at 168-69.) As the court reasonably concluded, the affidavits Mack submitted with his petition demonstrated that if the witnesses had testified, \u201cthey would have only added confusion and implausibility to the defense strategy.\u201d Mack, 2000 WL 1594117, at *4. Defense counsel interviewed Carrington and Mack\u2019s mother, both of whom had a close relationship with Mack, and reasonably decided their testimony would not have assisted the defense; Payne\u2019s testimony would not have supported Mack\u2019s alibi as Mack alleged; Kates would have offered information that was available at trial, rendering his affidavit barred by res judicata; and the testimony of Curtis Mack, who also was close to Mack, would have been inadmissible hearsay. The state court\u2019s decision on this claim, therefore, did not contravene or misapply Strickland or other Supreme Court precedent.\nSub-claims (a) and (b), as listed above, are similarly unavailing. As this court noted in relation to Mack\u2019s *Brady* claims, Willis\u2019 written statement was disclosed to defense counsel, most likely before trial and then again during it, and the information from the initial police reports concerning Willis either was disclosed to defense counsel or was not favorable to Mack\u2019s defense. Moreover, Carole Mancino\u2019s attempt to interview an uncooperative Willis and then to testify about what he said to her were documented in the trial transcript. (*See* Doc. 150-4 (Trial Tr.) at 121-29 (proffer of Carole Mancino\u2019s testimony regarding Willis interview).)\n\nAs to Mack\u2019s claim that counsel should have obtained Lekas\u2019 statement, Mack provides no argument at all as to why his counsel were deficient for failing to obtain this statement or how he was prejudiced by the failure. This court determined in connection with Mack\u2019s *Brady* claim that it is likely the prosecutor disclosed information contained in the police reports to defense counsel, which included Lekas\u2019 initial statement to police. (*See* Doc. 154-9 at 41-42 (Police Report).)\n\nFinally, although the fact that the recreation center was closed on the day of the murder, contradicting Willis\u2019 story about events that night, and it would have been relevant impeachment evidence, Mack has not demonstrated that if counsel had discovered that fact, it would have undermined Willis\u2019 testimony such that the result of his trial would have been different. This claim, therefore, lacks merit.\n\n9. **Performance at mitigation phase of trial**\n\nFinally, Mack complains that his trial counsel failed to investigate mitigation evidence, to develop and present a coherent mitigation strategy, and to present \u201csignificant\u201d\navailable mitigation evidence at the sentencing phase of trial, including evidence concerning Mack\u2019s background, social history, and mental health. (Doc. 155 at 170-83.) As Mack did not present this claim to state courts, this court reviews the claim de novo.\n\nThe Supreme Court repeatedly has held that counsel in a capital case have an \u201cobligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant\u2019s background\u201d for mitigation purposes. *Williams v. Taylor*, 529 U.S. 362, 396 (2000). In *Strickland*, the Supreme Court noted that a capital sentencing proceeding \u201cis sufficiently like a trial in its adversarial format and in the existence of standards for decision\u201d that counsel\u2019s role in the two proceedings is comparable: \u201cto ensure that the adversarial testing process works to produce a just result under the standards governing decision.\u201d *Strickland*, 466 U.S. at 686.\n\nAccordingly, the Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit have found ineffective assistance of counsel in capital cases where trial counsel failed to investigate or present mitigating evidence at sentencing. *See, e.g., Wiggins v. Smith*, 539 U.S. 510, 537 (2003) (Defense counsel presented only \u201cone significant mitigating factor\u2014that Wiggins had no prior convictions. Had the jury been able to place petitioner\u2019s excruciating life history on the mitigating side of the scale, there is a reasonable probability that at least one juror would have struck a different balance.\u201d); *Rompilla v. Beard*, 545 U.S. 374, 389-93 (2005) (counsel ineffective where he failed to examine court file of defendant\u2019s prior conviction which contained a range of vital mitigation leads regarding defendant\u2019s childhood and mental health problems); *Frazier v. Huffman*, 343 F.3d 780, 795-99 (6th Cir. 2003) (counsel ineffective where he failed to introduce any mitigating evidence in either guilt or penalty phases of trial and he was aware of petitioner\u2019s brain injury).\nNevertheless, \u201cthe duty to investigate does not force defense lawyers to scour the\nglobe on the off chance something will turn up; reasonably diligent counsel may draw a line\nwhen they have good reason to think further investigation would be a waste.\u201d Rompilla,\n545 U.S. at 383; see also Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 525 (further investigation excusable where\ncounsel has evidence suggesting it would be fruitless); Strickland, 466 U.S. at 699 (counsel\ncould \u201creasonably surmise . . . that character and psychological evidence would be of little\nhelp\u201d); Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776, 793-94 (1987) (finding limited investigation\nreasonable because all witnesses brought to counsel\u2019s attention provided predominantly\nharmful information). \u201c[A] particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed\nfor reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to\ncounsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691. And counsel is not ineffective for\ndeciding to offer little or no mitigating evidence where that decision is based on sound\nprofessional judgment. See, e.g., Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685, 699-702 (2002); Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 699-700; Burger, 483 U.S. at 793-95; Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168,\n184-87 (1986). As the Supreme Court has explained,\n\n[T]here comes a point at which evidence from more distant relatives can\nreasonably be expected to be only cumulative, and the search for it distracting\nfrom more important duties. . . . This is not a case in which the defendant\u2019s\nattorneys failed to act while potentially powerful mitigating evidence stared\nthem in the face, or would have been apparent from documents any reasonable\nattorney would have obtained. It is instead a case, like Strickland itself, in\nwhich defense counsel\u2019s \u201cdecision not to seek more\u201d mitigating evidence from\nthe defendant\u2019s background \u201cthan was already in hand\u201d fell \u201cwell within the\nrange of professionally reasonable judgments.\u201d\n\nBobby v. Van Hook, 558 U.S. 4, 11-12 (2009) (internal citations omitted).\nThe Ohio court of appeals, in reviewing Mack\u2019s reopening application, provided this summary of the defense\u2019s presentation during the sentencing phase of trial:\n\nDuring the mitigation phase, Mr. Mack gave an unsworn statement in which he pleaded his innocence and for his life and stated his belief that the State's chief witness framed him to cover up the witness's murdering Mr. Sanelli. Mr. Mack's uncle, mother and grandmother testified that he had a hard childhood, but was a good person. Their testimony reflected their belief that Mr. Mack was innocent, and counsel's closing argument included an attack that the chief witness was a liar.\n\nMack, 2003 WL 21185786, at *8.\n\nMack contends that his trial counsel should have known from even a \u201csuperficial exploration\u201d of his background that they needed additional mitigation evidence and expert assistance. (Doc. 155 at 175.) He stresses the family\u2019s history of alcoholism, domestic violence, and poverty, including Mack\u2019s mother shooting his stepfather in Mack\u2019s presence, the stepfather being accused of, and prosecuted for, raping Mack\u2019s 13-year-old cousin, and the mother\u2019s youth and inability to raise her son. (Id. at 175-76.) And Mack emphasizes the importance of expert testimony regarding his medical, family, and social history, submitting an affidavit and report from clinical psychologist Robert Smith as support. (Id. at 174-76 (citing Doc. 154-9 at 447-62 (Smith Aff.).)\n\nMancino testified at the federal evidentiary hearing, however, that Mack displayed no sign of any mental illness while he represented him, and the use of experts for mitigation purposes in capital cases was just developing at that time; he could not recall if mitigation specialists were even available then. (Doc. 100 (FEH Tr.) at 177-78, 182-83.) Mancino explained that they were \u201ctrying to present a human person to the jury, and the best people who knew about him were people who \u2013 in this case, his family was very cooperative.\u201d (Id.\nat 179.) \u201c[M]ost of the mitigation that I knew in those days,\u201d he added, \u201call they do is I was\ntold this and that by the family. If you got it from the family, it would be more\ncompelling.\u201d (Id. at 181.) The Supreme Court has endorsed this very mitigation strategy,\nnoting in one case that testimony of lay witnesses such as family members describing a\ndefendant\u2019s \u201cterrible\u201d childhood was\n\nneither complex nor technical. It required only that the jury make logical\nconnections of the kind a layperson is well equipped to make. The jury simply\ndid not need expert testimony to understand the \u201chumanizing\u201d evidence; it\ncould use its common sense or own sense of mercy.\n\nWong v. Belmontes, 558 U.S. 15, 24 (2009).\n\nMoreover, \u201cexpert testimony discussing [Mack\u2019s] mental state, seeking to explain\nhis behavior, or putting it in some favorable context [may] have exposed [Mack] to\n[damaging] evidence.\u201d Id. at 25 (rejecting petitioner\u2019s \u201c\u2018more-evidence-is-better\u2019 approach\nto mitigation\u201d where it would have opened door to evidence of past murders); see also\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 699 (\u201cRestricting testimony on respondent\u2019s character to what had\ncome in at the plea colloquy ensured that contrary character and psychological evidence and\nrespondent\u2019s criminal history, which counsel had successfully moved to exclude, would not\ncome in.\u201d). Mancino testified that he considered this risk in choosing his mitigation\nstrategy: \u201c[T]he one risk in this case that I saw, he just got out on shock probation from\nanother offense, and I didn't really want to open that up.\u201d (Doc. 154-1 at 97 (Mancino\nDepo.).)\n\nFinally, many of Smith\u2019s findings report what Mack\u2019s mother and uncle testified to\nat trial: Mack\u2019s mother\u2019s alcoholism, his stepfather\u2019s abuse, and their poverty. (Doc. 154-9\nat 457-62.) And other than the \u201cnegative effects of significant early childhood trauma,\u201d\nSmith diagnosed Mack only with the chronic depressive disorder, dysthymia. (Id. at 457.)\n\n\u201c[T]he failure to present additional mitigating evidence that is merely cumulative of that already presented does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\u201d Eley v. Bagley, 604 F.3d 958, 968 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting Nields v. Bradshaw, 482 F.3d 442, 454 (6th Cir. 2007))\n\nMack, therefore, has not \u201covercome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689. His trial counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to uncover more mitigating evidence or retaining experts. Nor has Mack shown \u201ca reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695.\n\nAccordingly, Mack\u2019s fourth, seventeenth, and eighteenth grounds for relief are meritless.\n\nXII. Nineteenth Ground for Relief: Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel\n\nMack claims for his nineteenth ground for relief that his appellate counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance. (Doc. 155 at 189-93.) He lists forty separate claims that appellate counsel should have raised on direct appeal but did not. (Id. at 190-92.) Mack does not, however, provide any argument regarding the claims\u2019 procedural status or merits.\n\n\u201c\u2018[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\u2019\u201d United States v. Hall, 549 F.3d 1033, 1042 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Johnson, 440 F.3d 832, 846 (6th Cir. 2006)). This\ncourt, therefore, declines to review these claims. See, e.g., United States v. Crosgrove, 637 F.3d 646, 663 (6th Cir. 2011) (\u201cBecause there is no developed argumentation in these claims, the panel declines to address [the defendant\u2019s] general assertions of misconduct in witness questioning and closing statements.\u201d). 27\n\nXIII. Twentieth and Twenty-Eighth Grounds for Relief: Insufficiency of the Evidence\n\nMack asserts for his twentieth ground for relief that his conviction under Ohio\u2019s felony-murder specification violated his due process rights because there was insufficient evidence that he was the principal offender. (Doc. 155 at 193-94.) He further claims in his twenty-eighth ground for relief, which he states \u201cincorporates\u201d his twentieth ground, that his convictions and sentence violated his due process rights because they were based \u201calmost entirely, if not entirely, on the uncorroborated testimony of [State witness Timothy] Willis.\u201d (Id. at 231-32.)\n\nA. Procedural Posture\n\nMack presented his twentieth ground on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, which summarily denied it on the merits. Mack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 507, 519. That claim is therefore preserved for federal habeas review.\n\nRespondent argues, however, that Mack did not present his twenty-eighth ground to state courts, and that claim is therefore procedurally defaulted. (Doc. 158 at 111.) Mack responds that this claim is substantially similar to his sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim\n\n27 Because the court finds Mack waived his appellate-counsel ineffective-assistance claims, he cannot establish cause for the procedural default of other claims based on the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\nasserted in his twentieth ground, and is therefore also ripe for habeas review. (Doc. 162 at 281.) The court agrees. The substance of the claim he presents here in his twenty-eighth ground was presented to the state courts. See Jells v. Mitchell, 538 F.3d 478, 504 (6th Cir. 2008) (\u201cTo present a claim fairly, it is sufficient if the substance of the claim was presented to the state courts, such that the ultimate question would have been the same despite variations in the legal theory or factual allegations urged in its support.\u201d).\n\nB. Merits Analysis\n\nThe last state court to address Mack\u2019s insufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, the state court of appeals on direct appeal, opined:\n\nAppellant argues that the state presented insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for the felony murder specification. Specifically, appellant contends there was insufficient evidence to establish that he was a principal offender in the Peter Sanelli murder. We disagree.\n\nIn reviewing a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the evidence \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Jackson v. Virginia (1979), 443 U.S. 307, 319; State v. Davis (1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 361, 365. Appellant was convicted of the following capital specification contained in R.C. 2929.04 which provides in relevant part:\n\n\u201c(A) Imposition of the death penalty for aggravated murder is precluded, unless one or more of the following is specified in the indictment or count in the indictment pursuant to section 2941.14 of the Revised Code and proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\n\u201c(7) The offense was committed while the offender was committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit kidnapping, rape, aggravated arson, aggravated robbery, or aggravated burglary, and either the offender was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder or, if not the principal offender, committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design.\u201d\nThe evidence presented at trial established that Peter Sanelli was shot while seated in the driver's seat of his car. The evidence also demonstrated that the front driver's side window and the back passenger window were shattered and missing following the robbery. Additionally, ballistic tests revealed that the gun confiscated from Clarence Mack fired three of the four spent nine millimeter shell casings recovered from the murder scene. The ballistic tests also revealed that the gun confiscated from Clarence Mack two days after the murder fired the copper jacketed pellet which was removed from the right shoulder area of the murder victim's inner clothing. The autopsy of Peter Sanelli revealed that he sustained three gunshot wounds to the upper left side of his body. The coroner testified that the bullet which exited the victim's right shoulder area caused the most significant internal damage by perforating the victim's lung and the sack which surrounds the heart. It is thus apparent that the bullet recovered from the murder victim's inner clothing caused the most significant internal damage and was fired by the gun confiscated from Mack.\n\nMoreover, the coroner's testimony also established that the other gunshot wound to the victim's left shoulder was simply a flesh wound and the gunshot wound to the left side of the victim's face only struck the victim's left and right jaw and larynx. Significantly, there is no indication that the bullet which caused the facial wound impacted or damaged the victim's brain or any other vital body parts.\n\nIn reviewing the evidence and testimony presented and the inferences drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude that the appellant was the principal offender in the aggravated murder of Peter Sanelli. The evidence established that the nine millimeter gun confiscated from Mack fired the bullet which caused the most significant internal damage. Accordingly, appellant's twelfth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nMack, 1993 WL 497052, at *18-19.\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a state to prove every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 315\u201316 (1979). When reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence, habeas courts must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at 319 (emphasis in original). \u201c[T]he Jackson inquiry does\nnot focus on whether the trier of fact made the correct guilt or innocence determination, but rather whether it made a rational decision to convict or acquit.\u201d *Herrera v. Collins*, 506 U.S. 390, 402 (1993) (emphasis in original).\n\nBecause both *Jackson* and AEDPA apply to Mack\u2019s insufficiency claims, federal habeas review requires deference at two levels. \u201cFirst, deference should be given to the trier-of-fact\u2019s verdict, as contemplated by *Jackson*; second, deference should be given to the [state trial court\u2019s] consideration of the trier-of-fact\u2019s verdict, as dictated by AEDPA.\u201d *Davis v. Lafler*, 658 F.3d 525, 531 (6th Cir. 2011) (quoting *Tucker v. Palmer*, 541 F.3d 652, 656 (6th Cir. 2008)). The Sixth Circuit has explained:\n\nWhen reviewing whether the state court\u2019s determination was \u201cobjectively unreasonable,\u201d this court necessarily engages in a two-step analysis. First, we must ask whether the evidence itself was sufficient to convict under *Jackson*. The inquiry ends if the panel determines that there was sufficient evidence to convict [the petitioner]. If we find that the evidence is insufficient to convict, we must then apply AEDPA deference and ask whether the state court was \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d in concluding that a rational trier of fact could find [the petitioner] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n*Stewart v. Wolfenbarger*, 595 F.3d 647, 653 (6th Cir. 2010). The circuit court further has observed that \u201c[a] defendant who challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction faces a nearly insurmountable hurdle.\u201d *Davis*, 658 F.3d at 534 (quoting *United States v. Oros*, 578 F.3d 703, 710 (7th Cir. 2009)).\n\nMack has not met this burden. He argues that the state court\u2019s decision was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, *Jackson*, \u201cand/or\u201d was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented. (Doc. 162 at 264.) But Mack does not contest any of the court\u2019s specific factual findings. And he has not demonstrated that the state court\u2019s decision was unreasonable.\nMack asserts that his convictions and sentence were impermissibly based \u201cexclusively on Willis\u2019 uncorroborated testimony.\u201d (Id. at 260-63.) As this court found with regard to Mack\u2019s Brady claim, however, not only was the State\u2019s case founded on more than Willis\u2019 testimony \u2013 most notably, the conclusive forensic evidence that, as the state court aptly summarized, linked Mack to the crime. But Willis\u2019 testimony was in fact corroborated by other evidence adduced at trial on numerous key points.\n\nWillis\u2019 key testimony was in identifying Sowell and Mack as the shooters. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 75-76.) He testified that Germany offered Sowell his gun to go downtown to get a \u201chotty,\u201d and he saw Sowell carrying a nine millimeter gun after the murder. (Id. at 66-68, 76.) The forensic evidence adduced at trial showed that the guns Mack and Germany had in their possession when they were arrested, both nine millimeter guns, fired the bullets recovered from Mr. Sanelli\u2019s clothing and the crime scene. (See, e.g., Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 264-65 (Horval Test.); Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 21-26 (Lucey Test.).) Willis testified that, after the time of the murder, he saw Sowell and Mack driving a small, silver, \u201clittle mini station wagon\u201d with the driver\u2019s and rear passenger\u2019s windows broken out and red license plates. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 71-72.) Detective Allen testified that Mr. Sanelli\u2019s abandoned, damaged car was a light blue small car (a Horizon) with the driver\u2019s and rear passenger\u2019s windows broken out and red licence plates. (Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 210-11.) Willis testified that when he saw Sowell and Mack shortly after the murder occurred, Sowell was wearing a black Bulls starter jacket. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 73.) The State presented evidence that when Sowell was arrested, he was wearing a black Bulls starter jacket with a nail in the pocket that matched nails found in\nMr. Sanelli\u2019s car when it was recovered. (Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 295-97 (Bornfeld Test.).) In addition, Willis said Sowell was handling a pair of binoculars in a pouch. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 76.) Tony Sanelli testified that his father always kept a pair of binoculars in his car. (Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 167.) Finally, Willis testified that Mack told him Sowell crashed Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car into a pole. (Doc. 150-3 (Trial Tr.) at 79.) Detective Allen testified that Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car was discovered abandoned and damaged from apparently crashing into a nearby pole. (Doc. 150-2 (Trial Tr.) at 210-11.)\n\nMack further argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that he was the \u201cprincipal offender\u201d and therefore eligible for the death penalty under Ohio law. (Doc. 155 at 194.) As this court explained above in relation to Mack\u2019s ineffective-assistance claim based on counsel\u2019s failure to mount a defense that Mack was not the principal offender, the evidence established at trial that there were two perpetrators who both shot through Mr. Sanelli\u2019s car windows, but it was Mack who was found with the gun that actually fired the fatal bullets. A rational jury, therefore, could have found that Mack was the actual shooter and \u201cprincipal offender.\u201d\n\nBased on the State\u2019s forensic evidence and Willis\u2019 corroborated testimony, therefore, the state appellate court reasonably concluded that \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of [felony murder] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319 (emphasis in original). The state court\u2019s decision neither contravened nor misapplied Jackson.\n\nXIV. Twenty-First Ground for Relief: Ohio Death Penalty Specification\nFor his twenty-first ground for relief, Mack asserts that the statutory death penalty specification under which he was sentenced, Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.04(7), violated his rights to due process and equal protection. (Doc. 155 at 195.) That provision applies to the commission of a felony murder where \u201ceither the offender was the principal offender in the commission of the aggravated murder or, if not the principal offender, committed the aggravated murder with prior calculation and design.\u201d Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2929.04(7). Mack contends the statute imposes a higher degree of proof for aiders and abettors (prior calculation and design) than principal offenders, and because he was sentenced as a principal offender, he was \u201csubject to the death penalty with a less culpable mental state than an aider and abettor, who must have acted with prior calculation and design.\u201d (Doc. 155 at 195.) Mack presented this claim to the Ohio Supreme Court, which summarily denied relief. Mack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 507, 519.\n\nAs Respondent argues, however, Mack does not cite any Supreme Court precedent supporting his argument, and indeed there is none. (Doc. 158 at 105.) The state court\u2019s decision rejecting this claim, therefore, neither contravened nor misapplied clearly established federal law under \u00a7 2254(d)(1). 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); see also Wright v. Van Patten, 552 U.S. 120, 125 (2008). This claim fails.\n\nXV. Twenty-Second and Twenty-Fifth Grounds for Relief: Proportionality\n\nFor Mack\u2019s twenty-second and twenty-fifth grounds for relief, he challenges the Ohio courts\u2019 review of his case to determine if his sentence was excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in other cases. (Doc. 155 at 196-97; 211-12.) He contends that the Ohio court did not \u201cmeaningfully review\u201d the proportionality of his death\nsentence, and his sentence was \u201cunfairly disproportionate\u201d when compared to similar cases, including those of his co-defendants. (Id. at 197, 212.) He presented these claims to the Ohio Supreme Court on direct appeal, which denied them summarily. Mack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 507, 519.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that comparative review by an appellate court is not constitutionally required. Pulley v. Harris, 465 U.S. 37, 50-51 (1984) (\u201cThere is . . . no basis in our cases for holding that comparative proportionality review by an appellate court is required in every case in which the death penalty is imposed and the defendant requests it.\u201d); see also Bowling v. Parker, 344 F.3d 487, 521 (6th Cir. 2003) (\u201cThe Supreme Court has held that the Constitution does require proportionality review, but that it only requires proportionality between the punishment and the crime, not between the punishment in this case and that exacted in other cases.\u201d) (citing Harris, 465 U.S. at 50). And the Sixth Circuit repeatedly has upheld Ohio\u2019s proportionality review system as constitutional. See, e.g., Leonard v. Warden, Ohio State Penitentiary, 846 F.3d 832, 854 (6th Cir. 2017) (collecting cases); Buell v. Mitchell, 274 F.3d 337, 369 (6th Cir. 2001) (\u201cBy limiting proportionality review to other cases already decided by the reviewing court in which the death penalty has been imposed, Ohio has properly acted within the wide latitude it is allowed.\u201d).\n\nIn the absence of controlling Supreme Court precedent, Mack cannot demonstrate that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision rejecting these claims contravened or misapplied clearly established federal law, and this claim fails.\n\nXVI. Twenty-Third Ground for Relief: Ohio\u2019s Post-Conviction Relief Statute\nMack contends in his twenty-third ground for relief that Ohio\u2019s post-conviction relief scheme is unconstitutional. (Doc. 155 at 197-211.) This claim, however, is not cognizable on federal habeas review. See, e.g., Cress v. Palmer, 484 F.3d 844, 853 (6th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[E]rrors in post-conviction proceedings are outside the scope of federal habeas corpus review.\u201d); Leonard v. Warden, Ohio State Penitentiary, 846 F.3d 832, 854-55 (6th Cir. 2017) (declining to revisit issue). As the Sixth Circuit has explained, \u201c\u2018the essence of habeas corpus is an attack by a person in custody upon the legality of that custody, and . . . the traditional function of the writ is to secure release from illegal custody.\u2019\u201d Kirby v. Dutton, 794 F.2d 245, 246 (6th Cir. 1986) (quoting Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 484 (1973)). Challenges to state post-conviction proceedings \u201caddress collateral matters and not the underlying state conviction giving rise to the prisoner\u2019s incarceration.\u201d Id. at 247. A due process claim related to collateral post-conviction proceedings, therefore, even if resolved in a petitioner\u2019s favor, would not \u201cresult [in] . . . release or a reduction in . . . time to be served or in any other way affect his detention because we would not be reviewing any matter directly pertaining to his detention[,]\u201d and cannot be brought in federal habeas proceedings. Id. at 247. Mack\u2019s twenty-third ground for relief is denied.\n\nXVII. Twenty-Fourth Ground for Relief: Weighing of Mitigating and Aggravating Factors\n\nMack asserts in his twenty-fourth ground for relief that his death sentence is \u201cunreliable, inappropriate, and unconstitutional,\u201d because there is residual doubt as to whether he is guilty of aggravated murder with an aggravating circumstance when \u201cthe only evidence against him was the dubious testimony of Timothy Willis.\u201d (Doc. 155 at 211.) Therefore, he contends, the mitigating factors outweigh the \u201csole questionable aggravating\ncircumstance.\u201d (Id.) As Respondent argues, however, Mack cites to no law supporting a habeas court\u2019s authority to conduct an independent evaluation of the appropriateness of a state-court death sentence. (Doc. 158 at 108.) This claim does not present a cognizable ground for habeas corpus relief and is denied.\n\nXVIII. Twenty-Sixth Ground for Relief: Constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s Statutory Death Penalty Scheme\n\nFor his twenty-sixth ground for relief, Mack attacks Ohio\u2019s statutory death penalty scheme as unconstitutional on numerous grounds. (Doc. 155 at 213-29.) He asserted this claim on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, which denied it summarily. Mack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 507, 522. As Mack concedes, the Sixth Circuit repeatedly has upheld the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death penalty scheme, rejecting the very claims Mack asserts here. See, e.g., Beuke v. Houk, 537 F.3d 618, 652-53 (6th Cir. 2008) (\u201cBeuke next challenges the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death penalty scheme. His arguments are entirely meritless and have been rejected by this court on numerous occasions. We therefore will afford them minimal attention.\u201d); Cooey v. Coyle, 289 F.3d 882, 922-28 (6th Cir. 2002); Buell v. Mitchell, 274 F.3d 337, 367-76 (6th Cir. 2001). This claim, therefore, fails.\n\nXIX. Twenty-Seventh Ground for Relief: Cumulative Error\n\nMack claims that the Ohio courts\u2019 cumulative errors violated his constitutional rights. (Doc. 155 at 229-31.) He presented this claim to the Ohio Supreme Court on direct appeal, which denied it summarily. Mack, 73 Ohio St. 3d at 507, 520. The Sixth Circuit repeatedly has held that a claim of cumulative trial error is not cognizable on federal habeas review. See, e.g., Williams v. Anderson, 460 F.3d 789, 816 (6th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[T]he law of\nthis Circuit is that cumulative error claims are not cognizable on habeas because the\nSupreme Court has not spoken on this issue.\u201d). This ground for relief, therefore, is denied.\n\nXX. Twenty-Ninth Ground for Relief: Actual Innocence\n\nMack claims for his twenty-ninth ground for relief that he is actually innocent of the\ncrimes for which he was convicted and of the death penalty. (Doc. 155 at 232.) He asserts\nthis claim both as a substantive, freestanding claim and as a blanket procedural ground to\nexcuse any procedural default of his other claims. (Doc. 162 at 282.)\n\nIn Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993), the Supreme Court held that \u201ca claim of\n\u2018actual innocence\u2019 is not itself a constitutional claim, but instead a gateway through which a\nhabeas petitioner must pass to have his otherwise barred constitutional claim considered on\nthe merits.\u201d Id. at 404. The Court stated in dicta, however, that \u201cin a capital case a truly\npersuasive demonstration of \u2018actual innocence\u2019 made after trial would render the execution\nof a defendant unconstitutional\u201d regardless of whether any constitutional violation occurred\nduring trial. Id. at 417. But the Court emphasized that \u201cthe threshold showing for such an\nassumed right would necessarily be extraordinarily high.\u201d Id.; see also House v. Bell, 547\nU.S. 518, 520 (2006).\n\nSince Herrera, however, the Supreme Court has never applied a freestanding actual\ninnocence claim. McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 392 (2013) (declining to resolve\nwhether a freestanding actual innocence claim is cognizable on federal habeas review).\nAnd the Sixth Circuit has held that such a claim is not a valid ground for habeas relief. See,\ne.g., Smith v. Nagy, 962 F.3d 162, 207 (6th Cir. 2020); Cress v. Palmer, 484 F.3d 844,\n854-55 (6th Cir. 2007). To the extent Mack asserts a freestanding claim of actual innocence, therefore, that claim fails.\n\nThe \u201cnarrow exception\u201d of actual innocence to the cause-and-prejudice requirement for excusing the procedural default of a habeas claim applies only where a constitutional violation has \u201cprobably resulted\u201d in the conviction of one who is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the substantive offense. *Dretke v. Haley*, 541 U.S. 386, 392 (2004). To demonstrate \u201cactual innocence,\u201d a petitioner must show \u201c\u2018by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error, no reasonable juror would have found the petitioner eligible under the death penalty under the applicable state law.\u2019\u201d *Id.* (quoting *Sawyer v. Whitley*, 505 U.S. 333, 336 (1992)). The claim requires a showing of \u201cnew reliable evidence\u201d and factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency. *See Schulp v. Delo*, 513 U.S. 298, 324 (1995); *Bousley v. United States*, 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998).\n\nMack cannot meet this standard for reasons set forth in the court\u2019s discussion of grounds five and twenty. Most significantly, the State presented conclusive forensic evidence linking the gun found in Mack\u2019s possession when he was arrested to a \u201cmorgue bullet\u201d recovered from Mr. Sanelli\u2019s clothing.\n\nAccordingly, Mack is not entitled to relief on his twenty-ninth ground for relief.\n\n**CERTIFICATE OF APPEALABILITY ANALYSIS**\n\nThe court must now determine whether to grant a Certificate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) for any of Mack\u2019s claims for relief. The Sixth Circuit has held that neither a blanket grant nor a blanket denial of a COA is an appropriate means by which to conclude a capital habeas case as it \u201cundermine[s] the gate keeping function of certificates of\nappealability, which ideally should separate the constitutional claims that merit the close attention of counsel and this court from those claims that have little or no viability.\u201d\n\n*Porterfield v. Bell*, 258 F.3d 484, 487 (6th Cir. 2001); *see also Murphy v. Ohio*, 263 F.3d 466 (6th Cir. 2001) (remanding motion for certificate of appealability for district court\u2019s analysis of claims).\n\nHabeas courts are guided in their consideration of whether to grant a COA by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, which provides in relevant part:\n\n(c)(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from --\n\n(A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of process issued by a State court . . .\n\n(2) A certificate of appealability may issue under paragraph (12) only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\n\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. This language is identical to the requirements set forth in the pre-AEDPA statutes, requiring the habeas petitioner to obtain a Certificate of Probable Cause. The sole difference between the pre- and post-AEDPA statutes is that the petitioner must now demonstrate he was denied a *constitutional*, rather than federal, right. *Slack v. McDaniel*, 529 U.S. 473, 483-04 (2000) (interpreting the significance of the revision between the pre- and post-AEDPA versions of that statute).\n\nFurthermore, if a habeas claim is not procedurally defaulted, then the court need only determine whether reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s decision \u201cdebatable or wrong.\u201d *Id.* at 484. A more complicated analysis is required, however, when assessing whether to grant a COA for a claim the district court has determined is procedurally defaulted. In those instances, a COA should only issue if \u201cjurists of reason\nwould find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d *Id.*\n\nAfter taking the above standards into consideration, the court finds as follows:\n\nThe court will not issue a COA for grounds for relief: 3 (juror bias); 7 (right to remain silent); 15 (trial-court error), sub-claims 2, 4, 8, and 10; 16 (prosecutorial misconduct), sub-claims 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10; 17 (trial-counsel ineffective assistance / guilt phase), sub-claims 3(b), 5, 6, 7, and 8(a); 19 (appellate-counsel ineffective assistance); 20 and 28 (insufficiency of evidence); 21 (Ohio death penalty specification); 22 and 25 (proportionality); and 26 (Ohio death penalty scheme). No jurist of reason would debate the court\u2019s conclusions on these claims.\n\nNo COA will issue for grounds for relief: 1 and 2 (juror selection); 4 (trial-counsel ineffective assistance / *voir dire*); 15 (miscellaneous trial-court errors), sub-claims 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 11; 16 (prosecutorial misconduct), sub-claims 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, and 11; 17 (trial-counsel ineffective assistance / guilt phase), sub-claims 2, 3(a), 3(c), 4, 8(b), and 8(c); and 18 (trial-counsel ineffective assistance / sentencing phase), because they are unequivocally procedurally defaulted.\n\nIn addition, no COA will issue for grounds for relief: 6 (search and seizure); 8 (grand jury transcripts); 10 though 12 (trial-court evidentiary rulings); 13 and 14 (jury instructions); 23 (Ohio post-conviction statute); 24 (weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors); 27 (cumulative error); and 29 (actual innocence), because they are not cognizable on federal habeas review.\nThe court will issue a COA for Mack\u2019s fifth ground for relief, asserting prosecutorial misconduct through the suppression of evidence, and his ninth ground for relief, regarding the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the proffered testimony of Carole Mancino and Curtis Mack. A reasonable jurist could debate the court\u2019s conclusions regarding these claims.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, this court denies Mack\u2019s Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus (Doc. 155). The court further certifies that, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3), an appeal from this decision could be taken in good faith as to the fifth and ninth grounds for relief, and the court issues a certificate of appealability pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 22(b) as to those claims only. As to all remaining claims, the court certifies that, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3), an appeal from this decision could not be taken in good faith, and that there is no basis upon which to issue a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); Fed. R. App. P. 22(b).\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\n\nDate: September 30, 2021\n\n/s/ SOLOMON OLIVER, JR.\nSolomon Oliver, Jr.\nUnited States District Judge", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-03-17", "created":
