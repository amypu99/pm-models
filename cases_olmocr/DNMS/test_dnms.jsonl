{"id": "7a6d963c2e816c8c3922f00c162f66091fd66935", "text": "KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, J.:\n\n{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Michael Davis, appeals his convictions following a jury trial. Finding no merit to the appeal, we affirm.\n\n{\u00b6 2} In 2017, Davis was named in an eight-count indictment charging him with attempted murder, aggravated robbery, discharge of a firearm, having weapons\nwhile under disability, and two counts each of felonious assault and aggravated menacing. The charges stemmed from an altercation that occurred on East 137th Street and Kinsman Road in Cleveland, between Davis and Dion Watson (\u201cWatson\u201d), Ketara Jewell (\u201cJewell\u201d), and Sharon Maddox (\u201cMaddox\u201d), where according to the state, Davis exited a vehicle with a gun drawn, and ultimately engaged in a physical confrontation with Watson, causing him serious injury. It was alleged that Davis discharged the firearm during the incident.\n\n3 A jury trial commenced in July 2018. However, after the jury was empaneled and the first witness testified, the trial court sua sponte declared a mistrial out of manifest necessity based on Davis\u2019s repeated protestations that he wanted to proceed pro se at trial.\n\n4 In January 2020, a second jury trial commenced where Davis represented himself. The jury found Davis not guilty of attempted murder and one count of felonious assault (use of a deadly weapon), but guilty of felonious assault (causing serious physical harm), aggravated robbery, discharge of a firearm, having weapons while under disability, and both counts of aggravated menacing. The trial court sentenced Davis to 24 years in prison.\n\n5 Davis now appeals, raising three assignments of error. Because Davis does not challenge on appeal the sufficiency or manifest weight of the evidence, this court will only set forth the facts as they pertain to each assignment of error.\nI. Mistrial\n\n{\u00b6 6} In his first assignment of error, Davis contends that the trial court abused its discretion in sua sponte declaring a mistrial.\n\n{\u00b6 7} Prior to the start of the July 16, 2018 jury trial, Davis expressed reservations about whether his trial attorneys had spent sufficient time with him to prepare for trial. During one of the exchanges with the trial court, Davis indicated that he wished to represent himself. (Tr. 22-24.) After a lengthy discussion between the court, Davis, and his attorneys, the court assured Davis that he was represented by competent and experienced attorneys who were prepared to go forward with trial.\n\n{\u00b6 8} After the jury was empaneled and Watson testified, Davis addressed the court requesting to represent himself. (Tr. 415.) According to Davis, his attorney did not ask Watson the questions that he wanted her to ask and they had a conflict of interest. (Tr. 415-420.) The court engaged in a long colloquy with Davis, at first denying his request to proceed pro se because they were \u201cthick into this right now.\u201d (Tr. 420.) Additional discussion occurred regarding the amount of time Davis\u2019s attorneys spent with him preparing for trial. (Tr. 422-428.) After further discussion regarding the interplay between what Davis wished his attorney had asked during examination and what was asked, and the rules of evidence, the court took a recess and spoke with counsel off the record. (Tr. 428-430.)\n\n{\u00b6 9} The trial court then again discussed with Davis his concerns regarding his attorneys\u2019 representation. Davis assured the court that his mental health\ndiagnosis was not impacting his decision-making, and that he was fully compliant with his medications. (Tr. 431-436.) Thereafter, the court stated:\n\nOkay. So, with that being said, I think that at this point, the Court has no choice but to declare a mistrial in this case for the manifest necessity.\n\nThe basis, of course, is that the defendant has exerted very clearly the idea that he wishes to represent himself in this matter. And that, frankly, there is a significant amount of discovery which has been reviewed by counsel only and would require the defendant certainly to, at the very least, review that information before proceeding.\n\nAdditionally, while the Court has not gone through the entire colloquy with the defendant on self[-]representation, it\u2019s very clear that he is competent and of clear mind today and very affirmatively expressing his position. However, I do still have to go over that colloquy with you before we begin \u2014\n\n(Tr. 437.)\n\n\\{\u00b6 10\\} The trial court then noted that that the state \u201cstrenuously object[ed] to the court granting a mistrial.\u201d (Tr. 438.) The court expressed its justification:\n\nAnd certainly I have taken into consideration the State\u2019s perspective, but in the interests of justice, the Court has to make decisions which are in the interests of justice.\n\nTherefore, strenuous objection is noted and I should also note that this is the second time in ten years that I\u2019ve declared a mistrial, so it\u2019s not something that the Court either takes lightly or takes an aspersion to.\n\nI certainly have reviewed a number of cases along with the case law that is applicable to the decision that I have just made.\n\n(Tr. 438.) The court again noted, in relevant part,\n\nSo, this is a mistrial necessitated by the defendant just so that the record is clear.\n\nAnd once again, I am obviously significantly concerned about the timing of all of this and recognize that it is suspect from that perspective.\nDavis did not object at any time regarding the trial court\u2019s decision to declare a mistrial. On July 18, 2018, the trial court formally issued a journal entry ordering a mistrial, while noting the state\u2019s objection.\n\nOn October 17, 2018, Davis appeared in court with newly appointed counsel, who advised the court that Davis still wished to represent himself. After a thorough colloquy, Davis unequivocally stated \u201c[i]f I\u2019m competent enough to stand trial, I should be competent enough to represent myself.\u201d (Tr. 456.) Out of concern, the trial court ordered Davis to undergo a competency evaluation at Northcoast Behavioral Health before allowing him to proceed without counsel. In November 2018, the court received a report from Northcoast indicating that Davis was uncooperative with the evaluation. As a result, the court ordered Davis to undergo further evaluation at Northcoast regarding competency.\n\nIn December 2018, the court received a report from Northcoast opining that Davis was competent to stand trial and competent to waive his right to counsel. After the parties stipulated to the report, Davis once again unequivocally stated that he wished to represent himself. (Tr. 465.)\n\nIn February 2019, the trial court engaged in an extensive discussion with Davis about his desire to represent himself. Following this discussion, the trial court engaged in the requisite Crim.R 44 advisements on waiving his right to counsel and proceeding pro se, and Davis executed the appropriate waiver. (Tr. 508, 541-542, 554, 571.)\nIn July 2019, the trial court considered Davis\u2019s multiple motions to dismiss \u2014 none of which asked the court to dismiss the indictment based on double jeopardy grounds. During the motion hearing, the trial court further explained her justification for declaring a mistrial:\n\nI\u2019m going to note for the record that we were, in fact, engaged in trial. We had selected a jury. In fact, we had gone through several days of jury selection and begun opening statements and the presentation of witnesses wherein Mr. Davis at the time seemed to feel uncomfortable and unhappy with the way that the proceedings were going.\n\nHe appeared to the Court to be angry with [his attorneys], and at a time told the Court that he absolutely, unequivocally fired both of his counsel while we were in the middle of trial and was not going to accept them as his counsel anymore. And he made those motions partially in front of the jurors, so it was a rather tenuous situation.\n\nI did grant the defendant\u2019s \u2014 I did grant a motion for a mistrial at that point against the objection \u2014 over the objection of the State of Ohio. I should note that in 11 years as a Common Pleas Court Judge, I have only had two mistrials. This would be the second.\n\nThe second jury trial began on January 27, 2020, without objection or any declaration that Davis\u2019s constitutional rights against double jeopardy were violated because of the retrial. Although Davis proceeded pro se, he had standby counsel assisting him with courtroom procedure.\n\nOn appeal, Davis contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it assumed manifest necessity and declared a mistrial, thus violating his constitutional right against double jeopardy. He contends that neither he nor the state requested a mistrial and that his request to proceed pro se was untimely and,\nthus, should not have been a basis for granting a mistrial. Davis\u2019s arguments are without merit.\n\n\u00b6 17 The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, protects a criminal defendant from multiple prosecutions for the same offense. State v. Truhlar, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103312, 2016-Ohio-5338, \u00b6 33, citing Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 671, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982). The Double Jeopardy Clause does not, however, bar re-prosecution in every case. Truhlar at \u00b6 34. Generally, retrial is permitted whenever a mistrial is declared at the request of or with the consent of the defendant, or the trial court sua sponte declares a mistrial, unless the request is precipitated by prosecutorial misconduct intended to provoke a defendant into seeking a mistrial. Id., citing N. Olmsted v. Himes, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 84076 and 84078, 2004-Ohio-4241, \u00b6 36-37; State v. Bogan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106183, 2018-Ohio-4211, \u00b6 22; see also State v. Truhlar, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105835, 2017-Ohio-9018, \u00b6 7.\n\n\u00b6 18 In this case, there is no allegation of prosecutorial misconduct. And according to Davis, he did not request or consent to a mistrial and thus the court should not have declared a mistrial. Specifically, he directs this court to a single sentence wherein he told the court that his desire to represent himself was not \u201cto postpone this or none of this because I believe the facts of this case will set me free.\u201d (Tr. 427.) Despite this isolated and out-of-context statement, we find that the record demonstrates that Davis\u2019s request to proceed pro se and his actions during the first\ntrial caused the mistrial. Moreover, Davis neither filed a motion to dismiss the charges on double jeopardy grounds nor asserted a violation of his Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy in the trial court. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error and, arguably, he invited any error.\n\nPursuant to Crim.R. 52(B), plain errors or defects that affect substantial rights may be grounds for reversal even though they were not brought to the attention of the trial court. To constitute plain error, there must be (1) an error, i.e., a deviation from a legal rule, (2) that is plain or obvious, and (3) that affected substantial rights, i.e., affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 2002-Ohio-68, 759 N.E.2d 1240. \u201cNotice of plain error under Crim.R. 52(B) is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978), paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\nAssuming that Davis did not consent to the mistrial, double jeopardy will not bar a retrial if (1) there was a manifest necessity or high degree of necessity for ordering a mistrial; or (2) the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated. State v. Widner, 68 Ohio St.2d 188, 189, 429 N.E.2d 1065 (1981), citing Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 505, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978). \u201c\u2018Manifest necessity\u2019 means a \u2018high degree\u2019 of necessity must exist before a mistrial may properly be declared. However, it does not require a showing that a mistrial was \u2018absolutely necessary\u2019 or that there was no other alternative but to declare a\nmistrial.\u201d *State v. Marshall*, 2014-Ohio-4677, 22 N.E.3d 207, \u00b6 21 (8th Dist.), citing *Washington* at 511.\n\nThere is no \u201cmechanical formula\u201d for determining what constitutes a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for a mistrial: \u201c[T]he manifest-necessity standard \u2018abjures the application of any mechanical formula by which to judge the propriety of declaring a mistrial in the varying and often unique situations arising during the course of a criminal trial.\u2019\u201d *Marshall* at \u00b6 22, quoting *State v. Gunnell*, 132 Ohio St.3d 442, 2012-Ohio-3236, 973 N.E.2d 243, \u00b6 27, quoting *Illinois v. Somerville*, 410 U.S. 458, 462, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973).\n\n{\u00b6 21} What constitutes a manifest necessity for a mistrial is, therefore, left to the discretion of the trial court to be decided on a case-by-case basis, considering all the relevant circumstances. *Marshall* at id. This approach is \u201cin recognition of the fact that the trial judge is in the best position to determine whether the situation in his [or her] courtroom warrants the declaration of a mistrial,\u201d *State v. Glover*, 35 Ohio St.3d 18, 19, 517 N.E.2d 900 (1988), but should be used with the \u201cgreatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes.\u201d *Gunnell* at \u00b6 26, quoting *U.S. v. Perez*, 22 U.S. 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824).\n\n{\u00b6 22} In determining whether a mistrial is necessary, the trial court should (1) allow both parties to state their positions on the issue, (2) consider their competing interests, and (3) explore reasonable alternatives, if any, before declaring a mistrial. *Himes*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 84076 and 84078, 2004-Ohio-4241, at \u00b6 44. \u201cA trial court must act \u2018rationally, responsibly, and deliberately\u2019 in determining whether to declare a mistrial.\u201d *Marshall* at \u00b6 25, quoting *Gunnell* at \u00b6 33.\nIn this case, we find no abuse of discretion, and thus no plain error. The record reflects that prior to trial, Davis was concerned about proceeding with his attorneys and thus requested to represent himself. After trial commenced, Davis again expressed dissatisfaction with his attorneys, contending that they did not spend enough time with him preparing for trial, and did not ask the questions he wanted them to ask, and he felt that he could represent himself more effectively. The court later noted that some of these protestations and disruptions occurred in the presence of the jury. See tr. 579-580; 1508 (following Davis\u2019s testimony during the second trial, the court noted that Davis \u201cfired [his attorney] in the middle of trial, claiming that [he] found her to be incompetent, and [he] did not like her representation of [him] at all. And [he] made it clear in front of the last jury that that is how [he] felt\u201d).\n\nFollowing a lengthy colloquy with Davis and counsel \u2014 both on and off the record \u2014 the trial court declared a mistrial, finding it to be a manifest necessity on the basis that Davis unequivocally wished to represent himself. Although the state objected and the trial court did not consider any alternatives to a mistrial on the record, this is not a case in which the parties were afforded no opportunity to state their respective positions or where an adequate alternative remedy was readily apparent, other than to deny Davis\u2019s request for self-representation and require him to proceed with current counsel, which of course the court could have done. However, based on the circumstances of the case and Davis\u2019s outward attitude toward his attorneys, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial\ncourt. The record reflects sufficient justification to conclude that the court acted rationally, responsibly, and deliberately in its decision to grant Davis\u2019s motion to proceed pro se and ultimately declare a mistrial. We further find that the trial court\u2019s actions did not amount to such a manifest miscarriage of justice for this court to recognize plain error.\n\nMoreover, Davis arguably invited the error upon which he now relies on appeal. Under the invited error doctrine, a party is not entitled to take advantage of an alleged error that the party induced or invited the court to make. *State ex rel. Fowler v. Smith*, 68 Ohio St.3d 357, 359, 626 N.E.2d 950 (1994). \u201c[A] litigant cannot be permitted, either intentionally or unintentionally, to induce or mislead a court into the commission of an error and then procure a reversal of the judgment for an error for which he was actively responsible.\u201d *Lester v. Leuck*, 142 Ohio St. 91, 93, 50 N.E.2d 145 (1943). The doctrine precludes a litigant from making \u201can affirmative and apparent strategic decision at trial\u201d and then complaining on appeal that the result of that decision constitutes reversible error. *State v. Doss*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 84433, 2005-Ohio-775, \u00b6 7, quoting *United States v. Jernigan*, 341 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir.2003). The invited error doctrine has been applied in the context of motions for mistrials. *See State v. Osley*, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-17-1025, 2018-Ohio-437, \u00b6 21-26 (discussing cases related to defendants\u2019 outbursts during trial).\n\nIn this case, even if we were to find that the trial court erred in declaring a mistrial, it is apparent that Davis\u2019s actions and assertions were the precipitating events that caused the mistrial; thus, it could be viewed as invited\nerror. The record demonstrates that Davis was unequivocal in his request to dismiss his attorneys during trial and represent himself. The court noted that some of his protestations occurred in the presence of the jury, which could have tainted their perspective and led to an unfair trial. Davis cannot take advantage of the error that he in fact induced. Accordingly, Davis\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\nII. Jury Instructions\n\n{\u00b6 27} In his second and third assignments of error, Davis contends that the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury. Specially, he contends that a flight instruction was not appropriate and that the court should have instructed the jury on self-defense.\n\nA. Flight Instruction\n\n{\u00b6 28} At the request of the state, the trial court gave the jury the following instruction on flight:\n\nNow, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, testimony has been admitted indicating the defendant fled the scene. You are instructed that the fact that the defendant fled the scene does not raise a presumption of guilt, but it may tend to indicate the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt. If you find that the facts do not support that the defendant fled the scene, or if you find that some other motive prompted the defendant's conduct, or if you are unable to decide what the defendant's motivation was, then you should not consider this evidence for any purpose. However, if you find that the facts support the defendant engaged in such conduct, and if you decide the defendant was motivated by a consciousness of guilt, you may, but are not required to consider that evidence in deciding whether the defendant is guilty of any of the crimes charged. You alone will determine what weight, if any to give to this evidence.\n\n(Tr. 1613.)\nThe giving of jury instructions is typically within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we review it for an abuse of discretion. *State v. Howard*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100094, 2014-Ohio-2176, \u00b6 35, citing *State v. Martens*, 90 Ohio App.3d 338, 629 N.E.2d 462 (3d Dist.1993). However, Davis failed to object to the trial court\u2019s decision to instruct the jury on flight and, therefore, has waived all but plain error on appeal. *State v. Lott*, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990); *State v. Burns*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 95465, 2011-Ohio-4230; Crim.R. 52(B); Crim.R. 30(A) (failure to object to the trial court\u2019s jury instructions waives issue on appeal).\n\nAn improper or erroneous jury instruction does not constitute plain error under Crim.R. 52(B) unless, but for the error, the outcome of the trial would clearly have been different. *State v. Cooperrider*, 4 Ohio St.3d 226, 448 N.E.2d 452 (1983). This court has repeatedly held that \u201c[a] mere departure from the scene of the crime is not to be confused with deliberate flight from the area in which the suspect is normally to be found.\u201d *State v. Santiago*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 95516, 2011-Ohio-3058, \u00b6 30, quoting *State v. Norwood*, 11th Dist. Lake Nos. 96-L-089 and 96-L-090, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4420 (Sept. 30, 1997).\n\nIn *State v. Jackson*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100125, 2014-Ohio-3583, \u00b6 48, and *State v. Johnson*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99715, 2014-Ohio-2638, \u00b6 110, the court held that the defendant\u2019s conduct of leaving the scene of the crime did not warrant a flight instruction because there was no evidence of deliberate flight in the sense of evading police. *See also State v. Wesley*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 80684, 2002-Ohio-4429 (flight instruction not warranted based on insufficient evidence).\nIn this case, there was no evidence of Davis\u2019s deliberate flight in the sense of evading police. Nevertheless, the state requested a flight instruction, and the trial court granted the request. Despite this court\u2019s repeated decisions on when a flight instruction is proper and when it is not, the state continues to request the instruction and trial courts continue to grant this request when clearly the instruction is not appropriate and contrary to the controlling case law in the Eighth District. The misapplication of the flight instruction is extremely troubling to this court, and we strongly encourage that the flight instruction should only be requested and given when the facts of the case permit.\n\nDespite the trial court\u2019s error, we cannot say, nor has Davis demonstrated, that the error was prejudicial such that a manifest miscarriage of justice has occurred. Reviewing the instruction as a whole, it allowed the jury to reach its own conclusions on the issue of flight, including whether Davis actually fled the scene, and Davis\u2019s motivation for leaving the scene. Under similar circumstances, this court has declined to find plain error. See, e.g., Jackson and Johnson. We likewise decline to find plain error here. Davis\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\nB. Self-Defense\n\nDavis requested that the trial court instruct the jury on self-defense. The state objected, contending that Davis\u2019s innocence defense or alternative theory that the firearm accidentally discharged were contrary to his claim of self-defense.\nFollowing an extensive and thorough discussion, and a review of the relevant case law, the trial court denied Davis\u2019s request for a self-defense jury instruction.\n\n\u00b6 35 When reviewing a refusal to give a requested jury instruction, an appellate court considers whether the trial court\u2019s refusal was an abuse of discretion under the facts and circumstances of the case. *State v. Wolons*, 44 Ohio St.3d 64, 541 N.E.2d 443 (1989). Trial courts have a responsibility to give all jury instructions that are relevant and necessary for the jury to properly weigh the evidence and perform its duty as the factfinder. *State v. Stephens*, 2016-Ohio-384, 59 N.E.3d 612, \u00b6 17 (8th Dist.), citing *State v. Comen*, 50 Ohio St.3d 206, 553 N.E.2d 640 (1990), paragraph two of the syllabus. Trial courts should ordinarily give a requested jury instruction if it is a correct statement of law, if it is applicable to the facts of the case, and if reasonable minds might reach the conclusion sought by the requested instruction. *State v. Jacinto*, 2020-Ohio-3722, 155 N.E.3d 1056, \u00b6 42 (8th Dist.), citing *State v. Adams*, 144 Ohio St.3d 429, 2015-Ohio-3954, 45 N.E.3d 127, \u00b6 240; see also *Goldfuss v. Davidson*, 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 124, 679 N.E.2d 1099 (1997). In deciding whether to give a self-defense instruction, the trial court must view the evidence in favor of the defendant, and the question of credibility is not to be considered. *Jacinto* at id.; *State v. Robinson*, 47 Ohio St.2d 103, 110-113, 351 N.E.2d 88 (1976).\n\n\u00b6 36 Davis contends that his testimony was sufficient to support a conclusion that he acted in self-defense in relation to Counts 3, 7, and 8 of the indictment. Count 3 charged Davis with felonious assault in violation of R.C.\n2903.11(A)(1), which alleged that Davis caused or attempted to cause serious physical harm to Watson. The state claimed that Davis caused Watson actual injury, i.e., a bite to his arm and injury to his head requiring staples. Counts 7 and 8 each charged Davis with aggravated menacing in violation of R.C. 2903.21(A), alleging that Davis knowingly caused Watson and Jewell to believe that he would cause them serious physical harm. The state claimed that Watson and Jewell each feared for their safety when Davis exited the vehicle with a gun drawn and when the fight over the firearm ensued.\n\nAt trial, Davis testified that he exited his friend\u2019s vehicle and walked in the direction where his other friend was waiting, which happened to be the same direction that Maddox was walking. Davis stated that Maddox reached into her purse, turned around, and pointed a gun at him. He stated that out of fear, he dropped his cell phone and cigar and placed his hands in the air. Davis testified that he threw his keys and money on the ground, which distracted Maddox, allowing him to grab her arm and take the gun from her. He said he placed it behind his back, but turned around when Watson yelled out. Davis stated that Watson charged at him and grabbed the gun. He stated that the two were tussling on the ground when the gun discharged. According to Davis, he stopped wrestling with Watson and attempted to diffuse the situation by stating they should just \u201cmove on.\u201d Davis testified that Watson then head-butted him, which caused him to become dizzy. He said he saw Watson and one of the other females assaulting his friend, but left out of fear because he was on parole. He denied that he threatened anyone with a gun,\nfired the gun at anyone, or assaulted anyone. He claimed the gun discharged during the tussle with Watson.\n\n\u00b6 38 We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Davis\u2019s request for a jury instruction on self-defense. A defendant claiming self-defense \u201cconcedes he had the purpose to commit the act, but asserts that he was justified in his actions.\u201d State v. Talley, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87143, 2006-Ohio-5322, \u00b6 45. Self-defense \u201cpresumes intentional, willful use of force to repel force or escape force.\u201d State v. Champion, 109 Ohio St. 281, 286-87, 142 N.E. 141 (1924). \u201cThus, when an individual testifies that they did not intend to cause harm, such testimony prevents the individual from claiming self-defense.\u201d State v. Hubbard, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 11AP-945, 2013-Ohio-2735, \u00b6 54.\n\n\u00b6 39 In this case, Davis denied that he created the situation or committed any offense. Accordingly, a claim of self-defense is contradictory to his defense of actual innocence. See State v. Kramer, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 01-C.A.-107, 2002-Ohio-4176, \u00b6 53. Self-defense presumes that the facts of the crime, as alleged in the indictment or complaint, are true, but asserts that there are further facts that justify the defendant\u2019s actions and exempt him or her from liability. State v. Poole, 33 Ohio St.2d 18-20, 294 N.E.2d 888 (1973). Davis did not admit that he committed the offense of felonious assault or aggravated menacing; accordingly, the defense of self-defense was not available to him.\n\n\u00b6 40 Moreover, any claim that the gun accidentally discharged is also contrary to a theory of self-defense. See State v. Johnson, 10th Dist. Franklin No.\n06AP-878, 2007-Ohio-2792, \u00b642-43 (defendant\u2019s testimony that the firearm discharged as a result of a struggle for the firearm and not as a result of his intentional and willful act contradicted the application of self-defense). We note that the jury found Davis not guilty of attempted murder and felonious assault with a deadly weapon. Accordingly, insofar as the self-defense instruction was requested involving the discharge of the firearm, the denial of the instruction was not prejudicial. Davis\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n{\u00b6 41} Judgment affirmed.\n\nIt is ordered that appellee recover from appellant costs herein taxed.\n\nThe court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the common pleas court to carry this judgment into execution. The defendant\u2019s convictions having been affirmed, any bail pending is terminated. Case remanded to the trial court for execution of sentence.\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\nKATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, JUDGE\n\nMARY J.

{"id": "b21032bd054d143ca7c697bb78f06ae407d4ec4b", "text": "IN THE COURT OF APPEALS\nFIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT OF OHIO\nHAMILTON COUNTY, OHIO\n\nSTATE OF OHIO, : APPEAL NO. C-170507\n   Plaintiff-Appellee, : TRIAL NO. B-1700427\n\nvs. : O P I N I O N.\n\nMARK HILL, : \n   Defendant-Appellant. :\n\nCriminal Appeal From: Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas\nJudgment Appealed From Is: Affirmed\nDate of Judgment Entry on Appeal: August 8, 2018\n\nJoseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Scott M. Heenan, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for Plaintiff-Appellee,\n\nThe Law Office of John D. Hill, LLC, and John D. Hill, Jr., for Defendant-Appellant.\nZayas, Judge.\n\n{\u00b61} Defendant-appellant Mark Hill was charged with burglary in violation of R.C. 2911.12(A)(2) for entering a residence on Flora Street in the Clifton Heights area and stealing a flat screen television (\u201cTV\u201d) and gaming headphones from Mitch Mrus. Following a bench trial, the trial court found Hill guilty and sentenced him to 48 months in prison for the burglary.\n\n{\u00b62} In this appeal, Hill challenges his conviction on the basis of the sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence, the denial of his motion to suppress, the admissibility of police body camera videos, the ineffectiveness of trial counsel, and the cumulative effect of the errors on his right to a fair trial. We find no merit to Hill\u2019s arguments and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nThe Body Camera Videos\n\n{\u00b63} On January 27, 2017, Cincinnati Police Officer John Neal was dispatched to Emming Street to investigate a report of a brick thrown at a house. He took a statement from the complainants for criminal damaging. While Neal was investigating on Emming Street, Officers Stavale and Pierson responded independently to Coon Alley to investigate a possible suspect.\n\n{\u00b64} When Stavale arrived, Hill was being detained by Officer Bricker. Hill identified himself and stated that he was waiting for his girlfriend to get off of work. Hill began to volunteer personal information. Bricker had placed Hill in handcuffs and informed him that he was being detained. Bricker and Stavale asked him routine questions such as his name, address, social security number, and telephone number. Bricker conducted a pat down, and found a power cord in Hill\u2019s pocket. Bricker retrieved Hill\u2019s identification card, and Stavale took it to his cruiser to run it while Pierson, who had arrived after Stavale, remained with Hill.\nAs Bricker walked away, Hill inexplicably exclaimed, \u201cHey, it\u2019s over there, bro.\u201d Moments later, Bricker found a flat screen TV and gaming headphones behind the car where he first saw Hill. Pierson placed Hill in Stavale\u2019s cruiser, told him that he was being detained while the officers continued to investigate, and placed the TV in the trunk of Stavale\u2019s cruiser.\n\nWhile in the cruiser, Hill continued to make numerous, unprompted, statements to the officers. He told them that the TV was not stolen, and that it was given to him in exchange for drugs. Hill repeatedly told the officers that a friend gave him the TV, that he did not steal it, and that he did not break into any house. He further explained that he had been drinking beer with a friend and left to purchase drugs for that friend. When Hill returned with the drugs, the friend gave him the TV to pay for the drugs.\n\nIn the meantime, Stavale finished running Hill\u2019s identification and told Pierson that Hill had an extensive history of burglaries.\n\nNeal arrived on the scene with the Emming Street complainants in his cruiser. Neal brought them to see if they could identify Hill as the person who threw the brick at their home. Initially, Hill refused to look toward Neal\u2019s cruiser, knocked Neal\u2019s camera to the ground, told him that he could not make him do anything, and demanded the officer call his lawyer. Hill started cursing but finally turned toward the cruiser.\n\nHill was returned to Stavale\u2019s cruiser and continued to explain the circumstances to Stavale and Pierson. He claimed that he had been sitting outside with his friend for four hours drinking. He stated that \u201cRed\u201d pulled up with the dope, and he gave his friend the dope. Hill asked the officer to get both sides of the story.\nAfter the complainants identified Hill as the man who threw the brick, he was placed under arrest for criminal damaging.\n\nThe Motion to Suppress\n\nHill filed a motion to suppress his statements alleging that he was not advised of his rights before he was interrogated.\n\nAt the hearing, Sergeant Vaughn testified that he was a Cincinnati police officer, but was working that night as a supervisor for the University of Cincinnati robbery prevention detail. Vaughn was not wearing a body camera because he was not required to wear one while working a detail.\n\nWhen Vaughn arrived, he saw Hill being detained by Bricker and placed into Stavale\u2019s cruiser. Vaughn did not see Hill again until Stavale transported him to Flora Street after the owner of the TV, Mitch Mrus, was located. Vaughn reached into the driver\u2019s side window of the cruiser, retrieved Stavale\u2019s written Miranda warnings, rolled down the rear passenger window, and read the Miranda rights to Hill. Vaughn did not have Hill sign a written Miranda waiver.\n\nVaughn testified that they had a five minute conversation. Hill explained that he had obtained drugs for Mrus that evening. When he returned to Mrus\u2019s home with the drugs, Mrus gave him permission to take the TV to pay for the drugs. Vaughn further testified that Hill never requested an attorney.\n\nHill testified that he did not make any statements to Vaughn that evening, and that Vaughn did not read him his rights while they were in Clifton Heights. Hill testified that he was not read his rights until the officers had driven him downtown and parked the car. Then, Vaughn informed him he was under arrest for burglary and read him his rights. Hill did not speak to Vaughn after he was Mirandized. Hill admitted that he had made numerous statements to Pierson,\nStavale, and Bricker.\n\n{\u00b616} At the end of the hearing, Hill submitted the body camera videos from Neal, Stavale, and Pierson as a joint exhibit. After reviewing the videos, the trial court denied the motion to suppress.\n\n**The Trial Testimony**\n\n{\u00b617} Mrus testified that he lived on Flora Street in a three-story home with five other college students. On January 22, 2017, he had returned home from a party, intoxicated, and was sitting on his front porch drinking beer. Hill approached him, and they spoke for 20 to 30 minutes. Mrus testified that they may have had a beer together, but he could not remember. He offered to buy Hill a pack of cigarettes, so they walked down the street to the store after 1:30 a.m. When they discovered the store was closed, Mrus left to go to his friend\u2019s house down the street. He did not see where Hill went.\n\n{\u00b618} Mrus testified that his TV, Play Station, and headphones were in his house before he went to his friend\u2019s home. When he returned home between 2:30 a.m. and 3:00 a.m., he saw his TV and his Play Station in the front yard, and his roommates and several police officers in front of his house. No other property was missing.\n\n{\u00b619} Mrus denied purchasing drugs from Hill, and testified that he did not give Hill permission to enter his home or take his TV.\n\n{\u00b620} Bricker testified that he saw Hill on Coon Alley, a few blocks from Emming Street, standing on a driveway between a garage and a parked car. Hill appeared to be hiding, so when Hill walked away from the car, Bricker stopped him further up the street. After Pierson arrived, Bricker walked up the driveway where he initially saw Hill and found a flat screen TV.\nBricker stated that he canvassed the area with Vaughn looking for any signs of a forced entry. They located a house that was missing a TV on Flora Street. After they found the home, Bricker had no further interactions with Hill.\n\nVaughn testified that when he arrived, Hill was being searched by Bricker. Bricker removed a power cord from Hill\u2019s pocket. Later, they determined that the power cord was for the TV they found by the car.\n\nAfter Bricker found the TV, he and Vaughn searched the area to determine where Hill got the TV. When they walked down Flora Street, the residents of 2244 Flora came outside to speak with them. After the officers learned that a TV had been stolen from the home, Stavale drove Hill and the TV to Flora Street. When Mrus came home, he recognized the TV and informed Vaughn that the flat screen TV belonged to him.\n\nDuring this time, Hill was sitting in the back of Stavale\u2019s cruiser. Vaughn approached the car, Mirandized Hill, and spoke with him. Hill told him that he knew Mrus, and that Mrus had owed him money for drugs. Mrus had given him the TV to pay the dealer for the drugs. After Vaughn\u2019s testimony, the state rested.\n\nHill\u2019s motion for an acquittal was denied by the trial court, and Hill testified on his own behalf. Hill stated that he was in Clifton Heights to meet a friend, and he went to the store to buy a beer. While he was walking up Ravine Street, Mrus stopped him and asked for directions because his friend was lost. Mrus invited him to have a beer, and when Hill declined, Mrus begged him to have drinks. Hill finally agreed, and they sat outside Mrus\u2019s home drinking ginger ale beers for three to four hours. Mrus went into the house several times to retrieve the beers.\n\nThey walked to the store because Mrus wanted to buy chewing tobacco. When they arrived at the store, Mrus discovered that he had lost his money,\nso they want back to the house to drink. After drinking four or five beers, Mrus wanted to purchase some marijuana.\n\n{\u00b627} Hill offered to get him cocaine from his friend Red who lived on Stratford. Mrus agreed, so Hill left and walked to get the cocaine. He purchased $90 worth of cocaine, and on his way back, he got into an argument with some white men. He threw a brick at a window where he thought one of the white men lived. Hill returned to Mrus\u2019s house with the drugs.\n\n{\u00b628} Mrus offered to give him his 42-inch flat screen TV to pay for the drugs. Hill entered the home and helped Mrus carry the TV outside. Then, the two parted ways.\n\n{\u00b629} On cross-examination, Hill admitted that he had been convicted of four felonies in the past ten years, and had been incarcerated for more than one year on each. He further testified that both Mrus and Vaughn were lying.\n\n{\u00b630} Hill entered the CD with three body camera videos into evidence as his only exhibit. After confirming the court had reviewed all three videos, the defense rested.\n\n{\u00b631} In finding Hill guilty, the trial court stated that his story was not believable. The court sentenced him to 48 months\u2019 incarceration.\n\n**Manifest Weight of the Evidence**\n\n{\u00b632} In his first assignment of error, Hill argues that his burglary conviction is not supported by the manifest weight of the evidence. Specifically, Hill argues that his testimony more credible than Mrus\u2019s testimony.\n\n{\u00b633} When reviewing a claim that a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and\ndetermine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. *State v. Smith*, 2017-Ohio-8558, 99 N.E.3d 1230, \u00b6 60 (1st Dist.), citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). \u201cBecause the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses at trial, we must defer to the factfinder\u2019s decisions whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses.\u201d *State v. McNeil*, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2017-CA-64, 2018-Ohio-2659, \u00b6 39, citing *State v. Lawson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684 (Aug. 22, 1997).\n\n{\u00b634} Although Hill and Mrus testified to two entirely different versions of events, the trial court believed Mrus\u2019s testimony and discounted Hill\u2019s testimony. In rendering the verdict, the trial court admonished Hill for concocting such a ridiculous story. Based on our review of the record, we cannot say that the court clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that we must reverse Hill\u2019s conviction and order a new trial. Accordingly, we overrule his first assignment of error.\n\n**Sufficiency of the Evidence**\n\n{\u00b635} In his second assignment of error, Hill alleges that the state introduced insufficient evidence to convict him of burglary because there was no evidence that anyone was home or likely to be home when the TV was stolen. He further argues that Mrus and his roommates were all University of Cincinnati college students who were likely to be out partying on a Saturday night between 1:30 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. when the burglary occurred.\n\n{\u00b636} When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offenses\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n{\u00b637} R.C. 2911.12(A)(2) provides, in relevant part, that no person shall \u201c[t]respass in an occupied structure * * * that is a permanent or temporary habitation of any person when any person other than an accomplice of the offender is present or likely to be present, with purpose to commit in the habitation any criminal offense * * *.\u201d\n\n{\u00b638} In determining whether persons were present or likely to be present, a defendant\u2019s knowledge or belief is not relevant. In re Meatchem, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-050291, 2006-Ohio-4128, \u00b6 16. \u201cThe issue is not whether the burglar subjectively believed that persons were likely to be there, but whether it was objectively likely. The significant inquiry is the \u2018probability or improbability of actual occupancy which in fact exists at the time of the offense, determined by all the facts surrounding the occupancy.\u2019\u201d State v. Cravens, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-980526, 1999 WL 567098, * 1 (June 25, 1999), quoting State v. Durham, 49 Ohio App.2d 231, 229, 360 N.E.2d 743 (1st Dist.1976).\n\n{\u00b639} Merely showing that people lived in the home is insufficient; the state must adduce specific evidence that people were present or likely to be present at the time of the burglary. Cravens at *1. See State v. Fowler, 4 Ohio St.3d 16, 18-19, 445 N.E.2d 1119 (1983). Where the state proves that a home is regularly inhabited, the occupying residents were in and out on the day in question, and the house was burglarized when the residents were temporarily absent, the state has presented sufficient evidence to prove the likely to be present element. State v. Kilby, 50 Ohio St.2d 21, 362 N.E.2d 1336, (1977), paragraph one of the syllabus. Courts have found insufficient evidence when the occupants were absent for an extended period of time\non vacation or gone for the entire work day when the house was burglarized during the work day. *State v. Frock*, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2004 CA 76, 2006-Ohio-1254, \u00b6 21.\n\n\u00b640 Here, the burglary occurred sometime after 1:30 a.m. and before 2:30 a.m. The evidence showed that Mrus lived in the three-story home with five roommates. That evening, Mrus had returned home from a party at 11:30 p.m. and sat on his front porch drinking beer. During that time, he went in and out of the house to get more beer. Mrus left his home to go to the store after 1:30 a.m. and then visited a friend for approximately an hour. At the time he left, Mrus testified that his TV, play station, and headphones were still in his home.\n\n\u00b641 When he returned home between 2:30 a.m. and 3:00 a.m., all of his roommates were in front of the house. According to Vaughn, all of the roommates came out of the house to report that the TV was missing when they saw the officers canvassing the area.\n\n\u00b642 From the evidence presented, the fact finder could conclude that someone was likely to be present at the time of the offense. Mrus and his five roommates were college students who shared the home, Mrus had been in and out of the house that evening and was temporarily absent at the time of the burglary, the roommates came out of the home to flag down the officers, and the offense occurred between 1:30 a.m. and 2:30 a.m. when the residents were likely to be sleeping. The state provided sufficient evidence that someone was likely to be present at the time of the burglary. *See Kilby* at paragraph one of the syllabus. We overrule the second assignment of error.\n\n**Statements Made by Hill**\n\n\u00b643 In the third assignment of error, Hill argues that his statements to the police officers should have been suppressed because he was in custody and was\nquestioned without being given *Miranda* warnings.\n\n{\u00b644} Our review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. *State v. Burnside*, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, \u00b6 8. We must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact if they are supported by competent and credible evidence, rely on the trial court\u2019s ability to assess the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether the trial court applied the proper legal standard to the facts. *State v. Baker*, 4th Dist. Washington No. 16CA30, 2018-Ohio-762, \u00b6 7.\n\n{\u00b645} Statements made during custodial interrogation are inadmissible unless the police have given the accused a *Miranda* warning before the interrogation. *Miranda v. Arizona*, 384 U.S. 436, 471, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). A custodial interrogation occurs when a person has been taken into custody or deprived of his freedom, and a law enforcement officer questions that person. *Id.* at 476. \u201c\u2018Interrogation\u2019 includes express questioning as well as \u2018any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u2019\u201d *State v. Strozier*, 172 Ohio App.3d 780, 2007-Ohio-4575, 876 N.E.2d 1304, \u00b6 20 (2d Dist.), quoting *Rhode Island v. Innis*, 446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980).\n\n{\u00b646} A suspect who voluntarily gives information without being asked questions is not subject to a custodial interrogation and is not entitled to *Miranda* warnings. *State v. McGuire*, 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 401, 686 N.E.2d 1112 (1997), citing *State v. Roe*, 41 Ohio St.3d 18, 22, 535 N.E.2d 1351 (1989).\n\n{\u00b647} A review of the body camera videos shows that Hill was in the custody of law enforcement officers when the statements were made. Bricker placed Hill in\nhandcuffs and told him he was being detained. Both Stavale and Bricker obtained basic identifying information from him. As Bricker was walking away, Hill exclaimed, \u201cHey, it\u2019s over there, bro.\u201d Moments later, Bricker found the TV behind the car where he first saw Hill. After Bricker found the TV, Hill was placed in the back of the cruiser. Hill was not read his *Miranda* rights at that time.\n\n{\u00b648} While in the cruiser, Hill continued to make numerous unprompted statements. Hill told the officers that the TV was not stolen and offered to take the officers to the guy who gave it to him. He further claimed that the TV was given to him in exchange for dope. Throughout the videos, Hill can be heard repeatedly telling the officers that he did not steal the TV, and that he obtained it as payment for drugs.\n\n{\u00b649} Hill\u2019s incriminating statements were not the product of custodial interrogation; rather the statements were voluntary and spontaneous. Because the statements were freely made, and not the result of custodial interrogation, Hill was not entitled to *Miranda* warnings. *See McGuire* at 401. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in finding that the statements were admissible.\n\n{\u00b650} Hill also argues that any statements he made to Vaughn flowed from the previous interrogation and should have been suppressed. Because Hill was not subject to custodial interrogation, any statements he made to Vaughn after he was properly advised of and waived his *Miranda* rights were admissible. *See State v. Dixon*, 101 Ohio St.3d 328, 2004-Ohio-1585, 805 N.E.2d 1042, \u00b6 24.\n\n{\u00b651} Hill further claims that the trial court erred in believing Vaughn\u2019s testimony that he administered the *Miranda* warnings to Hill prior to questioning him.\n\n{\u00b652} Here, the trial court determined that Vaughn\u2019s testimony was more\nbelievable than Hill\u2019s. Because issues of credibility are primarily for the trial court to decide, and the record lacks any indication that Vaughn\u2019s testimony was not credible, we find no reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s finding that Vaughn was a more credible witness. We overrule his third assignment of error.\n\n**Other Acts Evidence**\n\n{\u00b653} Next, Hill contends that the unredacted body camera video that suggested his involvement in another criminal offense and referenced his lengthy criminal history constituted inadmissible \u201cother acts\u201d testimony. However, Hill voluntarily admitted the videos at the hearing on the motion to suppress and at trial. Therefore, he has waived his right to appeal their admissibility. See *State v. Smith*, 2017-Ohio-8558, 99 N.E.3d 1230, \u00b6 36 (1st Dist.). The fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n**Ineffective Assistance of Counsel**\n\n{\u00b654} In his fifth assignment of error, Hill argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the inadmissible bad-acts evidence. Specifically, he contends that the identification of Hill as the man who threw the brick and references to his prior convictions for burglary were prejudicial. We note that Hill testified on direct examination that he had thrown the brick after an altercation with a group of white men.\n\n{\u00b655} To prevail on an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, Hill must show trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and he was prejudiced as a result. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In order to demonstrate prejudice, Hill must establish that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, there is a reasonable probability that the result of trial would have been different. *State v. Burke*, 97 Ohio St.3d 55,\nThe failure to make an adequate showing on either prong is fatal to an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. See Strickland at 697.\n\nHill's case was tried to the bench, and we must presume that the \u201ccourt considered only the relevant, material, and competent evidence in arriving at its judgment unless it affirmatively appears to the contrary.\u201d State v. Cowins, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-120191, 2013-Ohio-277, \u00b6 10. Although Hill argues that the evidence was inflammatory, he has failed to establish that the court considered the evidence or that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different absent the evidence. The fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nIn his sixth assignment of error, Hill argues that the cumulative effect of all of the errors denied him his right to a fair trial.\n\nThe doctrine of cumulative error allows a conviction to be reversed if the cumulative effect of errors, deemed separately harmless, deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial. See State v.

{"id": "f93b8e2b412e2dd7703debd1841de80bd8525811", "text": "COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\nEIGHTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\nCOUNTY OF CUYAHOGA\n\nSTATE OF OHIO, : \n\nPlaintiff-Appellee, : No. 108923\n\nv. : \n\nJAVON COOPER, : \n\nDefendant-Appellant. : \n\nJOURNAL ENTRY AND OPINION\n\nJUDGMENT: AFFIRMED\nRELEASED AND JOURNALIZED: September 3, 2020\n\nCriminal Appeal from the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas\nCase No. CR-18-634474-A\n\nAppearances:\n\nMichael C. O\u2019Malley, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting\nAttorney, and Jillian J. Piteo, Assistant Prosecuting\nAttorney, for appellee.\n\nJonathan N. Garver, for appellant.\n\nPATRICIA ANN BLACKMON, J.:\n\nDefendant-appellant Javon Cooper appeals from his convictions for\nattempted murder and felonious assault. He assigns the following errors for our\nreview:\nI. The trial court committed prejudicial error and violated [Cooper's] constitutional rights by allowing the prosecuting attorney, over objection, to introduce evidence of [Cooper's] post-arrest silence.\n\nII. The trial court committed structural error and plain error and denied [Cooper] a fair trial and due process of law by using leading questions to elicit prejudicial testimony from the victim.\n\nIII. The trial court committed prejudicial error by allowing the prosecuting attorney, over objection, to elicit irrelevant and inflammatory prejudicial evidence.\n\nIV. [Cooper's] convictions and sentences are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nV. The trial court committed plain error, invaded the province of the jury, and denied [Cooper] due process of law by instructing the jury that a gun is, \u201cof course\u201d a \u201cdevice or thing designed or especially adapted for use as a weapon,\u201d when that was an issue to be decided by the jury.\n\nVI. [Cooper's] sentence should be reversed because it was based, at least in part, upon unsubstantiated rumors of post-verdict intimidation of the victim by named and unnamed persons allegedly associated with [Cooper].\n\n\u00a7 2 Having reviewed the record and the caselaw, we affirm the decision of the trial court.\n\n\u00a7 3 Cooper was indicted in connection with the 2018 shooting of Antonio Palmer (\u201cPalmer\u201d). Cooper was charged with attempted murder and two counts of felonious assault, all with one-year and three-year firearm specifications. The matter proceeded to a jury trial in June 2019.\n\n\u00a7 4 Palmer testified that on August 30, 2018, his thirtieth birthday, he was riding a bicycle on the playground at Willow Elementary School in Cleveland. While talking on the phone with his brother, Palmer noticed Cooper's car, a black\nBMW vehicle with Arizona license plates. According to Palmer, Cooper got out of his vehicle and fired three or four shots at him, striking him in the arm and leg. Palmer required multiple surgeries and spent four weeks in the hospital.\n\n\\{\u00b6 5\\} Initially, Palmer told police that he did not know the identity of his assailant. He was presented with a photo array containing Cooper\u2019s photograph but did not identify him as the assailant. Palmer stated that he \u201cwas just going to let it be,\u201d and did not want to be a snitch. Several months later, Palmer told police that \u201cCoop\u201d shot him, and picked defendant out of a photo lineup. He explained that he now believed that Cooper could do it to \u201csomebody else,\u201d if he was not apprehended. Palmer testified that during the shooting, he had a clear look at his assailant\u2019s face and recognized him as his girlfriend\u2019s cousin. Palmer also recognized Cooper\u2019s vehicle.\n\n\\{\u00b6 6\\} Palmer did not provide the police with a possible reason for the attack. However, at trial he stated that his girlfriend\u2019s mother has mental health issues, and that she had argued with him shortly before the shooting. During this argument, she stated that he \u201choped to see\u201d his thirtieth birthday.\n\n\\{\u00b6 7\\} On cross-examination, Palmer was questioned about information in the initial police report that indicated the assailant was driving a black BMW with Georgia license plates. Palmer also acknowledged that he and Cooper had never previously spoken to one another, and that in 2015 he was also shot while at Willow Elementary School. Palmer opined that the earlier shooting was related to an\nincident involving his brother, but he did not see the 2015 assailant. Palmer denied gang involvement.\n\n\u00b6 8 After obtaining questions from the jurors, the court also questioned Palmer. During this questioning, the court asked whether, in contrast to Palmer\u2019s testimony that he is concerned that Cooper may shoot someone else, Palmer is concerned that Cooper may shoot him again. Palmer replied that he is concerned about this, but he \u201cwould be good\u201d if Cooper is \u201cput away.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 9 Douglas Mayne (\u201cMayne\u201d) testified that he lived near Willow Elementary playground. While getting his mail on the day of the shooting, he observed kids on the playground. A midsized black car approached that area. Mayne observed \u201cmuzzle flash\u201d from inside the car and heard gunshots. Mayne watched the black car fleeing the area, and he identified Cooper as the driver and the assailant.\n\n\u00b6 10 Neighbor Cody Pawelecki (\u201cPawelecki\u201d) testified that he heard gunshots and saw Palmer on the ground. He drove over to the playground and transported Palmer to MetroHealth Hospital. According to Palmer\u2019s physician, Dr. Levon Khojayan, Palmer arrived at the hospital with life-threatening injuries. Palmer underwent immediate surgery to save his life, but he remained in peril of losing his leg. Palmer had additional wounds in his arm.\n\n\u00b6 11 Cleveland Police Officer Michael Castiglione (\u201cOfficer Castiglione\u201d) testified that he responded to the scene but learned that the shooting victim had been transported away. He located shell casings, and blood evidence.\nCleveland Police Detective James Crivel (\u201cDet. Crivel\u201d) testified that officers received information regarding a black BMW with out-of-state license plates. Recalling that he had previously run the plates of a vehicle with this description, Det. Crivel retrieved the prior LEADS report. The earlier information identified Cooper as the owner of the vehicle. Det. Crivel, accompanied by Cleveland Police Detective Andrew Hayduk (\u201cDet. Hayduk\u201d), subsequently conducted a brief search of Cooper\u2019s residence. They did not locate a weapon.\n\nDet. Hayduk also spoke with Palmer at the hospital. Palmer reported that the assailant was a light complected African-American with a beard. According to Det. Hayduk, Palmer stated that the assailant was driving a black BMW with out-of-state plates, possibly from Georgia. Officers administered a photo array to Palmer that contained Cooper\u2019s photo, but Palmer failed to identify anyone.\n\nDet. Hayduk also spoke with Mayne. In this meeting, Mayne identified Cooper from a photo array. Det. Hayduk subsequently obtained a search warrant for Cooper\u2019s car. Among the items located inside the car was a holster for a handgun.\n\nCleveland Police Detective Michael Cozart (\u201cDet. Cozart\u201d) testified that on November 29, 2018, he presented Palmer with a \u201csix-pack\u201d photo array and Palmer immediately identified Cooper as his assailant. Det. Cozart did not know, however, that Palmer failed to identify Cooper during the earlier photo array and did not know whether Palmer discussed the shooting with others prior to identifying Cooper.\nCooper was convicted of all charges and specifications. The trial court determined that the offenses were all allied offenses of similar import and merged them for purposes of sentencing. The state elected to proceed to sentencing on attempted murder, and the court sentenced Cooper to an eight-year term, and a three-year term for the firearm specification.\n\nPostarrest Silence\n\nIn the first assigned error, Cooper argues that the trial court erred in permitting introduction of evidence that police met with him, but he did not give a statement.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that no person \u201cshall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d See also State v. Leach, 102 Ohio St.3d 135, 2004-Ohio-2147, 807 N.E.2d 335, \u00b6 11. \u201cThe Fifth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination, which includes the right to silence during police interrogation.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 474, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). \u201cOnce a person invokes his or her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, the State cannot use the person\u2019s silence [either in prearrest or postarrest circumstances] as substantive evidence of guilt in its case-in-chief.\u201d State v. Bennett, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 12CA010286, 2014-Ohio-160, \u00b6 63, citing Wainwright v. Greenfield, 474 U.S. 284, 298-299, 106 S.Ct. 634, 88 L.Ed.2d 623 (1986). See also Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 618, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976) (\u201cthe use for impeachment\npurposes of [a defendant\u2019s] silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving *Miranda* warnings, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d).\n\n{\u00b6 19} Further, as this court recently noted in *State v. Rosa*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108051, 2019-Ohio-4888:\n\n[A] *Doyle* violation can also occur when the state uses other witness testimony about a defendant\u2019s silence as implicit evidence or inference of a defendant\u2019s guilt. *See, e.g., State v. Froe*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 02CA2860, 2003-Ohio-7334 (prosecutor can implicitly imply the defendant\u2019s silence is evidence of guilt through police testimony about the defendant invoking his right to remain silent or to consult an attorney); *State v. Jones*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-970043, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 3938 (Aug. 28, 1998). \u201c[T]he test under *Doyle* is to determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s comment was extensive \u2014 \u2018whether an inference of guilt from silence is stressed to the jury *** as a basis of conviction.\u201d *State v. Lanier*, 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT-95-051, 1996 Ohio App. LEXIS 3286, 11 (Aug. 2, 1996), quoting *United States v. Newman*, 943 F.2d 1155, 1158 (9th Cir.1991). ***\n\nIn *State v. Leach*, 102 Ohio St.3d 135, 2004-Ohio-2147, 807 N.E.2d 335, the Ohio Supreme Court held that use of a defendant\u2019s pre-arrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt violates the Fifth Amendment, and that the use of a defendant\u2019s post-arrest, post-*Miranda* invocation of his right to counsel as substantive evidence of guilt violates the Fourteenth Amendment. The court specifically noted, however, that \u201c[the investigating officer\u2019s] testimony that he had made an appointment to meet with [the defendant] to discuss the case but that the appointment was not kept is [a] legitimate [governmental practice]\u201d because the testimony qualified as evidence of the \u201ccourse of investigation.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 32, citing *Combs v. Coyle*, 205 F.3d 269 (6th Cir.2000).\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 37, 39.\n\n{\u00b6 20} The *Rosa* court concluded that a detective\u2019s \u201csingle comment about Rosa\u2019s silence was not extensive that an inference of guilt was stressed to the jury\nand used as a basis for conviction. Rather, * * * this comment was more akin to a response about the detective\u2019s course of investigation.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 38.\n\n{\u00b6 21} Here, the challenged testimony is as follows:\n\nQ. Did you attempt to make contact with the defendant in this case?\n\nA. Yes. I sent notifications to the Fugitives Unit to attempt to try to locate him, and I believe in November they were able to, and while he was at the county jail, I did attempt to interview him at the jail.\n\nQ. Okay. And were you able to or did you interview him?\n\n[Defense counsel]: Objection.\n\nTHE COURT: Well, this is probably objectionable, but I\u2019m not sure why you started this in the first place if it is. So let me hear the answer to this question: Did you interview him?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\n\nTHE COURT: Next question.\n\nQ. And was any statement given?\n\nA. No.\n\n{\u00b6 22} Analyzing this remark and the entire record in this matter, we recognize that the comment at issue was more than the issue contemplated in *Leach*. That is, the challenged testimony constitutes more than merely outlining that the detective made an appointment with Cooper that was not kept. However, in *Leach*, the impermissible evidence further indicated that the defendant said that he was not keeping the interview appointment because he wanted to speak with an attorney. *Id.* at \u00b6 5. The state used this evidence as substantive evidence of guilt. *Id.* at \u00b6 29-30. In this matter, however, no further information as to the reason for the lack of\na statement was elicited. Therefore, we find this matter analogous to *Rosa* in that it was a detective\u2019s \u201csingle comment\u201d about Cooper\u2019s silence, rather than evidence offered as substantive evidence of Cooper\u2019s guilt. Moreover, the remark was not so extensive that an inference of guilt was stressed to the jury or used as a basis for conviction. Rather, we find that this comment can properly be read as a remark about the detective\u2019s course of investigation, and not evidence offered as substantive evidence of guilt.\n\n{\u00b6 23} Accordingly, we conclude that this assigned error is without merit.\n\n**Court\u2019s Leading Questions**\n\n{\u00b6 24} In the second assigned error, Cooper argues that the trial court erred and became \u201can advocate\u201d when it questioned Palmer using leading questions that elicited that he is fearful of further harm from Cooper but \u201cwould be good\u201d if Cooper is \u201cput away.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6 25} We review the court\u2019s questioning for an abuse of discretion. *State v. Skerkavich*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105455, 2019-Ohio-4973, \u00b6 14.\n\n{\u00b6 26} As to the substantive law, the *Skerkavich* court explained:\n\nWith regard to the trial court\u2019s questioning of witnesses, a trial court, in either a bench trial or a jury trial and in accordance with Evid.R. 614(B), \u201cmay interrogate witnesses, in an impartial manner, whether called by itself or by a party.\u201d Evid.R. 614(B). \u201cThis rule exists because the trial court has an \u2018obligation to control proceedings, to clarify ambiguities, and to take steps to insure substantial justice.\u2019\u201d *State v. Stadmire*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 81188, 2003-Ohio-873, \u00b6 26, quoting *State v. Kay*, 12 Ohio App.2d 38, 49, 230 N.E.2d 652 (8th Dist.1967). Furthermore, and pursuant to Evid.R. 611(A), the trial court has discretion to control the flow of the trial. \u201cThis control includes\nasking questions of the participants and the witnesses in a search for truth.\u201d State v. Redon, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92611, 2009-Ohio-5966, \u00b68, quoting State v. Prokos, 91 Ohio App.3d 39, 44, 631 N.E.2d 684 (4th Dist.1993), citing Evid.R. 614.\n\nA trial court\u2019s powers pursuant to Evid.R. 611 and 614 are within its discretion. ***\n\n\u201cA judge abuses his [or her] discretion when he [or she] plays the part of an advocate, but the rule is not so restrictive that [a] judge is not permitted to participate in a search for the truth.\u201d Redon at \u00b611, quoting State v. Kight, 4th Dist. Jackson No. 682, 1992 Ohio App. LEXIS 4727 (Sept. 9, 1992). In this way, a trial court \u201cmay interrogate witnesses, in an impartial manner, whether called by itself or by a party.\u201d Evid.R. 614(B). Absent \u201cany showing of bias, prejudice, or prodding of a witness to elicit partisan testimony, it will be presumed that the trial court acted with impartiality [in propounding to the witness questions from the bench] in attempting to ascertain a material fact or to develop the truth.\u201d State v. Baston, 85 Ohio St.3d 418, 426, 1999-Ohio 280, 709 N.E.2d 128 (1999), quoting Jenkins v. Clark, 7 Ohio App.3d 93, 98, 7 Ohio B. 124, 454 N.E.2d 541 (2d Dist.1992).\n\nHowever, \u201cthere are strict limits placed on the propriety of judicial questions of witnesses, lest the court by its inquiries give the appearance of favoring one side or the other.\u201d Harper v. Roberts, 173 Ohio App. 3d 560, 2007-Ohio-5726, 879 N.E.2d 264, \u00b67 (8th Dist.). With regard to a bench trial, \u201cthe court is \u2018accorded greater flexibility in questioning witnesses * * * [because] when there is no jury, there is no one to be prejudicially influenced by the judge\u2019s demeanor.\u2019\u201d Sheflyand v. Schepis, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 95665 and 95667, 2011-Ohio-2040, \u00b635, quoting Mentor v. Brancatelli, 11th Dist. Lake No. 97-L-011, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 5439, 10 (Dec. 5, 1997).\n\nId. at \u00b613-16.\n\n{\u00b6 27} In Skerkavich, this court determined that the trial court exceeded its permissible questioning where its questions greatly exceeded the questions asked by the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel, and the court\u2019s questions\ndemonstrated bias and prejudice. *Id.* at \u00b6 25. This court ruled that the trial court did not merely attempt to ascertain a material fact or attempt to develop the truth, but instead abandoned its duty as an impartial factfinder. Based upon the extent and tone of the questions, this court concluded that \u201c[t]he trial court was in no way attempting to clear up inconsistencies, contradictions, or ambiguities. Instead, the trial court took the stance of a biased advocate on the side of the prosecution.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 23.\n\n\u00b6 28 Here, Cooper takes issue with these questions:\n\nTHE COURT: Are you also concerned he\u2019ll do it to you again?\n\nTHE WITNESS: No. I said he\u2019ll do it to me so he\u2019ll do it to someone else.\n\nTHE COURT: I understood your answer, but are you also concerned that he might shoot you?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Oh, yes.\n\nTHE COURT: What about having that concern now that you\u2019re testifying?\n\n(Tr. 241)\n\n\u00b6 29 Considering the questioning, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion. Unlike the questioning condemned in *Skerkavich*, the court\u2019s questions were prompted by juror questions and were very brief. Examining the volume, content, and tone, we find no demonstration of bias or prejudice. Rather, we conclude that the questions were posed to ascertain Palmer\u2019s reasons for naming Cooper as his assailant despite his initial failure to identify him. The court\u2019s\nquestions were a clear attempt to develop the truth, and to ascertain the material facts.\n\n\u00b6 30 This assigned error is without merit.\n\nPrejudicial Evidence\n\n\u00b6 31 In the third assignment error, Cooper argues that the trial court erred and violated Evid.R. 402 and 403 in admitting evidence of Palmer\u2019s fear of Cooper after the shooting.\n\n\u00b6 32 The admission of evidence \u201clies within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a reviewing court should not disturb evidentiary decisions in the absence of an abuse of discretion that has created material prejudice.\u201d State v. Conway, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 62. This court\u2019s review is limited to determining whether the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings were unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 23, 2002-Ohio-68, 759 N.E.2d 1240.\n\n\u00b6 33 \u201cAll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by [federal and state law.]\u201d Evid.R. 402. Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evid.R. 401. But it is \u201cnot admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d Evid.R. 403(A). Relevant evidence \u201cmay be excluded if its\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by considerations of undue delay, or\nneedless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Evid.R. 403(B).\n\n\u00b6 34 In this case, Cooper complains that the trial court erred in admitting\ntestimony that Palmer is afraid of Cooper due to the shooting. However, we find no\nabuse of discretion. Palmer initially testified that he refused to cooperate with the\npolice in prosecuting the assailant and decided to leave it \u201cin the street.\u201d When\nPalmer later changed his mind, he stated that he was afraid Cooper would shoot\nsomeone else, and the court inquired as to whether Palmer was concerned for his\nown safety. This question was probative of Palmer\u2019s truthfulness in identifying\nCooper as the assailant, and it tested Palmer\u2019s consistency in believing that Cooper\nis dangerous. Moreover, the question simply raises the commonsense concern as to\nwhether the victim of a claimed assailant is fearful. There is nothing out of the\nordinary about the question or the answer.\n\n\u00b6 35 This assigned error lacks merit.\n\nManifest Weight of the Evidence\n\n\u00b6 36 In the fourth assigned error, Cooper argues that his convictions are\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence because of Palmer\u2019s failure to identify\nhim from a photo array, his subsequent claim that the assailant was Cooper,\nsomeone he knew, and whose car he had seen before. Cooper also notes that during\ntrial, Palmer theorized that the shooting related to an issue with his girlfriend\u2019s\nmother, and, he argues, this claim was not sufficiently investigated. Likewise,\nCooper complains that the investigation failed to discount the possibility that the\nshooting was caused by gang members who had previous interactions with Palmer's brother.\n\n{\u00b6 37} \u201c[W]eight of the evidence involves the inclination of the greater amount of credible evidence.\u201d State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). Weight of the evidence concerns \u201cthe evidence\u2019s effect of inducing belief.\u201d State v. Wilson, 113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, \u00b6 25, citing Thompkins at 386-387. The reviewing court must consider all the evidence in the record, the reasonable inferences, and the credibility of the witnesses to determine \u201cwhether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d Thompkins at 387, quoting State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\n\n{\u00b6 38} Furthermore, \u201cthe weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d State v. DeHass, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212 (1967), paragraph one of the syllabus. When examining witness credibility, \u201cthe choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact.\u201d State v. Awan, 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 123, 489 N.E.2d 277 (1986). The fact-finder \u201cis free to believe all, some, or none of the testimony of each witness appearing before it.\u201d State v. Ellis, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98538, 2013-Ohio-1184, \u00b6 18.\nUpon review, we cannot say that the jury lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice by convicting Cooper of the offenses. We recognize that Palmer initially told the police that he did not know his assailant; he stated that the shooter was driving a black BMW with out-of-state license plates. He did not identify Cooper from a photo array. However, months later, Palmer clearly identified Cooper and stated that he knew him, and that Cooper is his girlfriend\u2019s cousin. Although Mayne\u2019s testimony differed from Palmer\u2019s as to whether the shooter was inside or out of the car during the shooting, Mayne also stated that a dark car was involved, and he identified Cooper as the assailant. The jury was free to resolve the inconsistencies, and the basic evidence presented linked Cooper and his car to the shooting. The convictions for attempted murder and felonious assault with firearm specifications are not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n**Instruction as to firearm**\n\nIn the fifth assigned error, Cooper argues that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that a \u201cdeadly weapon *** candidly includes a gun, of course.\u201d He complains that this remark was tantamount to an instruction to the jury that it must find that a deadly weapon was used during the offenses.\n\nHere, the indictment charged Cooper with felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), setting forth that Cooper \u201cdid knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to John Doe by means of deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance, to wit: handgun.\u201d The jury instructions defined a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d as:\nA deadly weapon is any instrument, device, or thing that has two characteristics. The first is that it is capable of inflicting or causing death. The second is in the alternative; either the instrument, device or thing was designed or especially adapted for use as a weapon and that candidly includes a gun, of course, or the thing was possessed, carried or used in this case as a weapon. These, of course, are questions of fact for you to decide.\n\nI will tell you that I take no position on what the facts are or aren\u2019t here, but you have heard evidence that Palmer was shot with a gun. These instructions are meant to cover all possibilities. So some cases the person might be hit with a bat and there\u2019s a question of is that a deadly weapon. If some of this verbiage seems excessive, that\u2019s the reason for that.\n\n(Tr. 497.)\n\n\u00b6 42 As an initial matter, we note that it is not appropriate to use the term \u201cof course\u201d when instructing a jury as to what they alone must find. In determining whether prejudicial error occurred herein, we recognize that R.C. 2923.11(A) defines \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d as \u201cany instrument, device, or thing capable of inflicting death, and designed or specially adapted for use as a weapon, or possessed, carried, or used as a weapon.\u201d See also Committee Comment to R.C. 2923.11(A) which specifically includes, as examples of a \u201cdeadly weapon\u201d \u201csuch as a gun, knife, billy, or brass knuckles[.]\u201d Further, this court has determined that a gun is \u201ccapable of inflicting death,\u201d as set forth in R.C. 2923.11(A). State v. Strowder, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 53840, 1988 Ohio App. LEXIS 1852 (May 12, 1988). Unloaded guns have also met this definition. State v. Tate, 54 Ohio St.2d 444, 446, 377 N.E.2d 778 (1978). Moreover, there is no indication that the instant attack involved a nonlethal instrument such as a toy or other device that is not cable of inflicting death. State v. Hammond, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99074, 2013-Ohio-2466, \u00b6 21. We also note that\nthe court\u2019s remark was not added in connection with the court\u2019s instructions on firearms specifications, which also require evidence establishing operability etc. See R.C. 2941.145. Therefore, although we caution against the use of the phrase \u201cof course\u201d in a jury charge, we find no prejudicial error in this matter.\n\n**Sentence**\n\n\u00b6 43 In the sixth assigned error, Cooper argues that the trial court erred in sentencing him and was influenced by Palmer\u2019s day-of-sentencing disclosure that he has been receiving threats since the verdict.\n\n\u00b6 44 As an initial matter, we note that the sentence is within the range set forth for attempted murder, that is punishable by prison terms of three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, or eleven years. R.C. 2923.02(E); 2929.14(A)(1). Additionally, the trial court stated, and the journal entries indicate, that the court considered the purposes and principles of felony sentencing set forth in R.C. 2929.11 and the sentencing factors listed in R.C. 2929.12. Therefore, the sentence is presumptively valid. *State v. Colon*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105571, 2018-Ohio-280, \u00b6 7; *State v. Collier*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 95572, 2011-Ohio-2791, \u00b6 15.\n\n\u00b6 45 Furthermore, prior to imposing sentence, the trial court explicitly informed Cooper that it was not going to take into account the reported alleged threats in fashioning the sentence. The trial court stated: \u201cI\u2019ve taken into account everything that the two lawyers and you have said here today, while discounting Mr. Palmer\u2019s representation of post-trial conduct to [the prosecuting attorney] as she described here this morning.\u201d (Tr. 570-571.)\nTherefore, we cannot accept Cooper\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in imposing sentence herein.\n\nThe sixth assigned error is without merit.\n\nJudgment is affirmed.\n\nIt is ordered that appellee recover from appellant costs herein taxed.\n\nThe court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the common pleas court to carry this judgment into execution. The defendant\u2019s conviction having been affirmed, any bail pending is terminated. Case remanded to the trial court for execution of sentence.\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\nPATRICIA ANN BLACKMON, JUDGE\n\nMARY J.
