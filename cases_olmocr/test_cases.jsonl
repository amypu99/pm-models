Emerick for Appellee\nZIMMERMAN, J.\n\n{\u00b61} Defendant-Appellant, Raylon A. Davis (\u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals his convictions from the Allen County Common Pleas Court for one count of possession of cocaine and one count of possession of heroin in case number CR 2014 0118; and one count of possession of cocaine, one count of possession of heroin, one count of possession of marijuana, one count of illegal cultivation of marijuana and one count of having weapons while under disability in case number CR 2015 0361. On appeal, Appellant asserts, in each case, that: 1) his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence; 2) his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence; 3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel; 4) the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss; 5) the trial court erred by permitting appellee to present the testimony of an expert witness who had not provided the defense with a report; 6) the trial court erred by consolidating his two cases for trials; and 7), 8) the trial court erred by denying Appellant\u2019s motions to suppress evidence in each case. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n\nFactual Background - Case Number CR 2014 0118\n\n{\u00b62} On March 14, 2014, (then) Lima Police Department Patrolman Trent Kunkleman (\u201cKunkleman\u201d) was on third shift patrol in the city of Lima, Ohio. (Doc. No. 146). Around 3:20 a.m., Kunkleman responded to a police dispatch to a\ndowntown parking lot in Lima in regards to a suspicious silver vehicle. (Id.). Upon arriving at the parking lot, Kunkleman located a grey Hyundai. (Id.). Kunkleman testified that the Hyundai was the only vehicle in the parking lot, so he shined his spotlight into the vehicle, identifying the Appellant as its sole occupant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b63} A second Lima police officer, Sergeant Hillard (\u201cHillard\u201d), arrived at the parking lot shortly after Kunkleman. (Id.). Hillard testified that he received a police dispatch that a suspicious vehicle\u2019s car alarm was going off\\(^1\\) in the Lima parking lot in question. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b64} After Hillard arrived, Kunkleman walked up to the Appellant\u2019s vehicle in an attempt to engage Appellant in conversation, but Appellant did not respond. (Id.). Instead, Appellant exited his vehicle, turned his back to Kunkleman, and then leaned back into the vehicle. (Id.). Kunkleman testified that he was unable to see Appellant\u2019s hands, but was able to smell an overwhelming odor of raw marijuana. (Id.). At this point, Kunkleman became alarmed that Appellant might be reaching into his vehicle for a weapon, so he pulled Appellant away from the car. (Id.). Officers Kunkleman and Hillard testified that they saw the Appellant placing his hand down into his pants pocket at this point. (Id.). Two additional law enforcement officers, who had also arrived on the scene, then grabbed Appellant and patted him down for officer safety. (Id.). During the pat down, officers testified that there was\n\n\\(^1\\) Dash-cam video entered into evidence confirms that a car alarm was going off. (Id.; Mot. To Suppress Hearing, 06/30/2016, State\u2019s Ex. 2).\na strong odor of marijuana coming from Appellant. (Id.). Officers testified that they felt a \u201cbaggie\u201d in Appellant\u2019s left pocket. (Id.). Officers removed the baggie, which contained drugs. (Id.). Appellant was then arrested. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b65} After Appellant\u2019s arrest, Kunkleman returned to the vehicle to investigate the odor of marijuana coming from it. (Id.). Hillard, who was also at the vehicle at this time, searched the vehicle, and found a paper sack under the driver\u2019s seat that contained a large amount of cocaine. (Id.). In addition to the cocaine, officers located heroin, marijuana, ecstasy pills, a digital scale, and a ledger in the vehicle. (Id.).\n\nProcedural Background - Case Number CR 2014 0118\n\n{\u00b66} On May 15, 2014, the Allen County Grand Jury indicted Appellant on three (3) counts, including: Count One, possession of drugs (cocaine) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(4)(e), a first degree felony; Count Two, possession of drugs (heroin) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(6)(b), a fourth degree felony; and Count Three, aggravated possession of drugs (ecstasy) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(1)(a), a fifth degree felony. (Doc. No. 3).\n\n{\u00b67} Ultimately, Appellant was arraigned in the Allen County Common Pleas Court on January 23, 2015.\u00b2 (Doc. No. 13). Appellant\u2019s recognizance bond\n\n\u00b2 The record reveals a significant gap in time between Appellant\u2019s indictment and his arraignment. However, the record also reveals that Appellant made his initial appearance in the Lima Municipal Court on March 21, 2014, wherein he posted a $500,000 cash surety bond and was released. (Doc. No. 2).\nwas set at $100,000 cash or surety, which Appellant posted. (Doc. No. 11). However, on October 1, 2015, the trial court ordered that Appellant\u2019s bond be forfeited because he failed to appear for a pre-trial conference. (Doc. No. 32). A bench warrant for Appellant\u2019s arrest was then issued by the trial court. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b68} On September 17, 2015, Appellant was indicted on new charges in Allen County.3\n\n{\u00b69} On February 19, 2016, Appellant was apprehended by the US Marshall\u2019s Service in Detroit, Michigan. (Doc. No. 34). After returning to Allen County, the trial court ordered that the Appellant be held in the Allen County Jail, without bond, until further order of the Court. (Doc. No. 38). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was then scheduled for April 19, 2016. (Doc. No. 69).\n\n{\u00b610} On April 12, 2016, Appellant filed a motion to suppress in the trial court. (Doc. No. 87). On May 5, 2016, Appellant executed a waiver of his right to speedy trial. (Doc. No. 115).\n\n{\u00b611} A hearing on the motion to suppress occurred on June 30, 2016. (Doc. No. 138). And, on July 21, 2016, the trial court issued its ruling overruling Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. (Doc. No. 146).\n\n{\u00b612} On July 7, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate Appellant\u2019s cases. (Doc. No. 137). Appellant filed his oppositions to the State\u2019s motion to\n\n---\n\n3 This is Case Number CR 2015 0361, which we will address infra.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nconsolidate on July 15, 2016 and on August 22, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 139; 159). On August 26, 2016 the trial court consolidated the cases. (Doc. No. 163).\n\n{\u00b613} On August 3, 2016, Appellant signed and filed a second waiver of his speedy trial rights in the trial court. (Doc. No. 155). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was rescheduled for December 20, 2016. (Doc. No. 169). On November 28, 2016, Appellant, through counsel, filed a motion to continue. (Doc. No. 171). Specifically, Appellant\u2019s trial counsel represented to the court that he had encountered difficulty contacting potential defense witnesses in preparation for trial. (Id.). A hearing was held on Appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance on November 30, 2016. (Doc. No. 174). At the hearing, Appellant refused to further waive his right to a speedy trial beyond the January 1, 2017 date set forth in Appellant\u2019s previous waiver. (Id. at 2). Despite Appellant\u2019s refusal, the trial court found that a sixty (60) day continuance was necessary and not unreasonable under the circumstances. (Id. at 8). Appellant\u2019s trial was set for February 21, 2017. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b614} On February 3, 2017, the State filed its motion for a continuance, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in State v. Gonzales, requiring that the State must prove the actual weight of a drug in question, (excluding any filler materials) to meet the statutory weight requirement. (Doc. No. 180). Stated better, based on the change in the prosecution of drug offenses under State v. Gonzales, the State requested additional time to determine the actual weight of the cocaine\npossessed by Appellant. Appellant objected to the State\u2019s motion for continuance. (Doc. No. 181). The trial court, finding that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom in drug prosecutions, granted the State\u2019s motion. (Doc. No. 182). Ultimately, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017. (Doc. No. 184).\n\n{\u00b615} On April 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss in the trial court. (Doc. No. 202). Specifically, Appellant requested that his cases be dismissed, pursuant to R.C. 2945.73(B) and R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), because he had been held in custody for 276 days, which exceeded the statutorily permissible 270 days. (Id.). The State responded to Appellant\u2019s motion, arguing that the time involving its continuance (of February 3, 2017) should not count against it, because that continuance was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d under the circumstances of the case. (Doc. No. 205). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motion on April 19, 2017. (Doc. No. 206).\n\n{\u00b616} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 211). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 214).\n\n{\u00b617} On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d and a \u201cmotion for continuance of trial date.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 237; 238). Appellant alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nwitnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions on August 1, 2017, finding that Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the cases. (Doc. No. 239).\n\n\u00b618 Appellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 243). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2014 0118, the State made an oral motion to amend Count One in the indictment, possession of cocaine, a felony of the first degree, to possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree. (Id.). The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion. (Id.) Further, the State made an oral motion to dismiss Count Three in the indictment, aggravated possession of drugs, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court also granted. (Id.). The Appellant did not object to either motion.\n\n\u00b619 Appellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding the Appellant guilty of Count I, possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree and of Count II, possession of heroin, a felony of the first degree. (Id.).\n\n\u00b620 Ultimately, and in case number CR 2014 0118, the trial court sentenced the Appellant to consecutive prison terms of six (6) years (Count I) and twelve (12) months (Count II) on September 14, 2017. (Doc. No. 244).\nFactual Background - Case Number 2015 CR 0361\n\n{\u00b621} On January 12 or 13, 2015, investigators with the West Central Ohio Criminal Task Force (\u201cWCOCTF\u201d) commenced an investigation to locate the Appellant, due to Appellant\u2019s outstanding warrants. (Doc. No. 100). On January 12, 2015, the Lima Police Department received an anonymous telephone call\\(^4\\) that Appellant was staying at 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio. (Id.). The caller further advised officers that Appellant was not a tenant on the lease at that location. (Id.). Sgt. Charles Godfrey, (\u201cGodfrey\u201d) then a supervisor at WCOCTF, attempted to contact the anonymous caller to verify the information provided, but was unable to do so. (Id.). So, based on the information provided (by the anonymous caller), Godfrey set up an undercover operation on January 13, 2015 to monitor the 1222 Catalpa Street residence in an attempt to locate Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b622} On January 17, 2015, Godfrey observed a Chrysler 300 parked at the Catalpa Street residence. (Id.). Later that day, an individual in a hooded sweatshirt left the residence in that vehicle. (Id.). Since the vehicle\u2019s windows were heavily tinted, and because Godfrey could not see inside it, Godfrey arranged for the Ohio State Highway Patrol to stop the vehicle for a tinted windows violation. (Id.). When the Chrysler was stopped a person identified as \u201cWatkins\u201d was located as a passenger in the vehicle. (Id.). Watkins told law enforcement officials that he and\n\n\\(^4\\) The anonymous caller was later identified as the landlord of the duplex wherein Appellant was staying. (See, Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 10/20/2016 Tr. at 7).\nthe driver had been visiting \u201cRay\u201d at 1222 Catalpa Street. (Id.). When shown a picture of Appellant, Watkins confirmed that \u201cRay\u201d was the Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b623} With that information (from Watkins), Godfrey returned to 1222 Catalpa Street, believing that Appellant was present in the residence. (Id.). And, after verifying that Appellant still had active outstanding warrants, Godfrey went to the residence\u2019s front door while law enforcement set up a perimeter around the house. (Id.). Godfrey knocked on the door, identified that he was a police officer, and that he had a warrant for Appellant\u2019s arrest. (Id.). Godfrey further advised that if the door wasn\u2019t opened it would be knocked down. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b624} While Godfrey was at the front door attempting to kick it in, another investigator radioed Godfrey, advising him that the Appellant was seen leaving the residence through the back door, but then returned into the residence when law enforcement officials were seen. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b625} Law enforcement eventually entered the house, located Appellant, and arrested him on the outstanding warrants. (Id.). During a protective sweep of the residence, officers observed a \u201cmarijuana grow tent\u201d in plain view. (Id.). Officers observed several marijuana plants and a marijuana grow operation inside the tent (which was searched because it was large enough to conceal a person). (Id.). Based on the Appellant\u2019s arrest and the officer\u2019s observations during the protective sweep, law enforcement immediately obtained a search warrant for the residence. (Id.).\nProcedural Background - Case Number CR 2015 0361\n\n{\u00b626} On September 17, 2015, Appellant was indicted by the Allen County Grand Jury in case number CR 2015 0361 on five counts: Count One, possession of drugs (cocaine) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(4)(d), a second degree felony; Count Two, possession of drugs (heroin) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(6)(d), a second degree felony; Count Three, possession of drugs (marijuana) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(3)(d), a third degree felony; Count Four, illegal cultivation of marijuana in violation of R.C. 2925.04(A)&(C)(5)(d), a third degree felony; and Count Five, having weapons while under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3)&(B), a felony of the third degree. (Doc. No. 1). Furthermore, Counts One, Two, Three, and Four each contained the following specifications: 1) Specification for Forfeiture of a Gun in a Drug Case, pursuant to R.C. 2941.1417(A); 2) Specification for Forfeiture of Money in a Drug Case, pursuant to R.C. 2941.1417(A); 3) Specification for Forfeiture of Property, pursuant to R.C. 2941.1417(A); 4) Specification for Forfeiture of a Gun in a Drug Case, pursuant to R.C. 2941.1417(A); and 5) Specification for Forfeiture of a Gun in a Drug Case, pursuant to R.C. 2941.1417(A). (Id.).\n\n{\u00b627} On February 25, 2016, Appellant was arraigned in the trial court and entered pleas of \u201cnot guilty to all counts and specifications\u201d in the indictment. (Doc. No. 9). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was scheduled for May 10, 2016. (Doc. No. 14).\nOn April 15, 2016, Appellant filed a motion to suppress/motion in limine in the trial court. (Doc. No. 25). Specifically, Appellant argued that law enforcement\u2019s warrantless search of the residence (where Appellant was located) was unconstitutional. (Id.). Further, Appellant filed a motion to continue his trial on May 5, 2016, so his pending motion to suppress could be heard. (Doc. No. 28). He also executed a waiver of his speedy trial rights pursuant to R.C. 2945.71 on the same date. (Doc. No. 30). The trial court granted his continuance and Appellant\u2019s jury trial was rescheduled for September 20, 2016. (Id.).\n\nOn July 7, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate both of Appellant\u2019s criminal cases. (Doc. No. 39). Appellant opposed the State\u2019s request. (See, Doc. No. 48).\n\nOn August 3, 2016, Appellant executed another waiver of his speedy trial rights pursuant to R.C. 2945.71. (Doc. No. 61). However, Appellant\u2019s waiver and continuance was for a date certain, January 1, 2017. (Id.).\n\nAppellant, through his then counsel, filed an additional motion to suppress in the trial court on August 22, 2016. (Doc. No. 76). Also on that date, Appellant filed a supplemental motion in opposition to the State\u2019s motion to consolidate his cases. (Doc. No. 77).\n\nOn August 26, 2016, the trial court granted the State\u2019s motion to consolidate. (Doc. No. 82). Specifically, the trial court found that the charges were\nof the same or similar character sufficient to permit joinder, and that Appellant failed to demonstrate sufficient information to show that joinder violated his right to a fair trial. (Id.).\n\n\u00b633 On September 27, 2016, Appellant\u2019s jury trial was rescheduled for December 20, 2016. (Doc. No. 93).\n\n\u00b634 On October 20, 2016, the trial court held a motion hearing on Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. (Motion to Suppress Hearing, 10/20/2016 Tr.). The trial court found, based upon the evidence presented, that the search warrant of 1222 Catalpa Street was supported by sufficient probable cause and further found that statements that Appellant made to law enforcement officials did not require Miranda warnings because Appellant made unsolicited statements that were not the result of police interrogation. (Doc. No. 100).\n\n\u00b635 On November 28, 2016, Appellant filed another motion for continuance of his jury trial, averring that his counsel had encountered difficulty locating a potential witness. (Doc. No. 102). The trial court granted the motion and continued Appellant\u2019s jury trial until February 21, 2017. (Doc. No. 105).\n\n\u00b636 On February 3, 2017, the State filed its motion for a continuance, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in State v. Gonzales, requiring that the State must prove the actual weight of a drug in question, (excluding any filler materials) to meet the statutory weight requirement. (Doc. No. 107). Stated better,\nbased on the change in the prosecution of drug offenses under *State v. Gonzales*, the State requested additional time to determine the actual weight of the cocaine possessed by Appellant. Appellant objected to the State\u2019s motion for continuance. (Doc. No. 108). The trial court, finding that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in *Gonzales* was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom in drug prosecutions, granted the State\u2019s motion for a continuance. (Doc. No. 109). Ultimately, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017. (Doc. No. 111).\n\n{\u00b637} On April 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss in the trial court. (Doc. No. 139). Specifically, Appellant requested that his cases be dismissed, pursuant to R.C. 2945.73(B) and R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), because he had been held in custody for 276 days, which exceeded the statutorily permissible 270 days. (*Id.*). The State responded to Appellant\u2019s motion, arguing that the time involving its continuance (of February 3, 2017) should not count against it, because that continuance was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d under the circumstances of the case. (Doc. No. 140). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motion on April 19, 2017. (Doc. No. 141).\n\n{\u00b638} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 147). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 150).\nOn July 24, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel.\u201d (Doc. No. 173). On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed an additional \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d as well as a \u201cmotion for continuance of the trial date,\u201d \u201cmotion for specific discovery,\u201d and \u201cmotion to suppress evidence.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 180; 181; 182; 183). Appellant, through his various motions, alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena witnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The Appellant further alleged that the State had failed to provide specific discovery. (Doc. No. 182). On August 1, 2017, the trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions, finding that the Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the case. (Doc. No. 186).\n\nAppellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 194). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2015 0361, the State made an oral motion to amend Count Three in the indictment, possession of marijuana, a felony of the third degree, to possession of marijuana, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court granted. (Id.) The Appellant did not oppose the amendment. (Id.).\n\nAppellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding Appellant guilty of all charges. (Id.). Further, Appellant was found guilty of all specifications except for the specification for property (electronics) contained in Count One and Count Two. (Id.).\nAppellant was sentenced on September 14, 2017 in the trial court and was ordered to serve a prison term of: seven (7) years in prison under Count One; seven (7) years in prison under Count Two; twelve (12) months in prison under Count Three; thirty (30) months in prison under Count Four; and thirty-six (36) months in prison under Count Five. (Doc. No. 200). The trial court further ordered that all counts be served consecutively to each other and consecutively to the prison sentence imposed in case number CR 2014 0118. (Id.). With regards to the specifications, the firearms were ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; the money was ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; and the electronics (subject to the specification in Counts Three and Four) were ordered forfeited to the WCOCTF. (Id.). Appellant\u2019s prison sentences totaled twenty-eight (28) and a half years. (Id.).\n\nFrom the judgments in case number CR 2014 0118 and case number CR 2015 0361 Appellant timely appeals, and presents the following assignments of error for our review:\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO.

For the reasons outlined below, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n\u201cWhether there is legally sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict is a question of law.\u201d *State v.

Ruby*, 149 Ohio App.3d 541, 2002-Ohio-5381, 778 N.E.2d 101, \u00b6 36.\n\n{\u00b650} The State may establish constructive possession by circumstantial evidence alone. *Id.* at \u00b6 19. \u201cAbsent a defendant\u2019s admission, the surrounding facts and circumstances, including the defendant\u2019s actions, are evidence that the trier of fact can consider in determining whether the defendant had constructive possession.\u201d *Id.*\n\n{\u00b651} In case number CR 2014 0118, the State produced competent and credible evidence establishing that Appellant had possession of the cocaine and heroin as charged. Specifically, Kunkleman testified that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:20 a.m., he was dispatched to a report of a suspicious vehicle sitting in the parking lot of 234 North Main Street. (Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol. I at 63-64). Kunkleman pulled up behind the vehicle to run the plates, and noticed that an African-American male was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. (*Id.* at 66). The male, who was later identified as Appellant, was the sole individual in the vehicle. (*Id.*). As\nKunkleman exited his vehicle, Appellant exited the vehicle in which he was sitting. (Id. at 67). Appellant then began walking towards Kunkleman, and refused to engage him in conversation. (Id.). Shortly thereafter, Appellant turned around and walked back to towards the vehicle. (Id.). Kunkleman followed Appellant back to the vehicle, and noticed the overwhelming smell of marijuana coming from the car. (Id. at 68). Appellant was observed leaning into the driver\u2019s compartment and grabbing at something on the floorboard. (Id.). Appellant refused to comply with Kunkleman\u2019s request to exit the vehicle, and as a result Kunkleman pulled him away from the vehicle for officer safety. (Id.). Hillard, who had arrived at the scene simultaneously with Kunkleman, looked inside the vehicle and found a paper bag with cocaine in it sticking out from under the driver\u2019s seat. (Id. at 66, 71). Upon searching the center armrest, Kunkleman found a baggie that contained heroin inside it. (Id. at 71). Upon conducting a pat down of Appellant for officer safety, a large amount of money (over $5,000) was located on Appellant\u2019s person. (Id. at 70).\n\n\u00b652 This evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, could lead a rational trier of fact to find that Appellant had constructive possession of the drugs in the vehicle. Appellant was the only person in the vehicle at the time of the stop. Further, the drugs in the vehicle were located on the driver\u2019s side floorboard and the center console, in the proximity of Appellant\u2019s position as the\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\ndriver. While proximity to drugs alone is insufficient to establish constructive possession, proximity to the object does constitute some evidence of constructive possession. *State v. Rodgers*, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-10-35, 2011-Ohio-3003, \u00b6 30. Lastly, Appellant\u2019s furtive movements in the area where the cocaine was located is indicative of knowledge and possession.\n\n{\u00b653} Given Appellant\u2019s conduct and the attending facts, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2014 0118.\n\n*Analysis \u2013 Case Number CR 2015 0361*\n\n{\u00b654} Pertinent to this appeal, in case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant was found guilty in Count I of possession of drugs (cocaine), guilty in Count II of possession of drugs (heroin), and guilty in Count III of possession of drugs (marijuana), all in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which states:\n\n(A) No person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2925.11(A).\n\n{\u00b655} In Count IV, Appellant was charged with illegal cultivation of marijuana, in violation of R.C. 2925.04(A), which states:\n\n(A) No person shall knowingly cultivate marihuana or knowingly manufacture or otherwise engage in any part of the production of a controlled substance.\n\nR.C. 2925.04(A).\nIn Count V, Appellant was charged with having weapons while under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3), which states:\n\n(A) Unless relieved from disability under operation of law or legal process, no person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any firearm or dangerous ordnance, if any of the following apply:\n\n* * *\n\n(3) The person is under indictment for or has been convicted of any felony offense involving the illegal possession, use, sale, administration, distribution, or trafficking in any drug of abuse or has been adjudicated a delinquent child for the commission of an offense that, if committed by an adult, would have been a felony offense involving the illegal possession, use, sale, administration, distribution, or trafficking in any drug of abuse.\n\nR.C. 2923.13(A)(3).\n\nIn support of his sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge, Appellant argues that the State failed to provide evidence that linked Appellant with the contraband found at 1222 Catalpa Street. We find otherwise. Specifically, testimony at trial revealed that after Appellant was arrested, Appellant told law enforcement officials that: \u201cI don\u2019t live here. I\u2019m just seeing a girl.\u201d (Trial, 08/02/2017 Tr., Vol. I, at 145). But, when law enforcement questioned Appellant about the \u201cgirl,\u201d Appellant wasn\u2019t able to provide any information about her to law enforcement. (Id.).\n\nMoreover, after the search warrant was executed, authorities found a book bag in a bedroom closet that contained: a VISA gift card with Appellant\u2019s\nname on it; a medical marijuana card with Appellant\u2019s personal identifiers on it; a Huntington Bank VISA card with Appellant\u2019s name on it; and Appellant\u2019s social security card and birth certificate. (Id., Vol. II at 242). Also located within the residence were three handguns. (Id., Vol. I 187-88). Authorities failed to find any women\u2019s or children\u2019s clothing in the residence. (Id., Vol. II at 245). Contrary to Appellant\u2019s argument on appeal, there was competent and credible evidence that Appellant was the sole occupant of 1222 Catalpa Street at the time of the arrest, the protective sweep, and when the search occurred in the residence. We find that Appellant\u2019s theory of possession is inconsistent with the evidence.\n\n{\u00b659} After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes charged proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Second Assignment of Error\n\n{\u00b660} Appellant argues that his convictions in both case number CR 2014 0118 and CR 2015 0361 were against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nStandard of Review\n\n{\u00b661} The Ohio Supreme Court has \u201c\u2018carefully distinguished the terms \u2018sufficiency\u2019 and \u2018weight\u2019 in criminal cases, declaring that \u2018manifest weight\u2019 and \u2018legal sufficiency\u2019 are \u2018both quantitatively and qualitatively different.\u2019\u201d Lyle, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-14-41, 2015-Ohio-1181, \u00b6 9 quoting Eastley v. Volkman, 132 Ohio St.3d 328, 2010-Ohio-2179, 972 N.E.2d 517, \u00b6 10.\n\n{\u00b662} In analyzing a claim that a conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court:\n\nsits as the \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d and may disagree with the fact finder\u2019s resolution of the conflicting testimony. * * * The appellate court, \u201c\u2018reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against conviction.\u2019\u201d\n\nState v. Johnson, 3rd Dist. Shelby No. 17-08-06, 2008-Ohio-4784, \u00b6 4 quoting State v. Jackson, 169 Ohio App.3d 440, 2006-Ohio-6059, 863 N.E.2d 223, \u00b614 (citations omitted). However, in sitting as the thirteenth juror the appellate court should give due deference to the findings made by the jury. Id.\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b663} The Eighth District Court of Appeals identified the following eight factors as a guide to assist a reviewing court in determining whether a decision of the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence:\n\n1. A reviewing court is not required to accept the incredible as true;\n2. Whether the evidence is uncontradicted;\n3. Whether a witness was impeached;\n4. What was not proved;\n5. Certainty of evidence;\n6. Reliability of evidence;\n7. Whether witness\u2019 testimony is self-serving;\n8. And whether evidence is vague, uncertain, conflicting, or fragmentary.\n\nState v. Mattison, 23 Ohio App.3d 10, 14, 490 N.E.2d 926 (8th Dist.1985). We discuss the relevant factors to each underlying case below.\n\nUncontradicted Evidence\n\n{\u00b664} Initially, we note that Appellant failed to introduce any evidence that contradicted the State\u2019s evidence at trial. In respect to case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant produced no evidence to contradict the State\u2019s testimony that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:00 a.m., the Lima Police Department was dispatched to 234 North Main Street in Lima, Ohio for a call of a suspicious vehicle sitting in\nthe parking lot. It is not disputed that the Appellant exited his vehicle when officers arrived, and when Kunkleman approached him, Appellant turned back and leaned into the car on the driver\u2019s side. It is further undisputed that officers could smell the smell of raw marijuana at this time and that officers grabbed Appellant and pulled him away from the vehicle for their safety.\n\n{\u00b665} There is no dispute that the Appellant, when ordered to put his hands up in the air, disregarded the officer\u2019s commands, which led to him being detained. A pat down of Appellant produced a large sum of money and marijuana, which led to his arrest and the subsequent search of the vehicle, which produced a large amount of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, digital scales, and Appellant\u2019s billfold. With no testimony or evidence produced at trial to cast doubt upon this version of events, Appellant cannot contradict the elements of possession of cocaine and possession of heroin as established by the State in case number CR 2014 0118.\n\n{\u00b666} In regards to case number CR 2015 0361, the State\u2019s uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that on January 17, 2015, after receiving an anonymous tip and surveilling the premises, law enforcement entered 1222 Catalpa Street after repeatedly requesting that Appellant come to the front door. Once inside the premises, and while conducting a protective sweep of the home, officers viewed a marijuana grow tent in plain view. Based on the information collected, officers obtained a search warrant and searched the premises in its entirety. During the\nsearch, officers located credit cards, mail, and other personal effects bearing Appellant\u2019s name.\n\n{\u00b667} While Appellant contends that no witness had personal knowledge that he occupied the premises, the evidence indicates otherwise. Specifically, many of Appellant\u2019s personal effects were found within the residence, which is indicative of occupation. Accordingly, we find that the uncontradicted evidence supports that Appellant was occupying the residence on January 17, 2015.\n\nImpeached Witness\n\n{\u00b668} A review of the record reveals that no witness for the State was impeached in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361.\n\nReliability of Evidence\n\n{\u00b669} With respect to case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant attempts to discredit the reliability of the testimony and evidence produced at trial, because \u201cnot one single witness [***] actually had personal knowledge of Appellant allegedly occupying the premises testified [to] at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). Appellant further classifies all of the testimony produced regarding occupation of the premises as \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\n{\u00b670} However, we find that the State produced competent and credible evidence that Appellant was occupying 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio at the time the officers conducted their raid. Specifically, officers testified that they\nobserved Appellant leave the back of the duplex in an attempt to flee, and then run back inside once he saw that officers had the duplex surrounded. Furthermore, the evidence established that officers personally observed Appellant leave out of the back of the residence prior to it being breached. With eyewitness testimony confirming that Appellant was, in fact, inside the residence, we find no merit in Appellant\u2019s argument in regards to reliability.\n\n**Self-Serving Testimony**\n\n{\u00b671} The record reveals that the trial court did not characterize any witness\u2019s testimony as self-serving in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, on review, we do not find any indicia of self-serving testimony in either case and Appellant does not argue that testimony was self-serving on appeal.\n\n**Vague, Uncertain, Conflicting, or Fragmentary Evidence**\n\n{\u00b672} In case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant points to the evidence produced at the suppression hearing to cast into doubt officers\u2019 testimony at trial. Specifically, Appellant argues that the officers, when testifying at the suppression hearing, described a \u201cmuch more leisurely encounter at the suppression hearing than they did at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). However, Appellant fails to develop this argument and further fails to demonstrate how this \u201cconflict\u201d in testimonies between the suppression hearing and trial creates a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting\nreversal. Even should Appellant establish that a true \u201cconflict\u201d exists in the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and the trial, and that such issue was properly before this Court, we find that the record contains competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. *Phelps v. Horn\u2019s Crop Serv. Ctr.*, 3rd Dist. Wyandot No. 16-89-8, 1990 WL 157282, * 2 (holding that the choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact).\n\n{\u00b673} Accordingly, we find that the weight of the evidence supports Appellant\u2019s convictions. We further find that the jury did not lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting Appellant of possession of cocaine and heroin in case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n**Appellant\u2019s Third Assignment of Error**\n\n{\u00b674} In his third assignment of error, Appellant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective, in part, because trial counsel failed to object to hearsay statements during trial. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n{\u00b675} \u201c\u2018When a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that the counsel\u2019s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d State v. Sanders, 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151, 2002-Ohio-350, 761 N.E.2d 18 quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). Additionally, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d Id., at 694. See also, State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 137, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).\n\n{\u00b676} In analyzing a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, this court\u2019s scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential, with a \u201c\u2018strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019\u201d Bradley, supra, at 142, quoting Strickland, supra, at 687-88. \u201cCounsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d Id.\n\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b677} At the outset, we note that Appellant, during the course of the proceedings below, had five (5) different attorneys represent him. Interestingly, Appellant does not specify which trial counsel was ineffective. However, it appears from this assignment that Appellant questions the effectiveness of his trial counsel.\nAppellant initially argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because trial counsel failed to object to any of the hearsay regarding Appellant residing in the residence during the raid by police officers, as charged in case number CR 2015 0361. However, we note that the failure to make objections is not alone enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Conway*, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 103. *See also, State v. Holloway*, 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831 (1988) (failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); *State v. Gumm*, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 428, 1995-Ohio-24, 653 N.E.2d 253 holding modified by *State v. Wogenstahl*, 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 1996-Ohio-219, 662 N.E.2d 311 (the failure to make objections does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel *per se*, as that failure may be justified as a tactical decision).\n\nNext, Appellant argues that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective because trial counsel did not *voir dire* Sergeant Dana Sutherland (\u201cSutherland\u201d), the State\u2019s marijuana expert witness. This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, the record reveals, and the Appellant concedes, that trial counsel objected to the expert being certified as an expert witness, and the trial court overruled the objection. (*See, Trial Tr., Vol. II, at 286*). And second, the record reveals that the Appellant\u2019s concerns with Sutherland\u2019s qualifications to testify as an expert were addressed by the trial court prior to trial. (*Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol.*\nI, at 11). Given the trial court\u2019s rulings, we do not find that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation under the facts presented.\n\nLastly, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective because his trial counsel failed to file a proper motion to sever the counts at the appropriate time during trial. However, the record is clear, and the Appellant concedes, that objections to the State\u2019s motions to consolidate were made and a motion to sever was filed prior to trial. (See, CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 139; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 48). Despite Appellant\u2019s objections and motion, the trial court found that the charges were of similar character and part of a common scheme or course of criminal conduct, then consolidated the cases and joined them for purposes of trial. (CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 163; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 82). Thus, because the trial court had already ruled on Appellant\u2019s motion to sever, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that a subsequent trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness by failing to file an additional motion to sever, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fourth Assignment of Error\n\nIn his fourth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss his cases based upon a speedy trial violation. Specifically, Appellant argues that the continuance granted at the request of the\nState beyond the February 21, 2017 trial date was unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b682 \u201cOur standard of review upon an appeal raising a speedy trial issue is to count the expired days as directed by R.C. 2945.71, et seq.\u201d State v. King, 3rd Dist. Marion No. 9-06-18, 2007-Ohio-335, \u00b6 30. See also, State v. DePue, 96 Ohio App.3d 513, 516, 645 N.E.2d 745 (4th Dist.1994). \u201cIf any ambiguity exists, we construe the record in favor of the accused.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b683 The applicable statutory speedy trial provision, R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), provides that a person charged with a felony shall be brought to trial within two hundred and seventy (270) days after the person\u2019s arrest. R.C. 2945.71(C)(2). In computing time under division (C)(2), \u201ceach day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charges shall be counted as three days.\u201d R.C. 2945.71(E).\n\n\u00b684 Further, R.C. 2945.73(B) provides:\n\nUpon motion made at or prior to the commencement of trial, a person charged with an offense shall be discharged if he is not brought to trial within the time required by sections 2945.71 and 2945.72 of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n{\u00b685} In the instant matter, both the State and Appellant agree that Appellant\u2019s speedy trial rights were upheld throughout the proceedings up until Appellant\u2019s scheduled jury trial on February 21, 2017. However, at the request of the State, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017, outside of the Appellant\u2019s statutory speedy trial period. Thus, the question before us is not whether Appellant was brought to trial within the statutorily permitted time frame, but rather, was the speedy trial violation permissible under the circumstances of the case. We answer that question in the affirmative.\n\n{\u00b686} R.C. 2945.72, entitled \u201cextension of time for hearing or trial,\u201d allows for an extension of time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances. R.C. 2945.72(H) provides:\n\nThe time within which an accused must be brought to trial, or, in the case of felony, to preliminary hearing and trial, may be extended only by the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(H) The period of any continuance granted on the accused\u2019s own motion, and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused\u2019s own motion.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2945.72(H).\nThe resolution of this issue, therefore, depends upon whether the trial court\u2019s continuance was reasonable. \u201cDetermining the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of the continuance beyond the ninety-day stricture of R.C. 2945.71, invariably, \u2018depends on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u2019\u201d State v. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, \u00b6 10, quoting State v. Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988). \u201c\u2018In addition, precedent requires that such a continuance be necessary under the circumstances of the case.\u2019\u201d Id. quoting Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988) citing City of Aurora v. Patrick, 61 Ohio St.2d 107, 108-09, 399 N.E.2d 1220 (1980).\n\nOn February 3, 2017, the State requested a continuance of the trial date, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in State v. Gonzales. See, State v. Gonzales, 150 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-Ohio-8319, 81 N.E.3d 405, reconsideration granted, decision vacated, 150 Ohio St.3d 276, 2017-Ohio-777, 81 N.E.3d 419, reconsideration denied, 149 Ohio St.3d 1409, 2017-Ohio-2822, 74 N.E.3d 466. In Gonzales, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the offense level for possession of cocaine was determined only by the weight of the actual cocaine, not by the total weight of cocaine plus any filler. Id. at \u00b6 22. This opinion was inconsistent with prior case law on the same topic. Id. at \u00b6 51. Given the new purity requirements, the State requested a continuance to send Appellant\u2019s cocaine to a lab equipped to determine the weight of actual cocaine, separate from the filler weight.\nThe trial court, on February 9, 2017, granted the State\u2019s request for a continuance and set Appellant\u2019s jury trial for May 16, 2017. (Case number CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 182; case number CR 2015, Doc. No. 109). In granting the continuance, the trial court acknowledged that State v. Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom. Furthermore, the trial court relied on the Seventh District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in State v. High, wherein the Appellate court held that an extension request by the State for testing of evidence was reasonable. State v. High, 143 Ohio App.3d 232, 242, 2001-Ohio-3530, 757 N.E.2d 1176.\n\nWe find that the continuance was reasonable in light of the need for additional time to conduct testing (of the drugs in question) in accordance with Gonzales. While Appellant argues that the State took \u201ctoo long\u201d (after the Gonzales decision was announced) to request the continuance, we find that the State\u2019s request was made prior to the already scheduled jury trial.\n\nAppellant further argues that the continuance was unreasonable because the trial court focused on its schedule in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss. However, \u201cscheduling and docketing conflicts have been held to be reasonable grounds for extending an accused\u2019s trial date beyond the speedy trial limit date by both [the Appellate Court] and the Supreme Court of Ohio. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, \u00b6 11. See also, State v. Lee, 48 Ohio\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nSt.2d 208, 210, 357 N.E.2d 1095 (1976) (continuance due to \u201ccrowded docket & judge\u2019s conference\u201d was reasonable). Thus, we find that the continuance was reasonable, and therefore met the exception requirement listed in R.C. 2945.72(H).\n\n\u00b692 For the foregoing reasons, we find Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error not well taken and overrule the same.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fifth Assignment of Error\n\n\u00b693 In Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court was required to exclude Identification Officer Michael Carman\u2019s (\u201cCarman\u201d) expert testimony, because the State did not comply with Crim.R. 16(K). For the reasons that follow, we find that the trial court did not err in allowing the State\u2019s expert witness to testify.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b694 \u201cThe trial court has broad discretion over evidentiary rulings, and such rulings will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d State v. Workman, 3rd Dist. Van Wert No. 15-06-09, 171 Ohio App.3d 89, 2007-Ohio-1360, 869 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 10. See also, In re Sherman, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 05-04-47, 2005-Ohio-5888, \u00b6 27. An \u201c\u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 implies that the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably.\u201d Id. quoting Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). \u201cWhen applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, a reviewing court may not simply substitute its judgment for\nthat of the trial court. *Dindal v. Dindal*, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-09-06, 2009-Ohio-3528, \u00b6 6 citing *Blakemore*, supra.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n{\u00b695} Appellant alleges that the State violated Crim.R. 16(K) when it failed to provide an expert witness\u2019 report prior to the start of Appellant\u2019s jury trial. Crim.R. 16(K) states:\n\nAn expert witness for either side shall prepare a written report summarizing the expert witness\u2019s testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinion, and shall include a summary of the expert\u2019s qualifications. The written report and summary of qualifications shall be subject to disclosure under this rule no later than twenty-one days prior to trial, which period may be modified by the court for good cause shown, which does not prejudice any other party. Failure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert\u2019s testimony at trial.\n\nCrim.R. 16(K). Additionally, Crim.R. 16(L), entitled regulation of discovery, goes on to provide:\n\nThe trial court may make orders regulating discovery not inconsistent with this rule. If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\n\nCrim. R. 16(L).\n\n{\u00b696} Initially, we note that the State concedes that they should have provided Appellant with an expert report prior to Appellant\u2019s jury trial, pursuant to\nCrim. R. 16(K). We also note that the Appellant does not allege that the exclusion of Carman\u2019s testimony would have changed the outcome of the trial. Rather, Appellant argues that Carman\u2019s testimony was \u201cvery important\u201d to the State\u2019s case and its inclusion (over objection) warrants him a new trial. Appellant directs this Court to the Eleventh District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in State v. McGhee. State v. McGhee, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2014-T-0106, 2017-Ohio-5773. In McGhee, the Eleventh District held that the purpose of Crim.R. 16(K) is to prevent surprise and trial by ambush. Id. at \u00b6 19. While the State, in McGhee, had provided their expert witness\u2019 name to defense counsel at the appropriate time, it had failed to provide the expert\u2019s report to defense counsel until a couple days prior to trial. Id. Finding that the expert testimony was \u201cvital\u201d to the State\u2019s case, the court of appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and ordered a new trial. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\nHowever, Appellant\u2019s reliance on McGhee ignores precedent from this Court regarding the failure to provide an expert report. Specifically, in State v. Opp, under circumstances factually similar to the case sub judice, the State failed to provide an expert report. State v. Opp, 3rd Dist. Seneca No. 13-13-33, 2014-Ohio-1138, \u00b6 7. Relying, in part, on the Fifth District\u2019s decision in State v. Viera, we concluded that while Crim.R. 16(K) contains mandatory language for compliance, such language, when read in context with Crim.R. 16(L), does not abolish the trial court\u2019s discretion in regards to evidentiary matters. Id. at \u00b6 10. See, State v. Viera,\n5th Dist. Delaware No. 11CAA020020, 2011-Ohio-5263, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23 (Appellate court found that the trial court did not err in allowing an expert to testify in spite of an untimely expert\u2019s report). We then went on to analyze other cases involving a discovery violation with respect to an expert\u2019s report in accordance with Crim.R. 16(K). Opp, after its examination of precedent from various appellate courts in Ohio, found that while the State committed a discovery violation, that trial court did not err in allowing the State\u2019s expert witness to testify on a very limited issue which did not prejudice the defendant. Id. at \u00b6 20.\n\n\u00b698 Relying on Opp, we find that the trial court did not err in allowing the State to present Carman\u2019s limited expert testimony at trial. Specifically, the record reveals that Carman was not testifying on the specifics of the case at hand, but rather, provided testimony regarding his experience, in general, involving why fingerprints may or may not exist on a handgun. (Trial, 08/02/2018 Tr., Vol. I, at 209). Moreover, the trial court specifically found that Carman was not testifying about the evidence in Appellant\u2019s case, but merely on generalities involving a lack of fingerprints on a handgun. (Id.). Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling Appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 16(K) objection.\n\n\u00b699 Lastly, even if we were to find that the trial court erred in admitting Carman\u2019s testimony, we would affirm the ruling under the harmless error doctrine. Harmless error is \u201c\u2018any error, defect, irregularity, or variance, which does not affect\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\n[a] substantial right[ ] [***]\u201d\u2019. State v. Wilson, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-09-53, 2010-Ohio-2947, \u00b6 26 quoting Crim.R. 52(A). Furthermore, \u201charmless error does not affect the outcome of the case and, thus, does not warrant a judgment to be overturned or set aside.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6100 For the reasons discussed above, we overrule Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Sixth Assignment of Error\n\n\u00b6101 In his sixth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by consolidating his two trials. Specifically, Appellant argues that the evidence was not \u201csimple and direct,\u201d which would permit joinder of the cases. We disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b6102 \u201cA defendant who asserts that joinder is improper has the burden of making an affirmative showing that his rights will be prejudiced thereby.\u201d State v. Shurelds, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-91-28, 1992 WL 147559, *2, cause dismissed, 66 Ohio St.3d 1430, 608 N.E.2d 760 (1993). Furthermore, a defendant \u201cmust demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to separate the charges for trial.\u201d State v. Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 343, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981). An \u201c\u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 implies that the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably.\u201d Id. quoting Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d\n1140 (1983). \u201cWhen applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, a reviewing court may not simply substitute its judgment for that of the trial court.\u201d Id. Absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion, a trial court\u2019s decision regarding joinder will not be disturbed. Torres, supra.\n\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b6103} Crim.R. 13, entitled \u201ctrial together of indictments or information or complaints,\u201d provides the statutory authority for joinder, which states:\n\nThe court may order two or more indictments or informations or both to be tried together, if the offenses or the defendants could have been joined in a single indictment or information. The procedure shall be the same as if the prosecution were under such single indictment or information.\n\nThe court may order two or more complaints to be tried together, if the offenses or the defendants could have been joined in a single complaint. The procedure shall be the same as if the prosecution were under such single complaint.\n\nCrim.R. 13.\n\n{\u00b6104} In determining whether the indictments could have been joined in a single indictment, Crim.R. 8(A) states: \u201c[t]wo or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment, * * * if the offenses charged, * * * are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a course of criminal conduct.\u201d Crim.R. 8(A).\nIn examining the purposes and policies behind joinder, courts have expressed that: \u201c[j]oinder and the avoidance of multiple trials are favored to conserve judicial resources, including time and expense, reduce the chance of incongruous results in successive trials before different juries, and diminish inconvenience to the witnesses.\u201d State v. Clifford, 135 Ohio App.3d 207, 211, 733 N.E.2d 621 (1st Dist.1999), cause dismissed, 87 Ohio St.3d 1422, 717 N.E.2d 1108 (1999). \u201cTo prevail on a claim that the trial court erred in consolidating charges for trial, the defendant must demonstrate affirmatively (1) that his rights were prejudiced, (2) that at the time that the trial court ruled on the motion to consolidate, he provided the court with sufficient information so that it could weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, and (3) that given the information provided to the court, it abused its discretion in consolidating the charges for trial.\u201d (Emphasis added). Id.\n\nIn reviewing Appellant\u2019s argument, we find that the Appellant failed to demonstrate affirmatively exactly how his rights were prejudiced by joinder. Even though Appellant argues that questions exist concerning his actual dominion and control over items of contraband, we find this argument addresses the sufficiency of the evidence, not whether Appellant was prejudiced by the joinder of the cases.\nNext, Appellant argues that the evidence in one case would not have been admissible in the other case. However, this is not the standard for joinder announced in Crim.R. 13 or Crim.R. 8(A).\n\nLastly, Appellant argues that \u201cit is undeniable that juries do not like fugitives.\u201d (See, Br. of Appellant at 18). Appellant then argues that this fact, standing alone, was sufficient to establish that the trial court abused its discretion by joining the two cases. However, Appellant provides us no support for such assertion. Thus, when reviewed in its entirety, Appellant\u2019s argument fails to demonstrate affirmatively that his rights were prejudiced and thus, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the trial court erred in joining the two cases.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, we overrule Appellant\u2019s sixth assignment of error.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Seventh and Eighth Assignments of Error\n\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motions to suppress in each of his underlying cases. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u201cA review of the denial of a motion to suppress involves mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d State v. Lewis, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-16-13, 2017-Ohio-996, 86 N.E.3d 974, \u00b6 8 citing State v. Burnside, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, \u00b6 8. At a suppression hearing, the trial court assumes\nthe role of trier of fact, and as such, is in the best position to evaluate the evidence and the credibility of witnesses. *Id.* \u201cAn appellate court must accept the trial court\u2019s findings of facts if they are supported by competent, credible evidence.\u201d *Burnside*, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, \u00b6 8. \u201cAccepting these facts as true, the appellate court must then independently determine, without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis \u2013 Motion to Suppress in Case Number CR 2014 0118**\n\n{\u00b6112} Appellant argues that in case number CR 2014 0118, law enforcement officials lacked probable cause or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to detain Appellant. Appellant further argues that law enforcement officers impermissibly detained him after he chose not to engage Kunkleman (in conversation) and walked away from officers. And lastly, Appellant argues that the search of the vehicle started *prior* to his arrest. Appellant contends that these three factors, collectively, resulted in a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.\n\n{\u00b6113} \u201cThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution generally prohibits warrantless searches and seizures, and any evidence obtained during an unlawful search or seizure will be excluded from being used against the defendant.\u201d *Frye*, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-17-30, 2018-Ohio-894, \u00b6 63. \u201cNeither the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution nor Section 14, Article I of the Ohio\nConstitution explicitly provides that violations of its provision against unlawful searches or seizure will result in the suppression of evidence obtained as a result of such violation, but the United States Supreme Court has held that the exclusion of evidence is an essential part of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d  *State v. Jenkins*, 3rd Dist. Union No. 14-10-10, 2010-Ohio-5943, \u00b6 9 citing *Mapp v. Ohio*, 367 U.S. 643, 649, 81 S.Ct. 1684 (1961). The primary purpose of the exclusionary rule is to remove the incentive to violate the Fourth Amendment. *Id. citing State v. Jones*, 88 Ohio St.3d 430, 434, 2000-Ohio-374, 727 N.E.2d 886 overruled on other grounds by *State v. Brown*, 99 Ohio St.3d 323, 2003-Ohio-3931, 792 N.E.2d 175 (2003).\n\n\u00b6114 \u201cThe Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution prohibit any governmental search or seizure, including a brief investigative stop, unless supported by an objective justification.\u201d *State v. Andrews*, 57 Ohio St.3d 86, 87, 565 N.E.2d 1271 (1991) citing *United States v. Cortez*, 449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690 (1981); *Reid v. Georgia*, 448 U.S. 438, 440, 100 S.Ct. 2752 (1980); *Terry v. Ohio*, 392 U.S. 1, 19, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (1968).\n\n\u00b6115 However, in crafting exceptions to Fourth Amendment violation claims, \u201cthe United States Supreme Court [in *Terry*] held that a police officer may stop and investigate unusual behavior, even without probable cause to arrest, when he reasonably concluded that the individual is engaged in criminal activity.\u201d *Id. citing Terry*, 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (1968). \u201cIn assessing that conclusion,\nthe officer \u2018must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u2019\u201d *Id.* quoting *Terry*, at 21.\n\n{\u00b6116} Upon reviewing the record, we find that the State produced competent and credible evidence that the officers had specific and articulable facts, along with the rational inferences from those facts, to reasonably warrant the intrusion into Appellant\u2019s vehicle. The evidence produced at the suppression hearing demonstrated that law enforcement responded to a call that a suspicious vehicle (with its car alarm going off\\(^5\\)) was parked in the parking lot of 234 North Main Street in Lima, Ohio in the early morning hours of March 21, 2014. (Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 06/30/2016 Tr. at 8-9). Kunkleman, who was the first officer to respond to the call, testified that Appellant was out of the vehicle when he (Kunkleman) exited his vehicle, and refused to engage him (Kunkleman) in conversation. (Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 06/30/2016 Tr. at 10). Rather, Appellant turned back to the vehicle and started to lean into the driver\u2019s area, where Kunkleman was unable to observe what Appellant was doing with his hands. (*Id.*). Kunkleman also testified that when he approached Appellant\u2019s vehicle, he smelled\n\n---\n\n\\(^5\\) Dash cam video footage entered into evidence revealed that a car alarm was going off when officers arrived. (See, Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 06/30/2016, State\u2019s Ex. 2 at 3:26:20 AM).\nan overwhelming odor of marijuana\\(^6\\) emanating from the vehicle. (Id.). Kunkleman then shined his flashlight into Appellant\u2019s vehicle and observed a digital scale laying on the driver\u2019s side floorboard. (Id. at 11). Kunkleman testified that as a result of Appellant\u2019s actions, the smell of marijuana, and the observation of a digital scale on the floorboard, he decided to detain Appellant for his safety. (Id. at 11-12).\n\n\\{\u00b6117\\} Hillard, who observed the interaction between Appellant with Kunkleman, testified that he smelled the odor of marijuana coming from Appellant\u2019s vehicle. (Id. at 42). Hillard testified that when he looked inside the vehicle he saw, in plain view, cellphones, a digital scale, and raw marijuana in the center console, as well as a brown paper bag partially sticking out from under the seat. (Id. at 42-43). Hillard opened the brown paper bag and saw what he believed to be crack cocaine in it. (Id. at 43). Based on what was located in the vehicle, Appellant was placed under arrest. (Id.).\n\n\\{\u00b6118\\} We find, upon the totality of the circumstances, that Kunkleman and Hillard had probable cause to suspect that criminal activity was afoot, warranting further investigation. We further find that the search was not based solely upon \u201can unlawful arrest\u201d of the Appellant, but upon Appellant\u2019s actions, coupled with observations of the officers and the smell of raw marijuana. Thus, the trial court did\n\n\\(^6\\) We note that the smell of marijuana, alone, by a person qualified to recognize the odor, sufficiently establishes probable cause to search the vehicle from which the marijuana odor is detected.

Godfrey was further informed that a maintenance man for the Catalpa residence had attempted to inspect the residence but was denied entry by Appellant. (Id. at 8). Godfrey knew Appellant had active warrants for his arrest, so he set up a surveillance of 1222 Catalpa Street on January 13, 2015. (Id. at 8-9). On January 17, 2015, Godfrey observed a Chrysler 300 in the driveway with temporary tags. (Id. at 10). When the Chrysler 300 left the residence, Godfrey followed the vehicle. (Id. at 11). The Ohio State Highway Patrol, in conjunction with the West Central Ohio Crime Task force, conducted a traffic stop of the vehicle due to a window tint violation. (Id.). Kunkleman, who was assisting Godfrey with 1222 Catalpa Street surveillance, spoke with the individuals in the Chrysler 300 and learned that they were visiting their friend \u201cRay\u201d at the Catalpa residence in question. (Id. at 12).\n\n7 The record suggests that the landlord identified the Appellant after seeing a local \u201cmost wanted\u201d television news report.\nThe passenger of the Chrysler identified \u201cRay\u201d as Appellant, and informed officers that Appellant had been living at the address for about a month. (Id. at 12). Because of this information, Godfrey verified that Appellant had active warrants and then set up a perimeter around 1222 Catalpa Street to arrest Appellant. (Id.).\n\nAfter the residence was surrounded, Godfrey knocked on the front door and ordered Appellant to come out. (Id. at 13). Instead, Appellant exited the rear of the house, but quickly ran back to the residence after observing law enforcement officials surrounding the duplex. (Id.). Officers eventually gained entry into the house, and the Appellant was arrested without incident. (Id. at 15). After Appellant\u2019s arrest, law enforcement officers conducted a protective sweep of the residence to make sure that there were no other individuals or threats within the house. (Id.). In conducting the protective sweep of the residence, law enforcement officials observed a black tent in one of the rooms. (Id.). Because the tent was large enough for someone to hide in, officers looked inside it, finding marijuana plants and a \u201cgrow operation\u201d inside. (Id. at 15-16).\n\nBased on observing the marijuana grow tent in the residence, officers secured the residence and sought out a search warrant for the premises. (Id. at 17-18). The reviewing judge found probable cause and signed the affidavit/search warrant for the residence. (Id. at 39-40; State\u2019s Ex. 1). Based on the search of the\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nresidence, law enforcement officials found guns, drugs, electronics, I.D.\u2019s, and paperwork. (Id. at 41; State\u2019s Ex. 1).\n\n\u00b6122 \u201cIn Payton [v. New York], the United States Supreme Court concluded that \u2018for Fourth Amendment purposes, an arrest warrant founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason to believe the suspect is within.\u2019\u201d State v. Crawford, 3rd Dist. Logan No. 8-04-21, 2005-Ohio-243, \u00b6 24 quoting Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 603, 100 S.Ct. 1371 (1988). \u201cUnder Payton, therefore, officers may effectuate an arrest warrant at a location when they believe that the subject of the warrant lives at a residence and that belief is supported by probable cause.\u201d Id. Appellant asserts that officers lacked probable cause to enter the premises. We find otherwise. Specifically, law enforcement received a tip that Appellant was residing in a residence in Lima, and as a result of that tip officers set up a surveillance to see if they observed Appellant come or go. While they did not observe Appellant leave the residence, they did observe another individual leave the residence, and after a lawful traffic stop, that individual disclosed that Appellant was, in fact, inside the residence. Based on those two factors, law enforcement attempted to enter the residence. However, prior to actually entering the residence to secure Appellant, Appellant was observed leaving the residence out the back and then returning inside the residence once he observed law enforcement officials\noutside. Thus, under the totality of the circumstances, we find law enforcement had probable cause to enter 1222 Catalpa Street.\n\n{\u00b6123} Next, Appellant contends that the protective sweep of the residence was unlawful, and as a result the search warrant and affidavit that was obtained as a result of that sweep was unconstitutional. However, as the Ohio Supreme Court held in State v. Adams, \u201c[o]fficers making arrests in a home are permitted to conduct a protective sweep, which is a \u2018quick and limited search of the premises, incident to an arrest and conducted to protect the safety of the police officers and others.\u2019\u201d State v. Adams, 144 Ohio St.3d 429, 2015-Ohio-3954, 45 N.E.3d 127, \u00b6 188 quoting United States v. Stover, 474 F.3d 904, 911 (6th Cir.2007). Furthermore, as the United States Supreme Court recognized in Maryland v. Buie, a protective sweep \u201coccurs as an adjunct to the serious step of taking a person into custody for the purpose of prosecuting him for a crime.\u201d Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 333, 110 S.Ct. 1093 (1990). Because an in-home arrest puts the officer at the disadvantage of being on his adversary\u2019s \u201cturf,\u201d officers are permitted to sweep the residence for hidden individuals for their own protection. Id.\n\n{\u00b6124} And lastly, Appellant argues that the trial court failed to suppress evidence concerning the contents of a Kindle and an IPad found in the residence. Appellant argues that because \u201cvirtually every electronic utensil and gadget in existence has some level of computer mechanism involved,\u201d the search warrant\nauthorizing a search of \u201ccomputers, computer hardware, computer software, cell phones and the contents\u2026any and all material evidence of violations\u201d was overly broad.\n\n\u00b6125 \u201cThe particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment was a response to \u2018those general warrants known as writs of assistance under which officers of the Crown had so bedeviled the colonists.\u2019\u201d State v. Armstead, 9th Dist. Medina No. 06CA0050-M, 2007-Ohio-1898, \u00b6 10 quoting Stanford v. State of Tex., 379 U.S. 476, 481, 85 S.Ct. 506 (1965). \u201cA proper search warrant leaves nothing to the discretion of the officer executing it: \u2018the requirement that warrants shall particularly describe the things to be seized makes general searches under them impossible and prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another. As to what is to be taken, nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.\u2019\u201d Id. quoting State of Tex., at 485.\n\n\u00b6126 However, not all broad or generic descriptions of things to be seized are invalid under the Fourth Amendment. \u201cA broad and generic description is valid if it \u2018is as specific as circumstances and nature of the activity under investigation permit\u2019 and enables the searchers to identify what they are authorized to seize.\u201d Id. quoting United States v. Harris, 903 F.2d 770, 775 (10th Cir.1990). Contrary to Appellant\u2019s argument, we find that that the \u201ccomputer\u201d language of search warrant\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nnotified searchers what they were authorized to seize, in this case, an electronic tablet and an IPad.\n\n{\u00b6127} Furthermore, as correctly noted by the trial court, even if the warrant failed the particularity test, the \u201cgood-faith exception\u201d to the exclusionary rule would apply in this instance. As this Court held in State v. McClanahan, \u201cthe [United States Supreme] Court determined that the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment \u2018should not be applied so as to bar the use in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief of evidence obtained by officers acting in objectively reasonable reliance on a search warrant issued by a detached and neutral magistrate but ultimately found to be unsupported by probable cause.\u2019\u201d State v. McClanahan, 3rd Dist. Seneca No. 13-03-02, 2003-Ohio-4279, \u00b6 18 quoting State v. George, 45 Ohio St.3d 325, 330, 544 N.E.2d 640 (1989) citing United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 918-19, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (1984). In the case at hand, there was no testimony regarding bad faith on part of the officers who searched the residence where Appellant was hiding.\n\n{\u00b6128} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule Appellant\u2019s eighth assignment of error.\n\nConclusion\n\n{\u00b6129} Having found no error prejudicial to Appellant herein in the particulars assigned and argued, we overrule all of Appellant\u2019s assignments of error.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgments of the Allen County Common Pleas Court.\n\nJudgments Affirmed\n\nWILLAMOWSKI, P.J. and PRESTON, J., concur.\n\n/jlr", "case_juv": 0, "case_crim": 0, "case_2001": 0, "case_app": 0, "case_pros": 0, "aoe_none": 0, "aoe_grandjury": 0, "aoe_court": 0, "aoe_defense": 0, "aoe_procbar": 0, "aoe_prochist": 0, "case_timeframe": 0, "other": 0}
{"Index": "253-FORTUNE II", "Context": "SCHAFER, Judge.\n\n{\u00b61} Defendant-Appellant, Richard Fortune II, appeals from his convictions in the Wayne County Court of Common Pleas. This Court affirms.\n\nI.\n\n{\u00b62} D.M. and M.F. are the stepdaughters of Mr. Fortune. He married their mother when D.M. was five years old and M.F. was one year old. He later adopted M.F., and she understood Mr. Fortune to be her biological father until she was fourteen years old. Mr. Fortune and the girls\u2019 mother also had two children together. Their daughter was born about a year and a half after they married, and their son was born about three years after that.\n\n{\u00b63} When D.M. was ten or eleven years old, she told her mother that Mr. Fortune had sexually abused her. Her accusations went uninvestigated because she recanted, but other issues arose as time went on. Mr. Fortune was later investigated for having a sexual relationship with a teenager and, around that same time, D.M. and M.F. told their mother that he had abused them.\nThe girls also told friends about the abuse at various points, but none of their disclosures resulted in any action being taken against Mr. Fortune.\n\n\u00b64 When M.F. was a preteen and D.M. was a teenager, Mr. Fortune left their mother for the teenage girl he had been seeing. His new relationship did not last long, however, and he attempted suicide when the girl ended things. Mr. Fortune spent several days in a coma and several weeks under observation, during which time D.M. and M.F.\u2019s mother visited him. When it was time for him to be released, they agreed to reconcile. Nevertheless, infidelity was an ongoing issue in their relationship, and there were times when the family lived apart.\n\n\u00b65 Shortly after she turned seventeen, M.F. began seeing a psychiatrist and confessed that Mr. Fortune had sexually abused her in her youth. The psychiatrist reported the abuse to the authorities, and an investigation ensued. During that investigation, D.M. likewise informed the authorities that Mr. Fortune had sexually abused her when she was younger. Their disclosures ultimately led to Mr. Fortune\u2019s arrest.\n\n\u00b66 A grand jury indicted Mr. Fortune on four counts of rape and five counts of sexual battery. Three of his rape counts and four of his sexual battery counts related to D.M. Those counts alleged that he sexually assaulted her at various points between January 2007 and September 2010 when she would have been between ten and fourteen years old. The remaining rape count and the remaining sexual battery count related to M.F. Those counts alleged that he sexually assaulted her between July 2009 and July 2010 when she would have been between nine and ten years old.\n\n\u00b67 Mr. Fortune moved to dismiss his indictment based on pre-indictment delay, but the court denied his motion. He then waived his right to a jury trial, and a bench trial ensued. The court found him guilty of the two counts related to M.F., but not guilty of his remaining counts\n(i.e., those related to D.M.). The court sentenced Mr. Fortune to a total of fifteen years to life in prison.\n\n{\u00b68} Mr. Fortune now appeals from his convictions and raises four assignments of error for our review. To facilitate our review, we reorder several of his assignments of error.\n\nII.\n\nAssignment of Error III\n\nThe trial court erred in denying [Mr. Fortune\u2019s] motion to dismiss for prejudicially delayed prosecution[.]\n\n{\u00b69} In his third assignment of error, Mr. Fortune argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss without setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law. We disagree.\n\n{\u00b610} Crim.R. 12(F) requires a trial court to \u201cstate its essential findings on the record\u201d when ruling on a motion to dismiss. Crim.R. 12(F). Yet, \u201c[the rule] is not self-executing[.]\u201d State v. Adams, 144 Ohio St.3d 429, 2015-Ohio-3954, \u00b6 112. \u201c[S]uch findings must be placed upon the record only upon \u2018the defendant\u2019s request.\u2019\u201d State v. Larsen, 9th Dist. Medina No. 2363-M, 1995 WL 125577, *2 (Mar. 22, 1995), quoting Bryan v. Knapp, 21 Ohio St.3d 64 (1986), syllabus. \u201c[I]f a defendant does not request findings of fact, any error is forfeited.\u201d Adams at \u00b6 112. Accord State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, \u00b6 47.\n\n{\u00b611} Mr. Fortune has not challenged any substantive aspect of the trial court\u2019s ruling on his motion to dismiss. His only argument is that the court committed a procedural error when it summarily denied his motion. Yet, the record reflects that Mr. Fortune never asked the court to issue findings of fact in support of its ruling. Nor did he object when it issued an abbreviated ruling. Because Mr. Fortune did not invoke Crim.R. 12(F) or otherwise bring this issue to the trial\ncourt\u2019s attention, he forfeited any error related to its failure to state its findings on the record. See Adams at \u00b6 112; LaMar at \u00b6 47. As such, his third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n**Assignment of Error IV**\n\n[Mr. Fortune\u2019s] conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n{\u00b612} In his fourth assignment of error, Mr. Fortune argues that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.\n\n{\u00b613} When considering an argument that a criminal conviction is against the manifest weight standard, this Court is required to\n\nreview the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\n\n*State v. Otten*, 33 Ohio App.3d 339, 340 (9th Dist.1986). Courts are cautioned to only reverse a conviction on manifest weight grounds \u201cin exceptional cases,\u201d *State v. Carson*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26900, 2013-Ohio-5785, \u00b6 32, citing Otten at 340, where the evidence \u201cweighs heavily against the conviction[,]\u201d *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387 (1997).\n\n{\u00b614} A rape occurs when a person engages in sexual conduct with another person who is less than thirteen years of age. See R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b). A sexual battery occurs when a person engages in sexual conduct with another person and is their \u201cnatural or adoptive parent, or a stepparent, or guardian, custodian, or person in loco parentis * * *.\u201d R.C. 2907.03(A)(5). The trial court found that Mr. Fortune committed one count of rape and one count of sexual battery against M.F. when she was between nine and ten years old.\n\n{\u00b615} M.F. testified that Mr. Fortune was her adoptive father and that her family consisted of him, her mother, an older sister (D.M.), a younger sister, and a younger brother. She recalled that Mr. Fortune engaged in sexual activity with her about four to five times when she was nine\nyears old, but she was only able to recount the details surrounding two of those incidents. During one of the incidents, M.F. recalled falling asleep on the family\u2019s living room couch and waking to find Mr. Fortune\u2019s mouth on her vagina. She could remember feeling \u201cthe wetness of his tongue and his beard hairs.\u201d She also remembered pretending to sleep and just letting the assault happen.\n\n{\u00b616} The second incident M.F. recalled also occurred in their family\u2019s living room. M.F. recalled being asleep on the couch and waking to find Mr. Fortune touching the area around her vagina. Penetration did not occur, but M.F.\u2019s pants and underwear were down around her ankles, and Mr. Fortune was making direct contact with her vaginal area. Startled by the realization that he was touching her, M.F. drew up her knees and pushed Mr. Fortune away with her feet. She stated that, in response, he asked what was wrong and said he was giving her a massage. She then retreated to her older sister D.M.\u2019s bedroom, woke her, and told her Mr. Fortune had touched her.\n\n{\u00b617} M.F. testified that she saw three different counselors after she turned fourteen, but never told them about the abuse. D.M. was the first person she told, and she later confided in a few friends. M.F. recalled that she also briefly spoke to her mother about the abuse when she was nine years old. She remembered riding in the car with her mother and D.M. and her mother receiving a phone call. The phone call was from an older friend of D.M.\u2019s and, during the call, the friend told M.F.\u2019s mother that she (the friend) was having a sexual relationship with Mr. Fortune. M.F. recalled her mother being extremely upset and questioning how something like that could have happened. According to M.F., D.M. responded by telling their mother it had happened to her. D.M. then nudged M.F., and M.F. likewise said it had happened to her. M.F. indicated that their mother did not believe anything had transpired, so nothing came of their disclosure.\n\n{\u00b618} M.F. testified that, after she turned seventeen, she was referred to a psychiatrist due to severe depression and anxiety. According to M.F., she did not plan on disclosing the abuse at\nthat time, but her new psychiatrist had an aggressive style and coaxed it out of her. The psychiatrist then reported the abuse to the authorities, and M.F. was interviewed at the child advocacy center. Consistent with her testimony, she told the interviewer that Mr. Fortune had sexually abused her four to five times when she was around nine years old and that those incidents occurred when she was sleeping on the family\u2019s living room couch.\n\n{\u00b619} D.M. testified that she was three years older than M.F. and, much like her sister, had been sexually abused by Mr. Fortune. She described how he began molesting her at a young age and progressed to vaginally raping her as time went on. When she was ten or eleven years old, her mother and Mr. Fortune had an argument, and D.M. told her mother about the abuse. She testified that her disclosure caused a great deal of discord and she overheard upsetting conversations between the adults in the household, including Mr. Fortune\u2019s mother. Because she was greatly upset by their reaction to her disclosure, D.M. recanted and told her mother that the abuse had just happened in her bad dreams.\n\n{\u00b620} D.M. recalled the night that M.F. rushed into her bedroom and told her that Mr. Fortune had touched her. She testified that Mr. Fortune had been in her bedroom earlier that evening and had repeatedly attempted to touch her vagina. After she pushed him away and told him to leave, Mr. Fortune left her room. A short while later, however, M.F. ran into the room, crying that he had touched her. D.M. testified that she felt guilty as a result the incident because, had she not rejected Mr. Fortune\u2019s advances, he would have left her sister alone.\n\n{\u00b621} D.M. acknowledged that she saw a counselor not long after Mr. Fortune began abusing her and never disclosed the abuse. She explained that she was very young at the time and went to the counselor as part of a custody dispute between her mother and biological father. Thus, the focus of those sessions was not on Mr. Fortune. Apart from the attempt she made to tell her\nmother about the abuse, D.M. did not speak to any authority figure about the abuse until an officer contacted her about M.F.\u2019s disclosure. D.M. then divulged that she too had been abused and met with the police for an interview.\n\nD.M. completed a written statement at the conclusion of her interview. Additionally, at the request of the prosecutor, she completed a more detailed written statement just before trial. The defense was able to point out a number of inconsistencies between her interview, her two written statements, and her testimony. For example, she recounted instances of oral sex in her second written statement, but explicitly denied that any oral sex had occurred when she was asked about it during her police interview. D.M. testified that additional details came to her as time went on. She testified that she initially found it difficult to recall many of the details because she had spent so long trying not to remember what happened.\n\nIn her second written statement and on cross-examination, D.M. indicated that she told two friends about Mr. Fortune\u2019s abuse. One of those friends testified at trial. The friend testified that she met D.M. in eighth grade and the two became close. She also later befriended M.F. and sometimes spent time alone with her. According to the friend, both D.M. and M.F. disclosed to her that Mr. Fortune had sexually abused them. She recalled D.M. disclosing in September 2016 and M.F. disclosing in June 2017, about two months before M.F. told her psychiatrist. The friend indicated that neither of the girls offered any details about the abuse other than that it had happened. The friend recalled that M.F.\u2019s disclosure occurred while they were driving around and M.F. was \u201cjust kind of ranting\u201d about things in her life. While ranting, she told the friend that Mr. Fortune was not even her biological father and that he had molested her.\n\nCaptain Anthony Lemmon was the lead investigator in this matter and spoke with both M.F. and D.M. He testified that he was familiar with Mr. Fortune because he had previously\nspoken to him about a sexual relationship he was having with a teenage girl. The captain met Mr. Fortune at work to discuss M.F.\u2019s accusations and recorded their conversation. During the conversation, Mr. Fortune said there were many past events he could not recall because he damaged his memory when he attempted suicide and spent several days in a coma. He told Captain Lemmon that he knew there was one occasion where he rubbed M.F.\u2019s leg on the family\u2019s couch because she was having growing pains. Mr. Fortune remembered her suddenly calling him a name and running off, but he had no memory of touching her vagina. He did not recall ever touching her inappropriately. Nevertheless, he told the captain more than once that any accusations she had made against him must be true because he raised her to always be truthful.\n\nD.M. and M.F.\u2019s mother testified about the family\u2019s living arrangements over the years and her relationship with Mr. Fortune. She testified that the two split up when he started sleeping with a teenage girl, but that they reconciled when that relationship ended, he attempted suicide, and he spent several weeks recuperating. The mother claimed that the police never sought to interview her about the abuse allegations. It was her opinion that D.M. could not have been raped several times a week for an extended period without her knowledge. The mother agreed that D.M. accused Mr. Fortune of abuse when she was about ten, but she noted that D.M. had quickly recanted and assured her nothing had happened. As for M.F., the mother claimed that M.F. never told her about any abuse and that she first learned of those accusations when M.F. visited her new psychiatrist. The mother would not say outright that she did not believe her daughters, but she did testify that she did not believe the extent of their allegations. She noted that other adults frequently lived with them throughout the years, so there was almost always more than one adult present when the girls were home. She also noted that were long stretches of time when Mr. Fortune was away because he was traveling for work. The mother maintained that she had no inclination\nanything inappropriate had ever happened and, had there been ongoing abuse, she would have noticed.\n\n{\u00b626} Contrary to the mother\u2019s testimony, Captain Lemmon testified that he asked her to come to the police station for an interview. He indicated that she cooperated when he spoke with her at her house, but she did not want to be formally interviewed at the police station. He also indicated that she \u201cwas not forthcoming with information\u201d when he asked her questions.\n\n{\u00b627} The defense called two witnesses who lived with D.M., M.F., and their family at various points. One witness testified that he was the mother\u2019s cousin, he lived with the family for about four years, and he never suspected the girls were being sexually abused. The second witness testified that she came to live with the family because her mother was acquainted with Mr. Fortune. She estimated that she lived with the family for five to six months and never personally observed any signs of abuse. The second witness testified that she remembered the mother coming to her one day and sharing with her that D.M. had accused Mr. Fortune of sexual assault. She also remembered the mother coming to her again and telling her the accusations were not true and were just a product of bad dreams D.M. had experienced. The second witness testified that she had a sexual relationship with Mr. Fortune for a year or more and that he was well-endowed. It was her opinion that, had he raped either D.M. or M.F., they would have displayed some signs of injury or there would have been some sort of evidence of abuse.\n\n{\u00b628} D.M. and M.F.\u2019s younger sister was twelve years old at the time of trial and also testified for the defense. The younger sister testified that her parents had a tumultuous relationship and that, around 2016 to 2017, D.M. and M.F. started encouraging their mother to leave Mr. Fortune. She indicated that D.M. became upset with Mr. Fortune when he began having a sexual relationship with one of her older friends and when he refused to allow her boyfriend to move into\nthe house. Meanwhile, M.F. became upset with him because he refused to buy her a car and she found out he was not her biological father. According to the younger sister, when D.M. and M.F. realized that their mother needed a good reason to leave Mr. Fortune, they concocted a plan to accuse him of sexual abuse.\n\nAccording to the younger sister, D.M. and M.F. believed they could use Mr. Fortune\u2019s memory loss to their advantage, as he would not be able to recall earlier incidents they claimed had happened. She also testified that D.M. thought there was a statute of limitations on rape that had already expired so that there would be no danger of his incarceration. Although her sisters wanted her to join in their plan, the younger sister testified that she refused to do so. She stated that, unbeknownst to her sisters at the time, she had been raped one month earlier and wanted to distance herself from their plan as much as possible. Yet, she claimed that she would still hear about it as her sisters discussed it within earshot. The younger sister claimed that, after Mr. Fortune was released on bond in this matter, her sisters approached her \u201cfreaking out\u201d because they knew there were issues with their stories and they needed \u201cto figure out all the loopholes and make everything fit.\u201d At that point, they decided to fabricate more details, and D.M. provided the prosecution with a lengthier written statement.\n\nThe younger sister testified that she was in counseling and, as a therapeutic tool, her counselor taught her to journal. She ultimately wrote two typewritten stories, one of which was a journal and one of which she submitted as a project for school. Both pieces recounted the abuse allegations and their impact on the family, with the school project manifesting as a fictionalized account in which names had been changed. In the journal, the younger sister specifically wrote about her older sisters fabricating the abuse allegations against Mr. Fortune. According to the younger sister, she never meant for anyone to see her journal, but Mr. Fortune\ndiscovered a copy of it on his laptop, read it, and provided it to the defense. The younger sister testified that, after her journal emerged, D.M. threatened to harm her.\n\n{\u00b631} Mr. Fortune hired a private investigator as part of his defense, and the investigator testified at trial. He testified that Mr. Fortune provided him with the younger sister\u2019s typewritten stories one month before trial, after which he interviewed the younger sister on at least four separate occasions. The investigator was aware that the younger sister was working with the police in a separate matter related to a man who had raped her. Yet, he was not aware that, during that investigation, she was interviewed several times by the prosecutor and a victim advocate, both of whom asked her questions about her older sisters.\n\n{\u00b632} On rebuttal, the State called the victim advocate who was present when the prosecutor interviewed the younger sister about the rape she had suffered. The victim advocate testified that they met with the younger sister multiple times and frequently brought up the case against Mr. Fortune as it was going forward at the same time and was a huge source of stress for her. According to the victim advocate, the younger sister stated that Mr. Fortune was the only member of her family with whom she had a close relationship and she \u201cnever [spoke] to her sisters in any way in regards to the sexual abuse they incurred.\u201d The younger sister told the victim advocate that she hoped the allegations were not true because she \u201cwould be very devastated if [Mr. Fortune] went to jail or prison * * *.\u201d\n\n{\u00b633} Mr. Fortune argues that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. He notes that the trial court acquitted him of the charges related to D.M. due to the number of inconsistencies in her story. Even so, he argues, her testimony directly contributed to his convictions on the charges related to M.F. He argues that there was no physical evidence to support his convictions and, apart from the testimony of the girls, the testimony weighed in his\nfavor. He notes that the girls\u2019 own mother testified that it was impossible they were abused in the way they claimed, given her observations, his work schedule, and the number of people who frequently stayed at the house. Further, he argues that the younger sister\u2019s testimony irrefutably showed that D.M. and M.F. fabricated their accusations. Mr. Fortune avers that it was illogical for the trial court to refuse to believe one accuser only to find the other credible. As such, he asserts that the court lost its way by convicting him.\n\nUpon review, we cannot conclude that the trier of fact clearly lost its way when it found Mr. Fortune guilty of raping and sexually battering M.F. See Otten, 33 Ohio App.3d at 340. M.F. described two incidents where Mr. Fortune either performed oral sex on her or touched her vagina. D.M. remembered M.F. seeking her out after one of those incidents, and their friend also remembered M.F. telling her that Mr. Fortune had molested her. Although the younger sister claimed that D.M. and M.F. had fabricated their accusations, there was testimony that she was very close to Mr. Fortune and upset about the prospect of him going to prison. There also was testimony that she had told her victim advocate she was not close to her sisters and had never talked to them about their abuse allegations. As the trier of fact, the court was in the best position to consider the conflicting evidence and reasonably could have chosen to disbelieve the testimony of the younger sister. See State v. Andrews, 9th Dist. Summit No. 29260, 2020-Ohio-2703, \u00b6 31 (trier of fact in best position to evaluate witness credibility). Likewise, the court could have chosen to disregard the mother\u2019s assurances that ongoing abuse had not occurred, given the testimony that she \u201cwas not forthcoming with information\u201d and had not been inclined to believe her daughters when they were younger and first disclosed the abuse. Mr. Fortune specifically told Detective Lemmon that any accusations M.F. had made against him must have been true because he raised her to always be truthful. His convictions are not against the weight of the evidence simply because\nthe trial court chose to believe the State\u2019s witnesses and its version of the events. See State v. Hill, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26519, 2013-Ohio-4022, \u00b6 15 (\u201cThis Court will not overturn the trial court\u2019s verdict on a manifest weight of the evidence challenge only because the trier of fact chose to believe certain witness\u2019 testimony over the testimony of others.\u201d).\n\n{\u00b635} Although the trial court did not convict Mr. Fortune of the charges related to D.M., it indicated that it \u201ctruly believe[d] that something happened\u201d to her and was \u201cfairly convinced\u201d of those allegations. The court simply found that the State fell short of its burden on those counts. As the trier of fact, it was the court\u2019s prerogative \u201cto believe all, part, or none of the testimony of each witness.\u201d Prince v. Jordan, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 04CA008423, 2004-Ohio-7184, \u00b6 35. The court, therefore, could have chosen to rely on portions of D.M.\u2019s testimony for purposes of the counts related to M.F. See id. The court\u2019s decision to do so did not render Mr. Fortune\u2019s verdicts inconsistent and, in any event, \u201ceven inconsistent responses on separate counts will not justify overturning a verdict.\u201d See State v. Fridley, 9th Dist. Wayne No. 17AP0029, 2019-Ohio-3412, \u00b6 22. Upon review, Mr. Fortune has not shown that this is the exceptional case where the evidence weighs heavily against his convictions. See Otten at 340. Accordingly, his fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nAssignment of Error II\n\n[Mr. Fortune\u2019s] right to a fair trial was compromised by prosecutorial misconduct in failing to investigate exculpatory evidence and instead directing a witness to create a new statement[.]\n\n{\u00b636} In his second assignment of error, Mr. Fortune argues that prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. Specifically, he argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct when he failed to have the police investigate the younger sister\u2019s claim that D.M. and M.F. lied and, instead, instructed D.M. to write a more detailed statement. We reject his argument.\nIn deciding whether a prosecutor\u2019s conduct rises to the level of prosecutorial misconduct, a court determines if the prosecutor\u2019s actions were improper, and, if so, whether the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were actually prejudiced. *State v. Smith*, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 (1984). \u201c[A] judgment may only be reversed for prosecutorial misconduct when the improper conduct deprives the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d *State v. Knight*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 03CA008239, 2004-Ohio-1227, \u00b6 6, citing *State v. Carter*, 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 557 (1995). The defendant must show that, but for the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, the trier of fact would not have convicted him. *State v. Lollis*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 24826, 2010-Ohio-4457, \u00b6 24.\n\nIf a defendant fails to object to alleged prosecutorial misconduct, he forfeits all but plain error. *State v. Rivera*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 18CA011263, 2019-Ohio-62, \u00b6 24. Accord *State v. Dawson*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 28311, 2017-Ohio-2833, \u00b6 36. Under Crim.R. 52, \u201c[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d Nevertheless, \u201c[t]his Court will not \u2018fashion a plain error argument on [a defendant\u2019s] behalf and then address it sua sponte.\u2019\u201d *State v. Rouse*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 28301, 2018-Ohio-3266, \u00b6 15, quoting *State v. Patterson*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 16CA011035, 2017-Ohio-8196, \u00b6 24.\n\nThe record reflects that Mr. Fortune discovered the younger sister\u2019s writings on his computer about a month before trial and turned them over to his counsel. His counsel then gave the writings to their private investigator, and he repeatedly interviewed the younger sister. The defense did not provide her writings to the prosecution until less than two weeks before trial. The prosecutor then met with D.M. and M.F. to discuss what the younger sister had written. Rather than provide the younger sister\u2019s writings to Captain Lemmon, the prosecutor ultimately asked D.M. to write another statement. According to Mr. Fortune, the prosecutor ignored his duty to\npursue exculpatory evidence when he failed to give the younger sister\u2019s writings to the police and instead told D.M. to provide additional evidence.\n\n{\u00b640} The record reflects that Mr. Fortune never raised the issue of prosecutorial misconduct at the trial court level. Because he failed to do so, he forfeited his argument save for a claim of plain error. See Rivera at \u00b6 24; Dawson at \u00b6 36. Mr. Fortune has not argued plain error on appeal, and this Court is not inclined to construct that argument on his behalf. See Rouse at \u00b6 15, quoting Patterson at \u00b6 24. See also State v. Bortner, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 02CA008189, 2003-Ohio-3508, \u00b6 22. Further, he has made no attempt to demonstrate how his substantial rights were actually prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s conduct. See Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d at 14. The defense had access to the younger sister\u2019s writings two weeks before the prosecutor and used that time to investigate her claims. Mr. Fortune chose not to provide those writings to the police himself, and it is unclear what additional exculpatory evidence, if any, he believes the police would have uncovered had the prosecutor asked Captain Lemmon to investigate the writings. Because Mr. Fortune forfeited his argument and, in any event, has not attempted to explain how he was substantially prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s actions, this Court rejects his argument. Mr. Fortune\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\nAssignment of Error I\n\n[Mr. Fortune] was deprived of his fair trial when the presiding judge, in a bench trial, failed to disclose to defense counsel knowledge of prior allegations which the trial judge found pertinent[.]\n\n{\u00b641} In his first assignment of error, Mr. Fortune argues that he was deprived of a fair trial due to bias on the part of the trial judge. He argues that the judge was influenced by his knowledge of facts outside the record and failed to disclose those facts to defense counsel until sentencing. Because the judge\u2019s impartiality reasonably could have been questioned, Mr. Fortune\navers, his failure to recuse himself offended his due process rights. Upon review, we reject Mr. Fortune\u2019s argument.\n\n{\u00b642} The issue of whether a conviction must be vacated due to bias or prejudice on the part of a trial judge is one that lies exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court. See State v. Polke, 9th Dist. Medina No. 18CA0061-M, 2019-Ohio-904, \u00b6 7; R.C. 2701.031. This Court lacks authority \u201cto void a trial court\u2019s judgment on the basis of personal bias or prejudice on the part of the trial judge * * *.\u201d State v. Hunter, 151 Ohio App.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-7326, \u00b6 18 (9th Dist.), citing Beer v. Griffith, 54 Ohio St.2d 440, 441-442 (1978). Nevertheless, we may determine whether conduct on the part of a trial judge denied a criminal defendant due process of law. See, e.g., State v. Powell, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 12CA010284, 2017-Ohio-4030, \u00b6 8-13. \u201cA judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d In re Disqualification of George, 100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, \u00b6 5.\n\n{\u00b643} According to Mr. Fortune, the trial judge demonstrated bias against him when he admitted that he had knowledge of a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) that was completed in 1996. He claims that the judge admitted to having read the report in 1999 when it sentenced him to three years in prison on an unrelated matter. Mr. Fortune avers that the contents of that PSI were never made available to him or his counsel, and the court never informed them that he was intimately familiar with its contents. Because the judge possessed that knowledge about Mr. Fortune before acting as the trier of fact in this matter and before sentencing him, he argues that the judge\u2019s statements about the PSI\u2019s contents raised significant concerns about his impartiality.\n\n{\u00b644} It is undisputed that no PSI was completed in this case. At sentencing, however, the trial judge made the following statements:\nThe court does have a [PSI] that was done in 1996, which has biographical information, social history regarding Mr. Fortune up to that date. That [PSI] involved charges of breaking and entering and theft, which the other judge, at that time, sentenced Mr. Fortune to prison for 3 years. I picked up a case 3 years later involving an unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, to which he pleaded guilty in 1999 and I gave him concurrent time ** *. That [PSI] contains information about Mr. Fortune\u2019s juvenile record, some of which, I think should be mentioned, I think it\u2019s pertinent.\n\nThe court then went on to discuss that information. It is not entirely clear from the court\u2019s statements whether it reviewed one PSI from 1996 or one from 1996 and another from 1999. The record does not contain the PSI(s), and Mr. Fortune did not object to the court\u2019s reference to the PSI(s).\n\n{\u00b645} Upon review, this Court rejects Mr. Fortune\u2019s argument that bias on the part of the trial judge denied him a fair trial. First, the record does not contain the PSI(s) that the court referenced during sentencing, so this Court cannot examine the information contained therein. It was Mr. Fortune\u2019s duty to ensure that the appellate record contained the PSI(s), and he failed to fulfill that duty. See State v. Collins, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 19CA011462, 2020-Ohio-317, \u00b6 14. Second, Mr. Fortune did not object to the trial judge\u2019s statements, his consideration of the PSI(s), or his alleged bias. His failure to object resulted in a forfeiture and, once again, he has not argued plain error on appeal. See State v. Piatt, 9th Dist. Wayne. No. 19AP0023, 2020-Ohio-1177, \u00b6 45. Finally, if Mr. Fortune believed the trial judge was prejudiced or had exhibited bias, he had the ability to file an affidavit of disqualification with the Ohio Supreme Court. See State v. Smetana, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 12CA010252, 2013-Ohio-2376, \u00b6 10. This Court \u201chas no authority to render a decision with regard to disqualification * * * or to void a trial court\u2019s judgment on the basis of personal bias or prejudice on the part of the trial judge * * *.\u201d Hunter, 151 Ohio App.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-7326, at \u00b6 18, citing Beer, 54 Ohio St.2d at 441-442. Accordingly, Mr. Fortune\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.\nIII.\n\n{\u00b646} Mr. Fortune\u2019s assignments of error are overruled. The judgment of the Wayne County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nThere were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\nWe order that a special mandate issue out of this Court, directing the Court of Common Pleas, County of Wayne, State of Ohio, to carry this judgment into execution.

Box 69, London, OH 43140\nDefendant-Appellant, Pro Se\nFROELICH, J.\n\n\u00b6 1 James E. Quinn appeals from a judgment of the Clark County Common Pleas Court that denied his second motion for a new trial. The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n\n**Factual Background and Procedural History**\n\n\u00b6 2 In March 2014, a Clark County jury found Quinn guilty of two counts of domestic violence, two counts of kidnapping, one count of abduction, and one count of intimidation. After merging the kidnapping and abduction charges, the trial court sentenced Quinn to an aggregate sentence of 20 years in prison.\n\na. Quinn I\n\n\u00b6 3 On Quinn's direct appeal, this court affirmed the trial court's judgment. *State v. Quinn*, 2016-Ohio-139, 57 N.E.3d 379, \u00b6 66 (2d Dist.) (\u201cQuinn I\u201d). At that time, we summarized the facts underlying Quinn's conviction as follows:\n\nThe victim, Beverl[e]y Quinn, is a 79-year-old woman, the mother of two daughters and two sons, including the defendant, James Quinn. In December 2013, Quinn's girlfriend, Samantha Ferrell, was living with Quinn's mother, Beverl[e]y, in her two-bedroom house. At that time, Quinn was under indictment for a domestic violence incident involving his mother; as a condition of bond he was subject to a no-contact order with his mother. Late in the evening, Beverl[e]y was awakened by noise, and found Quinn\n\n---\n\n1 Our previous decisions employed the \u201cBeverly\u201d spelling reflected in the transcript of the complainant's trial testimony. However, as all documents signed by the complainant in regard to Quinn's current appeal spell her first name \u201cBeverley,\u201d we have adopted the latter spelling for purposes of this decision.\nand Ferrell in her home, drinking vodka and watching television. Beverly told Quinn he was not allowed to be there and asked Quinn to leave, to turn off the television, and for Samantha to go to her room. Quinn became very angry with his mother, pushed her into a chair, and hit her. When Quinn suggested to Samantha that they take his mother to \u201cmental health,\u201d Samantha suggested that they take Beverly out into the country and dump her. Beverly then ran to her own bedroom, locked the door, and left the house by crawling out of the bedroom window. Beverly went to a neighbor\u2019s house and called the police. During the 911 call, Quinn identified her son, James Quinn, as the person who * * * abused her, and stated that Quinn left her house driving a white station wagon. Quinn and Samantha left Beverly\u2019s house before the police arrived. The police took photos of Beverly\u2019s bruises, and allowed her to return to her own home after they verified it was empty and secured. One of the two officers who spoke with Beverly at this time testified that Beverly was very articulate and said it was her son who had struck her in the face. No charges were filed against Quinn at this time.\n\nAccording to Beverly\u2019s testimony at trial, several hours later Quinn returned to his mother\u2019s home, without Samantha, forced entrance into his mother\u2019s bedroom, and forced his mother to leave the house with him, threatening to take her to the country and make her jump off a bridge. Beverly described her son as very angry and intoxicated on alcohol and drugs. Beverly left with her son because she felt she had no choice. He\ndrove out into the country, stopped at a bridge and said, \u201cif you don't jump, I'll push you.\u201d According to Beverl[e]y, Quinn decided he could not do it, and told her that he wouldn\u2019t do anything to her as long as she did not testify against him. Beverl[e]y testified at trial that Quinn then drove to Walmart, hitting her in the head numerous times as he was driving. After he left the car, Beverl[e]y got out of the car and approached a Walmart employee for help. She told the employee that her son had hurt her and was trying to kill her. The Walmart employee verified this course of events and testified that Beverl[e]y was scared, but she knew who she was, where she was, and was not disoriented or confused. The Walmart employee testified that as Beverl[e]y was talking to him, a man came up to both of them, grabbed Beverl[e]y\u2019s arm and complained that she was trying to hurt him. The employee insisted that he let go and leave her alone. A surveillance video of the Walmart parking lot corroborates this testimony, but is taken from too far a distance to identify the man's facial features. The surveillance video shows that Beverl[e]y approached the employee, a man approached them, and then the unidentified man left in a white station wagon. The employee could not identify Quinn as the person he saw and talked with in the parking lot. Beverl[e]y testified at trial that Quinn was driving her car, which she described as a tan sedan, not a white station wagon. No witness identified Quinn as the man depicted in the video in the Walmart parking lot.\n\nThe detective who interviewed Beverl[e]y at Walmart testified that Beverl[e]y identified her son, James Quinn, as the person who attacked her\nin her home, who forced her into a car, threatened to harm her, and hit her face, causing visible injuries. The detective also testified that during his interview on the scene, Beverl[e]y was very emotional, but lucid and articulate about the events of the evening. Based on this interview, the detective obtained a search warrant. A search of Beverl[e]y\u2019s home revealed evidence that her bedroom door had been damaged as the result of being forced open.\n\nBeverl[e]y was transported to the hospital by ambulance and treated in the Emergency Room at Springfield Regional Medical Center. The paramedic who transported Beverl[e]y testified that she was alert and oriented. The ER Nurse testified that Beverl[e]y was oriented, and did not appear to suffer from dementia or any other mental defect. The ER Nurse testified that Beverl[e]y identified her son as the person who had hit and injured her.\n\nId. at \u00b6 3-6.\n\nb. Quinn II\n\n\u00b6 4 Four months after his conviction, Quinn filed a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. On the same day we ruled on Quinn's direct appeal, this court also affirmed the trial court's denial of that motion. State v. Quinn, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2014-CA-95, 2016-Ohio-140, \u00b6 1 (\u201cQuinn II\u201d). That decision related the following relevant facts:\n\nFour months after the trial and conviction, Quinn filed a motion for a new trial and attached three affidavits[:] his own affidavit and two affidavits from\nhis mother, Beverl[e]y, who recanted her trial testimony. The motion also requested a hearing. In the affidavits filed in support of the motion for a new trial, Beverl[e]y avers that her testimony was based on what she was told by her family and by the prosecutor. She avers that at the time of the incident, she was not wearing her glasses or hearing aid, and she was on medication that caused her confusion. She avers that she does not believe that Quinn committed the crimes against her, because she knows he had consumed two fifths of vodka and was too drunk to stand or drive on the night of the incident.\n\nId. at \u00b6 10.\n\n{\u00b6 5} In Quinn II, we noted that the trial court overruled Quinn's motion for a new trial without conducting a hearing, citing its impression that the Walmart surveillance video substantiated Beverley's testimony such that the new evidence did not raise \u201cany probability\u201d of a different trial result. Id. Although we disagreed with the trial court's conclusion that \u201cevidence of Quinn's guilt was independently established,\u201d see id. at \u00b6 18, we nonetheless determined that the record \u201ccontain[ed] sufficient support for finding that Beverl[e]y's testimony at trial was more credible than her post-trial affidavits.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 19. We then elaborated:\n\nAt trial, evidence was presented from the officers who investigated the two separate incidents and the ER Nurse who talked with Beverl[e]y after she left Walmart. One officer testified that Beverl[e]y identified her son as the person who attacked her in her home. A detective testified that Beverl[e]y identified her son as the person who forced her into a car, threatened to\nharm her, and hit her face, causing visible injuries. The Walmart employee also testified that Beverl[e]y told him that her son was trying to hurt her. Although hearsay, these witnesses\u2019 testimony was properly admitted as an excited utterance, an exception to the hearsay rule under Evid. R. 803(2).\n\nIn ruling on the motion for a new trial, the trial court should have considered whether the testimony of the officers, the Walmart employee, and the nurse was sufficient to support the credibility of the victim\u2019s excited utterances at the time of the offenses, even if the victim later recanted her testimony. The trial court should have also considered the testimony of the investigating officers, the Walmart employee and the medical professionals, who all testified that although Beverl[e]y was scared, she was lucid, articulate and not confused or disoriented at the time she described details of the events that had just happened to her. The mental, emotional and physical condition of [ ] Beverl[e]y\u2019s state of mind at the time she made statements to the officers and medical professionals was properly admissible under Evid. R. 803(3).\n\nId.\n\n\u00b6 6 Applying the factors used to assess the credibility of affidavits, as set forth in State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 285, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999), we determined that \u201cthe Calhoun factors justify a conclusion that the affidavits filed in support of the motion for a new trial lacked credibility.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 21. We explained:\n\nThe trial judge who presided over the trial is the same judge who reviewed the affidavit and determined its lack of credibility. In their post-trial affidavits,\nboth Quinn and his mother describe his level of intoxication on the night of the offenses as \u201ctoo drunk to stand.\u201d Beverly\u2019s statements regarding how much Quinn had to drink and his ability to drive on the night of the incident, if believed, had to be based on hearsay statements Quinn made to her. She also claims that her original story was derived from fear based on hearsay statements made to her by family and the prosecutor. However, the trial testimony of the officers, the Walmart employee, and the ER Nurse confirmed that the story Beverly told at trial was consistent with the statements she made to them on the night of the incident, before she talked to her other family members or the prosecutor. The affidavits were signed by Quinn\u2019s mother, who may naturally want to protect her son from long-term incarceration. Quinn\u2019s new claim that Beverly was confused is not supported by the investigating officers or the medical professionals, who all found her oriented and articulate. Quinn\u2019s new claim that Beverly did not hear her son\u2019s voice on the night of the incident is directly contradicted by her trial testimony that he took her to a bridge and told her to jump, then said he would not hurt her if she did not testify against him. Based on the lack of Beverly\u2019s credibility in her affidavits, and the strength of her credibility at trial, as supported by the testimony of numerous witnesses, we conclude that even if the jury was presented with the new evidence there is not a strong probability that the outcome would be different.\n\nId.\n\n\u00b6 7 For those reasons, we held that the trial court did not err in overruling Quinn\u2019s\nmotion for a new trial without conducting a hearing. *Id.* at \u00b6 22.\n\nc. *Quinn III*\n\n{\u00b6 8} In May 2016, this court granted Quinn\u2019s motion to reopen his direct appeal to raise a claim that the trial court erred in ruling on challenges during voir dire. One of those challenges was to Prospective Juror #11, a deputy with the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Department whom Quinn urged the State \u201cknew, or should have known[,] * * * was involved in this case.\u201d *State v. Quinn*, 2017-Ohio-7000, 95 N.E.3d 664, \u00b6 13 (2d Dist.) (\u201c*Quinn III*\u201d). We overruled Quinn\u2019s assignment of error on that issue, *id.* at \u00b6 14, and again affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. *Id.* at \u00b6 19.\n\nd. *Quinn IV*\n\n{\u00b6 9} In February 2015, Quinn filed a petition for postconviction relief in the trial court, asserting nine claims. In August 2016, he moved to amend his petition to add additional claims and exhibits. When the trial court denied Quinn\u2019s motion for postconviction relief, Quinn once again appealed to this court. See *State v. Quinn*, 2017-Ohio-8107, 98 N.E.3d 1184 (2d Dist.) (\u201c*Quinn IV*\u201d).\n\n{\u00b6 10} In *Quinn IV*, we overruled all ten assignments of error Quinn raised at that time. See *id.* We first determined that the trial court did not err by failing to address Quinn\u2019s proposed amendments filed without leave of court 18 months after he filed the original petition. *Id.* at \u00b6 25. We further determined that although the trial court did not address each of the original petition\u2019s assignments of error individually, that court\u2019s findings of facts and conclusions of law sufficiently apprised Quinn that he had \u201cfailed to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief due to Beverl[e]y\u2019s credibility at trial.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 30. Finally, as to the original petition\u2019s remaining assignments\nof error, we determined that none warranted relief, as most were based on information contained in the amended petition not properly before the trial court, and the rest were barred by res judicata or were not supported by legally cognizable affidavits. *Id.* at \u00b6 31-37.\n\ne. Quinn V\n\n{\u00b6 11} Now before us is Quinn's appeal from the trial court's denial of his second motion for a new trial. In that motion filed on August 3, 2016, Quinn identified 14 issues alleged to warrant relief under Crim.R. 33. Twelve of those issues related to the State's alleged failure to disclose, or destruction of, evidence that purportedly was exculpatory in nature or could have been used to impeach witnesses who testified against Quinn. The two remaining issues related to Quinn's trial counsel's alleged ineffectiveness due to failing to properly investigate his case, and to police performing a warrantless search of Beverley's home. Attached to the motion were 20 exhibits, including seven exhibits that purport to be copies of documents that the State was alleged to have failed to disclose through discovery (Trial Court Docket #79, Exhs. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13), five exhibits that purport to be affidavits or signed statements of Beverley Quinn (*id.*, Exhs. 2, 9, 11, 17, 21), four exhibits that purport to be affidavits of other individuals with information beneficial to Quinn's defense (*id.*, Exhs. 3, 12, 15, 16), and four exhibits that are copies of trial court filings or other documents related to this case that are alleged to support Quinn's motion. (*Id.*, Exhs. 8, 14, 18, 19.)\n\n{\u00b6 12} On August 8, 2016, Quinn moved to amend his motion in order to add a\n\n---\n\n2 Although the final exhibit is labeled \u201cExhibit Twenty-one,\u201d no Exh. 20 is attached to Quinn's motion as it appears in the record before this Court.\ncopy of the trial court\u2019s docket from his case as an exhibit. (Trial Court Docket #81, Exh. 22.) On October 23, 2017, Quinn also moved to supplement his motion with three additional affidavits. (Trial Court Docket #89, attached 8/1/17 Affidavit of Beverley Quinn; 3/24/16 Affidavit of Mike Simms; 8/3/17 Affidavit of Mark Rafferty.)\n\n\u00b6 13 On November 30, 2017, the trial court entered judgment against Quinn by entry stating in its entirety as follows:\n\nDefendant\u2019s motion of August 3, 2016 for a new trial is OVERRULED.\n\nDefendant\u2019s motion of October 23, 2017, for leave to supplement his motion for a new trial is SUSTAINED.\n\n(Emphasis sic.) (Trial Court Docket #90.)\n\n\u00b6 14 Although the terse nature of that ruling leaves its intent somewhat unclear, we interpret the judgment to mean that the trial court granted Quinn leave to supplement his motion, considered the motion for a new trial as supplemented, and then overruled that motion.\n\n\u00b6 15 Quinn\u2019s current appeal sets forth these 14 assignments of error:\n\n1) The trial court found the unavoidable prevention portion of the leave to file a motion for a new trial to be correct and credible by the fact the trial court sustained the amendment to the new trial motion and denied the motion, showing the merits of the motion for a new trial were addressed by the trial court and denied.\n\n2) The trial court failed to grant [Quinn] a new trial which is error. [Quinn] submitted documentary evidence that was withheld by the State in the form of Clark County Sheriff Reports that would have been useful in\nrecovering exculpatory evidence from the car, test the car for prints, after\nthe car was found in an area where [Quinn] knows no one. The State\nnever opposed the fact that the reports were never disclosed, their\nexculpatory nature, and the disregard the State had concerning\ndiscovery. Only one of the undisclosed reports were disclosed prior to\nMay of 2016. However, the Discovery Checklist along with the\ntranscripts were not obtained by [Quinn] until May of 2016, and those\nwere needed to make sure the issues were not raised at trial or were on\nthe Discovery checklist. In short, the evidence concerning the\nundisclosed reports were not evidence that could be used for what they\nare being used for until the other reports that were disclosed were gotten\nand sent to [Quinn] which was in May of 2016. This is well documented\nin affidavits and unavoidable prevention memorandum portion of the\nleave to file a motion for a new trial.\n\n3) The trial court failed to award [Quinn] a new trial or an evidentiary\nhearing based on evidence that was presented to the court that clearly\nshowed [Quinn] was prejudiced by the fact that the law enforcement\nreports that were not disclosed would have provided a means to recover\nthe exculpatory evidence in the car. The State also had a duty to learn\nof any evidence favorable to [Quinn] and failed in that duty.\n\n4) The State had possession and constructive possession of the car and\nfailed to let the Defense know this. This impaired [Quinn\u2019s] right to * * *\npresent a complete defense. This [is] an obvious violation of the rules of\ndiscovery. The trial court failed to give [Quinn] a new trial or an evidentiary hearing, against due process.\n\n5) The State failed to turn over law enforcement reports that would have shown [Quinn] was arrested some five miles from where the car was towed from, and ten hours after the car was towed. This was a violation of due process and the trial court knew this, as the trial court was given the documents to prove this fact. The trial court failed to order a new trial or an evidentiary hearing. This [is] a violation of due process.\n\n6) The trial court failed to order a new trial when that court was given documents that were proof the investigation was shoddy and those documents were not provided to the Defense. The trial court had a duty to order a new trial or an evidentiary hearing. That failure to order a new trial or an evidentiary hearing was a violation of due process.\n\n7) The State failed to let the defense know that the car that they claimed was used in the crimes that [Quinn] is incarcerated for was destroyed prior to trial. This is a violation of the due process of law. [Quinn] provided the necessary documents to prove this claim and the trial court failed to give [Quinn] a new trial and also failed to provide an evidentiary hearing. This violated [Quinn\u2019s] right to due process and the failure to report that the car was destroyed is a *Brady* violation.\n\n8) One of the CSSO reports that were withheld was a Uniform Incident Report. The author of that report was in the jury pool[ ](as unreal and improper as that might sound)[.] Many issues resulted from this and they\nwere all violations of due process and the right to a fair trial. [Quinn] made the report available to the trial court along with the other reports. The trial court failed to grant [Quinn] a new trial or an evidentiary hearing, this is a violation of due process.\n\n9) The trial court failed to give [Quinn] a new trial when there was an obvious *Brady* violation concerning impeachment evidence that would have changed the result of the trial. The trial court also failed to provide [Quinn] with an evidentiary hearing.\n\n10) The trial court failed to award [Quinn] a new trial or an evidentiary hearing after [Quinn] disclosed documents that were not disclosed to him by the State that would have impeached a very important prosecution witness, the alleged victim herself.\n\n11) The State failed to disclose information concerning the bridge that the alleged victim was taken to be thrown from being closed and impassable [ ](this a *Brady* violation)[.] The State had knowledge of this fact. Documents proving this fact were made available to the trial court and the trial court failed to grant [Quinn] a new trial or grant [Quinn] an evidentiary hearing. This [is] a violation of due process.\n\n12) [Quinn] was prejudiced by the fact that he tested positive for opiates at the county jail and the State never made the Defense aware of this fact. The State made it a point to tell [Quinn\u2019s] family of this, and turning [Quinn\u2019s] family against him. This also would have been helpful in the production of an alternative perpetrator defense. This is a *Brady*\nviolation. The fact that the trial court did not afford [Quinn] a new trial, or an evidentiary hearing was a violation of due process.\n\n13) [Quinn] was denied an opportunity to present a complete defense by the fact that material witnesses in his favor were withheld, and the car, and the exculpatory evidence in the car was not made available to the Defense. The trial court was given documentation to prove this claim but failed to provide [Quinn] an opportunity to an evidentiary hearing or a new trial. This is a violation of [Quinn\u2019s] due process rights.\n\n14) Defense counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate the car, the house, and the bridge, after being asked to do so[ ](the car and the bridge would have given up exculpatory evidence)[.] Counsel was also ineffective for not interviewing Mark Rafferty or Mike Simms, as that would have provided the fact that [Quinn] was not even in the car that was on the video, and [was] at Mr[.] Rafferty\u2019s house when the incident occurred.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n{\u00b6 16} A ruling on a motion for a new trial is within the trial court\u2019s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of abuse of discretion. Quinn II, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2014-CA-95, 2016-Ohio-140, at \u00b6 12, citing State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 564 N.E.2d 54 (1990). \u201c[I]t is within the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine whether or not it is necessary to hold an evidentiary hearing on a new trial motion.\u201d Id., citing State v. Moore, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 13 MA 9, 2014-Ohio-358, \u00b6 19. An abuse of discretion \u201cimplies that the court\u2019s attitude [was] unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d State\nv. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 404 N.E.2d 144 (1980). \u201cA decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process that would support that decision.\u201d AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597 (1990).\n\n**Law Governing Motions for New Trial**\n\n{\u00b6 17} With regard to motions for a new trial, Crim.R. 33 provides in pertinent part as follows\n\n(A) Grounds. A new trial may be granted on motion of the defendant for any of the following causes affecting materially his substantial rights:\n\n* * *\n\n(6) When new evidence material to the defense is discovered which the defendant could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial. When a motion for a new trial is made upon the ground of newly discovered evidence, the defendant must produce * * * the affidavits of the witnesses by whom such evidence is expected to be given * * * [.]\n\n{\u00b6 18} Motions for new trial on account of newly discovered evidence must be filed within 120 days after the jury renders its verdict, unless the defendant shows \u201cby clear and convincing proof that [he] was unavoidably prevented from the discovery of the evidence upon which he must rely.\u201d Crim.R. 33(B). If the court finds that the defendant was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence within that time, the defendant must file his motion within seven days after the court\u2019s order to that effect. Id.\n\n{\u00b6 19} In State v. Petro, 148 Ohio St. 505, 76 N.E.2d 370 (1947), the Ohio\nSupreme Court held that \u201c[t]o warrant the granting of a motion for a new trial in a criminal case, based on the ground of newly discovered evidence, it must be shown that the new evidence (1) discloses a strong probability that it will change the result if a new trial is granted, (2) has been discovered since the trial, (3) is such as could not in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered before the trial, (4) is material to the issues, (5) is not merely cumulative to former evidence, and (6) does not merely impeach or contradict the former evidence.\u201d *Id.* at syllabus.\n\n{\u00b6 20} \u201cWhile *Petro* stands for the proposition that newly discovered evidence that merely impeaches or contradicts other evidence is not enough for a new trial, we do not read *Petro* as establishing a per se rule excluding newly discovered evidence as a basis for a new trial simply because that evidence is in the nature of impeaching or contradicting evidence.\u201d *Dayton v. Martin*, 43 Ohio App.3d 87, 90, 539 N.E.2d 646 (2d Dist.1987). \u201cThe test is whether the newly discovered evidence would create a strong probability of a different result at trial, or whether it is merely impeaching or contradicting evidence that is insufficient to create a strong probability of a different result.\u201d *Id.*; accord *State v. Smith*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23945, 2011-Ohio-2189, \u00b6 24-25; *State v. McConnell*, 170 Ohio App.3d 800, 2007-Ohio-1181, 869 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 21 (2d Dist.).\n\n{\u00b6 21} Where newly discovered evidence takes the form of recantation by the prosecution\u2019s primary witness, the trial court \u201cmust make two findings: (1) which of the contradictory testimonies of the recanting witness is credible and true, and if the recantation is believable; (2) would the recanted testimony have materially affected the outcome of the trial?\u201d *State v. Arnold*, 189 Ohio App.3d 507, 2010-Ohio-5379, 939 N.E.2d 218, \u00b6 30 (2d Dist.), citing *Toledo v. Easterling*, 26 Ohio App.3d 59, 498 N.E.2d 198 (6th\nWe assess the credibility of affidavits offered in support of a motion for a new trial by applying the same standard used to review affidavits supporting petitions for postconviction relief. See Quinn II, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2014-CA-95, 2016-Ohio-140, at \u00b6 20, citing State v. Beavers, 166 Ohio App.3d 605, 2006-Ohio-1128, 852 N.E.2d 754, \u00b6 20-21 (2d Dist.). That is, \u201c[i]n assessing the credibility of affidavits, the trial court should consider all relevant factors, including: \u2018(1) whether the judge reviewing the post-conviction relief petition also presided at the trial, (2) whether multiple affidavits contain nearly identical language, or otherwise appear to have been drafted by the same person, (3) whether the affidavits contain or rely on hearsay, (4) whether the affiants are relatives of the petitioner, or otherwise interested in the success of the petitioner's efforts, and (5) whether the affidavits contradict evidence proffered by the defense at trial.\u2019 \u201d State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 285, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999). \u201cMoreover, a trial court may find sworn testimony in an affidavit to be contradicted by evidence in the record by the same witness, or to be internally inconsistent, thereby weakening the credibility of that testimony.\u201d Id. \u201cOne or more of the Calhoun factors, to the extent that any of them apply, may be sufficient to justify a conclusion that an affidavit asserting information outside the record lacks credibility.\u201d Beavers at \u00b6 21.\n\nApplication of Doctrine of Res Judicata to Successive Motions for New Trial\n\n\u201cPursuant to the doctrine of res judicata, a valid final judgment on the merits bars all subsequent actions based on any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the previous action.\u201d State v. Reed, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26526, 2015-Ohio-3051, \u00b6 26, quoting State v. Collins, 2d Dist.\nMontgomery No. 25612, 2013-Ohio-3645, \u00b6 9. \u201cRes judicata applies to any defense that was raised or could have been raised in a criminal defendant\u2019s prior direct appeal from his conviction.\u201d Id., quoting Collins at \u00b6 9. Additionally, arguments advanced in a successive motion for a new trial may be barred by the doctrine of res judicata. See id. at \u00b6 28 (where appellant \u201cpreviously filed a motion for a new trial,\u201d res judicata bars use of successive new trial motion to raise issues that could have been asserted in prior motion). See also State v. Shabazz, 8th Dist. No. 100623, 2014-Ohio-3142, \u00b6 13 (\u201csuccessive motions for a new trial are barred by res judicata\u201d); State v. Moore, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-08-27, 2008-Ohio-6751 (arguments made in successive motion for new trial barred by res judicata).\n\n\u00b6 24 In Quinn II, we rejected Quinn\u2019s prior request for a new trial based on affidavits in which Beverley sought to recant her trial testimony identifying her son as her assailant. See Quinn II, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2014-CA-95, 2016-Ohio-140, at \u00b6 20-22. To the extent that Quinn\u2019s current, successive motion for a new trial likewise depends on affidavits in which Beverley proposes that a different person perpetrated the crimes of which Quinn was convicted, those arguments are barred by res judicata. Res judicata also precludes Quinn from now advancing any other arguments that could have been but were not raised in that prior motion for a new trial. See Reed at \u00b6 28.\n\nAssignment of Error 1 \u2013 \u201cUnavoidably Prevented\u201d and New Evidence\n\n\u00b6 25 Quinn\u2019s first assignment of error appears to assert that we are required to assume that he was unavoidably prevented from previously presenting evidence that he now advances in support of his motion for a new trial. Quinn urges that the trial court implicitly found that he had demonstrated he was unavoidably prevented from discovering\nthat evidence. See Crim.R. 33(B). He further asserts that the State \u201cwaived any evidentiary challenges\u201d to his current motion by failing to file an opposing memorandum in the trial court. We accept neither premise.\n\n\u00b6 26 In granting Quinn\u2019s motion to amend his latest motion for a new trial, the trial court made no finding, either express or implied, regarding whether Quinn had satisfied Crim.R. 33\u2019s requirements for filing a delayed motion for a new trial. (See Trial Court Docket # 90.) A court may rule on a motion to amend without passing on the merits of the underlying filing to be amended. In this instance, the trial court denied Quinn\u2019s motion for a new trial without addressing whether Quinn was unavoidably prevented for purposes of Crim.R. 33 from discovering the purported new evidence on which that motion was based.\n\n\u00b6 27 Additionally, the State did not concede Quinn\u2019s arguments by failing to dispute them before the trial court. Although waiver may occur as a result of failure to oppose evidence offered in support of a motion for summary judgment, that principle does not apply as to evidence supporting other motions. See Bank One Trust Co., N.A. v. Reynolds, 2d Dist. No. 22465, 2008-Ohio-5512, \u00b6 7-9. The State remains free to challenge the evidence offered in support of Quinn\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u00b6 28 Quinn\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\nAssignments of Error 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, & 13 \u2013 Exculpatory Evidence from Car\n\n\u00b6 29 Most of Quinn\u2019s current assignments of error relate to his claim that he was deprived of potentially exculpatory evidence associated with the car used in Beverley\u2019s kidnapping. Quinn argues that the State denied him due process by failing to disclose law enforcement records regarding where the car was found, towed, and impounded, by\nfailing to properly inventory the car\u2019s contents and/or to share any inventory with Quinn\u2019s counsel, by denying Quinn\u2019s counsel access to the car, and by destroying the car before Quinn\u2019s trial. He argues that any fingerprints left in or on the car, a note, a coat and a cellphone allegedly seen inside the car, and the abandoned car\u2019s location vis-\u00e0-vis where Quinn was arrested all could have supported a defense that a different person committed the crime. We will address all contentions related to evidence in the car by category.\n\na. Failure to Disclose Evidence \u2013 *Brady* violation\n\n{\u00b6 30} \u201cIn *Brady v. Maryland*, the United States Supreme Court held that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process when the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d *Disciplinary Counsel v. Kellogg-Martin*, 124 Ohio St.3d 415, 2010-Ohio-282, 923 N.E.2d 125, \u00b6 24, citing *Brady*, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). In order to establish a *Brady* violation, the defendant must demonstrate that (1) the prosecution failed to disclose evidence upon request; (2) the evidence was favorable to the defendant; and (3) the evidence was material. *State v. Wade*, 2d Dist. Clark No. 06-CA-108, 2007-Ohio-6611, \u00b6 12. Evidence suppressed by the State \u201cshall be deemed material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d *State v. Aldridge*, 120 Ohio App.3d 122, 145, 697 N.E.2d 228 (2d Dist.1997), quoting *State v. Johnston*, 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 529 N.E.2d 898 (1988), paragraph five of the syllabus.\n\n{\u00b6 31} As an initial matter, no cognizable evidence in the record establishes that the State failed to provide to Quinn\u2019s counsel through discovery the various law\nenforcement reports referenced in Quinn\u2019s arguments. (See Assignments of Error #2, #3, #5 & #6.) Although Quinn argues that such records were not produced prior to trial, he has submitted neither his own affidavit nor an affidavit from his trial attorney substantiating that claim. In addition, none of the documents now submitted by Quinn has been properly authenticated. Unauthenticated documents are not admissible as evidence and thus do not provide proper support for a motion for a new trial. See State v. Brown, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 805533, 2002-Ohio-3635, \u00b6 59-60.\n\nIrrespective of those omissions, however, and more importantly, Quinn has not shown that the subject records were favorable to him in a way that would have materially assisted his defense. Although the various documents as produced do combine to show both the location in which the car used for the kidnapping was abandoned on the night of December 14 and the location where Quinn was arrested at 2:15 p.m. the next day, those facts alone would not support an inference that Quinn was not the driver of the car involved in the kidnapping. Even accepting as true Quinn\u2019s assertion (again not supported by cognizable evidence) that he \u201cwas arrested some five miles from where the car was towed from, and ten hours after the car was towed\u201d (see Assignment of Error #5), our conclusion would not change. Given the ease with which five miles could be traversed\n\n---\n\n1 Specifically, Quinn advances a \u201cUniform Incident Report\u201d from the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office dated 12/15/13, which specifies a location from which Beverley\u2019s abandoned car was towed on that date because it posed \u201ca traffic hazard\u201d (see 8/3/18 Motion for New Trial Pursuant to Criminal Rule 33, Exh. 1); a Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office \u201cTow Log\u201d indicating that such car \u201cwas crushed on 3/19/2014\u201d (id., Exh. 4); a \u201cLaw Enforcement Arrest Report\u201d indicating when and where Quinn was arrested (id., Exh. 5); a Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office \u201cDetail Call Sheet\u201d dated 12/15/13, recording a \u201ctraffic complaint\u201d about Beverley\u2019s car and the car\u2019s location (id., Exh. 6); and a \u201cLaw Enforcement Arrest Report Probable Cause Affidavit\u201d from the Clark County Municipal Court dated 12/14/13, reflecting where and when Quinn was arrested. (Id., Exh. 7).\nin 10 hours, evidence of the distance between the abandoned car and the site of Quinn's arrest was not material to the outcome of Quinn\u2019s trial.\n\n\u00b6 33 Neither are we persuaded that the State impermissibly withheld documents about the towing of Beverley\u2019s car. Nothing in the record establishes that the State failed to produce those documents. Moreover, nothing on the face of those documents materially \u201cfavors\u201d Quinn. See Wade, 2d Dist. No. 06-CA-108, 2007-Ohio-6611, at \u00b6 12. Quinn implies that disclosure of those documents could have led to the discovery of other admissible evidence \u201csufficient to establish a reasonable probability of a different result\u201d in his trial. For example, he urges that disclosure of the Uniform Incident Report would have made the defense aware of a potential witness who saw the man who abandoned Beverley\u2019s car, and might have \u201cchanged [Quinn's] mind on whether he should testify himself.\u201d (Assignment of Error #13.) However, as discussed more fully below, given the strength of Beverley\u2019s trial testimony identifying her son as her assailant, Quinn has not demonstrated that any information derived from those documents would have materially assisted his defense.\n\n\u00b6 34 Because Quinn is unable to establish a Brady violation relative to the purportedly undisclosed documents, his assignments of error based on the State\u2019s alleged failure to disclose those documents is overruled.\n\nb. Destruction of Evidence\n\n\u00b6 35 \u201cThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects a criminal defendant from being convicted when the State\n\n---\n\n4 Although Quinn purports to quote United States v. Phillip, 948 F.2d 241, 248 (6th Cir.1991) for this proposition, that language does not appear in Phillip.\neither fails to preserve materially exculpatory evidence or destroys, in bad faith, potentially useful evidence.\u201d State v. McClain, 2016-Ohio-838, 60 N.E.3d 783, \u00b6 21 (2d Dist.), citing State v. White, 2015-Ohio-3512, 37 N.E.3d 1271, \u00b6 58 (2d Dist.). \u201cEvidence is \u2018materially exculpatory\u2019 if it (1) possesses \u2018an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed\u2019 and (2) is \u2018of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.\u2019 \u201d Id., citing California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 489, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984); State v. Powell, 132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, \u00b6 74.\n\n\u00b6 36 \u201cIn contrast, evidence is not materially exculpatory if it is merely potentially useful.\u201d State v. Cox, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25477, 2013-Ohio-4941, \u00b6 88. \u201cPotentially useful\u201d evidence \u201cmay or may not have incriminated the defendant. The failure to preserve evidence that by its nature or subject is merely potentially useful violates a defendant\u2019s due process rights only if the police or prosecution acted in bad faith.\u201d Id. Bad faith \u201cimplies something more than bad judgment or negligence.\u201d Powell at \u00b6 81. \u201cIt imports a dishonest purpose, moral obliquity, conscious wrongdoing, breach of a known duty through some ulterior motive or ill will partaking of the nature of fraud.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. The defendant bears the burden to prove that the evidence in question was materially exculpatory, not merely potentially useful. Id. at \u00b6 74.\n\n\u00b6 37 Quinn contends that the State violated his right to due process by allowing the car used in the kidnapping and its contents to be destroyed by the towing company prior to his trial. (See Assignments of Error #3 and #7.) He suggests that the car contained materially exculpatory, or at least potentially useful, evidence in the form of fingerprints as well as a note, cell phone, and jacket that did not belong to Quinn and may have\npointed to a different perpetrator. In support of his motion for a new trial on this basis, Quinn filed what he termed the \u201caffidavit\u201d of Michael E. Simms, who describes purportedly exculpatory evidence that he claims to have seen inside Beverley Quinn\u2019s car. (Trial Court Docket #77, Exh. 3, Affidavit of Mike Simms.) Quinn also offered his mother\u2019s \u201caffidavit\u201d stating that her car \u201chad a strange male coat and telephone in it.\u201d (Id., Exh. 2, 1/29/15 Affidavit of Beverley Quinn.)\n\n\u00b6 38 We determine that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by declining to grant a new trial on the basis of the purported \u201caffidavits\u201d Quinn filed. Beverley\u2019s assertion that a different person was responsible for the subject crimes was presented and rejected in Quinn\u2019s previous motion for a new trial. See Quinn II, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2014-CA-95, 2016-Ohio-140, \u00b6 20-22. Simms\u2019s statements to the same effect apparently could have been raised at that time as well, given Simms\u2019s assertion that Quinn\u2019s trial attorney was aware of Simms\u2019s status as a potential witness. (See Trial Court Docket #77, Exh. 3.) Arguments based on the potential evidence Beverley and Simms claim to have witnessed thus are barred by res judicata. See Reed, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26526, 2015-Ohio-3051, at \u00b6 28.\n\n\u00b6 39 In addition, neither Beverley\u2019s nor Simms\u2019s proposed \u201caffidavit\u201d is presented in proper form. \u201cAn affidavit must appear, on its face, to have been taken before the proper officer and in compliance with all legal requisites.\u201d In re Disqualification of Pokorny, 74 Ohio St.3d 1238, 657 N.E.2d 1345 (1992). While the \u201caffidavits\u201d proffered by Beverley and Simms do bear the signature and seal of a notary public, nowhere do those documents state that the affiants were identified to, sworn by, and affixed their signatures in the presence of the notary public. (See Trial Court Docket #77, Exhs. 2 & 3.) \u201cA paper\npurporting to be an affidavit, but not to have been sworn to before an officer, is not an affidavit.\u201d *Pokorny* at 1238. Because the documents produced by Quinn do not comport with the requirements for affidavits, they are not cognizable evidence.\n\n{\u00b6 40} The documents presented in conjunction with Quinn\u2019s motion for leave to supplement his motion for a new trial do not remedy those omissions. (See attachments to Trial Court Docket #89.) In one attachment to that motion, Beverley attests that all prior documents bearing her signature and labeled as affidavits \u201cwere signed in front of a notary * * * and sworn to verbally.\u201d (*Id.*, 8/1/17 Affidavit of Beverley Quinn.) Although that document itself appears to be in proper affidavit form, it does not correct the facial deficiencies of her prior filings. The newly proffered affidavit of Michael Simms is exactly the same \u201caffidavit\u201d he offered previously, but with this typewritten line added at the bottom: \u201cThis was sworn to on the above date. The signature was in my presence[.]\u201d (*Id.*, 8/1/17 Affidavit of Michael E. Simms.) No new date or notary seal appears, and the document bears no indicia that the additional sentences were added by or in the presence of an individual authorized to administer oaths. As such, it is not acceptable evidence.\n\n{\u00b6 41} Even if we were to overlook those deficiencies, the evidence described within those purported \u201caffidavits\u201d also would not qualify as \u201cnewly discovered.\u201d Although neither affidavit identifies the date on which the affiant claims to have seen evidence inside Beverley\u2019s car, those observations must have predated the car\u2019s destruction on March 19, 2014. (See *id.*, Exh. 4, Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office Tow Log.) Crim.R. 33 provides for the granting of a new trial on the basis of new evidence only where \u201cthe defendant could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced [that evidence] at the trial.\u201d Crim.R. 33(A)(6). Because Simms\u2019s proffered affidavit admits that\nQuinn\u2019s trial counsel knew prior to trial that Simms was a potential witness (see Trial Court Docket #77, Exh. 3), Simms\u2019s evidence is not \u201cnewly discovered\u201d for purposes of Crim.R. 33 relief.\n\n\u00b6 42 The same is true as to Beverley\u2019s knowledge of any exculpatory evidence contained within her car. Furthermore, Beverley\u2019s proffered affidavit on this issue suffers from the same infirmity found to undermine the credibility of earlier affidavits she offered in support of Quinn\u2019s previous motion for a new trial. See Quinn II, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2014-CA-95, 2016-Ohio-140, at \u00b6 21. Once again, because Beverley\u2019s latest affidavit offered as proof that Quinn was not her assailant directly contradicts her credible and well-corroborated trial testimony that her son indeed was the man who kidnapped and assaulted her, consideration of the relevant factors enumerated in Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 285, 714 N.E.2d 905, compels a conclusion that her current affidavit is not credible and does not warrant the granting of a new trial.\n\n\u00b6 43 Finally, to the extent that Quinn claims the destruction of Beverley\u2019s car deprived him of potentially exculpatory fingerprint evidence, we likewise conclude that the trial court did not err by failing to grant a new trial on that basis. The possibility that fingerprints of the alternative perpetrator Quinn proposes might have been left in the car is not \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence. See Crim.R. 33(A)(6). Additionally, because the presence of other fingerprints is merely a possibility, not a certainty, any fingerprint evidence would be \u201cpotentially useful,\u201d not \u201cmaterially exculpatory.\u201d See Cox, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25477, 2013-Ohio-4941, \u00b6 88. Accordingly, the State\u2019s destruction of any such evidence would constitute a violation only if done in bad faith. See id.\n\n\u00b6 44 The record before us would not support a finding that the State acted in bad\nfaith with respect to the destruction of Beverley's car. It appears that the car was \u201ccrushed\u201d at the instance of the towing company, not the State (see Trial Court Docket #77, Exh. 4), and that such action was taken only because Beverley failed to retrieve her vehicle from impound in a timely manner. (See id., Exh. 2 & Exh. 21 [5/4/16 Affidavit of Beverley Quinn].) Moreover, in light of Beverley\u2019s identification of her son as her assailant, the State reasonably could have concluded that gathering evidence from Beverley's car was unnecessary in order to prosecute the case. Given those circumstances, no bad faith can be imputed to the State. Quinn's inability to present any fingerprint evidence that might have been obtainable from the car is not valid grounds for a new trial under Crim.R. 33. Quinn\u2019s assignment of error based on the destruction of the car is overruled.\n\nc. Failure to inventory car contents/to provide access to car\n\n\u00b6 45 We reach a similar conclusion regarding Quinn\u2019s arguments as to the State\u2019s alleged failure to provide his trial counsel with an inventory of the car\u2019s contents or to provide his trial counsel access to that vehicle before it was destroyed. (See Assignment of Error #13.) Absent credible, cognizable evidence that the car contained evidence favorable to Quinn and that there is a reasonable probability that such evidence would have led to a different outcome, any omission by the State in those regards would not warrant a new trial. See Wade, 2d Dist. No. 06-CA-108, 2007-Ohio-6611, at \u00b6 12; Aldridge, 120 Ohio App.3d at 145, 697 N.E.2d 228. Quinn's challenge on that basis is not well taken. And, again, none of these arguments arises from newly discovered evidence.\n\n\u00b6 46 For the foregoing reasons, Quinn\u2019s second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, ninth and thirteenth assignments of error are overruled.\n\nAssignment of Error #8 \u2013 Potential Witness in Jury Pool\nIn his eighth assignment of error, Quinn contends that his rights to due process and a fair trial were violated because the law enforcement officer who prepared one of the reports allegedly not disclosed by the State during discovery was a member of the venire from which Quinn\u2019s jury was chosen. Specifically, Quinn asserts that Deputy Brian Melchi of the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office authored the \u201cOhio Uniform Incident Report\u201d related to the complaint that led to Beverley\u2019s abandoned car being towed (see Trial Court Docket #77, Exh. 1), and that Melchi also was in Quinn\u2019s jury pool.\n\nAs we noted above, Quinn did not produce an authenticated copy of the incident report at issue, and no cognizable evidence before us establishes that the State did not produce that report to Quinn\u2019s attorney, or when Quinn otherwise became aware of that document. Nevertheless, even assuming that Quinn was unavoidably prevented from discovering that Melchi had been involved in the towing of Beverley\u2019s car, Quinn has not demonstrated that Melchi\u2019s tangential involvement in the case combined with his presence in the jury pool denied Quinn due process or a fair trial.\n\nThe entirety of the proffered incident report\u2019s substantive content attributable to Deputy Melchi was as follows:\n\nOn [December 15, 2013], dispatch was advised of a vehicle parked at [address omitted], a white Hyundai Elantra, Ohio license plate [omitted]. This is the suspect vehicle from a domestic violence and abduction case from the Springfield Police Department. The owner of the vehicle is the victim in this case, however the suspect, her son Mr. Quinn was in possession of the vehicle. The vehicle was unoccupied at the time we\n\n---\n\n5 Melchi did not serve as a juror. See \u00b6 49, below.\narrived. A neighbor advised the vehicle had been there since last night. He further stated the driver of the vehicle stated it ran out of gas and he would return for it later. Springfield police advised they did not need the vehicle for anything at this time. Due to the way the vehicle was parked, which was part of the way in the roadway at the curve, it was towed due to being a traffic hazard. Maines Towing removed the vehicle from the scene, Tow #13-67777.\n\n(Trial Court Docket #77, Exh. 1, p. 2.) Accepted at face value, that report would show that Deputy Melchi had some knowledge of a reported domestic violence and abduction incident involving Quinn, Quinn\u2019s mother, and her car, but was not further involved in the investigation of that incident by a different law enforcement agency.\n\n\u00b6 50 The transcript of jury selection reflects the following:\n\n[ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR]: * * * Mr. Melchi, in my notes I gotta come back to you. You are a deputy Sheriff and have been in that position for a number of years now?\n\nJUROR #11: Fifteen.\n\n[ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR]: This case does not involve the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Have you had any discussions with anyone who is involved with this case about this case?\n\nJUROR #11: I'm not sure exactly which case it is. I am familiar with the defendant though.\n\n[ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR]: I'm not going to ask you anymore [sic] questions. * * *\nTHE COURT: Any challenge for cause?\n\n[ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR]: Pass for cause, Your Honor.\n\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We would pass for cause as well.\n\nTHE COURT: All right. Did you want to exercise a preemptory [sic] challenge?\n\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, We\u2019d like to excuse Juror #11.\n\nTHE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Melchi. You are excused.\n\nTrial courts are granted broad discretion in assessing the impact on jurors of \u201coutside influences\u201d and in crafting an appropriate remedy. State v. Cox, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24577, 2013-Ohio-4941, \u00b6 83, citing State v. Williams, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22126, 2008-Ohio-2069, and State v. Phillips, 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 656 N.E.2d 643 (1995). In Cox, a defendant convicted of sexual offenses against his minor stepdaughter argued that his jury pool was \u201cpoisoned\u201d when a potential juror indicated that she \u201chad seen the case covered on the local news\u201d and that she \u201c[o]bviously\u201d had formed opinions about the case. Id. at \u00b6 79. Noting that the potential juror\u2019s response was \u201cambiguous\u201d and unelaborated, and that she was excused from serving on the jury, we concluded that her comments did not \u201cpoison\u201d the jury. Id. at \u00b6 80.\n\nIn the same case, the defendant further contended that he was prejudiced due to a juror who had observed a spectator in the courtroom \u201cmouthing\u201d encouragement to the defendant and the same juror\u2019s \u201caccidental[ ] expos[ure] to information about the\ncase\" while out to dinner. *Id.* at \u00b6 81-82. After each incident, the court questioned the juror outside the presence of the other jurors and asked whether what she had heard or observed would affect her ability to be impartial. *Id.* When the juror said that the latter incident would prevent her from being fair and impartial, she was excused. *Id.* at \u00b6 82. Under those circumstances, this court saw \u201cno basis to find that these incidents affected [the defendant\u2019s] right to a fair trial or that he suffered prejudice as a result.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 83.\n\n{\u00b6 53} The case now before us presents a more benign example of \u201coutside influences\u201d on a jury pool. As soon as Deputy Melchi indicated that he was \u201cfamiliar\u201d with Quinn, the assistant prosecutor conducting jury selection on behalf of the State immediately ceased questioning him further about his knowledge of Quinn or this case. As a result, no information, ambiguous or otherwise, emerged that possibly could have contaminated the jury pool. Moreover, because Deputy Melchi was excused based on defense counsel\u2019s peremptory challenge, he never was seated on the jury at all, unlike the juror in *Cox*.\n\n{\u00b6 54} Although Quinn suggests that he was prejudiced because he was forced to use a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective juror who should have been removed for cause, we previously determined that Quinn failed to establish that Melchi should have been removed for cause. See *Quinn III*, 2017-Ohio-7000, 95 N.E.3d 664, \u00b6 17-18. Further argument regarding that issue thus is barred by res judicata. Moreover, nothing has been newly discovered, and there is no indication that Quinn was prejudiced by Deputy Melchi\u2019s brief presence and innocuous comments as part of the jury pool, Quinn\u2019s assignment of error on that basis is overruled.\n\n**Assignment of Error #9 \u2013 Denial of Evidence to Impeach Officer**\n\u00b6 55 In another assignment of error arising from the destruction of Beverley's car prior to his trial, Quinn claims that the State's failure to disclose documentation that the car had been destroyed deprived him of information that could have been used to impeach a law enforcement officer who testified that \u201caccess\u201d to Beverley's vehicle \u201cshould be\u201d available. A new trial is not warranted on the basis of that contention.\n\n\u00b6 56 The witness at issue is Springfield Police Officer Paul R. Herald, Jr., who was the first officer to respond to the report that Beverley had been assaulted. (See Tr. Vol. I, pp. 113-114.) On cross-examination, Quinn's trial attorney asked whether law enforcement officers \u201cwould have access to [Beverley's] vehicle\u201d in order to search for evidence such as loose hair pulled from Beverley's head, consistent with her report. (Id. at pp. 136-137.) When Officer Herald responded that \u201c[t]here should be access to it,\u201d Quinn's counsel moved to a different line of questioning. (Id. at p. 137.)\n\n\u00b6 57 The record does not support Quinn's suggestion that he would have been better positioned to impeach Officer Herald's testimony if Quinn had been aware of the car's destruction. Read in context, the question about access to Beverley's vehicle apparently was intended to illustrate that police had presented no evidence to corroborate Beverley's version of events, despite their ability to search one place where such evidence might have been found. Earlier in his cross-examination, Officer Herald shared the following exchange with Quinn's trial counsel:\n\nQ. Was the vehicle ever impounded?\nA. Not to my knowledge. I don't know.\n\nQ. Did you ever try to seek out that vehicle?\nA. No, sir. I was handling mainly the victim and the crime scene area and\nthe charges.\n\nQ. If the vehicle was impounded, you would have access to that vehicle if you wanted to search it for evidence?\n\nA. Once I filed the charge, the paperwork goes to the detective bureau and they would probably have access.\n\nQ. Okay. Do you know whether or not the detectives ever looked into that vehicle?\n\nA. No sir, I do not.\n\n(Tr. Vol. I, p. 136.)\n\n{\u00b6 58} Because Officer Herald said that he did not know whether Beverley's car had been impounded or searched, and that detectives, not he, would be the law enforcement representatives likely to have access to that vehicle, no credibility issue can be inferred from his testimony that the car \u201cshould be\u201d accessible. Accordingly, information showing that the car had been destroyed \u201c5 days prior to trial\u201d would not have enhanced Quinn's ability to impeach Officer Herald's testimony. Contrary to Quinn's assertion that revelation of the car's destruction \u201cwould have resulted in a mistrial,\u201d the record discloses no error in that regard.\n\n{\u00b6 59} For that reason and other previously stated reasons, including Quinn's reliance on unauthenticated documents, the lack of newly-discovered cognizable evidence regarding the alleged non-disclosure of those documents, and the possible res judicata effect of Quinn's failure to raise this argument in his prior motion for a new trial, his ninth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nAssignment of Error #10 \u2013 Denial of Evidence to Impeach Beverley\nQuinn\u2019s tenth assignment of error asserts that the State\u2019s failure to disclose a report from the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Department about Beverley\u2019s assault and abduction impeded Quinn\u2019s ability to impeach Beverley\u2019s trial testimony. Based on a hospital record\u2019s notation that a \u201cSheriff deputy\u201d was \u201ctaking [a] report from\u201d Beverley in the emergency room on December 14, 2013 (see Trial Court Docket #77, Exh. 10), Quinn argues that the State withheld a report that could have been used to show that Beverley told the deputy \u201cthat she was not sure who assaulted her.\u201d The record does not support that argument.\n\nAs an initial matter, Quinn again has failed to present cognizable evidence to show that the State withheld any requested document of which it was aware. Indeed, in this particular instance, Quinn has not even established that the alleged \u201creport\u201d in fact exists. The only indication that a report was taken by the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Department appears within an unauthenticated document that is not cognizable evidence. Moreover, even that document states that Beverley \u201creport[ed] that her son was hitting her with his hand, pulling, grabbing her anywhere he could, including her hair while she was in the car.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (Id.) Thus, the very document on which Quinn relies as support for the existence of an undisclosed \u201creport\u201d suggests that such report would be consistent with, not contradictory to, Beverley\u2019s trial testimony that Quinn was her assailant. A document with that content would have no impeachment value.\n\nAlthough Quinn cites to another \u201caffidavit\u201d from Beverley for the proposition that she told a Clark County Sheriff\u2019s deputy \u201cthat she was not sure who assaulted her,\u201d that argument, too, suffers from significant flaws. The \u201caffidavit\u201d Quinn advances is not in proper evidentiary form (see Trial Court Docket #77, Exh. 9, 5/4/16 Affidavit of Beverley\nQuinn), and Beverley's claims as to what she stated to the deputy at the hospital did not qualify as \u201cnewly discovered.\u201d Moreover, we previously determined that Beverley\u2019s post-trial attempts to refute her trial testimony were not credible, rendering that issue res judicata. See Quinn II, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2014-CA-95, 2016-Ohio-140, \u00b6 20-22. For all those reasons, Quinn\u2019s tenth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nAssignment of Error #11 \u2013 New Evidence of Bridge Closure\n\n\u00b6 63 Quinn next argues that he was denied due process when the State failed to disclose that the bridge from which Quinn allegedly threatened to throw his mother was closed at the time the offense occurred, and when the trial court denied his motion for a new trial based on evidence of the bridge\u2019s closure. In support of his new trial motion, Quinn presented the trial court with a sworn but not notarized statement signed by his mother, stating that the Clark County Engineer told Beverley that the Tremont City Road bridge6 \u201cwas closed due to being unsafe\u201d on an unspecified date in 2013 before being \u201cdeemed safe for travel\u201d in June 2015. (See Trial Court Docket #77, Exh. 11.) Quinn also presented the affidavit of Jason Egan, who attested that he \u201cknew that [Tremont City Road] bridge was closed and had obstructions that made it not possible to go onto the bridge.\u201d (Id., Exh. 12, Affidavit of Jason Egan.) Those documents do not demonstrate that the trial court erred in denying Quinn a new trial.\n\n\u00b6 64 Evidence that the subject bridge was closed throughout 2014 would have been available at the time of trial, and Quinn has not demonstrated that he was \u201cunavoidably prevented\u201d from discovering that evidence at that time. Additionally, Quinn\n\n---\n\n6 During her trial testimony, Beverley did not use the name \u201cTremont City Road bridge,\u201d but she did testify that Quinn drove her \u201cdown #334\u201d and turned left to a bridge, which she later determined was \u201cvery close to Tremont City.\u201d (Tr. Vol. I, pp. 193, 195).\nis barred by res judicata from raising an argument that could have been but apparently was not presented in his initial motion for a new trial. Beverley's unsworn statement based on hearsay is not cognizable evidence of the subject bridge's closure, and Egan's affidavit specifies neither the basis for his alleged knowledge about the bridge nor the dates when that bridge supposedly was closed. (See id.) Furthermore, no foundation exists for Egan's opinion that \u201cthe chances of [Quinn's] taking someone to a closed and barricaded bridge is slim to none.\u201d (Id.) Quinn's eleventh assignment of error is overruled.\n\n**Assignment of Error #12 \u2013 Undisclosed Drug Test Results**\n\n{\u00b6 65} Quinn claims in his twelfth assignment of error that he was prejudiced by the State\u2019s failure to disclose to his trial counsel that Quinn had tested positive for opiates at the county jail. Quinn suggests that he could have presented \u201ca more complete alternative perpetrator defense\u201d had he known of the positive test result he could use as evidence \u201cthat Samantha [Ferrell] * * * put heroin in his drink the night of the incidents in question,\u201d so that Ferrell could \u201crent [Beverley's] car out for drugs, and have Beverley killed or robbed.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6 66} To support the plausibility of that defense, Quinn offered Beverley's \u201caffidavit\u201d stating that on \u201c12/13,\u201d she \u201cwalked in on Samantha injecting something into Jim's vodka,\u201d causing Ferrell to threaten to \u201cget her boyfriend to kill\u201d Beverley. (See Trial\n\n---\n\n7 Egan's affidavit also provides no information about his relationship to this case; the State's opposing brief indicates that Egan is a fellow inmate of Quinn's at the London Correctional Institution.\n\n8 Quinn's brief also asserts that the State did share his positive drug test results with Quinn's family, \u201cturning [his] family against him,\u201d but offers no argument as to why that alleged conduct would warrant a new trial.\n\n9 The date thus referenced is unclear. (See Trial Court Docket #77, Exh. 2, 1/29/15 \u201cAffidavit\u201d of Beverley Quinn).\nCourt Docket #77, Exh. 2, 1/29/15 Affidavit of Beverley Quinn.) That document then posits that the man who later abducted Beverley \u201cmust have been Samantha's boyfriend.\u201d (Id.) In addition, Quinn presented Simms's \u201caffidavit\u201d stating that he witnessed \u201cFerrell and a man putting gas in Beverley's white station wagon\u201d and that Ferrell told him \u201c[s]he was getting drugs for renting this man Beverley's car.\u201d (Id., Exh. 3.) That document further avers that Simms later saw \u201ca letter on the inside of [Beverley's] car under the windshield that was thanking Samantha for renting the car to\u201d the man Simms witnessed with Ferrell earlier. (Id.) Finally, Quinn attached what purports to be a copy of a Ohio State Highway Patrol Report of Investigation dated September 10, 2013, related to an \u201cUnauthorized Use\u201d charge against a man for driving a \u201cwhite station wagon type vehicle\u201d that had been reported to the Springfield City Police Department as stolen. (Id., Exh. 13.)\n\n\u00b6 67 Once again, Quinn has presented no competent evidence to support his argument. No evidence before us corroborates Quinn\u2019s claim to have tested positive for opiates. In addition, neither Beverley\u2019s nor Simms\u2019s purported affidavit is in proper evidentiary form. The Ohio State Highway Patrol Report has not been authenticated, and also does not establish that the car in question belonged to Beverley, that the man arrested had \u201crented\u201d the car from Ferrell or was the same man allegedly seen with Ferrell on the date of Beverley's assault and abduction, or that use of the car was being exchanged for drugs. In addition, Quinn has presented no evidence to show that he personally was unaware that he had tested positive for opiates, or that the State failed to provide that information to his trial attorney.\n\n\u00b6 68 Beyond those evidentiary deficiencies, Quinn also has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that, had evidence of his positive test for opiates been disclosed\nto the defense, \u201cthe result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d See Aldridge, 120 Ohio App.3d at 145, 697 N.E.2d 228. To find that evidence of Quinn's opiate use created reasonable doubt that Quinn was responsible for the crimes against Beverley would require a jury not only to make a series of inferences not supported by cognizable evidence, but also to disregard Beverley's sworn trial testimony that her son was her assailant. Quinn's twelfth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nAssignment of Error #14 \u2013 Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n\u00b6 69 Quinn's fourteenth assignment of error asserts that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel due to his trial attorney's failure to investigate Beverley's home and car and the bridge, as well as his failure to interview potential defense witnesses Simms and Mark Rafferty. That assertion is not well taken.\n\n\u00b6 70 To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must demonstrate both that trial counsel's conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that the errors were serious enough to create a reasonable probability that, but for the errors, the outcome of the case would have been different. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 142, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989). Trial counsel is entitled to a strong presumption that his or her conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable assistance. Strickland at 688. A defendant is entitled to \u201creasonable competence\u201d from his or her attorney, not \u201cperfect advocacy.\u201d See Maryland v. Kulbicki, __ U.S. __, 136 S.Ct. 2, 5 (2015), citing Yarborough v. Gentry, 540 U.S. 1, 8, 124 S.Ct. 1, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003).\n\u00b6 71 \u201cStrickland and its progeny establish that when a court is presented with an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, it should look to the full record presented by the defendant to determine whether the defendant satisfied his [or her] burden to prove deficient performance.\u201d Reeves v. Alabama, __ U.S. __, 138 S.Ct. 22, 26, 199 L.Ed.2d 341 (2017). Hindsight is not permitted to distort the assessment of what was reasonable in light of counsel\u2019s perspective at the time, and a debatable decision concerning trial strategy cannot form the basis of a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Cook, 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 524-525, 605 N.E.2d 70 (1992); State v. Fields, 2017-Ohio-400, 84 N.E.3d 193, \u00b6 38 (2d Dist.).\n\n\u00b6 72 Nothing in the record supports Quinn\u2019s contention that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Quinn has presented no affidavit or other cognizable evidence to substantiate his claim that his attorney failed to look into the matters about which Quinn now complains. Furthermore, having concluded above that Quinn failed to demonstrate that Beverley\u2019s car in fact contained evidence that would have materially assisted his defense, we cannot conclude that his trial attorney provided deficient representation by failing to search that car for evidence that may not have existed. See Strickland at 688.\n\n\u00b6 73 Neither has Quinn demonstrated a reasonable probability that any evidence obtainable from Beverley\u2019s home would have led to a different outcome at trial. Quinn contends that a visit to the house \u201cwould have revealed that the door [to Beverley\u2019s bedroom] had been broken down,\u201d despite Beverley\u2019s trial testimony that \u201cthere are little things you can use to get in the door.\u201d (See Tr. Vol. I, p. 183.) However, evidence that Quinn knew how to access Beverley\u2019s bedroom without breaking down the door as her\nassailant did is not reasonably likely to have overcome Beverley\u2019s unequivocal testimony that it was Quinn who took her from her bedroom and to the bridge. Additionally, especially absent cognizable evidence that the bridge in fact was closed and could not have been accessed in the way to which Beverley testified, we cannot begin to conclude that Quinn\u2019s trial counsel performed deficiently by allegedly failing to explore the bridge\u2019s accessibility on the night in question.\n\n\u00b6 74 Neither has Quinn shown that his trial attorney performed deficiently by failing to interview potential witnesses Simms and Rafferty. Although Quinn\u2019s counsel apparently was aware of Simms\u2019s availability as a potential witnesses, that attorney is entitled to \u201ca strong presumption\u201d that he acted reasonably in choosing not to call Simms to testify. See Strickland at 688. Only Simms\u2019s non-cognizable \u201caffidavit\u201d is offered to show that Quinn\u2019s trial attorney never interviewed him. (See Trial Court Docket #77, Exh. 3.) Based on the record, we are unable to conclude that the testimony Simms now proposes to have been able to offer on Quinn\u2019s behalf (see id.) was reasonably probable to convince the jury that Beverley was mistaken in identifying her son as her assailant.\n\n\u00b6 75 Similarly, only the purported \u201caffidavit\u201d of Mark Rafferty suggests that Quinn\u2019s attorney was aware that Rafferty was a potential witness, and that document is not competent evidence. (See id., Exh. 15.) While Rafferty therein claims to have seen Quinn asleep in Rafferty\u2019s home \u201cwith a stench of alcohol coming from him\u201d on \u201cthe morning *** Quinn was to have committed these crimes,\u201d that document is not cognizable evidence that Rafferty could have provided an alibi for Quinn on the night at issue in this case. And even were we to determine that Rafferty\u2019s supplemental affidavit offered later were cognizable evidence (see Trial Court Docket #89, 8/3/17 Affidavit of Mark Rafferty),\nwe once again are unable to conclude that testimony from one of Quinn\u2019s close friends contradicting the identification testimony of Quinn\u2019s own mother is newly discovered evidence or would have created a reasonable probability of a different outcome. See Strickland at 688. Accordingly, the record does not support a conclusion that Quinn\u2019s trial attorney performed deficiently by failing to call Rafferty and Simms as witnesses, and Quinn\u2019s fourteenth assignment of error is overruled in its entirety.\n\nConclusion\n\n\u00b6 76 The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n\nDONOVAN, J. and HALL, J., concur.\n\nCopies sent to:\n\nAndrew P.

Votel, Preble County Prosecuting Attorney, Kathryn M. West, 101 East Main Street, Courthouse, First Floor, Eaton, Ohio 45320, for appellee\n\nLarry E. Brown II, #A736518, London Correctional Institution, 1580 State Route 56, SW London, Ohio 43140, pro se\n\nRINGLAND, J.\n\n\u00b6 1 Appellant, Larry Brown, appeals the decision of the Preble County Court of Common Pleas dismissing his successive petition for postconviction relief and denying his motion for a new trial. For the reasons detailed below, we affirm.\n\n\u00b6 2 In 2015, the Preble County Grand Jury indicted Brown on two counts of gross sexual imposition, and one count each of rape of a person less than 13 years of age, sexual\nbattery, and importuning. The charges stemmed from allegations made by B.H., who alleged that Brown had kissed her, forced her to masturbate him, and forced her to perform fellatio on him when she was 11 and 12 years old. According to B.H., Brown's sexual abuse occurred at a farm owned by a family friend when she and Brown would be there working for the farm's owner. B.H. recorded some of her thoughts about the sexual abuse in a journal, which was later found and read by her mother. B.H. also told her mother and grandmother about the sexual abuse after it occurred.\n\n{\u00b6 3} The case proceeded to a bench trial and the court found Brown guilty on all charges. The trial court merged the rape count with the remainder of the charges and sentenced Brown to a term of ten years to life in prison. This court affirmed Brown's conviction on direct appeal. State v. Brown, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2016-07-006, 2017-Ohio-4231.\n\n{\u00b6 4} Brown subsequently filed a petition for postconviction relief, which the trial court denied without an evidentiary hearing. This court affirmed that decision and the Ohio Supreme Court declined review. State v. Brown, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2017-09-010, 2018-Ohio-3338; State v. Brown, 154 Ohio St.3d 1464, 2018-Ohio-5209.\n\n{\u00b6 5} The instant matter concerns Brown's motion for a new trial and successive petition for postconviction relief. The trial court dismissed Brown's successive petition for postconviction relief and denied his motion for a new trial in a written judgment entry. Brown now appeals, raising fourteen assignments of error for review.\n\nA. Successive PCR\n\n{\u00b6 6} Assignment of Error No. 1:\n\n{\u00b6 7} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AFTER THE APPELLANT SHOWED HE WAS UNAVOIDABLY PREVENTED FROM THE DISCOVERY OF THE FACT THAT THE ALLEGED VICTIM SUFFERED\nFROM HALLUCINATIONS AS WELL AS A PLETHORA OF OTHER RELATED MENTAL ILLNESSES. THE FACT THAT THE APPELLANT'S ATTORNEY HAD ACCESS TO THIS AND FAILED TO INVESTIGATE IT IS INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.\n\n{\u00b6 8} Assignment of Error No. 2:\n\n{\u00b6 9} THE STATE DID PROVIDE A BILL OF PARTICULARS THAT WAS DEFECTIVE, AND NOT NOTICED BY THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY. THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF DEFENSE COUNSEL'S DISREGARD AND IRRESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS CLIENT IN THIS CASE. THERE WERE NO TIME BRACKETS PROVIDED ON THE BILL OF PARTICULARS.\n\n{\u00b6 10} Assignment of Error No. 3:\n\n{\u00b6 11} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW WHEN IT FAILED TO REFERENCE THE TRANSCRIPTS AND FILINGS FROM THE DEFENDANTS [sic] TRIAL, AND WHEN THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO MAKE FINDINGS ACCORDING TO LAW TO DENY THE DEFENDANT'S POST-CONVICTION PETITION. THIS IS ALSO AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION. THIS SHOWS ACTUAL INNOCENCE AND IS THEREFORE PRECLUDED FROM ANY PROCEDURAL DEFAULT. THIS ALSO SHOWS INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL AND APPELLATE COUNSEL.\n\n{\u00b6 12} In his first set of assignments of error, Brown argues the trial court erred by dismissing his successive petition for postconviction relief.\u00b9 A petition for postconviction relief \"shall be filed no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the date on which the trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals in the direct appeal of the judgment of conviction\" challenged by the petition. R.C. 2953.21(A)(2). A trial court lacks authority to\n\n---\n\n\u00b9. For some reason, Brown renumbered his assignments of error with respect to his motion for a new trial and petition for postconviction relief. For purposes of addressing each assignment of error listed, we have done the same.\ngrant an untimely or successive petition unless one of two statutory exceptions applies. R.C. 2953.23(A); State v. Parker, 157 Ohio St.3d 460, 2019-Ohio-3848, \u00b6 19; State v. Apanovitch, 155 Ohio St.3d 358, 2018-Ohio-4744, \u00b6 36.\n\n{\u00b6 13} The only exception potentially applicable in this case is provided by R.C. 2953.23(A)(1), which permits the trial court to entertain an untimely or successive petition for postconviction relief if: (1) the applicant was unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts necessary to assert his claim for relief, or (2) he is invoking a new federal or state right recognized by the United States Supreme Court that is retroactively applicable to persons similarly situated. R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a); State v. Kent, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2013-05-003, 2013-Ohio-5090, \u00b6 12.\n\n{\u00b6 14} In the present case, the trial court found that neither exception contained in R.C. 2953.23(A) was applicable and therefore dismissed Brown's petition for postconviction relief. Since Brown does not invoke any new federal or state right, our analysis focuses on whether Brown was \"unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts necessary to assert his claim for relief.\" Following review, we find that Brown was not unavoidably prevented from the facts.\n\n{\u00b6 15} First, Brown argues he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel did not use alleged evidence of the victim's mental illnesses at trial. However, Brown acknowledges that both he and his trial counsel were aware of the evidence at the time of trial. The decision to question the victim on any alleged mental illness is plainly a matter of trial strategy. Brown cannot claim he was unavoidably prevented from the discovery of this information.\n\n{\u00b6 16} Next, Brown claims the state provided him with a defective bill of particulars. However, this argument is also plainly barred by res judicata, as it could have been presented in his direct appeal. \"Res judicata bars a petitioner from 're-packaging' evidence\nor issues that either were or could have been raised in trial or on direct appeal.\u201d State v. Casey, 12th Dist. Clinton No. CA2017-08-013, 2018-Ohio-2084, \u00b6 15, citing State v. Rose, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-03-050, 2012-Ohio-5957, \u00b6 20. In addition to being res judicata, Brown cannot show that he was unavoidably prevented from the discovery of the purportedly defective bill of particulars.\n\n\u00b6 17 Finally, Brown alleges the trial court erred by failing to reference the transcripts and filings from trial and by failing to make findings of fact. However, the trial court is not required to specifically reference the record. See, e.g., State v. Clay, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 17 MA 0113, 2018-Ohio-985, \u00b6 9 (\u201ca trial court need not issue findings of fact and conclusions of law when it dismisses an untimely [postconviction relief] petition.\u201d) Additionally, we fail to see how this constitutes evidence that Brown was unavoidably prevented from discovering.\n\n\u00b6 18 Since the trial court did not err by dismissing Brown's successive petition for postconviction relief, we overrule Brown's three assignments of error related to that petition.\n\nB. Motion for a New Trial\n\n\u00b6 19 Assignment of Error No. 1:\n\n\u00b6 20 THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO GRANT LEAVE TO THE APPELLANT TO FILE A MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL. THIS WAS AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION. THE COURT RESPONDED TO SOME OF THE ISSUES WHICH LEAVES NO ROOM TO BAR ANY ISSUE.\n\n\u00b6 21 Assignment of Error No. 2:\n\n\u00b6 22 DETECTIVE SCHNEIDER FALSIFIED A POLICE REPORT AND AFFIDAVIT THAT WAS MATERIAL TO THE DEFENDANT AND VIOLATED DUE PROCESS, THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL, AND COMPULSORY PROCESS. THE STATE INTERFERED WITH THE DEFENDANT'S RIGHTS WHICH IMPEDED HIS DEFENSE, REQUIRING\nAUTOMATIC REVERSAL. THIS CONTRARY TO THE DICTATES OF CRIMINAL RULE 17(D). (sic)\n\n{\u00b6 23} Assignment of Error No. 3:\n\n{\u00b6 24} THE PROSECUTOR REPRESENTED THAT A REPORT WAS TRUE AND ADMISSIBLE WHEN IT WAS NOT. THIS DENIED THE DEFENDANT DUE PROCESS AND THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL, AND ALSO DENIED HIM FAIR AND EQUAL PROTECTIONS OF THE LAW.\n\n{\u00b6 25} Assignment of Error No. 4:\n\n{\u00b6 26} COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE FOR ALLOWING A FALSE REPORT TO BE USED TO LEVERAGE A LEGAL PROCEEDING, WHEN THE RESULTS OF THAT LEGAL PROCEEDING WAS [sic] UNFAVORABLE TO HIS CLIENT. THIS IS A VIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS, AND VIOLATED THE DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.\n\n{\u00b6 27} Assignment of Error No. 5:\n\n{\u00b6 28} THE TRIAL COURT ISSUED A RULING THAT WAS NOT MADE ACCORDING TO THE LAW. THE TRIAL COURT HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE VALIDITY OF SAID REPORTS BEFORE ISSUING A RULING THAT BASICALLY DENIED THE DEFENDANT OF ANY MEANINGFUL DEFENSE. THE COURT WAS AWARE OF THE REPORTS AND THAT THE REPORTS DID NOT RESULT IN THE INDICTMENT OF THE DEFENDANT.\n\n{\u00b6 29} Assignment of Error No. 6:\n\n{\u00b6 30} THE DEFENDANT WAS PREJUDICED BY THE FACT THAT THE TRIAL COURT RULED ON 404(B) EVIDENCE THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN FALSE. THAT CARRIED EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT THE TRIAL COURT WOULD HARBOR ILL WILL AGAINST THE DEFENDANT IN A BENCH TRIAL.\nAssignment of Error No. 7:\n\nTHE STATE FAILED TO DISCLOSE A CSD (CHILDREN'S SERVICES)/LAW ENFORCEMENT REPORT THAT WAS PRECIPITATED BY THE ALLEGED VICTIM OF THE CRIMES FOR WHICH THE DEFENDANT IS INCARCERATED. THE REPORT WAS DERIVED FROM A CSD INTERVIEW OF THE ALLEGED VICTIM. THE PROSECUTION GAINED A TACTICAL ADVANTAGE IN THE FACT THE DEFENSE COULD NOT REFUTE ANYTHING THE PROSECUTION PUT FORWARD.\n\nAssignment of Error No. 8:\n\nDEFENSE COUNSEL FAILED TO MAKE THE DEFENDANT AWARE OF A PLEA AGREEMENT THAT THE STATE OFFERED COMPROMISING THE DEFENDANT. THIS IS INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.\n\nAssignment of Error No. 9:\n\nDEAN MILLER, AN INVESTIGATOR AND WITNESS IN THE CASE OF LARRY BROWN DELIVERED A SUBPOENA TO MISSY MCCOOL AND A CONVERSATION ENSUED. THAT REPORT WAS NOT DISCLOSED. THIS VIOLATED THE DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO HAVE ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT REPORT DISCLOSED TO HIM PER CRIMINAL RULE 16. THIS IS A VIOLATION OF THE DEFENDANT'S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS AND HIS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. THE NEW EVIDENCE DEPENDED UPON BY THE DEFENDANT IS THE FACT THAT IT WAS JUST DISCOVERED THAT DEAN AND KENNETH MILLER ARE ONE IN THE SAME. CRIMINAL RULE 17(D) WAS THEREFORE VIOLATED. (sic)\n\nAssignment of Error No. 10:\n\nTHE DEFENSE WAS PREJUDICED BY THE FACT THAT TWO INVESTIGATORS AND WITNESSES FOR THE STATE WERE PERMITTED TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE CERTIFIED VOICE STRESS ANALYSIS TEST. A CHARGE\nBEING LEVIED AGAINST THE DEFENDANT'S ACCUSER WOULD HAVE PROVIDED A MEANS TO EXONERATE THE DEFENDANT. THIS A VIOLATION OF THE DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS. (sic)\n\n{\u00b6 39} Assignment of Error No. 11:\n\n{\u00b6 40} THE STATE COMMITTED PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT IN SUGGESTING THAT BARIUM POISONING COULD HAPPEN WITH CERTAIN MEDICAL PROCEDURES AND THROUGH CERTAIN TRADES SUCH AS WELDING, WHEN IN FACT THERE WAS NO BASIS FOR THAT FALSITY. THEREFORE, FALSE EVIDENCE WAS PRESENTED BY THE STATE.\n\n{\u00b6 41} In his second set of assignments of error, Brown argues the trial court erred by denying his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. For ease of discussion, we will address Brown's arguments out of order.\n\n{\u00b6 42} A defendant may be granted a new trial \"[w]here new evidence material to the defense is discovered which the defendant could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial.\" Crim. R. 33(A)(6). When a motion for a new trial is based on newly-discovered evidence, the defendant must produce affidavits of the witnesses from whom such evidence is expected to be provided that inform the trial court of the substance of the evidence that would be presented if a new trial were to be granted. State v. Holmes, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 05CA008711, 2006-Ohio-1310, \u00b6 13.\n\n{\u00b6 43} To warrant the granting of a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, the new evidence must disclose a \"strong probability\" that it will change the result if a new trial is granted. State v. Barton, Warren No. CA2005-03-036, 2007-Ohio-1099, \u00b6 31. The decision as to whether or not to grant a new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence rests within the trial court's discretion, and the trial court's decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Thornton, 12th Dist. Clermont No.\nBrown's appellate brief raises a litany of intersecting and confusing claims alleging various improprieties in the handling of the investigation, the trial, and his own counsel's effectiveness. At the very center is Brown's allegation that he was previously accused of sexual abuse, but the alleged victim of that abuse later recanted. Brown maintains that the allegations of prior acts of sexual abuse were false, but, as a result of the prior allegation, Brown claims that the state turned character witnesses against him and further prejudiced him in a variety of ways.\n\nIn his first assignment of error, Brown alleges the trial court improperly denied his motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial. In so doing, Brown makes the blanket assertion that the trial court may have been biased and only made \"a very cursory and incomplete review\" of the record. However, contrary to Brown's argument, the trial court did address his claims by concluding that he failed to produce any new evidence to support his claims and he was not unavoidably prevented from timely discovering the evidence at issue. Moreover, we decline to engage in Brown's speculation that the trial court was biased or only provided a cursory review of the record. Brown's first assignment of error is overruled.\n\nBrown's second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error appear to be interrelated. Once again, these assignments of error involve the past allegation of sexual abuse, which he maintains was false. Brown alleges that a detective \"falsified\" a police report when referencing the prior allegation of sexual abuse. Brown claims that this false allegation prevented character witnesses from being called on his behalf at trial. Brown\n\n---\n\n2. Brown also improperly claims that certain law enforcement officials should not have been permitted to serve subpoenas, as they were parties to the case. However, contrary to Brown's argument, none were parties to the case.\nblames the detective, the state, the trial court, and his own trial counsel for not being able to present character witnesses. The trial court found that none of these arguments raised by Brown were new and did not support a finding that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence at issue. As noted by the trial court, Brown's allegations are simply not relevant because the decision not to call witnesses was a strategic decision made at trial. For those reasons, and the fact that Brown could have raised these issues in his initial appeal and are therefore res judicata, we agree with the trial court. Brown's second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth assignments of error related to his motion for a new trial are overruled.\n\n\u00b6 47 In his seventh and ninth assignments of error, Brown raises a litany of arguments regarding the investigative process and information that he claims was wrongly denied him. Brown's claims rely on speculation and conjecture regarding the existence of reports that were allegedly denied to him. For example, Brown highlights an incident report wherein a detective mentions that he \"will schedule an interview with [Brown] once I receive a report from CSD.\" Brown then points out that he was interviewed and therefore by his logic \"[t]he interview happened, so where is the report?\"\n\n\u00b6 48 We decline to entertain Brown's speculation. From the record, we cannot discern the existence of any report that was improperly denied him that would support his arguments for a new trial. Brown has raised similar arguments in his direct appeal and in his first petition for postconviction relief. However, Brown presents this court with no newly discovered evidence that remotely supports his claim, much less the type of evidence that presents a \"strong probability\" of reversal. Accordingly, Brown's seventh and ninth assignments of error are overruled.\n\n\u00b6 49 In his eighth assignment of error, Brown claims that his attorney did not advise him of a plea offer. The state denies Brown's claim that he was not advised but notes that Brown failed to suggest that he would have accepted the plea. We agree with the state, as\nBrown failed to allege that he would have accepted the plea and therefore his argument does not succeed under the test of *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052(1984). *State v. Hicks*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2002-08-198, 2003-Ohio-7210, \u00b6 15. Brown's eighth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n{\u00b6 50} In his tenth and eleventh assignments of error, Brown once again argues that he suffered from Barium poisoning and claims the state committed prosecutorial misconduct and denied him due process of law. We have previously addressed similar arguments with respect to alleged Barium poisoning in the context of Brown's claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. *Brown*, 2018-Ohio-3338 at \u00b6 26. Once again, res judicata bars a petitioner from \"re-packaging\" evidence or issues that either were or could have been raised. *Casey*, 2018-Ohio-2084 at \u00b6 15. Furthermore, his claims in this appeal do not constitute newly discovered evidence. Brown's tenth and eleventh assignments of error are overruled.\n\n{\u00b6 51} Having reviewed the record, Brown is not entitled to postconviction relief or a new trial.\n\n{\u00b6 52} Judgment affirmed.\n\nHENDRICKSON, P.J., and PIPER, J., concur."}

This Court affirms.\n\nI.\n\n{\u00b62} In the early morning of December 15, 2011, Mr. Spaulding shot and paralyzed Patrick Griffin while he was leaving a house on Grant Street. Merely hours later, Mr. Spaulding shot and killed both Erica Singleton and Ernie Thomas outside of the same house. Mr. Spaulding was arrested the following day. After a jury trial, Mr. Spaulding was convicted of two counts of aggravated murder with course of conduct death specifications, attempted murder, and a multitude of other charges. After a mitigation hearing, the jury recommended a sentence of death, which was accepted by the trial court. The court sentenced Mr. Spaulding to death along with 32 and one-half years in prison. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed Mr. Spaulding\u2019s\nconvictions and sentence. *State v. Spaulding*, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, \u00b6 230. Mr. Spaulding filed a petition for post-conviction relief in the trial court citing ten grounds for relief, an amended petition containing an additional 25 grounds for relief, and a separate motion for testing and related discovery, which were denied by the trial court.\n\n\u00b63 Mr. Spaulding now appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition for post-conviction relief and motion for testing and related discovery and raises four assignments of error for this Court\u2019s review.\n\n\u00b64 For ease of analysis, we reorganize Mr. Spaulding\u2019s assignments of error.\n\nII.\n\n**Post-Conviction Relief**\n\n\u00b65 \u201cA post[-]conviction proceeding is a collateral civil attack on a criminal conviction.\u201d *State v.

Gondor*, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, \u00b6 51.\n\n{\u00b67} In reviewing a petition for post-conviction relief, \u201ca trial court should give due deference to affidavits sworn to under oath and filed in support of the petition, but may, in the sound exercise of discretion, judge the credibility of the affidavits in determining whether to accept the affidavits as true statements of fact.\u201d *Calhoun* at 284. When assessing the credibility of supporting affidavits in post-conviction relief proceedings, the trial court shall consider all relevant factors, including:\n\n(1) whether the judge reviewing the post[-]conviction relief petition also presided at the trial, (2) whether multiple affidavits contain nearly identical language, or otherwise appear to have been drafted by the same person, (3) whether the affidavits contain or rely on hearsay, (4) whether the affiants are relatives of the petitioner, or otherwise interested in the success of the petitioner\u2019s efforts, and (5) whether the affidavits contradict evidence proffered by the defense at trial.\n\n*Id.* at 285. A trial court properly denies a petition for post-conviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing where the petition, the supporting affidavits, the documentary evidence, the files, and the records do not demonstrate that the petitioner set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief. *Id.* at 291. \u201cIf the court does not find grounds for granting relief, it shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall enter judgment denying relief on the petition.\u201d Former R.C. 2953.21(G).\n\n{\u00b68} \u201cGenerally, this Court reviews a trial court\u2019s denial of a post-conviction relief petition for an abuse of discretion.\u201d *State v. Childs*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 25448, 2011-Ohio-913, \u00b6 9. Our review of a denial of a petition for post-conviction relief without a hearing is two-fold: First, we \u201creview the trial court\u2019s decision to determine whether its findings are supported\nby competent and credible evidence\u201d and; second, if the findings are properly supported, we \u201creview[] the trial court\u2019s decision in regard to its gatekeeping function for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Wesson at \u00b6 11, citing Gondor at \u00b6 52. An abuse of discretion \u201cimplies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219 (1983). When applying an abuse of discretion standard, a reviewing court is precluded from simply substituting its own judgment for that of the trial court. Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd., 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621 (1993).\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR ONE\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY APPLYING THE DOCTRINE OF RES JUDICATA TO BAR SPAULDING\u2019S GROUNDS FOR RELIEF.\n\n{\u00b69} In his first assignment of error, Mr. Spaulding argues that the trial court erred by applying the doctrine of res judicata in denying grounds for relief 1, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 16-30, 32, and 33 in his petition for post-conviction relief when the grounds were supported by credible evidence dehors the record. As Mr. Spaulding has failed to comply with App.R. 16(A)(7) in this assignment of error, we decline to reach the merits of this argument and therefore overrule it. We will nonetheless address the trial court\u2019s application of res judicata where applicable in discussing Mr. Spaulding\u2019s third assignment of error.\n\n{\u00b610} A petition for post-conviction relief may be properly dismissed without a hearing on the basis of res judicata. State v. Griffin, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 14CA010680, 2016-Ohio-2988, \u00b6 14. Pursuant to the doctrine of res judicata:\n\n[A] final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.\nState v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175 (1967), paragraph nine of the syllabus. To avoid the preclusive effect of res judicata, post-conviction relief claims must be \u201cbased on evidence outside of the original record that existed during direct appellate proceedings.\u201d State v. Bulls, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27713, 2015-Ohio-5094, \u00b6 9.\n\n{\u00b611} Nevertheless, \u201c[p]resenting evidence outside the record does not automatically defeat the doctrine of res judicata.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) State v. Stallings, 9th Dist. Summit No. 19620, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 1696, *4-5 (Apr. 19, 2000). The evidence \u201c\u2018must meet some threshold standard of cogency; otherwise it would be too easy to defeat the holding of Perry by simply attaching as exhibits evidence which is only marginally significant and does not advance the petitioner\u2019s claim[.]\u2019\u201d Id. at *5, quoting State v. Lawson, 103 Ohio App.3d 307, 315 (12th Dist.1995), quoting State v. Coleman, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-900811, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 1485, *21 (Mar. 17, 1993). The evidence dehors the record must also \u201cdemonstrate that the claims advanced in the petition could not have been fairly determined on direct appeal based on the original trial court record without resorting to evidence outside the record.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) Stallings at *5. Accordingly, Mr. Spaulding bears the burden to produce evidence dehors the record that would render the judgment void or voidable and also show that he could not have appealed the claim based upon information contained in the original record. See State v. Nemchik, 9th Dist. Lorain No. CA98CA007279, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 836, *4 (Mar. 8, 2000).\n\n{\u00b612} Although Mr. Spaulding attached many lengthy exhibits as evidence dehors the record to his petition for post-conviction relief, he fails to identify or argue in his merit brief under this particular assignment of error exactly how the trial court erred by applying the doctrine of res judicata and denying grounds 1, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 16-30, 32, and 33 of his petition.\nInstead, Mr. Spaulding simply states that his petition contained \u201cspecific factual allegations\u201d supported by \u201ccredible evidence dehors the record\u201d and then summarily concludes that \u201cthe trial court improperly applied res judicata to dismiss his grounds for relief * * * violat[ing] his due process guarantees.\u201d In his reply brief, Mr. Spaulding attempts to explain his failure to advance any specific argument within this assignment of error by stating:\n\nTo be clear, Spaulding was\u2014and is\u2014limited by page limits, and thus he requests that his brief be read as a whole. * * * In pages 11-27 of his Merit Brief, Spaulding described in detail the ways in which his outside the record evidence would render the judgment void or voidable. To the extent that it is unclear, Spaulding incorporates herein the merits arguments that demonstrate he should have survived preclusion by res judicata.\n\nHowever, pages 11-27 of Mr. Spaulding\u2019s merit brief address his arguments relating to his third assignment of error, not his first. Moreover, an appellant may not rely on incorporation by reference to circumvent the page limitations set by Loc.R. 7(E)(1). See State v. Smith, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 99CA007399, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 5161, *26 (Nov. 8, 2000). See also State v. Wright, 9th Dist. Summit No. 18941, 1999 Ohio App. LEXIS 2980, *3 (June 23, 1999) (stating that an attempt to raise arguments by incorporation through reference to a motion that was before the trial court is improper.).\n\nAccordingly, we decline to address the merits of Mr. Spaulding\u2019s first assignment of error because he has failed to make an argument in accordance with App.R. 16(A)(7), which requires \u201c[a]n argument containing the contentions of the appellant with respect to each assignment of error presented for review and the reasons in support of the contentions, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and parts of the record on which appellant relies.\u201d See Wright at *3. See also App.R. 12(A)(2) (\u201cThe [C]ourt may disregard an assignment of error presented for review if the party raising it fails to identify in the record the error on which the assignment of error is based or fails to argue the assignment separately in the brief, as required\nunder App.R. 16(A\u201d); Cardone v. Cardone, 9th Dist. Summit Nos. 18349 and 18673, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 2028, *22 (May 6, 1998) (\u201cIf an argument exists that can support this assignment of error, it is not this [C]ourt\u2019s duty to root it out\u201d).\n\n\u00b615 Mr. Spaulding\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled. However, the trial court\u2019s application of the doctrine of res judicata to various grounds for relief will nonetheless be addressed when necessary in our analysis of Mr. Spaulding\u2019s third assignment of error.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR THREE\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DISMISSING SPAULDING\u2019S POST-CONVICTION PETITION WHEN HE PRESENTED SUFFICIENT OPERATIVE FACTS TO MERIT RELIEF OR, AT MINIMUM, AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING.\n\n\u00b616 In his third assignment of error, Mr. Spaulding argues that his petition for post-conviction relief contained sufficient operative facts and evidence dehors the record that supported his grounds for relief, and the trial court therefore erred in denying the petition and finding that he was not entitled to a hearing. We disagree.\n\n\u00b617 At the outset of its analysis in its entry denying post-conviction relief, the trial court reasoned that Mr. Spaulding\u2019s petition should be dismissed solely on the basis that he only made an insufficient, summary assertion of prejudice and \u201c[w]hen it comes to alleging constitutional error, prejudice must be established by more than just speculation.\u201d Nevertheless, the trial court produced a 25-page judgment entry containing findings of fact and conclusions of law in compliance with Former R.C. 2953.21(G).\n\nIneffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n\u00b618 A vast majority of Mr. Spaulding\u2019s grounds for relief alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel for a variety of reasons, including failure to: investigate and present evidence; call certain witnesses to testify; hire certain experts to testify; effectively cross-\nexamine witnesses; provide \u201cconflict-free\u201d representation; and investigate and present alternate defense theories.\n\n{\u00b619} \u201c[I]n Ohio, a properly licensed attorney is presumed competent.\u201d State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, \u00b6 62. \u201cThere are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case. Even the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.\u201d Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689 (1984). To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, one must establish that: (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Id. at 687. Counsel\u2019s performance is deficient if it falls below an objective standard of reasonable representation. State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136 (1989), paragraph two of the syllabus. Prejudice can be shown by proving \u201cthere exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus. \u201c[T]he Court need not address both Strickland prongs if an appellant fails to prove either one.\u201d State v. Lortz, 9th Dist. Summit No. 23762, 2008-Ohio-3108, \u00b6 34. Furthermore, \u201c[w]here [a] defendant, represented by new counsel upon direct appeal, fails to raise therein the issue of competent trial counsel and said issue could fairly have been determined without resort to evidence dehors the record, res judicata is a proper basis for dismissing defendant\u2019s petition for post[-]conviction relief.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) State v. Cole, 2 Ohio St.3d 112 (1982), syllabus. Mr. Spaulding was represented by new counsel in his direct appeal. See Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126.\n\n{\u00b620} For ease of analysis, we will rearrange and consolidate the grounds for relief contained in Mr. Spaulding\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief.\nMr. Spaulding argued that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and present evidence in his case.\n\nMr. Spaulding attached to his petition an affidavit of Tom Fields, who was the investigator hired by the defense in this case. Mr. Spaulding argued that the affidavit demonstrates how counsel failed to properly prepare for trial and how Mr. Fields\u2019 investigation was hindered by defense counsel\u2019s inattention, passiveness, and lack of involvement in the case. He argued that Mr. Fields discovered several potential witnesses who could have testified that there were multiple shooters or masked men who committed the crimes, but counsel provided ineffective assistance by choosing not to call the potential witnesses to testify at trial.\n\nThe trial court stated that the decision whether to call a witness falls within the rubric of trial strategy and that Mr. Fields failed to explain in his affidavit how he is qualified to render an opinion on counsel\u2019s performance. Moreover, the court stated that the \u201ctwo shooters/masked men\u201d theory was presented at trial and Mr. Fields\u2019 affidavit does not demonstrate a failure to investigate by defense counsel.\n\nWe conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. \u201c[C]ounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to investigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments.\u201d Strickland at 691. Although Mr. Fields lists his concerns in the affidavit as to how Mr. Spaulding\u2019s case was handled in comparison to how he sees cases \u201ctypically\u201d handled, his affidavit does not demonstrate a failure to investigate by defense counsel. While Mr. Fields avers that he never had\nany \u201cmeaningful discussions\u201d with attorney Jason Wells, he admittedly recalls having \u201csignificant discussions\u201d with attorney Donald Walker about Mr. Spaulding\u2019s case. Mr. Fields avers that it was \u201cdifficult and slow to get guidance and information\u201d and that he received discovery \u201cvery close to the trial date,\u201d but he does not claim that he never received guidance, information, or discovery from counsel. He avers that he made audio recordings of potential witnesses during his investigation and urged counsel to listen to them, but he is \u201cuncertain\u201d if counsel listened to all of the recordings. Mr. Fields does not claim, however, that counsel did not listen to the audio recordings or that counsel refused to listen to them. He also avers that he was \u201csurprised and disheartened\u201d that counsel decided to not call any witnesses at trial. Finally, Mr. Fields avers that he had \u201climited time and guidance[,]\u201d but concludes that his investigation was nonetheless sufficient enough to create serious doubts as to the State\u2019s case.\n\n{\u00b625} We conclude that Mr. Fields\u2019 affidavit does not contain sufficient operative facts to establish that the trial court incorrectly denied his petition without holding a hearing. While we certainly commend Mr. Fields on his desire to work tirelessly alongside counsel throughout the case and although we empathize with his apparent discomfort in working on a difficult investigation under what may have been unfamiliar and stressful time constraints, he nonetheless admits in his affidavit to having completed a sufficient investigation after engaging in significant discussions with lead counsel in this case. Although the amount of communication with counsel in this case may not have been what Mr. Fields is typically used to, it does not appear that counsel was deficient in performance or that Mr. Spaulding was prejudiced as a result. Also, an investigator\u2019s disagreement with counsel\u2019s decision to not call certain witnesses to testify at trial does not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. \u201c\u2018Decisions regarding the calling of witnesses are within the purview of defense counsel\u2019s trial tactics[.]\u2019 and absent a showing of\nprejudice, the failure to call witnesses will not be deemed erroneous.\u201d *City of Elyria v. Bozman*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 01CA007899, 2002-Ohio-2644, \u00b6 17, quoting *State v. Coulter*, 75 Ohio App.3d 219, 230 (12th Dist.1992). We conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying this ground for relief without a hearing.\n\n**Grounds for Relief 1, 4, 29, 30, 32, 31, and 6**\n\n{\u00b626} Mr. Spaulding argued that defense counsel were ineffective for failing to call several witnesses to testify at trial.\n\n{\u00b627} He attached an affidavit from Keyona B., who avers that, at approximately 2:00 A.M. on December 15, 2011, Ms. Singleton arrived at Keyona\u2019s residence and told her some masked men who she did not know had just come into a house on Grant Street and started shooting. She avers that Ms. Singleton had drugs and a gun with her. Keyona also acknowledges that she was contacted by Mr. Spaulding\u2019s investigator in this case.\n\n{\u00b628} Mr. Spaulding also attached a police report completed by Detective Richard Morrison, which states that Shera C. was interviewed at the scene on Grant Street. Shera, who is Mr. Thomas\u2019 cousin, informed police that Mr. Thomas told her that when Mr. Griffin was shot, \u201csome masked men came into his house and he ran them out.\u201d\n\n{\u00b629} Mr. Spaulding also attached the affidavit of Shaunday H., who avers that she was friends with Ms. Singleton and Mr. Spaulding. On December 15, 2011, Cierra H. called Shaunday when Ms. Singleton came to Cierra\u2019s house. Shaunday overheard Ms. Singleton say, \u201c[T]hese dudes came in my boyfriend\u2019s house trying to rob him.\u201d She also spoke to Mr. Spaulding\u2019s investigator in this case.\n\n{\u00b630} In Mr. Fields\u2019 affidavit, he avers that he spoke with both Cierra and Shaunday. Cierra told him that, at approximately 2:00 A.M. on December 15, 2011, Ms. Singleton arrived\nat Cierra\u2019s residence and stated that \u201ctwo guys came into the house and started shooting.\u201d Ms. Singleton had drugs and a gun with her and appeared scared when a silver car with two men in it pulled up in front of the house. Shaunday told Mr. Fields that she was on the phone with Cierra when Ms. Singleton arrived that night and confirmed that she overheard what Ms. Singleton said to Cierra.\n\nMr. Spaulding also attached the affidavit of Niechelle B. and a police report by Detective John Bell. Detective Bell testified that he is not related to Niechelle in any way. Niechelle avers that she gave Ms. Singleton and Mr. Thomas a ride back to Tallmadge after the shooting of Mr. Griffin, and Mr. Thomas said he thought they were being robbed, but did not know who would want to rob them. She avers that both Ms. Singleton and Mr. Thomas \u201cthought that there was more than one shooter.\u201d Niechelle spoke to two attorneys before trial and then testified at trial. In the police report, Detective Bell states that he interviewed Niechelle and she discussed giving the victims a ride three hours before they were murdered. She told the detective that Mr. Thomas mentioned firing a gun, which may have caused the suspects to leave after the Griffin shooting. Mr. Thomas did not mention to Niechelle that he knew the suspects. Niechelle did, in fact, testify at Mr. Spaulding\u2019s trial, but defense counsel repeatedly and successfully objected to her testifying on direct examination as to anything Mr. Thomas told her on December 15, 2011. She was then cross-examined by defense counsel and later asked during redirect examination, \u201cDid [Mr. Thomas] suggest any knowledge of [who] did this?\u201d She answered, \u201cNo.\u201d When she was asked what Mr. Thomas had to say about that topic, she replied, \u201cHe really was just, like, I don\u2019t know. He was saying, \u2018I don\u2019t know who could have done this.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn Mr. Fields\u2019 affidavit, he avers that he spoke with both Dan F. and Pat F. Dan and Pat lived next door to the house on Grant Street where the shootings occurred. Mr. Fields\navers that Dan and Pat told him it is a known drug house and that a drive-by shooting recently happened there. Mr. Fields avers that Dan told him he saw Ms. Singleton and Mr. Thomas get out of a cab and soon thereafter he heard gun shots. Dan looked and saw a man in the driveway and heard at least one other person inside the house. It sounded to him like the house was being \u201cransacked.\u201d An upset man came out of the house to tell another man who was on his cell phone to move the black Chevy Impala that was parked in the driveway. Dan did not mention seeing anyone with braids.\n\n\u00b633 Mr. Spaulding also attached an affidavit from William S. to his petition. William avers that he overheard Mr. Spaulding in jail talking about how he was being \u201crailroaded.\u201d William knew both Mr. Griffin and a man named \u201cManny\u201d as dope dealers who lived close to one another on Grant Street. William avers that Manny told him that Mr. Griffin was involved in a recent robbery of Manny. Moreover, William believes Manny \u201cconfessed\u201d to shooting Mr. Griffin afterward when he told William, \u201c[Y]ou heard about the boys down the road? That\u2019s what those n*****s get for robbing me.\u201d William also avers that Manny threatened to shoot him sometime later over forty dollars.\n\n\u00b634 The trial court found that Mr. Fields interviewed Keyona, Shaunday, and Cierra, and that Niechelle testified at trial. The \u201ctwo shooters/masked men\u201d theory was presented at trial and witnesses were cross-examined regarding it. Furthermore, the court found that Mr. Spaulding\u2019s evidence dehors the record was only marginally significant in advancing his theory and he failed to explain how his arguments could not have been raised on direct appeal; thus, they were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n\n\u00b635 We conclude that some of the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Once again, \u201c[d]ecisions regarding the calling of witnesses are within\nthe purview of defense counsel\u2019s trial tactics[\u2019] and absent a showing of prejudice, the failure to call witnesses will not be deemed erroneous.\u201d Bozman, 2002-Ohio-2644, at \u00b6 17, quoting Coulter, 75 Ohio App.3d 219, at 230. Mr. Spaulding has not shown how counsel\u2019s decision to not call these individuals to testify as witnesses was anything other than a tactical decision or that it fell outside the range of competent representation. See State v. Willard, 9th Dist. Medina No. 05CA0096-M, 2006-Ohio-5071, \u00b6 36. Although several of these individuals may have spoken to, or overheard, either the victims or Mr. Spaulding at some point in time, most of them were not eyewitnesses who were personally at the scene of either shooting and their potential testimony does not bear upon the operative facts of this matter. See State v. Hudson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98499, 2013-Ohio-1444, \u00b6 31. One of them, Niechelle, did in fact testify at Mr. Spaulding\u2019s trial and was subjected to cross-examination by defense counsel. Although Mr. Fields avers that Dan and Pat told him they were next door when one of the shootings occurred, we agree with the trial court that it is unclear which shooting incident Dan and Pat described to Mr. Fields, and Mr. Spaulding did not attach affidavits from either Dan or Pat to his petition. Moreover, the jury watched videos at trial of the first and third police interrogations of Mr. Spaulding, where Mr. Spaulding urged police to speak to Cierra and Keyona regarding \u201cfour masked men\u201d being mentioned by Ms. Singleton. See Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, at \u00b6 31-33. On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Mr. Griffin as to whether the shooter wore a mask. We fail to see how counsel\u2019s decision to not call these additional witnesses to present essentially cumulative evidence to hopefully \u201cstrengthen\u201d the \u201ctwo shooters/masked men\u201d theory demonstrates deficient performance or a resulting prejudice to support an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\nWe do, however, disagree with the trial court\u2019s determinations that the affidavits submitted were only marginally significant and Mr. Spaulding\u2019s claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The affidavits are evidence dehors the record pertaining directly to whether more than one shooter or masked men were responsible for the underlying crimes and, therefore, meet the threshold standard of cogency. Nevertheless, \u201cthis Court will not reverse a correct judgment merely because of a flaw in the trial court\u2019s analysis.\u201d Wesson, 2012-Ohio-4495, at \u00b6 31. See also State v. Kiley, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 12CA010254, 2013-Ohio-634, \u00b6 10. Regardless of whether we disagree with the trial court\u2019s application of the doctrine of res judicata here, an appellate court \u201cshall affirm a trial court\u2019s judgment that is legally correct on other grounds, that is, one that achieves the right result for the wrong reason, because such an error is not prejudicial.\u201d Wesson at \u00b6 31, quoting Rude v. NUCO Edn. Corp., 9th Dist. Summit No. 25549, 2011-Ohio-6789, \u00b6 21, quoting Cook Family Invests. v. Billings, 9th Dist. Lorain Nos. 05CA008689 and 05CA008691, 2006-Ohio-764, \u00b6 19.\n\nIn Mr. Spaulding\u2019s case, we conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying these grounds for relief without a hearing because it correctly found that decisions regarding the calling of witnesses are within the purview of defense counsel\u2019s trial tactics.\n\nGrounds for Relief 2, 7, 8, 11, and 15\n\nMr. Spaulding argued that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to hire several experts to testify at trial.\n\nMr. Spaulding claimed that counsel were ineffective for failing to call an expert in cellular tracking to testify at trial, such as computer forensic examiner Mark Vassel, who could have testified that a person\u2019s location cannot be pinpointed precisely using cell phone tower data.\nMr. Spaulding attached a report from Mr. Vassel to his petition in which Mr. Vassel opines that some of Detective Robert Moledor\u2019s testimony at trial is not supported by data. Mr. Vassel avers that \u201c[a] person\u2019s location cannot be pinpointed so precisely by using data from cell phone towers.\u201d Although he does not disagree that the evidence shows Mr. Spaulding\u2019s cell phone connected to the Grant Street cell tower at some point on December 15, 2011, he avers that it is \u201cjust as likely that the defendant\u2019s handset device was at least a mile away from the crime scene.\u201d\n\n{\u00b640} The trial court found that Mr. Spaulding did not point to any American Bar Association (\u201cABA\u201d) guidelines requiring defense counsel to hire experts to advance marginally significant evidence in rebuttal to the State\u2019s evidence. The court further found that, while Detective Moledor testified about the ability to map a person\u2019s location by cell phone use, he clarified that Mr. Spaulding\u2019s location could only be determined to be in the sector or zone of the Grant Street cell tower and the location could not be pinpointed. This was contrary to Mr. Spaulding\u2019s statement to the police that he had been on the other side of town. Furthermore, the court found that counsel chose to cross-examine Detective Moledor instead of presenting an independent witness, which is a matter of trial strategy.\n\n{\u00b641} We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. The trial court correctly stated that Detective Moledor\u2019s testimony did not indicate an exact pinpoint of Mr. Spaulding\u2019s location, as Mr. Spaulding has argued. Detective Moledor testified at trial that he uses mapping software to display the \u201cgeneral area\u201d of a cell phone\u2019s location when it uses a cell tower. In Mr. Spaulding\u2019s case, Detective Moledor was able to narrow down a location for certain times and dates for Mr. Spaulding\u2019s cell phone and he only concluded that Mr. Spaulding\u2019s phone placed multiple calls between 2:04 A.M. and 2:15 A.M.,\nand between 7:58 A.M. and 8:08 A.M., on December 11, 2011, using cell phone towers in the vicinity of 1104 Grant Street.\n\n{\u00b642} Mr. Spaulding also argued that defense counsel were ineffective for failing to call an eyewitness expert, such as Dr. Harvey Schulman, who could have testified at trial and challenged Mr. Wilbur\u2019s and Mr. Griffin\u2019s eyewitness identification testimony. He argued that Mr. Wilbur\u2019s identification was suspect, unreliable, and not convincing because his identification evolved over time and his second identification was more detailed. He further argued that Mr. Griffin identified Mr. Spaulding even though evidence existed that the shooter wore a mask. Moreover, Mr. Griffin failed to identify Mr. Spaulding in the first photo array, but then positively identified him in the second photo array.\n\n{\u00b643} Mr. Spaulding attached a report to his petition from Dr. Schulman, a retired psychology professor trained in the field of cognitive psychology, specifically the areas of attention, perception, and memory. Dr. Schulman states in his report that Mr. Griffin\u2019s eyewitness identification may have been influenced by several factors, including: poor viewing conditions, Mr. Griffin\u2019s focus on the gun, other reports that the assailant may have worn a mask, and officers informing him in between the two photo arrays that Ms. Singleton and Mr. Thomas had been murdered. Dr. Schulman further states that Mr. Wilbur\u2019s eyewitness identification may have been influenced by several factors, including: less than ideal visibility conditions, multiple targets to view, his only identification occurring in court nine months after the crime despite having said he was unable to describe the face of the individual he saw, and the difficulty of cross-racial identification.\n\n{\u00b644} The trial court found that the ABA Guidelines do not mandate the hiring of experts to challenge the State\u2019s evidence. Moreover, the court found that defense counsel cross-\nexamined both Mr. Wilbur and Mr. Griffin at length about their eyewitness identifications of Mr. Spaulding, including questioning Mr. Griffin as to whether the shooter wore a mask.\n\n\u00b645 We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. First, by his own admission, Dr. Schulman states in his report that it contains only a list of factors that \u201cmay have operated in this case\u201d and \u201cmay have influenced the testimony\u201d of Mr. Griffin and Mr. Wilbur. (Emphasis added.). Nothing in the report suggests that these factors actually affected the testimony of Mr. Griffin or Mr. Wilbur. Second, defense counsel cross-examined both Mr. Wilbur and Mr. Griffin extensively as to their eyewitness identifications of Mr. Spaulding. Counsel questioned Mr. Wilbur as to what he saw and heard at the crime scene, the weather conditions that day, any distractions such as buckling his son\u2019s seat belt, whether Mr. Wilbur was intoxicated or on medications at that time, whether he saw the suspect\u2019s face or just some braided hair, Mr. Wilbur\u2019s description of the suspect, and why he did not identify Mr. Spaulding during his first or second interactions with police and instead waited until a third interview to give a \u201ccomplete statement.\u201d Counsel also questioned Mr. Griffin at his deposition as to his relationship with David \u201cFrog\u201d Clark, whether he had been involved in a robbery earlier on the night he was shot, whether he had used drugs or consumed alcohol the night he was shot, whether he had been selling drugs the night he was shot, what clothes the shooter wore, how far away the shooter was from Mr. Griffin, whether the shooter was alone, whether he previously told anyone that the shooter wore a red mask, and whether he had been on a lot of medications while in the hospital.\n\n\u00b646 Mr. Spaulding argued that defense counsel were ineffective for failing to hire and call an expert, such as Dr. Sergio Bergese, to review Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records and challenge Nurse Lynne Trenkelbach\u2019s testimony. He argued Mr. Griffin was still sedated when he first\nidentified Mr. Spaulding in the second photo array at the hospital. He also argued that shutting the sedation off approximately five minutes before police spoke to Mr. Griffin, as Nurse Trenkelbach testified, was an insufficient amount of time for the medication to be out of his system.\n\n\u00b647 Mr. Spaulding attached a report to his petition from Dr. Bergese, Director of Neuroanesthesia at the Ohio State University. Dr. Bergese concludes in his report that the drug propofol affects a person\u2019s cognitive recovery after the drug is stopped for at least 90 minutes after having been used for several days. He states that Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records showed him being on a propofol drip for five days. Along with propofol, Mr. Griffin had been on Ativan and morphine, which Dr. Bergese states would prolong the timeframe for a full cognitive recovery into several hours. Dr. Bergese also states that Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records showed no change in sedation status on December 20, 2011, between 10:00 A.M. and 12:00 P.M.\n\n\u00b648 The trial court found that defense counsel had Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records prior to trial. Moreover, the court found that counsel cross-examined Nurse Trenkelbach extensively about the effects of Mr. Griffin\u2019s medications and whether they may have affected his judgment when he identified Mr. Spaulding, and counsel\u2019s decision to rely on cross-examination instead of calling an expert is not ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n\u00b649 We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records were entered into the record at trial. Defense counsel questioned Nurse Trenkelbach extensively at trial and asked who was allowed to visit Mr. Griffin at the hospital, whether his visits from family members were private, whether he was aware of the murders of Ms. Singleton and Mr. Thomas, whether family members may have told\nhim who they believed was responsible for the murders, what medications he was on and when he received them, and the circumstances surrounding the photo arrays.\n\n{\u00b650} Mr. Spaulding argued that defense counsel were ineffective for failing to call a ballistics expert, such as John Nixon, who could have challenged Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d) forensic scientist Michael Roberts\u2019 testimony that cartridges found at both crime scenes were fired from the same gun, Mr. Roberts\u2019 methods of comparison, and his qualifications to determine whether the cartridges came from the same gun.\n\n{\u00b651} Mr. Spaulding attached a report from Mr. Nixon, who cites to and attaches a 2009 report published by the National Academy of Sciences (\u201cNAS Report\u201d). Mr. Nixon emphasizes that, with regard to toolmark uniqueness, the NAS Report states: \u201cThe validity of the fundamental assumptions of uniqueness and reproducibility of firearms-related toolmarks has not yet been fully demonstrated * * *.\u201d Mr. Nixon states that the NAS Report contains \u201ca lot of criticism\u201d regarding firearm toolmark comparisons. He also cites to a 2013 letter from U.S. Department of Justice Special Counsel John Crabb to a Mississippi prosecutor (\u201c2013 Letter\u201d) as providing the FBI\u2019s official position on firearm toolmark uniqueness as \u201cnot permit[ting] examiner testimony that a specific gun fired a specific bullet to the exclusion of all other guns in the world.\u201d He claims \u201cthe concept of uniqueness has been disproven,\u201d no firearm or unfired ammunition from the same batch existed in this case which diminished confidence in the results, and Mr. Roberts\u2019 testimony contained 31 statements that were misleading or false. He also challenges the December 22, 2011, BCI report as \u201cepitomizing all that is wrong with laboratory reports\u201d and speculates that \u201ctwo shooters were probably responsible.\u201d\n\n{\u00b652} The trial court found that Mr. Nixon did not elaborate on how he is qualified to render an opinion that it is unlikely one shooter shot both victims. The court also found that Mr.\nSpaulding admitted in his petition that defense counsel had the BCI report prior to trial, so the issue was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Furthermore, the court found that speculation that different tactics may have improved the defense does not establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and counsel\u2019s decision to rely on cross-examination instead of calling an expert witness to testify is not ineffective assistance.\n\n\u00b653 We conclude that some of the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. While Mr. Nixon challenges Mr. Roberts\u2019 education in the areas of metallurgy, engineering, and statistics, he concedes that \u201cMr[.] Roberts is a court qualified expert with regard to performing comparisons.\u201d Instead of hiring an expert, counsel chose to cross-examine Mr. Roberts at trial as to his BCI report listing a variety of manufacturers that could have possibly made the firearm used to fire the cartridges recovered in Mr. Spaulding\u2019s case. Mr. Spaulding has not shown how counsel\u2019s choice to cross-examine the witness instead of calling another expert to testify was anything other than a legitimate, tactical decision, which cannot establish ineffective assistance of counsel. See State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, \u00b6 66.\n\n\u00b654 We disagree with the trial court\u2019s determination that because Mr. Spaulding admitted his defense counsel had the BCI report prior to trial, his claim was barred by res judicata. The NAS Report and 2013 Letter were not made part of the trial record and purportedly discredit statements contained in the BCI report; thus, they are evidence dehors the record that meet the threshold standard of cogency. Although this particular claim is not barred by res judicata, we again reiterate that \u201cthis Court will not reverse a correct judgment merely because of a flaw in the trial court\u2019s analysis[,]\u201d but we shall instead \u201caffirm a trial court\u2019s judgment that is legally correct on other grounds, that is, one that achieves the right result for the\nwrong reason, because such an error is not prejudicial.\u201d Wesson, 2012-Ohio-4495, at \u00b6 31, quoting Rude, 2011-Ohio-6789, at \u00b6 21, quoting Billings, 2006-Ohio-764, at \u00b6 19. We conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying this particular ground for relief without a hearing because it correctly found that counsel\u2019s decision to rely on cross-examination instead of calling a ballistics expert to testify is not ineffective assistance. See Hunter at \u00b6 66 (\u201c[T]he failure to call an expert and instead rely on cross-examination does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d).\n\n{\u00b655} Overall, we conclude that Mr. Spaulding\u2019s arguments that defense counsel did not \u201cthoughtfully and diligently\u201d consider the evidence and that \u201c[t]here was no thorough cross-examination\u201d of any experts at trial are without merit. \u201c[I]t is [well-]settled that a post-conviction petition does not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel even when it presents a new expert opinion that is different from the theory used at trial.\u201d State v. McNeill, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 01CA007800, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 3669, *11 (Aug. 22, 2001). See also State v. Morgan, 9th Dist. Medina No. 07CA0124-M, 2008-Ohio-5530, \u00b6 40. An attorney\u2019s reliance on cross-examination in lieu of calling an expert to testify at trial is a legitimate, tactical decision and does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. See Hunter at \u00b6 66. Mr. Spaulding has not shown how counsel\u2019s decision to cross-examine the State\u2019s witnesses instead of calling defense experts to testify at trial constituted deficient performance or resulted in any prejudice. Mr. Spaulding admitted in his petition that defense counsel had the BCI report prior to trial. The cell phone records and Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records were entered into evidence at trial. Mr. Spaulding also previously raised a similar argument in his direct appeal claiming ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to counsel\u2019s efforts to challenge Mr. Griffin\u2019s eyewitness identification, which was rejected. See Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, \u00b6 78-\n92. We conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying these grounds for relief without a hearing.\n\n**Ground for Relief 12**\n\n{\u00b656} Mr. Spaulding argued that defense counsel were ineffective for failing to use Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records to impeach Nurse Trenkelbach and suppress Mr. Griffin\u2019s identification of Mr. Spaulding, as Mr. Griffin was \u201cunder the influence of heavy medication when the police conducted a photo array with him.\u201d He argued that although counsel filed a motion to suppress alleging that the photo array did not comply with R.C. 2933.83 and was unduly suggestive, counsel nonetheless could have used Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records for impeachment and did not do so. Mr. Spaulding attached Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records in support of his claims.\n\n{\u00b657} The trial court found that this argument was barred by the doctrine of res judicata because it was based entirely on evidence in the record. The court found that any arguments that counsel should have emphasized certain points during cross-examination could have been raised on direct appeal. The court further found that Dr. Bergese\u2019s report did not significantly advance an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and any speculation that a different tactic may have improved Mr. Spaulding\u2019s defense does not demonstrate ineffective assistance.\n\n{\u00b658} We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Counsel did, in fact, cross-examine Nurse Trenkelbach extensively at trial, specifically as to what medications Mr. Griffin was on, when he received those medications, and the circumstances surrounding the subsequent photo arrays. Again, \u201cdecisions regarding cross-examination are within trial counsel\u2019s discretion, and cannot form the basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d *State v. Diaz*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 04CA008573, 2005-Ohio-\nSee also State v. Rafferty, 9th Dist. Summit No. 23217, 2007-Ohio-3997, \u00b6 15, quoting State v. Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, \u00b6 146 (\u201cThe extent and scope of cross-examination clearly fall within the ambit of trial strategy, and debatable trial tactics do not establish ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d). Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records were entered into evidence at trial. Any challenge related to counsel\u2019s use or non-use of the medical records to impeach Nurse Trenkelbach could have been made on direct appeal, and is therefore now barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Once again, Mr. Spaulding did raise a related argument in his direct appeal claiming ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to counsel\u2019s efforts to challenge Mr. Griffin\u2019s eyewitness identification, which was rejected. See Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, \u00b6 78-92. We conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying this ground for relief without a hearing.\n\nGrounds for Relief 17 and 18\n\n\u00b659 Mr. Spaulding argued that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and discover evidence to impeach Mr. Wilbur. Mr. Wilbur was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana ten days before the shootings, so Mr. Spaulding claimed that Mr. Wilbur could have been \u201cunder the influence of marijuana at the time of the shooting [and] his ability to recall would have been compromised.\u201d He further argued that counsel \u201cnot only failed to exploit the flaws in Wilbur\u2019s testimony, [but] also failed to impeach Wilbur with the fact that he has brain damage.\u201d\n\n\u00b660 Mr. Spaulding attached various documents from Mr. Wilbur\u2019s marijuana case as well as the docket of a previous criminal case involving Mr. Wilbur, which includes an entry from March 23, 2007, stating in part, \u201cupon information that the defendant is currently\nhospitalized in Massachusetts from a condition resulting in brain damage, community control * * * is hereby terminated.\u201d\n\n{\u00b661} The trial court found that these claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata and Mr. Spaulding\u2019s evidence dehors the record does not even marginally advance his ineffective assistance claim. The court found that any arguments that cross-examination should have emphasized certain points could have been raised on direct appeal and speculation that a different tactic may have improved Mr. Spaulding\u2019s defense does not demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n{\u00b662} We conclude that some of the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Once again, defense counsel questioned Mr. Wilbur extensively as to what he saw and heard, the weather conditions, any distractions that were present, whether Mr. Wilbur was intoxicated or on medications, whether he saw the suspect\u2019s face or just his braided hair, Mr. Wilbur\u2019s description of the suspect, and why he waited until a third interview with the police to give a \u201ccomplete statement.\u201d \u201cThe extent and scope of cross-examination clearly fall within the ambit of trial strategy, and debatable trial tactics do not establish ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Rafferty, 2007-Ohio-3997, at \u00b6 15, quoting Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, at \u00b6 146. We again disagree with the trial court\u2019s determination that these claims were barred by res judicata, as Mr. Spaulding presented evidence dehors the record that would have challenged the credibility of eyewitness testimony, therefore meeting the threshold standard of cogency. But, because the extent and scope of cross-examination is nonetheless within the ambit of trial strategy, we conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying these grounds for relief without a hearing. See Wesson, 2012-Ohio-4495, at \u00b6 31, quoting Rude, 2011-Ohio-6789, at \u00b6 21, quoting Billings, 2006-Ohio-764, at \u00b6 19 (\u201c[T]his Court\nwill not reverse a correct judgment merely because of a flaw in the trial court\u2019s analysis[,]\u201d but shall \u201c\u2018affirm a trial court\u2019s judgment that is legally correct on other grounds * * *.\u2019\u201d).\n\nGround for Relief 9\n\n\u00b663 Mr. Spaulding argued that defense counsel were ineffective and ill-prepared for the mitigation phase of trial.\n\n\u00b664 Mr. Spaulding attached an affidavit from attorney Susan Moran. Although she was not hired with the formal title of \u201cmitigation specialist,\u201d it was understood that she would perform the functions of a mitigation specialist. See Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, at \u00b6 170. Ms. Moran avers that she only had contact with attorney Walker and she only spoke to attorney Wells approximately five times, which she categorizes as \u201chighly unusual.\u201d She never met attorney Wells until the first day of the mitigation phase. In Mr. Spaulding\u2019s case, there was only one team meeting, whereas in Ms. Moran\u2019s experience there are typically ten-to-fifteen team meetings. Attorney Wells was not present at the meeting in Mr. Spaulding\u2019s case. Ms. Moran spoke to attorney Walker, but felt like he was ill-prepared and \u201cdid not quite grasp what mitigation was all about.\u201d Right before the mitigation phase began, Ms. Moran concluded that attorney Wells \u201chad nothing prepared,\u201d so she handwrote an opening statement for him to read. Attorney Wells initially used Ms. Moran\u2019s statement, but then purportedly strayed from it and instead used his own words. Consequently, he mistakenly told the jury that they would hear from a particular witness, although that person was now deceased. Ms. Moran avers that \u201cit appeared to [her] that the defense witnesses had not been prepped.\u201d She also avers that she handed attorney Walker notes with questions that she believed needed to be asked of witnesses, and in her opinion neither attorney properly rehabilitated the witnesses. She felt frustrated and disheartened because she believed Mr. Spaulding\u2019s case was \u201cwinnable.\u201d\nMr. Spaulding also attached an affidavit from Dr. John Fabian, a forensic psychologist and clinical neuropsychologist hired by the defense to assist with mitigation. Dr. Fabian avers that he was concerned that attorney Walker \u201cdidn\u2019t seem to grasp the idea, concept, and process of mitigation\u201d and he urged attorney Walker to hire Ms. Moran as a mitigation specialist. Dr. Fabian avers that he never spoke to attorney Wells. Dr. Fabian contacted both attorney Walker and Judge Gallagher in November of 2012 to request more time to fully conduct a mitigation investigation, and Judge Gallagher then continued sentencing in this matter until the end of January 2013. He avers that Mr. Spaulding\u2019s family appeared to not trust the attorneys and were very frustrated with what the attorneys did not do at trial, which hindered the ability to build a rapport with the family. Dr. Fabian avers that he recently learned that there were hospital records regarding Mr. Spaulding apparently having four separate head injuries, although Dr. Fabian\u2019s own report listed no head injuries, which he claims was due to not having the hospital records. Mr. Spaulding also purportedly ingested bleach once as a child.\n\nThe trial court found that part of this argument is barred by res judicata because ineffective assistance of counsel during the mitigation phase was raised and rejected in Mr. Spaulding\u2019s direct appeal. See Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, at \u00b6 168-180. Moreover, the court found that Dr. Fabian failed to explain how knowledge of head injuries and ingesting bleach could have been mitigating in Mr. Spaulding\u2019s case or how his report was rendered unreliable because that information was missing. The court also found that Ms. Moran did not elaborate on what aspects of the case she believed to be \u201cwinnable.\u201d The court found that the truth or falsity of Dr. Fabian\u2019s and Ms. Moran\u2019s affidavits is inconsequential, as the information contained within them does not demonstrate ineffective assistance. The court found that given the work performed and evidence presented during mitigation, \u201cit was a reasonable\nstrategic decision for counsel to create sympathy for Spaulding\u2019s family in mitigation[,]\u201d as Spaulding himself is an unsympathetic individual. Even debatable trial tactics do not constitute ineffective assistance and will not be second-guessed after a thorough mitigation is conducted. The court found that Mr. Spaulding failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from any of the alleged mitigation errors, he presented no evidence dehors the record identifying specific, additional evidence for mitigation, and he failed to demonstrate how, but for the alleged errors, his sentence would have been different.\n\n{\u00b667} We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. \u201cThe presentation of mitigating evidence is a matter of trial strategy.\u201d State v. Maxwell, 139 Ohio St.3d 12, 2014-Ohio-1019, \u00b6 189. \u201cCounsel in a capital case has an \u2018obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant\u2019s background\u2019 to determine the availability of mitigating evidence.\u201d Id., quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 396 (2000). \u201c[I]nvestigations into mitigating evidence \u2018should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at \u00b6 190, quoting Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 524 (2003), quoting ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, section 11.4.1(C), 93 (1989).\n\n{\u00b668} Mr. Spaulding previously raised in his reply brief in his direct appeal an argument that defense counsel and their experts were unprepared for the mitigation phase. See Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, at \u00b6 178. As such, this argument is now barred by the doctrine of res judicata. In rejecting his argument, the Supreme Court of Ohio specifically stated that \u201cSpaulding\u2019s allegations do not prove ineffective assistance.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 179. The Court also rejected Mr. Spaulding\u2019s arguments that counsel never hired a mitigation specialist and failed to\npresent psychological evidence during the mitigation phase. *Id.* at \u00b6 169-177. Mr. Spaulding has not presented any evidence dehors the record beyond Ms. Moran and Dr. Fabian\u2019s affidavits referring to incidents that they believed indicated a lack of preparation by defense counsel. As noted by both the trial court and the Supreme Court, Mr. Spaulding has not identified any specific information that a mitigation specialist would have uncovered that had not already been found by the defense expert or explained how that information would have prompted the jury to recommend a life sentence. *See id.* at \u00b6 171. We conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying this ground for relief without a hearing.\n\n**Ground for Relief 5**\n\n{\u00b669} Mr. Spaulding argued that defense counsel were ineffective for failing to effectively cross-examine Detective Morrison at trial as to the contents of a police report.\n\n{\u00b670} Mr. Spaulding attached a copy of Detective Morrison\u2019s report to his petition, which states that Shera informed the detective that Mr. Thomas told her after Mr. Griffin was shot that \u201csome masked men came into his house and he ran them out.\u201d\n\n{\u00b671} The trial court stated that the alleged error appeared on the face of the record, Mr. Spaulding\u2019s evidence dehors the record did not significantly advance his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and the issue was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n\n{\u00b672} Again, we must disagree with the trial court\u2019s determination that res judicata bars Mr. Spaulding\u2019s claim here. Detective Morrison\u2019s report was not made part of the trial record and is therefore evidence dehors the record. The report meets the threshold standard of cogency because it contains information supporting Mr. Spaulding\u2019s theory of the case that some \u201cmasked men\u201d allegedly committed these crimes. However, we must stress once more that \u201c[t]he extent and scope of cross-examination clearly fall within the ambit of trial strategy, and debatable trial\ntactics do not establish ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d\u201d Rafferty, 2007-Ohio-3997, at \u00b6 15, quoting Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, at \u00b6 146. Counsel cross-examined Detective Morrison regarding his investigation, including the interviews of Mr. Spaulding, Mr. Griffin\u2019s identification of Mr. Spaulding in the photo arrays, the rash of killings in the Grant Street neighborhood, the determination of Mr. Spaulding\u2019s location by pinging cell phone towers, and Mr. Wilbur\u2019s statements to police. Because decisions regarding the cross-examination of Detective Morrison were within defense counsel\u2019s discretion, we conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying this ground for relief without a hearing. See Wesson, 2012-Ohio-4495, at \u00b6 31, quoting Rude, 2011-Ohio-6789, at \u00b6 21, quoting Billings, 2006-Ohio-764, at \u00b6 19 (\u201c[T]his Court will not reverse a correct judgment merely because of a flaw in the trial court\u2019s analysis[,]\u201d but shall \u201caffirm a trial court\u2019s judgment that is legally correct on other grounds * * *.\u201d).\n\nGround for Relief 33\n\n\u00b673 Mr. Spaulding argued that trial counsel was ineffective because attorney Walker simultaneously represented both Mr. Spaulding in this case and Tarheasia Norwood in two other criminal cases, creating a \u201cclear conflict of interest.\u201d\n\n\u00b674 Mr. Spaulding attached to his petition a police report by Officer Richard O\u2019Brien, which states that Mr. Thomas told the officer that \u201cAnthony Shellman\u2019s girlfriend\u201d was present when Mr. Griffin was shot, but that she left the area prior to officers arriving on scene. Mr. Shellman testified at trial that Ms. Norwood was his girlfriend at that time. Mr. Spaulding attached another police report by Officer Justin Ingham, which states that the officer spoke to Ms. Norwood briefly at the scene, but while he was going after other people and telling them not to leave the scene, Ms. Norwood got into a car and left. He also attached various, additional\ncourt documents showing that attorney Walker represented Ms. Norwood in two separate criminal cases in June of 2012. Mr. Spaulding conceded that he never objected to the conflict at trial, but claimed that he \u201cwas not given the opportunity to object to the conflict because he was never made aware of it\u201d and that \u201cprejudice must be presumed.\u201d Mr. Spaulding claimed that he and Ms. Norwood had \u201ccompeting interests\u201d and that his investigator was unable to locate Ms. Norwood.\n\n{\u00b675} The trial court found that Mr. Spaulding cannot demonstrate prejudice because Ms. Norwood did not testify at trial and the evidence dehors the record does not show an actual conflict of interest. Moreover, the court found that Mr. Spaulding failed to argue how any potential conflict adversely affected attorney Walker\u2019s performance.\n\n{\u00b676} \u201cThe Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel secures to a criminal defendant both the right to competent representation and the right to representation that is free from conflicts of interest.\u201d State v. Sibley, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 16CA010908, 2017-Ohio-7015, \u00b6 7, citing Wood v. Georgia, 450 U.S. 261, 271 (1981). However, \u201cthe United States Constitution is violated by an actual conflict of interest, not a possible one.\u201d State v. Gillard, 78 Ohio St.3d 548, 552 (1997). A possible conflict exists if the \u201c\u2018interests of the defendants may diverge at some point so as to place the attorney under inconsistent duties.\u2019\u201d State v. Dillon, 74 Ohio St.3d 166, 168 (1995), quoting Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 356 (1980), fn. 3 (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Contrarily, an actual conflict is \u201ca conflict of interest that adversely affects counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 172 (2002), fn. 5. \u201c[A] defendant who fail[s] to object at trial must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d Gillard at 552. Thus, Mr. Spaulding bears the burden of demonstrating that attorney Walker \u201cactively represented\nconflicting interests,\u201d and that the conflict \u201cactually affected the adequacy of his representation.\u201d See Sibley at \u00b6 9, quoting Mickens at 171, quoting Cuyler at 349-350. See also State v. Jackson, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27478, 2015-Ohio-4356, \u00b6 15, citing Cuyler at 348.\n\n{\u00b677} We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Ms. Norwood never testified at Mr. Spaulding\u2019s trial and nothing in the evidence dehors the record demonstrates that Ms. Norwood would have testified as to multiple, masked shooters, as Mr. Spaulding now speculates. Apart from broadly claiming that he and Ms. Norwood had \u201ccompeting interests,\u201d Mr. Spaulding failed to explain what those competing interests were and failed to show any actual conflict of interest. Mr. Spaulding further failed to demonstrate how representation of Ms. Norwood in two other separate cases adversely affected attorney Walker\u2019s performance in Mr. Spaulding\u2019s case or how Mr. Spaulding suffered any prejudice from attorney Walker\u2019s representation of Ms. Norwood. We conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying this ground for relief without a hearing.\n\nGrounds for Relief 20, 21, 23, 24, 22, and 25\n\n{\u00b678} Mr. Spaulding argued in his petition that counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and present evidence of additional, alternate defense theories, specifically: (1) Mr. Thomas and Mr. Griffin were shot because of their involvement in the murder of Mr. Clark or because of their association with those who committed the murder; (2) Mr. Thomas and Mr. Griffin were shot to prevent their testimony in the Clark murder trial; (3) Mr. Thomas and Mr. Griffin were shot because Mr. Thomas was a gang member, and Mr. Griffin was involved in gang activity and may have been mistaken for Mr. Thomas; (4) Mr. Griffin was shot due to his \u201cdangerous lifestyle\u201d as a known drug dealer who was involved in illegal activity and had a reputation for violence and shootings; (5) the shootings were linked to a rash of murders that\noccurred in Akron and the Grant Street area around that same time; and (6) Mr. Spaulding was erroneously identified as the shooter because police were investigating another murder that occurred only hours before Mr. Griffin was shot and the suspect in that case (\u201cC.M.\u201d) looks similar to Mr. Spaulding, creating the possibility that media exposure tainted the identifications.\n\n{\u00b679} The trial court found that defense counsel investigated the events surrounding the shootings. Police officers testified that they investigated these issues as well. A robbery theory was rebutted by testimony that nothing was taken, and several witnesses testified that Mr. Thomas and Mr. Griffin sold drugs and that the Grant Street house was a drug house. Several witnesses also testified and were cross-examined regarding the murder of Mr. Clark. Moreover, the court found that the possibility the eyewitness identifications of Mr. Spaulding were tainted by media exposure was pure speculation. The court also found that Mr. Spaulding\u2019s evidence dehors the record did not advance his ineffective assistance claim and the issue was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n\n{\u00b680} We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Defense counsel did, in fact, suggest the alternate theories that the shootings were related to the murder of Mr. Clark or may have been drug-related. See Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, at \u00b6 48-49. Counsel also attempted to create reasonable doubt by challenging Mr. Griffin\u2019s identification of Mr. Spaulding. See id. at \u00b6 46. Moreover, Mr. Wilbur and Detective Morrison both testified as to other shootings that had occurred in the neighborhood. Lieutenant James Phister testified that robbery was ruled out as a motive for the shootings because Mr. Griffin and Mr. Thomas still had large sums of money on their persons, Ms. Singleton still had her purse, nothing was taken, and a vehicle was left running in the driveway with the keys still in it. Counsel questioned Lieutenant Phister on cross-examination\nand he agreed that a robbery can still occur when nothing is actually taken. The jury also saw police interrogations of Mr. Spaulding, where Mr. Spaulding urged police to speak to Cierra and Keyona regarding four masked men being mentioned by Ms. Singleton, which indicated a multiple shooter/masked men theory. See Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, \u00b6 31-33.\n\n\u00b681 As to the remaining alternate theories that Mr. Spaulding is now introducing, \u201c[n]ew or alternative theories and cumulative evidence to support them have never been recognized as grounds for post[-]conviction relief even if they come from new and/or different experts.\u201d State v. Wilson, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 97CA006683, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 2794, *17 (June 24, 1998). A petitioner may not \u201cseek[] to invalidate his trial because the defense did not prove to be successful, so that he might be retried and attempt an alternate theory of defense. This is not the purpose of post[-]conviction relief proceedings.\u201d State v. Doran, 9th Dist. Wayne No. 1424, 1976 Ohio App. LEXIS 6041, *10-11 (July 1, 1976). Here, defense counsel presented viable and coherent alternate theories for the shootings at trial and challenged the State\u2019s evidence in an attempt to create reasonable doubt; the mere fact that they were unsuccessful and Mr. Spaulding was found guilty does not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Mr. Spaulding has failed to demonstrate deficient performance or any resulting prejudice. We conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying these grounds for relief without a hearing.\n\nProsecutorial Misconduct\n\n\u00b682 Several grounds for relief in Mr. Spaulding\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief alleged prosecutorial misconduct.\n\u201cIn deciding whether a prosecutor\u2019s conduct rises to the level of prosecutorial misconduct, a court determines if the prosecutor\u2019s actions were improper, and, if so, whether the defendant\u2019s substantial rights were actually prejudiced.\u201d State v. Moreland, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27910, 2016-Ohio-7588, \u00b6 22, citing State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 (1984). \u201cThe Supreme Court of Ohio has limited the instances when a judgment may be reversed on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d State v. Knight, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 03CA008239, 2004-Ohio-1227, \u00b6 6, citing State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 166 (1990). \u201c[A] judgment may only be reversed for prosecutorial misconduct when the improper conduct deprives the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d Moreland at \u00b6 22, quoting Knight at \u00b6 6. \u201cThe defendant must show that, but for the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, the trier of fact would not have convicted him.\u201d Moreland at \u00b6 22. \u201cThe touchstone of the analysis \u2018is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u2019\u201d State v. Diar, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, \u00b6 140, quoting Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 219 (1982).\n\nGround for Relief 3\n\nMr. Spaulding argued prosecutorial misconduct when the prosecutor told the jury during opening statements that cell phone data showed Mr. Spaulding \u201cright in the area of 1104 Grant Street\u201d before Mr. Griffin was shot, \u201cmoving away\u201d from the area after the shooting, back in the same area again before Ms. Singleton and Mr. Thomas were shot, and out of the area again after the shootings. Mr. Spaulding argued that this was a gross exaggeration and misstatement of the evidence. During closing arguments, the prosecutor also stated, \u201cHis cell phone puts [him] there while they\u2019re being shot and moving away shortly after. And we\u2019re not talking about two or three streets away or two or three miles away. We\u2019re talking about within blocks. [His] cell phone is there.\u201d Mr. Spaulding argued that this was a misrepresentation of the facts and\nevidence. Mr. Spaulding relied again on Mr. Vassel\u2019s affidavit, where he avers that \u201c[a] person\u2019s location cannot be pinpointed so precisely by using data from cell phone towers.\u201d\n\n\u00b685 The trial court found that any alleged errors in the prosecutor\u2019s opening or closing statements were corrected by the jury instruction from the court that counsel\u2019s arguments are not evidence and that the jury would judge the facts. Moreover, the court found that Mr. Spaulding\u2019s evidence dehors the record did not even marginally advance his prosecutorial misconduct claim and the issue was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n\n\u00b686 We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. As opening and closing statements are a part of the record, Mr. Spaulding\u2019s claims could have been made on direct appeal without resorting to evidence dehors the record and are now barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Nevertheless, the trial court properly instructed the jury that opening and closing statements are not evidence, but merely intended to assist the jury in evaluating the evidence. \u201cIt is axiomatic that \u2018statements made by counsel in opening statements and closing arguments are not evidence[]\u2019 and the jury was instructed to disregard them as evidence accordingly.\u201d State v. Carr, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26661, 2014-Ohio-806, \u00b6 16, quoting State v. Frazier, 73 Ohio St.3d 323, 338 (1995). \u201cIt is presumed that the jury will follow the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d State v. Manor, 9th Dist. Summit No. 14376, 1990 Ohio App. LEXIS 2182, *3 (May 30, 1990). Furthermore, Detective Moledor did not testify that he could pinpoint Mr. Spaulding\u2019s location exactly using his cell phone records. He testified that he could only map a \u201cgeneral area\u201d of a cell phone\u2019s location when it uses a cell tower. He only concluded that Mr. Spaulding\u2019s phone placed multiple calls between 2:04 A.M. and 2:15 A.M., and between 7:58 A.M. and 8:08 A.M., on December 11, 2011, using the cell phone towers in the vicinity of 1104 Grant Street. Therefore, considering the evidence presented at trial, we\ncannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s generalized remarks in her opening and closing statements were improper. Mr. Spaulding has not demonstrated how he was prejudiced by these remarks or how they deprived him of his right to a fair trial. We conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying this ground for relief without a hearing.\n\nGrounds for Relief 13 and 16\n\n\u00b687 Mr. Spaulding argued that the State failed to correct: (1) Nurse Trenkelbach\u2019s testimony regarding when Mr. Griffin last received morphine prior to being shown the photo arrays, which he claims was contradicted by Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records; and (2) Mr. Wilbur\u2019s testimony regarding his drug usage at the time of the shootings, which was contradicted by his criminal history. Mr. Spaulding attached Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records as well as documents from Mr. Wilbur\u2019s criminal cases in support of his arguments.\n\n\u00b688 The trial court found that Mr. Spaulding failed to argue that Nurse Trenkelbach\u2019s alleged false testimony affected the judgment of the jury. The court further found that a drug possession charge does not indicate that Mr. Wilbur lied on the stand about the last time he used drugs, and Mr. Spaulding\u2019s argument to the contrary is pure speculation. Mr. Spaulding failed to argue that Mr. Wilbur\u2019s marijuana charge was material to Mr. Spaulding\u2019s case or how the information would have affected the judgment of the jury. The court also found that the evidence dehors the record did not even marginally advance his claims of prosecutorial misconduct and the issues were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n\n\u00b689 \u201c[T]he prosecutor, as an agent of the state, has a constitutional duty to assure the defendant a fair trial. Consistent therewith is the obligation of the prosecutor (1) to refrain from knowingly using perjured testimony, (2) to disclose certain evidence favorable to the accused,\nand (3) to correct testimony he knows to be false.\u201d State v. Staten, 14 Ohio App.3d 78 (2d Dist.1984), paragraph one of the syllabus. See also Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103 (1935).\n\n\u00b690 We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records were introduced into evidence at trial and, therefore, Mr. Spaulding could have raised this issue in his direct appeal; he is consequently barred by the doctrine of res judicata from raising it now. See State v. Cureton, 9th Dist. Medina Nos. 03CA0009-M and 03CA0010-M, 2003-Ohio-6010, \u00b6 13. Nonetheless, while Mr. Spaulding argues that Nurse Trenkelbach\u2019s testimony is contradicted by Mr. Griffin\u2019s medical records, he fails to argue or demonstrate that the prosecutor actually knew the testimony to be false.\n\n\u00b691 As to Mr. Wilbur\u2019s criminal history, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s determination that the issue is barred by res judicata. Evidence dehors the record indicating that Mr. Wilbur was arrested on drug charges near the date that the underlying crimes in Mr. Spaulding\u2019s case were committed meets the threshold standard of cogency required to survive preclusion by res judicata. However, Mr. Spaulding argues that Mr. Wilbur\u2019s marijuana case \u201cstrongly implies\u201d that he possessed marijuana for personal use and that \u201cit is far from \u2018speculative\u2019 to assume a known drug user, caught with and charged with possession of drugs, is using drugs,\u201d and this Court is unpersuaded by such a precarious attempt to amalgamate or confuse the definitions of \u201cpossession\u201d and \u201cuse.\u201d As the Supreme Court of Ohio has stated, \u201c\u2018Possession and use are not equivalent.\u2019\u201d State v. Thomas, 152 Ohio St.3d 15, 2017-Ohio-8011, \u00b6 37, quoting Kaufman v. People, 202 P.3d 542, 555 (Colo.2009). \u201c\u2018Possess\u2019 or \u2018possession\u2019 means having control over a thing or substance * * *.\u201d R.C. 2925.01(K). \u201cIn this context, \u2018use\u2019 means \u2018[t]he action of consuming something as food, drink, a drug, etc.\u2019\u201d Heimer v. Companion\nLife Ins. Co., 879 F.3d 172, 174 (6th Cir.2018), quoting Oxford English Dictionary (3d Ed.2011). Mr. Spaulding has provided no evidence to demonstrate that Mr. Wilbur actually used marijuana or was actually intoxicated in any way on the day of the shootings or any other day relevant to his testimony. Thus, regardless of our disagreement with the trial court\u2019s reliance on res judicata here, we agree with the trial court that Mr. Spaulding has failed to demonstrate how Mr. Wilbur\u2019s testimony was false or contradictory, or that the prosecutor knew it to be false. See Wesson, 2012-Ohio-4495, at \u00b6 31, quoting Rude, 2011-Ohio-6789, at \u00b6 21, quoting Billings, 2006-Ohio-764, at \u00b6 19 (\u201c[T]his Court will not reverse a correct judgment merely because of a flaw in the trial court\u2019s analysis[,]\u201d but shall \u201c\u2018affirm a trial court\u2019s judgment that is legally correct on other grounds * * *.\u2019\u201d).\n\n{\u00b692} We cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper or that Mr. Spaulding was deprived of his right to a fair trial. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying these grounds for relief without a hearing.\n\nGround for Relief 19\n\n{\u00b693} Mr. Spaulding argued that the State failed to disclose favorable, exculpatory evidence, specifically Mr. Griffin\u2019s text messages, which showed he could have been shot as a result of his \u201cdangerous lifestyle.\u201d He claimed that \u201c[i]t does not appear that the State turned these text messages over to trial counsel\u201d as they were in the prosecutor\u2019s files but not defense counsel\u2019s files. He claimed the text messages showed that Mr. Griffin had an \u201cextensive text message conversation\u201d with someone a month before he was shot, in which the other person \u201cappeared to be pleading for his life\u201d while Mr. Griffin \u201cwas apparently threatening to kill\u201d the person.\nIf the State withholds material, exculpatory evidence, it offends a criminal defendant\u2019s due process rights. *State v. Charlton*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 12CA010206, 2014-Ohio-1330, \u00b6 32, citing *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). \u201c\u2018However, it is []the defendant\u2019s burden to establish that the evidence is both favorable and material and that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different if the evidence had been provided.\u2019\u201d *Charlton* at \u00b6 32, quoting *State v. Moultry*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 25065, 2010-Ohio-3010, \u00b6 9.\n\nMr. Spaulding attached a copy of Mr. Griffin\u2019s text messages, and specifically directed the court to communications between Mr. Griffin and one unknown individual in particular. The individual apologizes for apparently getting caught using Mr. Griffin\u2019s name at the Oriana House after receiving a \u201cticket,\u201d and Mr. Griffin is seemingly upset. Mr. Spaulding focuses specifically on three lines of text from Mr. Griffin, where he states, \u201cI swear on my dead granny n***a I\u2019m gasing you true story[,]\u201d \u201cN***a f**k u b over y\u2019all house Imma show\u2026 dnt beg now ur done on my kids[,]\u201d and \u201cU leaving me no choice bt to have u gunnz.\u201d The first text exchange between the two individuals begins on November 4, 2011, and is as follows:\n\n**INCOMING:** Bro I f****d up i tried to take care of it witout tellin but that wouldn\u2019t of been real what i did wasn\u2019t real dnt kno how u go react but yo name a b cleared tmrw\n\n**OUTGOING:** What u mean\n\n**INCOMING:** Im in the Oriana\n\n**INCOMING:** Im textn u now i f****d up\n\n**OUTGOING:** Man u ain\u2019t n damn ori let me find out u use my name and I swear on my dead granny n***a I\u2019m gasing u true story so. U better say it now cuz when I get home um looking on da computer\n\n**INCOMING:** You already talkin bout gasin me before I explained nothing is goin to happen to you\nINCOMING: I got a ticket and I misrepresented you. You gotta go see Ms. Diana at 7th floor 114. You signed it, I went and admitted it. They will switch the names. That\u2019s all you have. Nothing to worry about. Everything good. I told them I misrepresented your name. She already knows. So, see her and give a signature. I will have to face the dark tint. A piece of k was on my shirt. Nothing serious. I didn\u2019t mean to do this. I went straight down there and told them I should have been told. But I didn\u2019t know what to do. It ain\u2019t no police. So please don\u2019t take this the wrong way. Man, I know it was wrong. Please don\u2019t take me out or get me out. I ain\u2019t the police. I went straight down there and told them I misrepresented you. I ain\u2019t never done nothing to where you can\u2019t trust me. I f***ed up. Please forgive me. Don\u2019t do nothing. Keep it between us. It\u2019s like this never happened. Just sign your signature to show it wasn\u2019t you and walk out. But be there at 1030 11 to 7th floor Ms. Diana.\n\nOUTGOING: N***a, fuck you.

It ain\u2019t gotta go like that. You not in no type of trouble we pose to be n***s.\n\nINCOMING: It\u2019s like it never happened. Just go tomorrow at 1030 11 to 7th floor Ms. Diana. She a take care of it. And you a c how I cleared it. They said I would still have to show to get it dismissed. But all I ask is to come to you if you really feel that way. Don\u2019t traumatize my bm n my daughter. We can handle it the right way. But it was wrong but deep down it ain\u2019t serious. I took the blame for my mistake and nothing go happen to you.\n\nOUTGOING: Answer the phone.\n\nOUTGOING: How you gon admit yo what you did of I ain\u2019t answering.\n\nINCOMING: Could I still call to holla at you needed to yank on you when you ready asap.\n\nOUTGOING: Ok.\n\nA second conversation between the two individuals occurs on November 7, 2011, and is as follows:\n\nOUTGOING: Blow down on me real quick.\n\nINCOMING: Ok where at.\n\nOUTGOING: I\u2019m pulling up to yo house. Let\u2019s catch this round real quick.\n\nINCOMING: Ok bro. We can catch a round but 4 wat we can solve it a diff way plus not rite now im baby sitten I got ma daughter.

The court also agreed with the State that Mr. Spaulding did not present evidence dehors the record that counsel did not have access to Mr. Griffin\u2019s text messages, nor did he demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the absence of the text messages at trial.\n\n{\u00b698} We conclude that some of the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Mr. Spaulding concedes that this evidence was in the prosecutor\u2019s files, which contradicts his speculative claim that the evidence was not provided to, or was somehow withheld from, defense counsel by the prosecutor. Summit County maintains an \u201copen-file discovery\u201d policy whereby \u201c[d]efense counsel must * * * review the [p]rosecutor\u2019s file for pertinent evidence and factual determinations as to the truth of the charge * * *.\u201d S.C.C. Rule 21.06. Mr. Spaulding has failed to provide any evidence dehors the record to show how these text messages, which were in existence and available for defense counsel to review at or before trial, were withheld by the State or somehow not provided to defense counsel. Mr. Spaulding has also failed to demonstrate how he has been prejudiced and failed to establish a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different. While Mr. Spaulding focuses exclusively on the conversations between Mr. Griffin and this unknown individual on November 4th and November 7th to support his argument that Mr. Griffin led a \u201cdangerous lifestyle\u201d and \u201cthreaten[ed] to kill\u201d someone who was \u201cpleading for his life,\u201d he ignores the overwhelming\nmajority of text messages between these two individuals afterward, indicating that the two appear to be friends. The two text each other often on November 10th, 13th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 20th, 25th, 27th, 28th, 30th, December 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th, 11th, 12th, and 13th. The unknown individual twice asks Mr. Griffin to borrow clothes. At one point Mr. Griffin texts, \u201cBro I need a favor.\u201d The individual asks Mr. Griffin, \u201cHow everything goin or went bro\u201d and later asks him for help with something. They also appear to discuss smoking marijuana together a couple of times.\n\nWhile we once again disagree with the trial court\u2019s determination that res judicata applies here, Mr. Spaulding has failed to show any improper conduct by the prosecutor or any resulting prejudice. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying this ground for relief without a hearing. See Wesson, 2012-Ohio-4495, at \u00b6 31, quoting Rude, 2011-Ohio-6789, at \u00b6 21, quoting Billings, 2006-Ohio-764, at \u00b6 19 (\u201c[T]his Court will not reverse a correct judgment merely because of a flaw in the trial court\u2019s analysis[,]\u201d but shall \u201c\u2018affirm a trial court\u2019s judgment that is legally correct on other grounds * * *.\u2019\u201d).\n\nGround for Relief 26\n\nMr. Spaulding argued prosecutorial misconduct because the State presented false and misleading evidence that was \u201cbeyond the bounds of science[,]\u201d specifically the testimony of the BCI forensic scientist, Mr. Roberts, that it was his opinion that the four cartridges recovered from the two crime scenes were fired by the same gun. Mr. Spaulding referred again to the report from Mr. Nixon, citing the NAS Report regarding toolmark uniqueness, and argued that \u201cexpert testimony that purports to determine definitively that a particular gun must have fired a particular bullet is not currently supported by science.\u201d\nThe trial court found that the argument was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Moreover, the court found that Mr. Spaulding\u2019s evidence dehors the record did not advance his argument that the prosecutor presented false ballistics evidence through a BCI analyst.\n\nAlthough we disagree with the trial court\u2019s determination that this claim is barred by res judicata, we conclude that some of the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Mr. Roberts testified at trial that in his opinion, based on a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, the four cartridges \u201cwere fired from one firearm\u201d and his findings were documented in his report. The prosecutor asked, \u201c[I]s that your opinion 100 percent without question?\u201d and Mr. Roberts said, \u201cCorrect.\u201d The NAS Report does not fully support Mr. Spaulding\u2019s claims that Mr. Roberts\u2019 testimony was \u201cbeyond the bounds of science\u201d or \u201cnot currently supported by science.\u201d In fact, \u201c[t]he NAS Report was not a wholesale repudiation of forensic ballistics evidence or so-called \u2018toolmark identification\u2019 * * *.\u201d Rice v. Gavin, E.D.Pa. No. 15-291, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21258, *26 (Feb. 18, 2016). In the NAS Report\u2019s summary assessment, the committee criticizes the \u201climitations\u201d of toolmark and firearms analysis, but nonetheless concedes: \u201cIndividual patterns from manufacture or from wear might, in some cases, be distinctive enough to suggest one particular source, but additional studies should be performed to make the process of individualization more precise and repeatable.\u201d Thus, we conclude that the NAS Report does not establish that the prosecutor presented \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d ballistics testimony through Mr. Roberts\u2019 testimony. Accordingly, we cannot say that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper or that Mr. Spaulding was deprived of his right to a fair trial. We conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying this ground for relief without a hearing. See Wesson, 2012-Ohio-4495, at \u00b6 31, quoting Rude, 2011-Ohio-6789, at \u00b6 21, quoting Billings, 2006-Ohio-764, at \u00b6 19 (\u201c[T]his Court will not reverse a\ncorrect judgment merely because of a flaw in the trial court\u2019s analysis[,]\u201d but shall \u201c\u2018affirm a trial court\u2019s judgment that is legally correct on other grounds * * *.\u2019\u201d).\n\nGrounds for Relief 27 and 28\n\n\u00b6103 Mr. Spaulding argued prosecutorial misconduct because the State elicited testimony from a BCI forensic scientist, Stacy Violi, that three swabs taken from Mr. Spaulding\u2019s shoes were presumptively positive for blood and a partial DNA profile consistent with Mr. Spaulding was obtained from one of the swabs. The State then misrepresented this evidence in closing arguments to suggest that the blood of one of the victims was found on Mr. Spaulding\u2019s shoes. He further argued that the State elicited testimony from Lieutenant Phister which it \u201cknew or should have known to be misleading or categorically false[,]\u201d specifically that Lieutenant Phister conducted a \u201cvictimology\u201d to attempt to determine what could make Mr. Griffin the target of a crime, but he was unable to determine any suspects who would want to shoot Mr. Griffin.\n\n\u00b6104 Mr. Spaulding attached no evidence dehors the record to support his argument regarding the blood on his shoes, but instead stated that \u201cthe dehors the record evidence that will prove the State\u2019s misconduct is the results from the DNA testing of the remaining blood spots.\u201d He attached various exhibits to demonstrate Mr. Griffin\u2019s \u201cdangerous lifestyle\u201d involving drugs, gangs, and violence, including: Mr. Griffin\u2019s text messages; Mr. Fields\u2019 affidavit; numerous police reports regarding Mr. Clark\u2019s murder; an affidavit from an FBI agent investigating Mr. Griffin for extortion; an online newspaper article regarding the shooting of Mr. Griffin and the murders of Ms. Singleton and Mr. Thomas; indictments for Mr. Thomas and Mr. Griffin that include criminal gang activity for Mr. Thomas and drug-related charges for both men; an online\ndocket for a case involving gang-related charges for Mr. Thomas; and police reports from separate incidents where Mr. Griffin and other individuals were shot, robbed, or arrested.\n\n{\u00b6105} The trial court found that the DNA evidence presented at trial proved to be irrelevant to the State\u2019s case and that it only demonstrated the extent of the police investigation conducted. The court further found that these arguments were barred by the doctrine of res judicata and that \u201c[t]here is no authority for the proposition that the prosecutor commits misconduct by \u2018eliciting testimony\u2019 from its witnesses.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6106} We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. Ms. Violi testified that she conducted DNA analysis on three swabs that were presumptively positive for blood and were found on Mr. Spaulding\u2019s shoes. One swab contained a profile consistent with Mr. Spaulding, but no DNA profiles were obtained from the other swabs. In her closing arguments, the prosecutor stated:\n\n[W]e do have blood on his shoes. Now, you all saw that booking video. It was deliberate, pick up one foot, check it out, pick up the other foot, and check it out. Now, shoes cost more than clothes. I think we all know that. So perhaps he thought, Oh, I\u2019ll just give my shoes a good scrub and get rid of all the blood; but the clothes, you know, maybe you can\u2019t get it out. We know he\u2019s been sitting in the jail watching CSI so I can assume he\u2019s watching it at home, but he missed some spots, because there is blood on his shoes.\n\nNowhere in this statement does the prosecutor \u201cmisrepresent[] the evidence [and argue that] the blood belonged to one of the victims[,]\u201d as Mr. Spaulding has argued. Ms. Violi\u2019s DNA report was entered into evidence at trial and Mr. Spaulding failed to submit any evidence dehors the record in support of his argument. As the report, Ms. Violi\u2019s testimony, and closing arguments were all in the record, Mr. Spaulding\u2019s argument could have been raised on direct appeal and is now barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\nLieutenant Phister testified that the police conducted a \u201cvictimology\u201d of Mr. Griffin whereby:\n\nWe look at the victim of the crime and when it\u2019s an unknown suspect, and we try and determine what has the victim done, what\u2019s his -- who are his associates, what are his previous crimes, who are his friends, and trying to figure out what would make him a victim of that crime or what would make him the target of that crime.\n\nHe further testified that the police were not able to determine any suspects who would have wanted to shoot Mr. Griffin. Mr. Griffin\u2019s criminal history was all drug-related. He was never charged with any robberies or shootings and he was never a suspect in the murder of Mr. Clark. No weapons had been found on Mr. Griffin or in his vehicle after he was shot. Mr. Spaulding has not demonstrated that Lieutenant Phister\u2019s testimony was false or that the prosecutor knew the testimony to be false or misleading. Moreover, this argument could have been raised on direct appeal and is now barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n\nWe cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of these witnesses was improper. We also cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing arguments were improper. Mr. Spaulding has failed to demonstrate how he was deprived of his right to a fair trial. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in denying these grounds for relief without a hearing.\n\n**Cumulative Error**\n\n**Grounds for Relief 10, 34, and 35**\n\nMr. Spaulding argued that even if none of his grounds for relief are well-taken, the cumulative effect of the errors and omissions warranted relief. He also argued that his \u201ccounsel entirely failed to mount a defense\u201d and presented a lengthy summary of all of the arguments previously raised in his petition.\nThe trial court found that none of Mr. Spaulding\u2019s claims had any merit and he, therefore, cannot establish a constitutional violation by joining the claims together.\n\nWe conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and credible evidence. The Supreme Court of Ohio has recognized the cumulative error doctrine. See State v. DeMarco, 31 Ohio St.3d 191 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus. According to this doctrine:\n\n[Errors during trial, \u201csingularly, may not rise to the level of prejudicial error, [but] a conviction will be reversed where the cumulative effect of the errors deprives a defendant of the constitutional right to a fair trial.\u201d \u201c[E]ven to consider whether \u2018cumulative\u2019 error is present, [the court] would first have to find that multiple errors were committed in this case.\u201d\n\n(Citations omitted.) Wesson, 2012-Ohio-4495, at \u00b6 113. The trial court found no errors in Mr. Spaulding\u2019s grounds for relief and, therefore, rejected his cumulative error grounds for relief. Mr. Spaulding mistakenly claims that the trial court failed to specifically rule on his 35th ground for relief. But, a footnote to the subheading entitled \u201cCUMULATIVE ERROR * * *\u201d in the trial court\u2019s order clearly states that the section addresses \u201cGrounds for Relief 10, 34, and 35.\u201d Moreover, in the trial court\u2019s \u201cCONCLUSION\u201d section, it explicitly states: \u201cSpaulding\u2019s cumulative errors claims (Grounds for Relief 10, 34, and 35) fail as a matter of law for failure to demonstrate a single meritorious error during the trial or mitigation phase.\u201d This Court, having reviewed all of Mr. Spaulding\u2019s grounds for relief, concludes that the trial court did not err in rejecting Mr. Spaulding\u2019s cumulative error grounds for relief without a hearing.\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter a thorough review of the record in this case, we conclude that Mr. Spaulding did not present sufficient operative facts and evidence dehors the record in support of his grounds for relief in his petition for post-conviction relief, and thus the trial court did not err or\nabuse its discretion in denying his 35 grounds for relief and in determining that an evidentiary hearing was not warranted. Some of Mr. Spaulding\u2019s arguments are barred by the doctrine of res judicata as they could have or should have been raised in his direct appeal, while others actually were raised in his direct appeal. The evidence dehors the record that he submitted, while voluminous in size, did not add much, if anything, to the substance of his claims. Mr. Spaulding sometimes strategically focused only on certain parts of evidence out of context, while ignoring other parts that did not support his arguments and sometimes even contradicted them. Mr. Spaulding has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, or cumulative error.\n\n{\u00b6113} Accordingly, Mr. Spaulding\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR FOUR\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT DENIED SPAULDING RELIEF WITHOUT AFFORDING HIM THE NECESSARY DUE PROCESS TO MEET HIS BURDEN.\n\n{\u00b6114} In his fourth assignment of error, Mr. Spaulding argues that he was denied \u201cthe necessary due process to which he should be entitled\u201d during the post-conviction process because he had no right to a hearing, no ability to obtain discovery, and his arguments were constrained by the three-page per claim limit under the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure. Because Mr. Spaulding did not raise this argument below, we decline to address it and therefore overrule it.\n\n{\u00b6115} We review a constitutional challenge de novo. State v. Franks, 9th Dist. Summit No. 28533, 2017-Ohio-7045, \u00b6 21. We note once again that a petitioner seeking post-conviction relief is not automatically entitled to a hearing. Phillips, 2002 Ohio App. LEXIS 788, at *6, citing Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d at 282. Moreover, \u201cthere is no right to discovery in a post-\nconviction proceeding.\u201d Coleman, 2015-Ohio-752, at \u00b6 5. This Court has also stated that the three-page limit provided by Crim.R. 35 is reasonable and affords petitioners ample opportunity to concisely present each ground for relief. State v. White, 9th Dist. Summit No. 19040, 1999 Ohio App. LEXIS 2721, *10 (June 16, 1999). \u201c[E]ven in capital cases, we have upheld page limitations, finding that they force counsel to winnow out weaker arguments and focus on key issues.\u201d Id., quoting Ziegler v. Wendel Poultry Serv., Inc., 67 Ohio St.3d 10, 22 (1993), overruled in part on other grounds Fidelholtz v. Peller, 81 Ohio St.3d 197 (1998). Additionally, Crim.R. 35 does not restrict the number of grounds for relief that may be presented and further permits the trial court to extend the page limit. White at *10. Mr. Spaulding even admits to having availed himself of the lack of any limit to the number of grounds he may present, as he chose to parse out his global claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and cumulative error into 35 separate grounds for relief in his petition. He states that \u201cbecause of the page limitation imposed by Crim.R. 35, [he] has had to subdivide his ineffectiveness claims into smaller claims.\u201d\n\n\u00b6116 This Court is cognizant of the recent changes to the post-conviction relief statute, effective April 6, 2017, including the addition of R.C. 2953.21(A)(6), which states in part: \u201cNotwithstanding any law or court rule to the contrary, there is no limit on the number of pages in, or on the length of, a petition filed * * * by a person who has been sentenced to death * * *.\u201d However, as Mr. Spaulding concedes in his merit brief, these changes do not apply to him as his petition was filed prior to April 6, 2017.\n\n\u00b6117 Nevertheless, although Mr. Spaulding raised 35 grounds for relief in his petition, none of them challenged the constitutionality of R.C. 2953.21 et seq. or Crim.R. 35 and claimed that his due process rights were violated because he had no right to a hearing, no ability to obtain\ndiscovery, or was constrained by page limits; he has consequently forfeited these arguments for purposes of appeal. \u201cThe failure to challenge the constitutionality of a statute in the trial court forfeits all but plain error on appeal, and the burden of demonstrating plain error is on the party asserting it.\u201d State v. Smith, 9th Dist. Wayne No. 15AP0001, 2017-Ohio-359, \u00b6 28, quoting State v. Quarterman, 140 Ohio St.3d 464, 2014-Ohio-4034, \u00b6 2. As Mr. Spaulding failed to raise these issues at the trial court level, he has forfeited all but plain error. See id. He has not raised plain error on appeal and we decline to create a plain error argument on his behalf. See State v. Boatright, 9th Dist. Summit No. 28101, 2017-Ohio-5794, \u00b6 8.\n\n\u00b6118 Mr. Spaulding\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR TWO\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DENYING SPAULDING\u2019S POST-CONVICTION PETITION WITHOUT FIRST ALLOWING SPAULDING TO CONDUCT DNA TESTING AND RELATED DISCOVERY.\n\n\u00b6119 In his second assignment of error, Mr. Spaulding argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for DNA testing for failure to comply with R.C. 2953.72(A) because R.C. 2953.84 provides other means apart from R.C. 2953.71 et seq. to obtain post-conviction DNA testing. As this Court is without jurisdiction to review a denial of an application for DNA testing when the offender has been sentenced to death, pursuant to R.C. 2953.73(E)(1), we decline to reach the merits of Mr. Spaulding\u2019s argument and therefore overrule this assignment of error.\n\n\u00b6120 This Court does not have the authority to review the trial court\u2019s denial of Mr. Spaulding\u2019s motion for DNA testing in this case. Pursuant to R.C. 2953.73(E)(1), if an eligible offender is sentenced to death and submits an application for DNA testing that is rejected by the trial court, the trial court\u2019s judgment may only be appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio. See\nState v. Noling, 136 Ohio St.3d 163, 2013-Ohio-1764, paragraph one of the syllabus (\"R.C. 2953.73(E)(1) * * * grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Supreme Court of Ohio to review rejections of applications for DNA testing in cases in which the death penalty is imposed * * *.\") See also State v. Noling, 149 Ohio St.3d 327, 2016-Ohio-8252, \u00b6 64 (severing unconstitutional statutory provisions from R.C. 2953.73(E)(1) and R.C. 2953.72(A)(8) that previously required capital offenders to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio, thus providing an appeal of right solely to the Supreme Court of Ohio for capital offenders who are denied post-conviction DNA testing). \u201cCourts of appeals do not have jurisdiction to review any rejection if the offender was sentenced to death for the offense for which the offender claims to be an eligible offender and is requesting DNA testing.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2953.73(E)(1). Mr. Spaulding was sentenced to death for the offenses for which he requests DNA testing. The trial court found that he did not submit his application for DNA testing on the appropriate form in accordance with R.C. 2953.72(A). Consequently, we must conclude that this Court is without jurisdiction to review the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for DNA testing1.\n\n{\u00b6121} Mr. Spaulding also argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for related discovery. As Mr. Spaulding has failed to comply with App.R. 16(A)(7), we decline to reach the merits of this particular argument and therefore overrule it.\n\n1 Pending legislation would amend R.C. 2953.73(E) to provide district courts of appeals with jurisdiction over appeals of all rejections of applications for DNA testing from courts of common pleas, whether or not the offender was sentenced to death. See 2017 Bill Text OH H.B. 389. However, this change would not affect Mr. Spaulding because \u201c[a]n offender who was sentenced to death before the effective date of this act shall have the same rights to appeal and to post[-]conviction remedies as the offender had under the provisions of Chapter 2953. of the Revised Code as those provisions existed immediately before the effective date of this act or as those provisions may hereafter be amended, and courts shall have the same powers and duties with respect to those offenders under those provisions as courts had before the effective date of this act.\u201d Id.\nMr. Spaulding's motion for related discovery included allegations that \u201ctrial counsel put no effort into having the State\u2019s physical evidence inspected or scientifically tested\u201d and therefore requested permission to conduct testing of bullet casings, cigar butts, a ten dollar bill, a baggie containing marijuana, a water bottle, and a cigar holder. As this motion was combined with Mr. Spaulding\u2019s motion for DNA testing, the trial court\u2019s order summarily denied it by stating \u201cPetitioner\u2019s Motion for Testing and Related Discovery is OVERRULED.\u201d (Emphasis added.).\n\n\u201c[T]his Court has repeatedly held that there is no right to discovery in a post-conviction proceeding.\u201d State v. Coleman, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27506, 2015-Ohio-752, \u00b6 5. Nevertheless, Mr. Spaulding has failed to identify or argue in his merit brief exactly how the trial court erred in denying his motion for related discovery. He broadly claims that \u201c[t]he court erred in denying the discovery motion\u201d and that he \u201cwas denied due process in his post-conviction appeal[,]\u201d but fails to advance any argument to support these claims in accordance with App.R. 16(A)(7). Accordingly, we may disregard this part of Mr. Spaulding\u2019s assignment of error for failure to argue his claim, as required under App.R. 16(A). See App.R. 12(A)(2). See also Cardone, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 2028 at *22 (\u201cIf an argument exists that can support this assignment of error, it is not this [C]ourt\u2019s duty to root it out\u201d).\n\nMr. Spaulding\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\nIII.\n\nMr. Spaulding\u2019s first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error are overruled.

SABO JONATHAN D. FREED\n136 West Main Street 429 Fallriver Drive\nP.O. Box 1008 Reynoldsburg, OH 43068\nLancaster, OH 43130\nDefendant-Appellant Jonathan D. Freed appeals the May 27, 2019 judgment of conviction and sentence of the Fairfield County Municipal Court, Lancaster, Ohio. Plaintiff-Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nOn January 28, 2019, Trooper Cummins of the Ohio State Highway Patrol was parked in a driveway on Columbus-Lancaster Road, also known as Business Route 33A, just north of Coonpath Road. Cummins was monitoring traffic. His attention was drawn to a Toyota minivan, driven by appellant. Cummins is trained in the visual estimation of speed and visually estimated appellant was traveling faster than the posted speed limit of 55 miles per hour, estimating approximately 67 miles per hour. Cummins then used a laser speed measuring tool to verify appellants speed. Per the laser tool, appellant was traveling at 68 miles per hour. Cummins initiated a traffic stop and cited appellant for speeding in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D)(1). Cummins provided appellant with an arraignment date of February 12, 2018.\n\nOn January 29, 2019, appellant, proceeding pro se, filed a motion to dismiss arguing the complaint was defective, failing to plead all elements of a violation of R.C. 4511.21(D)(1), and further was not \"made upon oath before any person authorized by law to administer oaths.\" Appellant argued therefore the complaint was invalid and the trial court was without jurisdiction over the matter.\n\nOn February 6, 2019, appellant filed an objection pursuant to R.C. 2937.21, objecting to the trial court's continuance and the delay in ruling on his motion to dismiss. The same day, he filed a demand for discovery.\n\u00b6 5 Appellant appeared at his arraignment on February 12, 2019 as scheduled and objected to the proceeding. When appellant asked the magistrate to rule on his motions, the magistrate explained appellant was present for arraignment, not trial and entered a not guilty plea on appellant's behalf. A motions hearing was set for March 5, 2019.\n\n\u00b6 6 Following his arraignment, appellant filed a \"Def's Motion for R.C. 2937.21 Discharge Forthwith,\" and \"Def's Objections and Req For Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.\"\n\n\u00b6 7 At the March 5 motions hearing, the trial court found the magistrate was not required to rule on appellant's motions, that R.C. 2937.21 was inapplicable to the proceedings, and the court was not required to address appellant's filings within 10 days. The trial court further found the balance of the matters raised in appellant's motions pertained to matters of fact to be decided at trial.\n\n\u00b6 8 A trial to the court was held on March 27, 2019. Appellant proceeded pro se.\n\n\u00b6 9 The state presented one witness, Trooper Cummins. Cummins testified that when he confirmed appellant was traveling over the posted speed limit of 55 miles per hour, he was using an Ultralyte LTI 20/20 laser, the laser tool of choice for the Ohio State Highway Patrol. Cummins stated he is trained and certified in the use of the laser and explained there is no difference between models of laser detectors as far as the underlying technology is concerned. Although some have advanced features for use in inclement weather, there is no difference model-to-model as to how speed is detected.\n\n\u00b6 10 Cummins also confirmed that he performs a calibration check of his laser both before and after his shift, each and every shift. He completed the appropriate checks\non the day in question, and the laser detector was functioning properly. The state asked the trial court to take judicial notice of the reliability of the Ultralyte LTI 20/20 per State v. Michael King, Fairfield County Municipal Court Number 92TRC10101. Appellant objected stating there was no evidence that Cummins was using the same model and series as that involved in the King case. The state responded that Cummins testified the underlying technology has not changed since 1992. The trial court overruled appellant's objection pursuant to Evid.R. 201(b)(1), finding the accuracy of the Ultralyte LTI 20/20 is a fact generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court of fact.\n\n\u00b6 11 On cross-examination, Cummins further explained he knew the laser was accurate that day due to its self-calibration, the fact that it displayed no error messages, and the additional fact that he conducted his field checks as required both before and after his shift.\n\n\u00b6 12 After the state rested, appellant made a Crim.R 29 motion for acquittal which the trial court denied. Appellant then made a brief statement on his own behalf and rested. The trial court found appellant guilty. The trial court fined appellant $100 and suspended $50.\n\n\u00b6 13 Appellant filed an appeal, and the matter is now before this court for consideration. He raises six assignments of error as follow:\n\n\u00b6 14 \"THE MUNICIPAL COURT JUDGE ERRED TO THE APPELLANT'S DETRIMENT AND DEMONSTRATED HIS MISUNDERSTANDING OF LAW BY SAYING HE WOULD DETERMINE \"WHETHER OR NOT THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT WAS 55 MILES PER HOUR, WHETHER OR NOT YOU WERE INDEED EXCEEDING THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT, AND IF YOU WERE, BY HOW MUCH\", AND, BY ALL\nINDICATIONS, DOING EXACTLY THAT AND NO MORE, EVEN THOUGH OHIO'S LEGISLATIVE SERVICE COMMISSION, LEADING ATTORNEYS, AND COURTS FROM OUR OHIO SUPREME COURT ON DOWN HAVE AGREED ON SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR VARIATIONS OF THIS: A SPEED LIMIT IS DETERMINED \"NOT BY SPEED LIMIT SIGNAGE\", AND A PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE \"CANNOT \u2026 CLAIM THAT IT CAN ENFORCE WHATEVER SPEED LIMIT IS POSTED IN THE AREA, AS OHIO LAW DICTATES THE REQUIRED SPEED LIMIT ON HIGHWAYS\"; THIS FIFTH DISTRICT COURT'S ULTIMATE DECISION IN STATE V.

Pro se appellants, however, like members of the bar, are required to comply with the rules of practice and procedure. *Hardy v. Belmont Correctional Inst.*, 10th Dist. No. 06AP-116, 2006-Ohio-3316, \u00b6 9. Although we will ordinarily indulge a pro se litigant when there is some semblance of compliance with the appellate rules, we may not consider that which is outside the record. \"A reviewing court cannot add matter to the record before it that was not part of the trial court's proceedings, and then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter. See, *State v. Ishmail*, 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 377 N.E.2d 500 (1978). In other words, new material and factual assertions contained in any brief before this court may not be considered. *Dzina v. Celebrezze*, 108 Ohio St.3d 385, 2006-Ohio-1195, 843 N.E.2d 1202, \u00b6 16. We therefore decline to consider appellant's references to matters outside the record.\n\n{\u00b6 21} Moreover, Local Rule 9 (B) states:\n\n{\u00b6 22} \"Length of Briefs. In addition to the requirements of App.R. 16, no brief by any party in an appeal or original action, excluding appendices, table of contents, table of cases, statement of assignments of errors, and statement of the issues shall exceed thirty pages, unless, upon a motion requesting an increase of a specific number of pages and the showing of good cause, this Court orders otherwise. No reply brief shall exceed fifteen pages.\"\n\n{\u00b6 23} Appellant has exceeded these limits without leave of the court. We therefore will not consider pages 39 and 40 of appellant's brief, nor pages 16-27 of his reply brief.\nWe address appellant's first three assignments of error together, as they are interrelated. Within these assignments of error, appellant argues that the characteristics of Route 33(A) dictate a speed of 70 miles per hour rather than the posted 55 miles per hour limit, that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has not made the speed limit on Business Route 33(A) 55 miles per hour, and any finding that the speed limit on Business Route 33(A) is 55 miles per hour is against the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.\n\nAppellant was convicted of speeding in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D)(1). That section states:\n\n(D) No person shall operate a motor vehicle, trackless trolley, or streetcar upon a street or highway as follows:\n\n(1) At a speed exceeding fifty-five miles per hour, except upon a two-lane state route as provided in division (B)(10) of this section and upon a highway, expressway, or freeway as provided in divisions (B)(12), (13), (14), and (16) of this section;\n\nSections B(10), B(12)-(14) and B(16) state:\n\n(B) It is prima-facie lawful, in the absence of a lower limit declared or established pursuant to this section by the director of transportation or local authorities, for the operator of a motor vehicle, trackless trolley, or streetcar to operate the same at a speed not exceeding the following:\n(10) Sixty miles per hour on two-lane state routes outside municipal corporations as established by the director under division (H)(2) of this section;\n\n(12) Sixty miles per hour on rural expressways with traffic control signals and on all portions of rural divided highways, except as provided in divisions (B)(13) and (14) of this section;\n\n(13) Sixty-five miles per hour on all rural expressways without traffic control signals;\n\n(14) Seventy miles per hour on all rural freeways;\n\n(16) Sixty-five miles per hour on all portions of freeways or expressways without traffic control signals in urbanized areas.\n\n\u00b6 27 Here, the posted speed limit was 55 miles per hour. Appellant argues that proof that the speed limit was posted is not enough to carry the day, and rather, that the state was required to establish the nature of the roadway or the origin of the sign. We disagree.\n\n\u00b6 28 First, although appellant introduced an exhibit at trial in an attempt to demonstrate Route 33A was not listed by the DOT as having a revised speed limit which would differ from that dictated by the characteristics of the road, the trial court did not admit that exhibit into evidence, finding it irrelevant. T. 105. Further, appellant did not proffer the document for purposes of appeal, and it is therefore\nnot contained in the record, and not before this court. As noted above, we may not consider anything outside the record. \"When the court's ruling is one excluding evidence, a party must proffer the evidence at trial to preserve the issue for appeal.\" State v. Smith, 9th Dist. Wayne No. 15AP0001, 2017-Ohio-359, \u00b6 19. Moreover, based on the testimony regarding the document, it appears it was merely a printout from a website. There was no testimony to indicate it was a certified document, and appellant provided no evidence to support a finding that the information it contained it was current and reliable.\n\n\u00b6 29 Second, at some point, local or state authorities made the decision that the speed along Business Route 33(A) would be 55 miles per hour, and Trooper Cummins testified that this was indeed the posted limit in both directions. Appellant relies on State v. Smith, 12th Dist. Madison No. CA2006-02-006, 2006-Ohio-4829 for his argument that speed limit is not determined by signage, but rather by statute. Smith, however, is factually distinguishable from the matter at hand. Smith involved conflicting signage on the same stretch of State Route 38 approaching and leaving a small municipality. In one direction the posted speed limit was 55 miles per hour. In the other, 35 miles per hour. The appellant in Smith was cited for traveling 48 miles per hour in a 35 mile per hour zone heading north, when at the same spot going south, the posted speed limit was 55 miles per hour.\n\n\u00b6 30 There is no such issue here. There is no dispute here that the posted speed limit on Business Route 33(A) in both directions is 55 miles per hour.\n\n\u00b6 31 Although appellant disagrees with our decision in State v. Cass, 5th Dist. No. 2018CA0003, 2018-Ohio-4405, we stand by our finding in that matter, resolving a similar challenge by Cass: \"In the absence of a posted speed limit, it\nwould seem that the state would be required to establish the nature of the roadway under R.C. 4511.21(B)(1)-(B)(17) in order to establish the prima facie lawful speed upon the roadway where the speeding violation is alleged to have occurred; however, where the speed limit is established by the director of transportation or local authorities and is posted, such a showing is unnecessary.\" Cass at \u00b6 34, (Hoffman dissenting on the issue of the trial court taking judicial notice of \"rural\" which is not at issue here.)\n\n{\u00b6 32} We therefore reject appellant's arguments that the speed limit on Business Route 33(A) is anything other than 55 miles per hour. The state's prima facie case was established based upon the posted speed limit, and appellant did not successfully rebut that presumption.\n\n{\u00b6 33} Turning then to appellant's manifest weight argument, on review for manifest weight, a reviewing court is to examine the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses and determine \"whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the [finder of fact] clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\" State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983). See also, State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). The granting of a new trial \"should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\" Martin at 175.\n\n{\u00b6 34} Given the forgoing discussion, we find the trial court as the finder of fact did not lose its way in finding appellant guilty of speeding in violation of R.C. 4511.21(D)(1).\nThe first three assignments of error are overruled.\n\nIV\n\nIn his fourth assignment of error, appellant sets forth three arguments. First he argues the state committed a *Brady* violation by failing to provide him with the *King* case, and faults the trial court for denying him a continuance to examine the *King* case. He further argues the trial court erred in taking judicial notice of the scientific reliability of the LTI Ultralyte 20/20 laser through citation to *State v. King*, Fairfield County Municipal Case No. TRC 9210101 (April 13, 1993). We find no error.\n\nALLEGED DISCOVERY VIOLATION\n\nWe first address appellant's argument that the state withheld exculpatory evidence when it failed to provide him with a copy of the entry from the *King* case in violation of the rule established in *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Under *Brady*, the state violates a defendant's right to due process if it withholds evidence that is favorable to the defense and material to the defendant's guilt or punishment. See 373 U.S., at 87. The Supreme Court has explained, \u201cevidence is 'material' within the meaning of *Brady* when there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d *Cone v. Bell*, 556 U.S. 449, 469-470, 129 S.Ct. 1769, 173 L.Ed.2d 701 (2009). \"The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence. A reasonable probability of a different result is accordingly shown when the government's evidentiary suppression\nundermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u201d (Internal quotations omitted) *Kyles v. Whitley*, 514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995), citing *United States v. Bagley* 473 U.S. 667, 678, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed. 487 (1985).\n\n{\u00b6 38} Appellant states the entry in *King* was exculpatory, but does not explain how. We find the *King* entry, which found the technology and scientific principals involved in the LTI 20/20 laser accurate to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty was not exculpatory. It merely establishes the reliability of laser technology. It is unlikely, therefore, that appellant would have received a different verdict had he been provided with the entry. Appellee was therefore not required to provide appellant with a copy of the entry per *Brady*, nor under the discovery rules.\n\nCONTINUANCE\n\n{\u00b6 39} \u201cThe grant or denial of a continuance is a matter which is entrusted to the broad, sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d *State v. Unger*, 67 Ohio St.2d 65, 67, 423 N.E.2d 1078 (1981). Therefore, an appellate court must not reverse a trial court's decision to deny a motion for continuance unless it finds that the trial court abused its discretion. *Id.*; *State v. Wheat*, 5th Dist. Licking App. No. 2003-CA-00057, 2004-Ohio-2088 The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court's attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d *Blakemore v. Blakemore* (1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983).\n\n{\u00b6 40} We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of appellant's request for a continuance. *King* stood for a simple finding of scientific reliability of\na laser speed measuring device, and appellant was in no way prejudiced by the trial court's decision to deny his motion for a continuance to research the case.\n\nJUDICIAL NOTICE\n\n\u00b6 41 Finally, we address the issue of judicial notice of the scientific reliability of the LTI Ultralyte 20/20 laser, an issue we note is currently before the Supreme Court of Ohio on a certified conflict. City of Brookpark v. Joseph G. Rodojev, 2019-0056.\n\n\u00b6 42 The trial court in this matter took judicial notice of the scientific reliability of the LTI Ultralyte 20/20 laser used by Cummins pursuant to Evid.R. 201(B); \u201cA judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d The trial court further relied upon King wherein the Fairfield County Municipal Court had heard testimony establishing the scientific reliability of the LTI 20/20 laser speed-measuring device.\n\n\u00b6 43 There are generally three ways for a court to take judicial notice of the accuracy of a scientific known within the territorial jurisdiction of the court: first, \"a reported municipal court decision\" from that jurisdiction; second, a \"reported or unreported case from the appellate district\" covering that jurisdiction; or finally, the previous consideration of expert testimony regarding the device in question where the trial court notes it on the record. State v. Cleavenger, 2018-Ohio-446, 93 N.E.3d 1027 (7th Dist.) \u00b6 18 citing East Liverpool v. Lawson, 7th Dist. No. 13 CO 52 2014-Ohio-5858 at \u00b6 10-11; State v. Tulugu, 7th Dist. No. 10-MA-77, 2011-Ohio-5134 \u00b6 66 (upholding the taking of judicial notice on laser device), quoting\nColumbus v. Bell, 10th Dist. No. 09AP-1012, 2010-Ohio-2908, \u00b6 14, citing Cincinnati v. Levine, 158 Ohio App.3d 657, 2004-Ohio-5992, 821 N.E.2d 613 (1st Dist.). The trial court here employed the third method.\n\n\u00b6 44 The issue currently before the Supreme Court of Ohio is whether the results of either a laser or radar speed measuring device should be admissible without expert testimony or the taking of judicial notice of the scientific reliability of the underlying technology. The conflict case of the Eighth District Court of Appeals in City of Brookpark v. Rodojev, 2018-Ohio-5028, 117 N.E.3d 175 (8th Dist.) found the reliability of laser and radar speed measuring devices that use the same underlying scientific principles previously found to be scientifically sound do not need to be revisited and reestablished in subsequent cases. The Eighth District noted that the scientific principals underlying these devices has been in existence for decades, and are broadly accepted as valid, no different than the broad acceptance of the science underlying DNA testing. Id., \u00b6 8-9. The court found that rather than focusing on the broadly accepted underlying science, the focus instead should be on the qualifications of the operator of the device, the maintenance of the device, and how it was operated. Id. \u00b6 24 citing City of East Cleveland v. Ferell, 168 Ohio St. 298, 154 N.E.2d 630 (1958).\n\n\u00b6 45 Like appellant in the matter at hand, Rodojev argued that each new model of a speed measuring device must individually be deemed scientifically reliable before a court can permit the witness to testify regarding the device's results. Rodojev \u00b6 14. In its analysis, however, following an extensive discussion of the history of laser and radar speed-measuring technology and the evolution of case law surrounding the same, the Eighth District found a review of individual\nproducts unnecessary as \"[t]here is no serious contention that the scientific principles underlying laser speed measuring devices are invalid or born from junk science.\" Id. \u00b6 24. We agree.\n\n\u00b6 46 Here Trooper Cummins testified he is trained in the use of laser speed detection, passed all of his training, and is certified in the use of lasers to detect speed. T. 19-20. Cummins further testified he uses his laser training each workday, multiple times a day. He conducts a daily test of the laser instrument by doing a calibration check which includes checking scope alignment and distance accuracy. He performs these checks at the beginning and end of each and every shift. T. 20-21. Cummins conducted these tests on the day in question, and used the instrument as recommended by the manufacturer. T. 86. The tool Cummins used that day is used by no one else; it is issued to him alone. He testified he knew the laser was functioning properly that day due to its self-calibration, the fact that it displayed no error messages, and the fact that he had conducted his field calibrations as required. T. 55, 59. Further, Cummins visually estimated appellant's speed before confirming the same several times with the laser tool. T. 14, 26.\n\n\u00b6 47 We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in taking judicial notice of the scientific reliability of the laser tool, and further, that there was no need for the trial court to revisit the scientific reliability of laser technology before doing so.\n\n\u00b6 48 The fourth assignment of error is overruled.\nIn his fifth assignment of error, appellant argues the ticket issued to him by Trooper Cummins was insufficient to charge a crime as it did not contain the essential elements constituting the offense charged. We disagree.\n\n\"Traffic tickets are legally sufficient if they describe the nature of the offense and refer to the statute or ordinance allegedly violated even though the description fails to allege all of the essential elements of the offense charged.\" State v. Campbell, 150 Ohio App.3d 90, 2002-Ohio-6064, 779 N.E.2d 811, \u00b6 7, affirmed State v. Campbell, 100 Ohio St.3d 361, 2003-Ohio-6804, 800 N.E.2d 356.\n\nAs discussed above, appellant was charged with a violation of R.C. violation of R.C. 4511.21(D)(1) which prohibits operating a motor vehicle, upon a street or highway at a speed exceeding fifty-five miles per hour, except upon a two-lane state route as provided in division (B)(10) of the section and upon a highway, expressway, or freeway as provided in divisions (B)(12), (13), (14), and (16) of the section.\n\nOur review of appellant's traffic citation indicates he was charged with speeding pursuant to R.C. 4511.21(D)(1) for traveling 68 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour zone on Route 33A northbound at or near Coonpath Road, in the township of Greenfield, in the county of Fairfield. We find that all of the essential elements of the violation charged were included in the citation. The citation was sufficient to place appellant on notice that he was being charged with a certain traffic offense and what the elements of that offense were.\n\nThe fifth assignment of error is overruled.\nIn his final assignment of error, appellant argues the trial court erred in failing to rule on his pre-arraignment motions within the 10-day window set forth in R.C. 2937.21, and by finding that section inapplicable to the proceedings and the Ohio Traffic Rules applicable. We disagree.\n\nThis is a minor misdemeanor traffic case. Contrary to appellant's arguments, the Ohio Traffic Rules govern procedure in traffic cases. Traffic Rule 1(A) provides: (A) Applicability. These rules prescribe the procedure to be followed in all courts of this state in traffic cases and supersede the \u201cOhio Rules of Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior To Common Pleas\u201d effective January 1, 1969, and as amended on January 4, 1971, and December 7, 1972.\n\nOhio Traffic Rule 11(C) addresses pleadings and motions made before trial and states: (E) Ruling on Motion. A motion made before trial, other than a motion for change of venue, shall be timely determined before trial. Where factual issues are involved in determining a motion, the court shall state its essential findings on the record.\n\nThe trial court complied with the appropriate rule in ruling on appellant's motions in a timely manner before trial. We therefore reject appellant's arguments to the contrary.\n\nThe final assignment of error is overruled.\nUpon careful consideration of each of appellant's arguments we affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence of the Fairfield County Municipal Court.\n\nBy Wise, Earle, J.\n\nWise, John, P.J. and\n\nDelaney, J. concur.", "case_2001": "0", "aoe_none": "0", "aoe_grandjury": "0", "aoe_procbar": "0", "aoe_prochist": "0", "case_timeframe": "0", "other": "157    0\nName: other, dtype: int64"}

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b6 2 On January 27, 2014, Myers and codefendant, Timothy Mosley, began to plot burglarizing the home of a known drug dealer or the home of Justin Back, Myers\u2019 childhood friend. Mark Cates, Back's stepfather, purportedly had a safe containing a firearm and money. Ultimately, Myers and Mosley chose to burglarize the Cates' home. The two men drove to the Cates' home. Upon knocking, they were surprised when Back answered the door. The two men briefly visited with Back and then left. Upon leaving the Cates' home, Myers suggested they return to the home, kill Back, and steal the contents of the safe. Myers and Mosley began to plan Back's murder.\n\n\u00b6 3 They initially planned to kill Back by injecting him with cold medicine. In furtherance of their plan, they attempted to purchase cold medicine and a bottle of poisonous \"bug wash\"; however, Myers' credit card was declined. Later that day, Myers and Mosley returned to the Cates' home and watched a movie with Back. When Cates came home from work, he joined them in watching the movie for a short time until he and Back had to leave for an appointment with a Navy recruiter. Myers and Mosley then left the house.\n\n\u00b6 4 Myers and Mosley continued to discuss how to murder Back and burglarize the Cates' home. As they discussed their plans, Mosley wrote down their ideas in a small notebook. The two men hatched a scheme to strangle Back with a wire, take the safe, and make it look as though Back had stolen the safe and run away from home. The two men further planned to dump Back's body in a remote wooded area. Myers and Mosley purchased galvanized steel cable and two metal rope cleats to fashion a garrote. The garrote was put together by their friend Logan Zennie.\n\n\u00b6 5 The next morning, January 28, 2014, Myers and Mosley bought ammonia, septic-tank cleaner, and rubber gloves. They believed the septic enzymes would help to\ndecompose the body in cold weather. Around 1:00 p.m., the two men went to the Cates' home. Mosley was carrying the garrote as well as a five- or six-inch pocketknife. The plan was for Myers to distract Back while Mosley came up behind him. Myers would hold Back down while Mosley would choke him to death with the garrote. After the two men arrived at the Cates' home, Back offered them a drink which Myers accepted. As Back was reaching into the refrigerator, Mosley came up behind him and tried to pull the garrote around his throat. However, the garrote only looped around Back's chin. Mosley panicked and as Myers restrained Back, Mosley repeatedly stabbed him with his knife. As Back begged for his life, Myers simply told him it would be over soon.\n\nAfter the murder, Myers and Mosley wrapped Back's body in a blanket, cleaned up the crime scene, and found the safe. Myers also found a handgun belonging to Cates, which he loaded. The two men shoved Back's body into the trunk of Mosley's car and left the house with the safe and various other stolen items. They stopped at Mosley's home where they cleaned up and changed clothes. They eventually dumped Back's body behind a log in a field in Preble County. Myers poured ammonia and septic enzymes onto Back's body. Myers then shot the body twice with the stolen handgun before it jammed. Myers and Mosley were later apprehended; Back's body was discovered on January 29, 2014. An autopsy determined that Back had died of multiple stab wounds. At the time of the murder, Myers and Mosley were both 19 years old.\n\nMyers was indicted in February 2014 on one count of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design and one count of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B). Both counts were accompanied by three death-penalty specifications. Myers was further indicted for aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, grand theft of a firearm, and abuse of a corpse, all with an accompanying firearm specification, and kidnapping, tampering with evidence, and safecracking. Mosley was indicted on similar charges.\nHowever, a week before Myers' jury trial, Mosley reached a plea agreement in which he agreed to testify against Myers. Mosley pled guilty to all charges in exchange for the dismissal of the death-penalty specifications; he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\n\u00b6 8 The guilt phase of Myers' jury trial commenced on September 22, 2014. On October 2, 2014, the jury found Myers guilty on all counts and specifications. The two aggravated-murder counts were merged for purposes of sentencing; the state elected to proceed on the prior-calculation-and-design aggravated murder count with the aggravated-robbery specification.\n\n\u00b6 9 The penalty phase of the jury trial was held on October 6, 2014. Myers presented the testimony of his parents and a sibling and made an unsworn statement by way of mitigation. Myers had no prior criminal history or delinquency adjudications. The jury recommended a death sentence. On October 16, 2014, the trial court sentenced Myers to death and imposed prison sentences on the noncapital counts. Myers' conviction and death sentence were subsequently upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court. State v. Myers, 154 Ohio St.3d 405, 2018-Ohio-1903.\n\n\u00b6 10 On November 10, 2016, while his appeal was pending before the supreme court, Myers filed a petition for postconviction relief (\"PCR petition\"), raising 60 grounds for relief. The PCR petition challenged the constitutionality of the death penalty and the Ohio statutes governing its imposition, argued that Myers was denied the effective assistance of counsel during both the guilt and penalty phases of the trial, and alleged violation of Myers' due process rights. On November 18, 2016, Myers moved for leave to conduct discovery in support of his PCR petition. In 2017, the state filed an answer to the PCR petition, then moved for summary judgment. In January 2018, the trial court issued a scheduling order which provided that Myers could file a supplemental motion for discovery by March 1, 2018,\nand that the state's summary judgment motion would be held in abeyance pending resolution of Myers' discovery motion.\n\n\u00b6 11 On March 1, 2018, Myers filed a supplemental motion for discovery, arguing he was entitled to conduct discovery in support of his PCR petition pursuant to newly-amended R.C. 2953.21, which became effective on April 6, 2017. The amended statute makes substantial changes regarding PCR petitions in death-penalty cases, and in particular, allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery in aid of their PCR petition if good cause is shown. State v. Ketterer, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2016-08-166, 2017-Ohio-4117, \u00b6 46.\n\n\u00b6 12 On July 3, 2018, the trial court denied Myers' discovery motions. The trial court found that amended R.C. 2953.21 was not applicable in the case at bar because the statute did not explicitly state it was retroactive. Alternatively, the trial court found that even if the statutory amendment was applied retroactively, Myers was not entitled to discovery as he had not demonstrated \"good cause.\"\n\n\u00b6 13 On November 26, 2018, Myers filed a memorandum opposing the state's motion for summary judgment; the memorandum included 12 additional documents consisting of affidavits, transcripts, and documentary evidence. Myers' memorandum and supplemental appendix triggered additional pleadings from the parties. Ultimately, the trial court never ruled upon the state's summary judgment motion. Instead, on June 27, 2019, the trial court denied Myers' PCR petition without a hearing. The trial court found that Myers' claims were either barred by res judicata or failed to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, and therefore, \"no evidentiary hearing [was] required.\"\n\n\u00b6 14 Myers now appeals the trial court's denial of his PCR petition and discovery motions, raising 11 assignments of error.\nII. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Standards of Review for Postconviction Relief Petitions\n\n{\u00b6 15} A postconviction proceeding is a collateral civil attack on a criminal judgment, not an appeal of a criminal conviction. State v. Dillingham, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2012-02-037 and CA2012-02-042, 2012-Ohio-5841, \u00b6 8. To prevail on a PCR petition, the petitioner must establish a violation of his constitutional rights that renders the judgment of conviction void or voidable. R.C. 2953.21. A PCR petition does not provide a petitioner a second opportunity to litigate his or her conviction, nor is the petitioner automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing. State v. Rose, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-03-050, 2012-Ohio-5957, \u00b6 16. A trial court properly denies a PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing if the supporting affidavits, the documentary evidence, the files, and the records of the case do not demonstrate that the petitioner set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief. State v. Blankenburg, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-04-088, 2012-Ohio-6175, \u00b6 9; R.C. 2953.21.\n\n{\u00b6 16} \"It is well established that a trial court may dismiss a postconviction relief petition on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata.\" State v. Davis, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-12-258, 2013-Ohio-3878, \u00b6 30. Under res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment or conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment. State v. Wagers, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2011-08-007, 2012-Ohio-2258, \u00b6 10, citing State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 1996-Ohio-337, syllabus.\n\n{\u00b6 17} The presentation of competent, relevant, and material evidence outside the record may defeat the application of res judicata. State v. Lawson, 103 Ohio App.3d 307,\n315 (12th Dist.1995). The evidence submitted with the petition cannot be merely cumulative of or alternative to evidence presented at trial. *State v. Jackson*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104132, 2017-Ohio-2651, \u00b6 16. To overcome the res judicata bar, evidence outside the record must demonstrate that the petitioner could not have appealed the constitutional claim based upon information in the original record. *State v. Piesciuk*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-01-011, 2013-Ohio-3879, \u00b6 18. If evidence outside the record is \"'marginally significant and does not advance the petitioner's claim beyond a mere hypothesis and a desire for further discovery,' res judicata still applies to the claim.\" *State v. Cowans*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA98-10-090, 1999 Ohio App. LEXIS 4157, *8-9 (Sept. 7, 1999).\n\n{\u00b6 18} \"In reviewing an appeal of postconviction relief proceedings, this court applies an abuse of discretion standard.\" *State v. Snead*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2014-01-014, 2014-Ohio-2895, \u00b6 16. \"The term 'abuse of discretion' connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court's attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\" *State v. Thornton*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-09-063, 2013-Ohio-2394, \u00b6 34; *State v. Hancock*, 108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, \u00b6 130. The trial court does not abuse its discretion in dismissing a PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing if (1) the petitioner fails to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, or (2) the operation of res judicata prohibits the claims made in the petition. *State v. Maxwell*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107758, 2020-Ohio-3027, \u00b6 25.\n\n{\u00b6 19} With these principles and standards in mind, we now address Myers' assignments of error together and out of order where appropriate.\n\n**B. Summary Dismissal of Myers' PCR Petition**\n\n{\u00b6 20} Assignment of Error No. 1:\n\n{\u00b6 21} THE TRIAL COURT DENIED MYERS' RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS, ACCESS TO THE OHIO COURTS, AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, AND\nVIOLATED R.C. \u00a7 2953.21, WHEN IT TREATED THE STATE'S POST-ANSWER \"MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\" AS A MOTION SEEKING SUMMARILY DISMISSAL (sic) UNDER R.C. \u00a7 2953.21(C) [NOW (D)], AND FAILED TO APPLY THE REQUISITE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARDS IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING EVERY CLAIM SET FORTH IN MYERS' PCR PETITION.\n\n\u00b6 22 This assignment of error challenges the trial court's failure to rule upon the state's summary judgment motion and the court's election instead to grant a summary dismissal of Myers' PCR petition. Specifically, Myers argues that the trial court erred in granting a summary dismissal of his PCR petition where there was a pending, fully briefed motion for summary judgment. Myers asserts that because the state filed an answer to the PCR petition and a motion for summary judgment and failed to move for dismissal of the petition under R.C. 2953.21(D), the trial court was required to apply the standard set forth in R.C. 2953.21(E) and was precluded from summarily dismissing the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D).\u00b9\n\n\u00b6 23 R.C. 2953.21 provides three methods for adjudicating a PCR petition: (1) \"summary dismissal\" under R.C. 2953.21(D) and State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 1999-Ohio-102, paragraph two of the syllabus; (2) \"summary judgment\" under R.C. 2953.21(E); and (3) an \"evidentiary hearing\" under R.C. 2953.21(F). State v. Blankenburg, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-11-197, 2014-Ohio-4621, \u00b6 23.\n\n\u00b6 24 Under R.C. 2953.21(E), either party may move for summary judgment on the issues raised. In ruling on a summary judgment motion in proceedings involving a PCR petition, the trial court must use the same standards set forth in Civ.R. 56(C), i.e., a party is\n\n\u00b9. As stated earlier, R.C. 2953.21 was amended, effective April 6, 2017, and some of its provisions were renumbered. As pertinent here, former R.C. 2953.21(C), (D), and (E) were renumbered 2953.21(D), (E), and (F). We note that for purposes of this assignment of error, the language of the applicable renumbered statutory provisions is identical to the language of their pre-amendment counterparts. We therefore elect to apply the current version of R.C. 2953.21.\nentitled to summary judgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. *State v. Francis*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-05-078, 2014-Ohio-443, \u00b6 11. Summary judgment in postconviction proceedings is appropriate only if the right to summary judgment appears on the face of the record. R.C. 2953.21(E); *Id.*\n\n\u00b6 25 Under R.C. 2953.21(D), \"a trial court properly denies a defendant's petition for postconviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing where the petition, the supporting affidavits, the documentary evidence, the files, and the records do not demonstrate that petitioner set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.\" *Calhoun*, 86 Ohio St.3d 279 at paragraph two of the syllabus; *Francis* at \u00b6 12.\n\n\u00b6 26 We find that the trial court did not err in granting a summary dismissal of Myers' PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D) notwithstanding the state's motion for summary judgment and its failure to move for dismissal of the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D). We have held that R.C. 2953.21(D) \"explicitly requires the trial court to look beyond the petition and examine the record in order to determine whether there are substantive grounds for relief. The trial court must independently review the record and address the substance of a petitioner's claims regardless of whether the state responds to his petition for postconviction relief.\" *State v. Wallen*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA97-02-017, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 3647, *4 (Aug. 11, 1997). See also *State v. Hartman*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27162, 2017-Ohio-7933 (a trial court has an independent duty to analyze a PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21[D]); *State v. McCabe*, 4th Dist. Washington No. 97CA32, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 4487 (Sept. 14, 1998) (it is well settled that, regardless of whether or not the state responds to a petition for postconviction relief, R.C. 2953.21[D] requires the trial court\nto sua sponte analyze the petition). Thus, the trial court was required to independently determine whether there were substantive grounds for relief and the pendency of the state's motion for summary judgment did not preclude the trial court from summarily dismissing the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D). See State v. McKelton, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-02-028, 2015-Ohio-4228; State v. Noling, 11th Dist. Portage No. 98-P-0049, 2003-Ohio-5008.\n\n\u00b6 27 In his reply brief Myers argues for the first time that the trial court's summary dismissal of the PCR petition without prior notice to the parties violated the notice requirement of procedural due process. However, it is well established that an appellant may not raise new issues or assignments of error in a reply brief. State v. Renfro, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-07-142, 2012-Ohio-2848, \u00b6 28, citing App.R. 16; State ex rel. Colvin v. Brunner, 120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041. A reply brief simply provides the appellant with an opportunity to respond to the arguments raised in the appellee's brief. State v. Quaterman, 140 Ohio St.3d 464, 2014-Ohio-4034, \u00b6 18. Myers' argument is not appropriately before the court and will not be considered. Furthermore, as the discussion above makes clear, parties in postconviction proceedings are on notice of a trial court's sua sponte authority to grant a summary dismissal of a PCR petition. R.C. 2953.21; Hartman, 2017-Ohio-7933; McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228; McCabe, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 4487.\n\n\u00b6 28 Myers' first assignment of error is overruled.\n\nC. Discovery Motions\n\n\u00b6 29 Assignment of Error No. 2:\n\n\u00b6 30 THE TRIAL COURT DENIED MYERS' RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS, ACCESS TO THE OHIO COURTS, AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, AND VIOLATED R.C. \u00a7 2953.21(A)(1) AND ITS DISCOVERY AMENDMENTS, WHEN THE COURT HELD THAT THE DISCOVERY AMENDMENTS WERE NON-RETROACTIVE\nAND THUS INAPPLICABLE TO MYERS' CASE, AND THEN ENFORCED AN UNREASONABLE AND IMPROPERLY-RESTRICTIVE DEFINITION OF \"GOOD CAUSE\" TO DENY DISCOVERY TO MYERS ON EVERY ONE OF HIS CLAIMS.\n\n{\u00b6 31} Assignment of Error No. 3:\n\n{\u00b6 32} EVEN UNDER THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE PCR STATUTE, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED MYERS' PCR PETITION WITHOUT AFFORDING HIM ANY OPPORTUNITY TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY.\n\n{\u00b6 33} These assignments of error challenge the trial court's denial of Myers' discovery motions. As stated above, the trial court found that amended R.C. 2953.21 was not applicable in the case at bar because the statute did not explicitly state it was retroactive. Alternatively, the trial court found that even if the statutory amendment was applied retroactively, Myers was not entitled to discovery as he had not demonstrated \"good cause.\" The statute was amended after Myers filed his PCR petition and first motion for discovery but before he filed his supplemental motion for discovery.\n\n{\u00b6 34} Before R.C. 2953.21 was amended on April 6, 2017, it was well established that the statutory scheme governing postconviction relief did not entitle a petitioner to conduct discovery. State ex rel. Love v. Cuyahoga Cty. Prosecutor's Office, 87 Ohio St.3d 158, 159, 1999-Ohio-314; Ketterer, 2017-Ohio-4117 at \u00b6 45. Nevertheless, discovery could be proper where a petitioner set forth operative facts outside the record that revealed a constitutional error in his or her case. Id. The granting or overruling of discovery motions rested within the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Lawson, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2011-07-056, 2012-Ohio-548, \u00b6 17.\n\n{\u00b6 35} Amended R.C. 2953.21 makes substantial changes regarding PCR petitions in death-penalty cases, and in particular, allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery in aid of their PCR petition if good cause is shown. Specifically, R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) now\nprovides that\n\nAt any time in conjunction with the filing of a petition for postconviction relief under division (A) of this section by a person who has been sentenced to death, or with the litigation of a petition so filed, the court, for good cause shown, may authorize the petitioner in seeking the postconviction relief and the prosecuting attorney of the county served by the court in defending the proceeding, to take depositions and to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in accordance with divisions (A)(1)(d), (A)(1)(e), and (C) of this section, and to any other form of discovery as in a civil action that the court in its discretion permits. The court may limit the extent of discovery under this division. In addition to discovery that is relevant to the claim and was available under Criminal Rule 16 through conclusion of the original criminal trial, the court, for good cause shown, may authorize the petitioner or prosecuting attorney to take depositions and issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in either of the following circumstances:\n\n(i) For any witness who testified at trial or who was disclosed by the state prior to trial, except as otherwise provided in this division, the petitioner or prosecuting attorney shows clear and convincing evidence that the witness is material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to substantiate or refute the petitioner's claim that there is a reasonable probability of an altered verdict. This division does not apply if the witness was unavailable for trial or would not voluntarily be interviewed by the defendant or prosecuting attorney.\n\n(ii) For any witness with respect to whom division (A)(1)(d)(i) of this section does not apply, the petitioner or prosecuting attorney shows good cause that the witness is material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to substantiate or refute the petitioner's claim that there is a reasonable probability of an altered verdict.\n\n\u00b6 36 We first address whether the trial court erred in finding that amended R.C. 2953.21 does not apply to the case at bar because it is not retroactive. This is a strict legal issue which we review de novo. State v. Consilio, 114 Ohio St.3d 295, 2007-Ohio-4163, \u00b6 8; State v. Gloff, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2019-06-047, 2020-Ohio-3143, \u00b6 17.\n\n\u00b6 37 It is well settled that a statute is presumed to apply prospectively unless\nexpressly declared to be retroactive. R.C. 1.48. Additionally, Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, prohibits the General Assembly from passing retroactive laws. Applying these two provisions, the Supreme Court of Ohio has established a two-part test to determine whether a statute may be applied retroactively. *Consilio*.\n\n{\u00b6 38} Under this test, a reviewing court must first determine as a threshold matter whether the statute is expressly made retroactive. *Consilio*, 2007-Ohio-4163 at \u00b6 10. \"The General Assembly's failure to clearly enunciate retroactivity ends the analysis and the relevant statute may be applied only prospectively.\" *Id.* If, however, the General Assembly expressly indicated its intention that the statute apply retroactively, the reviewing court must then move to the second step of the analysis and \"determine whether the statute is remedial, in which case retroactive application is permitted, or substantive, in which case retroactive application is forbidden.\" *State v. White*, 132 Ohio St.3d 344, 2012-Ohio-2583, \u00b6 27.\n\n{\u00b6 39} As the trial court properly found, R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) as amended does not explicitly state it is to be applied retroactively. \"A statute must clearly proclaim its own retroactivity to overcome the presumption of prospective application. Retroactivity is not to be inferred.\" *Consilio* at \u00b6 15. \"If the retroactivity of a statute is not expressly stated in plain terms, the presumption in favor of prospective application controls. Moreover, the General Assembly is presumed to know that it must include expressly retroactive language to create that effect, and it has done so in the past.\" *Id.* Because amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) does not expressly mention retroactivity, we find that the statute applies prospectively and we need not determine whether the statute is remedial or substantive under the second prong of the test.\n\n{\u00b6 40} We further find that by its plain terms the statute applies prospectively to pending PCR petitions in that it allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery, for good cause\nshown, \"at any time in conjunction with the filing of a [PCR petition], or with the litigation of a petition so filed[.]\" (Emphasis added.) In the case at bar, amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) was not yet in effect when Myers filed his PCR petition. However, the PCR petition was still being litigated on April 6, 2017, when the amended statute became effective. Amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d), therefore, applies to Myers' PCR petition. See Gloff, 2020-Ohio-3143.\n\n\u00b6 41 The statute requires that the petitioner demonstrate \"good cause\" as a prerequisite for a trial court to allow discovery. As stated above, the trial court alternatively found that Myers failed to show \"good cause.\"\n\n\u00b6 42 \"Good cause\" is not defined by the statute. Consequently, the trial court adopted the definition applied in federal habeas corpus proceedings, to wit, good cause exists \"where specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is * * * entitled to relief, it is the duty of the courts to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry.\" Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 908-909, 117 S.Ct. 1793 (1997). \"Conversely, where a petitioner would not be entitled to relief on a particular claim, regardless of what facts he developed, he cannot show good cause for discovery on that claim.\" Murphy v. Bradshaw, S.D.Ohio No. C-1-03-053, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15978, *2 (Sept. 13, 2003).\n\n\u00b6 43 Before determining whether a petitioner is entitled to discovery under \"good cause,\" the court must first identify the essential elements of the claim on which discovery is sought. Bracy at 904. The burden of demonstrating the materiality of the information requested is on the moving party. Stanford v. Parker, 266 F.3d 442, 460 (6th Cir.2001). Discovery may be allowed where the petitioner's claims are \"neither patently frivolous nor palpably incredible\" and where \"the discovery he requests is specific, limited, and reasonably calculated to lead to evidence in support of his claim[.]\" Hill v. Mitchell, S.D.Ohio\nNo. 1:98-cv-452, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71975, *31-32 (Sept. 27, 2007). A petitioner is not entitled to go on a fishing expedition based on conclusory allegations. *Id.* at *5; *Williams v. Bagley*, 380 F.3d 932, 974 (6th Cir.2004). \"Even in a death penalty case, 'bald assertions and conclusory allegations do not provide sufficient ground to warrant requiring the state to respond to discovery or to require an evidentiary hearing.'\" *Stanford* at 460. Rather, the petitioner must set forth specific allegations of fact. *Williams* at 974.\n\n\u00b6 44 Myers argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery because he demonstrated \"good cause\" or, alternatively, set forth operative facts outside the record that revealed constitutional errors. Myers further argues that the trial court misapplied the *Bracy* good cause standard by essentially requiring him to prove his claims as a prerequisite to discovery.\n\n\u00b6 45 Myers' discovery motions were broad overall, seeking a wide range of information, records, and depositions of individuals, some of whom were identified only by category. The trial court broke down Myers' discovery requests into nine general categories of inquiry: (1) records in the custody of the Warren County Children's Services, the Warren County Department of Job and Family Services, and the Warren County Juvenile Court regarding Myers' family, (2) Myers' records from the Warren County Jail, (3) grand jury proceedings, (4) Mosley's institutional records, (5) records of the prosecutor's office and several law enforcement agencies relating to their investigation of Back's death and the arrest of Myers and Mosley, (6) depositions of law enforcement officers, (7) depositions of the jurors, (8) depositions of the attorneys on the prosecution team, and (9) depositions of the defense team.\n\n\u00b6 46 Myers' first motion for discovery did not identify how his discovery requests related to his postconviction claims. By contrast, the supplemental motion for discovery argued that Myers was entitled to conduct discovery on (1) his claims of ineffective\nassistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial, (2) his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial, and (3) his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for an offender who was still a teenager at the time of the offense. In his brief, Myers argues the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery on the foregoing claims. We will address the trial court's denial of Myers' discovery motions concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial in conjunction with Myers' fifth assignment of error.\n\n\u00b6 47 Myers first argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery regarding his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for a 19-year-old offender at the time of the offense. In support of these constitutional challenges, Myers sought discovery of (1) the Warren County's training and instructional materials for judges, prosecutors, and sheriff deputies concerning behavioral characteristics and brain development of juveniles, adolescents, and late-adolescents (18-21 years old) offenders, and (2) Warren County's data concerning the prosecution of such juvenile, adolescent, and late-adolescent offenders for the previous seven years.\n\n\u00b6 48 We find that Myers' requested discovery falls more into the category of a fishing expedition. Furthermore, as we discuss in the fourth assignment of error, Myers' claims are barred by res judicata and fail to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, given the election of the United States Supreme Court and Ohio Supreme Court not to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of 18 at the time of the crime. \"[W]here a petitioner would not be entitled to relief on a particular claim, regardless of what facts he developed, he cannot show good cause for discovery on that claim.\" Murphy, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15978 at *2. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying Myers' motions for discovery regarding his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for a 19-year-old\noffender at the time of the offense.\n\n\u00b6 49 Myers next argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial. Counsel's alleged ineffective assistance included the failure to (1) pursue a youth-based defense theory, (2) hire a fact investigator, (3) fully cross-examine Mosley, (4) cross-examine a sergeant and a detective regarding their failure to follow police procedure manuals, (5) present the testimony of a crime scene expert, (6) present the testimony of a police procedure expert to challenge Miranda issues, (7) present the testimony of an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his Miranda rights, (8) achieve a change of venue, and (9) challenge the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook. As we discuss in the sixth assignment of error, Myers' claims regarding the testimony of a police procedure expert to challenge Miranda issues, change of venue, and the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook are barred by res judicata as they could have been raised on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. As we further discuss in the sixth assignment of error, Myers' other claims fail to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief. Murphy at *2. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying Myers' motions for discovery concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial.\n\n\u00b6 50 To that extent, Myers' second and third assignments of error are overruled.\n\nD. Constitutional Challenges\n\n\u00b6 51 Assignment of Error No. 4:\n\n\u00b6 52 THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT FOUND PROCEDURALLY BARRED MYERS' CLAIMS CHALLENGING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY, PROPRIETY, AND/OR PROPORTIONALITY OF A DEATH SENTENCE FOR AN OFFENDER, LIKE MYERS, WHO WAS STILL A TEENAGER AT THE TIME OF HIS OFFENSE (GROUNDS\n5, 8, 9, 46, 47, 48), AND IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING SUCH CLAIMS UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.\n\n\u00b6 53 Myers argues that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 5, 8, 9, 46, 47, and 48 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged the constitutionality, propriety, and/or proportionality of a death sentence for an offender, like Myers, who was a teenager at the time of the offense. In this assignment of error, Myers details the scientific research on adolescent brain development, references various cases acknowledging that young adults under the age of 21 share many of the characteristics of late-age adolescents, and argues that the imposition of a death sentence upon a teenage offender, such as him, is an unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. Myers asserts that a cut-off of age 18 for imposing a death penalty is arbitrary. Myers further asserts his death sentence is unconstitutionally disproportionate to the life sentence Mosley received.\n\n\u00b6 54 Ground 5 argues that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), Ohio's felony-murder statute, is unconstitutional because it fails to adequately account for youth in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Ground 8 argues that the death sentence was disproportionate compared to Mosley and others convicted of similar crimes in violation of Myers' Eighth Amendment rights. Ground 9 argues that Myers' death sentence was void because the trial court failed to consider the R.C. 2929.11 purposes of felony sentencing when determining the appropriateness of the death sentence on the capital specifications. Ground 46 argues that Myers' Eighth Amendment rights were violated because the trial court failed to accord his youth the mitigating value it deserved. Ground 47 argues that the death penalty was a disproportionate punishment for Myers given his youth and other individual characteristics. Ground 48 argues that the death penalty is per se unconstitutional for a youthful offender convicted of committing a crime prior to turning 21 years old.\nThe trial court dismissed Grounds 8 and 9, finding that both arguments were raised in Myers' direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, were addressed by the supreme court, and were therefore barred by res judicata. The trial court further dismissed Grounds 5 and 46 through 48 as follows:\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court has already addressed whether the sentence of death for Myers based on his age is a violation of the Eighth Amendment and found that it is not a violation of his constitutional rights. Therefore, this argument is barred by res judicata.\n\nFurther, the Supreme Court of the United States has addressed the age of youthful offenders in a number of contexts and has not chosen to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of eighteen at the time of the crime. [Myers] has submitted evidence related to the development in brain science, however, the Ohio Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court have considered these new developments and similar arguments to the ones set forth by [Myers]. The United States Supreme Court acknowledged that individuals over eighteen may still exhibit signs of a juvenile but also found that since eighteen is the line society draws for many purposes between childhood and adulthood, that was the age that the line for death penalty ought to rest. *Roper v. Simmons*, 543 U.S. 551, 574, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 1197-98 (2005).\n\nWe find that the trial court properly dismissed Grounds 5, 8, 9, and 46 through 48. On direct appeal to the supreme court, Myers argued that the death sentence violated the Eighth Amendment proscription of cruel and unusual punishment, given recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court and a growing body of new developments in brain science indicating that age 18 is not the proper cut-off point for the death penalty. Myers further argued that his death sentence was comparatively disproportionate to the life sentence Mosley received and that he should not have been sentenced to death because he was a 19-year-old immature adolescent with mental and youth-related behavioral issues when he committed his crimes. The supreme court addressed and rejected these claims. *Myers*, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 173-176. They are therefore barred by res judicata.\nMyers\u2019 other claims were properly dismissed by the trial court as failing to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, given the election of the United States Supreme Court and Ohio Supreme Court not to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of 18 at the time of the crime. Myers notes that while his direct appeal made a brief reference to the newer brain science, it did not make the constitutional claim for a *Roper*-extension that his PRC petition makes. See *Myers* at \u00b6 176 (\"Although Myers argues that new developments in brain science indicate that age 18 is not the 'proper cut off point for the death penalty,' he does not propose that the categorical exclusion for those under age 18 be extended to 19-year-olds\"). However, such constitutional argument was recently addressed and rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court in *State v. Graham*, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-6700.\n\nGraham, who turned 19 years old the month before he committed his crimes and who was sentenced to death, argued that imposing a death sentence on a capital defendant who was under the age of 21 at the time of the crime violated the Eighth Amendment. Extrapolating from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s *Roper* decision, Graham argued that it was possible the Supreme Court could extend *Roper* to find that a defendant who turned 19 the month before committing the offense is constitutionally barred from receiving a death sentence. The Ohio Supreme Court squarely rejected the argument: \"[B]ecause the United States Supreme Court has drawn the line at 18 for Eighth Amendment purposes, state courts are not free to invoke the Eighth Amendment as authority for drawing it at a higher age. * * * *Roper* is controlling, and we must follow it.\" *Graham* at \u00b6 182, citing *In re Phillips*, 6th Cir. No. 17-3729, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 17766 (July 20, 2017) (no authority exists at the present time to support the argument that a defendant who was 19 years old at the time of the offense is ineligible to receive a death sentence).\nMyers' fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nAssignment of Error No. 9:\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT FOUND PROCEDURALLY BARRED MYERS' CLAIMS CHALLENGING IN MULTIPLE RESPECTS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF OHIO'S DEATH PENALTY STATUTE AND SYSTEMS (GROUNDS 2-4, 7, 57), AND IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING SUCH CLAIMS UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.\n\nMyers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 2, 3, 4, 7, and 57 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged the constitutionality of Ohio's death-penalty scheme and the statutes governing it. Specifically, Myers argues that Ohio's death-penalty scheme (1) is per se unconstitutional due to several fundamental constitutional defects, (2) is unconstitutional because it allows racial disparities in capital indictment practices and the actual infliction of the death penalty, (3) is incompatible with modern standards of decency, and (4) violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under Hurst v. Florida, 577 U.S. 92, 136 S.Ct. 616 (2016). Myers further argues that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), Ohio's felony-murder statute, is unconstitutional as a capital specification because it allows for invidious racial discrimination in its application and fails to provide adequate safeguards to ensure only the most culpable offenders are sentenced to death.\n\nMyers' claims are barred by res judicata as they were either raised or could have been raised in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 201-202. This includes his Sixth Amendment argument under Hurst as his merit brief was filed in the supreme court four months after Hurst was decided. Myers acknowledges that the supreme court \"has thus far been unwilling to conclude that Ohio's death penalty\nstatute is unconstitutional under the U.S. and/or Ohio constitutions in the respect alleged * * in these Grounds.\" See, e.g., Myers; State v. Mason, 153 Ohio St.3d 476, 2018-Ohio-1462; State v. Mammone, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942. In December 2020, the supreme court once again held that Ohio's death-penalty scheme was not unconstitutional under Hurst. Graham, 2020-Ohio-6700 at \u00b6 185-186.\n\n\u00b6 64 Myers' ninth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n\u00b6 65 Assignment of Error No. 11:\n\n\u00b6 66 THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION, AND COMMITTED AN ERROR OF LAW, WHEN IT DENIED MYERS RELIEF ON HIS FIRST GROUND FOR RELIEF, BECAUSE OHIO'S POSTCONVICTION PROCEDURES FAIL TO PROVIDE DEATH-SENTENCED PETITIONERS WITH AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS AND THEY VIOLATE THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS.\n\n\u00b6 67 Myers argues that Ohio's statutory scheme for postconviction relief is unconstitutional because it does not provide an adequate corrective process due to its \"rigid\" reliance on principles of res judicata and a petitioner's inability to conduct discovery until convincing a trial court that a hearing is warranted. This court has already determined that \"the statutory procedure for postconviction relief constitutes an adequate corrective process.\" State v. Lindsey, 12th Dist. Brown No. CA2002-02-002, 2003-Ohio-811, \u00b6 13; State v. Lawson, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2013-12-093, 2014-Ohio-3554, \u00b6 43. Other Ohio appellate courts have likewise rejected the claim that Ohio's postconviction relief statute does not afford an adequate corrective process. See, e.g. State v. Conway, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-504, 2019-Ohio-2260. Furthermore, the propriety of resolving a postconviction petitioner's arguments on the basis of res judicata is well settled. E.g., Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93. We see no reason to deviate from our prior precedent. Lawson.\n\n\u00b6 68 Myers' eleventh assignment of error is overruled.\nE. Merits of Myers' Grounds for Relief\n\n1. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n{\u00b6 69} Assignment of Error No. 7:\n\n{\u00b6 70} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT (GROUNDS 50, 58), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.\n\n{\u00b6 71} Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily denying Grounds 50 and 58 of his PCR petition which allege prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n{\u00b6 72} For a conviction to be reversed on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must prove the prosecutor's comments were improper and that they prejudicially affected the defendant's substantial rights. State v. Elmore, 111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, \u00b6 62; McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228 at \u00b6 13. However, \"[t]he focus of an inquiry into allegations of prosecutorial misconduct is upon the fairness of the trial, not upon culpability of the prosecutor.\" State v. Gray, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-09-176, 2012-Ohio-4769, \u00b6 56. Therefore, \"[p]rosecutorial misconduct is not grounds for error unless the defendant has been denied a fair trial.\" State v. Olvera-Guillen, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2007-05-118, 2008-Ohio-5416, \u00b6 27, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239 (1984).\n\n{\u00b6 73} We first address Myers' averment that \"the late and questionable disclosure of Mosley's notebook may very well have been the result of prosecutorial misconduct.\"\n\n{\u00b6 74} R.C. 2953.21(A)(4) requires a petitioner to \"state in the original or amended petition filed under division (A) of this section all grounds for relief claimed by the petitioner.\" Except as provided in R.C. 2953.23, inapplicable here, \"any ground for relief that is not so stated in the petition is waived.\" R.C. 2953.21(A)(4); State v. Lawrence, 12th Dist. Butler\nNos. CA2017-06-078 and CA2019-03-048, 2020-Ohio-855, \u00b6 17. Myers did not raise this claim of prosecutorial misconduct in his PCR petition and has therefore forfeited it. State v. Zeune, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-147, 2013-Ohio-4156, \u00b6 30; State v. Barb, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94054, 2010-Ohio-5239, \u00b6 25; State v. McKee, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 96CA006599, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4433, *9 (Oct. 1, 1997) (failure to raise issue in PCR petition results in a waiver of the right to assert the issue on appeal).\n\n\u00b6 75 Ground 50 alleges that Myers' due process rights were violated when privileged attorney-client discussions were potentially broadcast throughout the courthouse and into the prosecutor's office via the trial court's audio/video recording system. In his brief, Myers asserts the fact that conversations from the defense table could be broadcast in such a manner should cause \"great concern about whether any privileged conversations were 'overheard,' whether any were recorded, whether someone took notes of what they heard, [and] whether such information was utilized by the State in any fashion[.]\n\n\u00b6 76 Myers does not identify the resulting prejudice. The trial court sua sponte addressed the issue at a pretrial hearing in August 2014, subsequently conducted an evaluation of its audio/video recording system to make sure that conversations taking place at the defense table could not be heard by others, and provided a copy of that evaluation to counsel. In dismissing Ground 50, the trial court found \"NO evidence that any conversation of counsel was ever overheard,\" noted its investigation into the issue, and \"determined that the mute button was sufficient to prevent anyone from overhearing any conversation between counsel and the petitioner.\" Furthermore, this issue could have been raised on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court and is therefore barred by res judicata. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 50.\n\n\u00b6 77 Ground 58 alleges that the elected prosecutor engaged in misconduct by extensively posting about the case on his county prosecutor Facebook and Twitter accounts\nduring and after the trial and via statements he made in an interview during a 2016 BBC documentary. Ground 58 further alleges that Myers was prejudiced by the prosecutor's misconduct. The trial court dismissed the ground, finding that Myers \"failed to establish sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.\" In his brief, Myers asserts that the prosecutor's social media postings and interview \"tainted\" his right to a fair trial.\n\n\u00b6 78 We find that the trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 58. The prosecutor's post-trial social media posts, post-trial media statements, and statements in the 2016 BBC documentary are irrelevant and could not and did not deprive Myers of a fair trial. Regarding the prosecutor's social media postings and statements that occurred before and during trial, Myers does not articulate how any specific post or media statement prejudiced his right to a fair trial. A review of the posts and statements shows that they were restricted to providing the public with information about the criminal proceedings against Myers and communicated the results of various stages of the criminal proceedings against Myers either directly or by sharing links to news headlines. Following the guilty verdict, the prosecutor simply recognized Back's family and the efforts of the investigators and his office.\n\n\u00b6 79 Furthermore, the trial court repeatedly admonished the jurors not to view or listen to any news reports in any form. We presume the jury followed the trial court's admonitions unless it is demonstrated otherwise. State v. Miller, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2019-11-010, 2021-Ohio-162, \u00b6 50. Myers has not introduced any evidence to the contrary. Prejudice to a defendant will not be presumed in the absence of proof of jury exposure to possibly prejudicial news reports, or in this case, the prosecutor's social media posts. See State v. Wright, 3d Dist. Crawford No. 3-92-24, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 6090 (Dec. 30, 1994).\nFinally, this issue could have been raised by Myers in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. We note that Myers actually did allege claims of prosecutorial misconduct as part of his direct appeal under his tenth proposition of law. Res judicata applies to any issue that could have been raised on direct appeal, including a claim alleging prosecutorial misconduct. *McKelton*, 2015-Ohio-4228 at \u00b6 23, citing *State v. Zych*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA97-02-012, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4731 (Oct. 27, 1997). Myers fails to identify any reason why this claim of prosecutorial misconduct could not have been raised on direct appeal. Myers does not assert he learned about the prosecutor's social media posts after filing his direct appeal. Nor does he allege the posts were not known or available at the time of trial or his direct appeal. *Dillingham*, 2012-Ohio-5841 at \u00b6 10.\n\nMyers' seventh assignment of error is overruled.\n\n2. Trial Court Rulings\n\nAssignment of Error No. 8:\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS OF TRIAL COURT ERRORS IN MULTIPLE RESPECTS (GROUNDS 51-56, 59), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.\n\nMyers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 51 through 56 and 59 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged several trial court's rulings.\n\nGround 51 challenges the trial court's failure to grant a continuance of the trial date to allow defense counsel to obtain a mitigation specialist. This issue involves lead defense counsel's request to have his wife appointed as a mitigation specialist, which was initially denied by the trial court. After he was unable to find another mitigation specialist, lead counsel moved the trial court to reconsider its previous ruling. *Alternatively*, counsel\nmoved the court for a continuance of the trial date. The trial court reconsidered its previous\ndenial, appointed lead counsel's wife as the mitigation specialist, and denied the alternative\nrequest for continuance. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 51.\n\n{\u00b6 86} Ground 52 challenges the trial court's failure to grant a continuance of the trial\ndate to allow defense counsel to investigate Mosley's notebook after it was disclosed to the\ndefense the day before trial was to commence. Ground 53 challenges the trial court's\nadmission of the notebook into evidence and its failure to instruct the jury on the break in\nthe chain of custody. The notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after\nthe original search warrant was executed. On direct appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court\naddressed the state's delayed disclosure of the notebook, the trial court's denial of defense\ncounsel's motion for a continuance, and the admissibility of the notebook into evidence.\nMyers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 86-93, 112-120. In his direct appeal, defense counsel did not\nchallenge the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on chain of custody. Because the issues\nabove could have been or were raised on direct appeal to the supreme court, they are\nbarred by res judicata. The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 52 and 53.\n\n{\u00b6 87} Grounds 54 and 55 challenge the trial court's denial of Myers' motion to\nsuppress his \"involuntary\" statements to Detective Michael Wyatt where he \"did not\nunderstand his Miranda rights and never signed a Miranda waiver.\" In support of these\ngrounds, Myers submitted the reports of Gary Rini, a crime scene/police procedure expert,\nand Dr. Drew Barzman, a psychiatrist. Upon reviewing Myers' videotaped police\ninterrogations, Rini concluded that Myers \"was clearly confused and befuddled during his\nquestioning\" and was \"therefore apparently unable to appreciate the gravity of his situation,\nnor was he aware of the constitutional rights afforded to him.\" Upon reviewing Myers' police\ninterrogations, administering the Miranda Rights Comprehension Instruments test (\"MCRI\"),\nand reviewing comprehensive historical information regarding Myers, Dr. Barzman opined\nthat \"due to his young age of 19, probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,\" Myers \"was unable to adequately apply his Miranda rights at the time of the interrogations.\"\n\n\u00b6 88 On direct appeal, the supreme court overruled Myers' proposition of law relating to the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress and the claims that he never validly waived his right to remain silent, that he was denied his constitutional right to counsel, and that his statements were involuntary. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 61-82. In his brief, Myers asserts that the expert reports of Rini and Dr. Barzman \"were necessary to substantiate the claim\" his statements were not voluntarily made and were obtained in violation of Miranda. With the exception of the MCRI test, the same facts and historical information reviewed by Rini and Dr. Barzman were known and available to Myers at the time of his direct appeal to the supreme court. Myers, therefore, could have appealed his statements to police on the basis of his demeanor during questioning, his age, his \"probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and his lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,\" but did not. \"A report not found in the record does not automatically equate to a valid issue for post-conviction review purposes where, as here, the issue could have been raised on direct appeal.\" State v. Drummond, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05 MA 197, 2006-Ohio-7078, \u00b6 43. The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 54 and 55.\n\n\u00b6 89 Ground 56 challenges the trial court's denial of Myers' motion for change of venue based on the \"overwhelming\" pretrial media publicity regarding the case. Although Myers moved the trial court for a change of venue, he did not challenge the trial court's denial of his motion in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. It is therefore barred by res judicata. See McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 56.\nGround 59 challenges the trial court's failure to instruct the jury that Mosley's plea deal to a life sentence without parole was a mitigating factor. The record shows that the trial court did instruct the jury that, in addition to the specific statutory mitigation factors, it could consider any additional factors that were not specifically mentioned in favor of a sentence other than death. Defense counsel was allowed to and did argue Mosley's plea deal as a mitigating factor. Furthermore, this claim could have been raised on direct appeal to the supreme court and is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Jennings, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-248, 2018-Ohio-3871; State v. Southers, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA88-03-027, 1988 Ohio App. LEXIS 2720 (June 30, 1988). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 59.\n\nMyers' eighth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n3. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel during the Guilt Phase\n\nAssignment of Error No. 6:\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS THAT HIS TRIAL COUNSEL RENDERED CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFICIENT PERFORMANCE IN THE TRIAL PHASE OF HIS CAPITAL TRIAL (GROUNDS 6, 10-18), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING, AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF ON THESE MERITORIOUS IAC CLAIMS.\n\nMyers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 6 and 10 through 17 of his PCR petition, all of which allege numerous instances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial.\n\nIn order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, it must be shown that an attorney's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance\nprejudiced the defense. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). In postconviction proceedings, a petitioner bears the initial burden of submitting evidentiary materials containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and also that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness. *State v. Jackson*, 64 Ohio St.2d 107, 111 (1980). Pursuant to the res judicata doctrine, a PCR petition may be dismissed where a petitioner, represented by new counsel on direct appeal, could have raised the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim on direct appeal without resort to evidence outside the record. *State v. Lentz*, 70 Ohio St.3d 527 (1994), syllabus; *State v. Loza*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA96-10-214, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4574, *9-10 (Oct. 13, 1997). Additionally, mere presentation of evidence outside the record does not transform a claim into one addressable in postconviction. *Drummond*, 2006-Ohio-7078 at \u00b6 17. The evidence must show that the petitioner could not have appealed his claim based upon the information in the original record. *Id.*\n\n\u00b6 96 Ground 6 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a youth-based defense theory during the guilt phase of the trial in anticipation of the penalty phase. Myers asserts that his \"youth, its specific effects on him, and its manifestation in the conduct alleged by the State at trial should have all formed a central, consistent theme presented during both phases of the trial.\" Counsel's defense theory during the guilt phase was that Mosley committed the murder, Myers was simply present during the crime, and Mosley subsequently turned on Myers by entering into a plea deal and testifying against him. This was consistent with the penalty phase during which defense counsel argued Myers' sentence should not be more severe than Mosley's sentence.\n\n\u00b6 97 The decision regarding which defense theory to pursue at trial is a matter of trial strategy, and trial strategy decisions are not the basis of a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Murphy*, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 524, 2001-Ohio-112; *State v.\nMoreover, as the trial court noted when it dismissed Ground 6, the fact that another defense attorney may have or would have employed a different approach does not mean the alternative strategy fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. *State v. Casey*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2017-08-013, 2018-Ohio-2084, \u00b6 34. \"[T]here is a strong presumption that counsel has rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\" *Id.* Defense counsel's guilt-phase strategy will not be second-guessed even though appellate counsel now argue that they would have defended differently. *State v. Mason*, 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 169, 1998-Ohio-370. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 6.\n\nGround 10 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to hire a fact investigator even though the trial court had approved funds for an investigator. Lead defense counsel's affidavit submitted in support of the PCR petition indicates that counsel \"ultimately did not retain\" an investigator because the case was not a \"who done it.\" Ground 11 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to fully cross-examine Mosley. Myers asserts that an investigator would have discovered, inter alia, that Mosley was suffering from rage and depression in the days leading to Back's murder, suffered from severe drug addiction and had violent tendencies, and was not in the habit of taking notes in a notebook. The investigation would have further discovered that Mosley's cellphone records belied his trial testimony. Myers claims that this information could have been used to properly cross-examine Mosley and impeach his credibility.\n\n\"The *Strickland* holding and the American Bar Association's Guidelines only require trial counsel to perform a reasonable investigation, not to hire an investigator.\" *State v. Hairston*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 05CA008768, 2006-Ohio-4925, \u00b6 36. \"Further, '[a]n attorney's decision not to hire an investigator does not equate to a failure to investigate and\nresult in ineffective assistance of counsel.\" State v. Thompson, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, \u00b6 247, quoting Hairston at \u00b6 36. Defense counsel's failure to hire a fact investigator does not mean counsel did not investigate Mosley's background. The affidavits, reports, and records submitted by Myers in support of Ground 10 do not show a failure to investigate.\n\n\u00b6 100 Furthermore, as the Ohio Supreme Court specifically noted on direct appeal, defense counsel did cross-examine Mosley \"vigorously and at length.\" Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 186. Defense counsel's cross-examination of Mosley shows that counsel was very familiar with Mosley's statements to police and demonstrated his investigation and familiarity with personal facts about Mosley, including Mosley's substance abuse issues and the fact he engaged in illegal activity. Defense counsel's cross-examination elicited testimony that later allowed counsel to argue that Mosley was the principal offender, that he had a financial motive to commit the crimes, that he had a motive to keep his testimony consistent with his statements to Detective Wyatt because of his plea agreement, and that he lied to the police about Zennie to protect Zennie over Myers. Defense counsel's cross-examination of Mosley refutes any suggestion counsel did not investigate Mosley's background.\n\n\u00b6 101 Whether defense counsel discovered all of the information Myers identifies as topics of cross-examination is unknown. However, counsel's strategy was to cast Mosley as the leader who planned the crimes and executed them with little help from Myers and who was now turning on Myers to save himself. Some of the information that Myers suggests should have been a topic during Mosley's cross-examination is the same type of information which would have undermined Myers' mitigation strategy that Mosley bore primary responsibility for Back's murder. In this sense, portraying Mosley as suffering from depression and cocaine withdrawal at the time of the crime would have run counter to\ndefense counsel's strategy that Mosley was fully responsible for Back's murder. In addition, in light of the overwhelming evidence of Myers' guilt and the fact that Mosley's testimony regarding his and Myers' actions on the days leading to and culminating in the murder was corroborated by third-party witnesses, there is no reasonable probability Myers would have been acquitted of the charges. The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 10 and 11.\n\n\u00b6 102 Ground 12 challenges counsel's failure to cross-examine Sergeant Jeff Garrison of the Clayton Police Department and Detective Wyatt during the hearing on Myers' motion to suppress and at trial regarding their failure to follow their respective police procedure manual in handcuffing Myers when he was only wanted for an interview. Myers asserts that had counsel used the manuals when cross-examining the officers, this would have aided in showing that Myers was \"effectively seized\" when he was handcuffed and would have tarnished the officers' credibility.\n\n\u00b6 103 The record shows that it was Clayton police officers who handcuffed Myers and placed him in the back seat of a Clayton police cruiser after he was located at Mosley's home. At the time, Myers was a suspect who was detained at the request of the Warren County Sheriff's Office. The Clayton Police Department manual allows one to be restrained when the officer can articulate a need to handcuff for safety reasons. The sergeant's testimony at the suppression hearing indicates that Myers was handcuffed for safety reasons and to prevent him from running. Detective Wyatt's testimony reveals that the detective did not direct that Myers be handcuffed, and that in fact, he directed that the handcuffs be removed after he discovered that Myers was handcuffed.\n\n\u00b6 104 Furthermore, as the trial court found, the extent and scope of cross-examination clearly fall within the ambit of trial strategy, and debatable trial tactics do not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, \u00b6 146. Even assuming, arguendo, that defense counsel was deficient in failing\nto use the manuals when he cross-examined the officers, Myers fails to establish that, but for counsel's error, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the suppression hearing and his trial would have been different. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 12.\n\n{\u00b6 105} Ground 13 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a crime scene expert testimony to question the veracity of Mosley's notebook and rebut such evidence. The notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after the original search warrant was executed in January 2014. In support of Ground 13, Myers submitted Rini's report. The report indicates that photographs taken during the January 2014 search of Mosley's home do not show the notebook at all, nor was the notebook mentioned in any investigative report generated as a result of the January 2014 search of Mosley's home. Rini's report states that the \"discovery\" of the notebook \"eight months later, during a warrantless search in a location previously photographed during the January [2014] search, draws into question the legitimacy of the 'find' by investigating officers.\" Thus, \"[i]t is not unwarranted for one to conclude the possibility that the [notebook] was not, in fact present during the original crime scene search, and may have been placed at the scene sometime after the search was completed.\"\n\n{\u00b6 106} \"As an initial matter, the failure to call an expert and instead rely on cross-examination does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\" State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, \u00b6 66. Further, even if the wisdom of such an approach is debatable, \"debatable trial tactics\" do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Clayton, 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49 (1980). Defense counsel cross-examined Mosley upon all issues identified in Rini's report and revisited those issues in closing argument. Detective Wyatt testified the notebook was found where Mosley said it would be. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 13.\n\n{\u00b6 107} Ground 14 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present\na police procedure expert such as Rini to challenge *Miranda* issues. Myers asserts that Rini could have testified, based on his review of Myers' police interrogations, that Myers was \"clearly confused\" during questioning, that Detective Wyatt did not adequately explain the *Miranda* warnings to Myers, and that the detective provided Myers with inaccurate information concerning how he could obtain an attorney. Ground 15 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his *Miranda* rights. In support of this ground, Myers submitted the report of Dr. Barzman. Upon reviewing Myers' police interrogations, administering the MCRI test, and reviewing comprehensive historical information regarding Myers, Dr. Barzman opined that \"due to his young age of 19, probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,\" Myers \"was unable to adequately apply his *Miranda* rights at the time of the interrogations.\"\n\n\u00b6 108 During the suppression hearing defense counsel's cross-examination of Detective Wyatt addressed the issues raised in Rini's report, and the videotapes of Myers' interrogations were played and admitted into evidence. The videotapes were likewise played to the jury and admitted into evidence at Myers' trial. The trial court denied Myers' motion to suppress, finding that Myers validly waived his *Miranda* rights. The trial court further found that, based on the totality of the evidence, Myers understood the nature of his *Miranda* rights and the consequences in declining to exercise them. In his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, Myers challenged the validity of his *Miranda* waiver and argued that counsel was ineffective during the guilt phase of his trial. Myers' alleged confusion during police questioning, Detective Wyatt's explanation to Myers of the *Miranda* warnings and the information he provided Myers concerning how to retain an attorney, and counsel's alleged ineffectiveness in failing to present expert testimony to challenge *Miranda* issues were cognizable and could have been raised on direct appeal based solely on the original\nrecord. Rini's report does not constitute evidence outside the record as Myers asserts. Myers' argument is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Dempsey, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 76386, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 2628 (June 15, 2000); State v. Holloway, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-900805, 1992 Ohio App. LEXIS 283 (Jan. 29, 1992). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 14.\n\n\u00b6 109 The trial court dismissed Ground 15, finding that \"even if the defense had requested an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his Miranda rights, based on the evidence presented at the motion to suppress hearing it is unlikely that the Court would have granted that request since the Court denied the motion to suppress.\" The trial court further found that \"[t]he failure to request a * * * police procedures expert or another expert to challenge Miranda issues was not such an error as to deny [Myers'] constitutional rights. [Myers] was not entitled to any such expert[.]\") Thus, the trial court found that even considering Dr. Barzman's report, Myers failed to set forth sufficient operative facts establishing a substantive ground for relief.\n\n\u00b6 110 The MRCI administered by Dr. Barzman in October 2016 is the updated version of the Thomas Grisso's Instruments for Assessing Understanding & Appreciation of Miranda Rights, commonly referred to as the Grisso test. The test specifically assesses a person's capacity to understand and appreciate Miranda rights at the time of the evaluation. Garner v. Mitchell, 557 F.3d 257, 266 (6th Cir.2009). The test consists of four subtests, called \"instruments\": Comprehension of Miranda Rights (CMR), Comprehension of Miranda Rights \u2013 Recognition (CMR-R), Function of Rights in Interrogation (FRI), and Comprehension of Miranda Vocabulary (CMV). Id.; State v. Higgins, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 12 JE 11, 2013-Ohio-2555, \u00b6 43.\n\n\u00b6 111 Myers' scores were within the range for 19-year-old individuals with a verbal IQ of 101 to 110 in the first three instruments; his score of 29 out of 32 in the fourth\ninstrument (CMV) was good in comparison to 19-year-old individuals with a verbal IQ of 101 to 110. As stated above, the Grisso test purports to assess one's capacity to understand the Miranda warnings only at the time of the evaluation, not at the time the warnings were given. Garner at 270. The test does not purport to measure the validity of the waiver of Miranda rights or legal competence to waive Miranda rights. Id. at 269. In his report Dr. Barzman admitted the limited usefulness of Myers' scores \"since his interrogations were almost 3 years ago[.]\" Nonetheless, Dr. Barzman opined that \"[b]ased on his responses to the [test], it is evident that Austin currently understands the words of the Miranda Rights but he had problems with applying his rights. Although [he] appeared to have average to above average intelligence, he did not have the 'street smarts' three years ago to actually apply his Miranda Rights under intense stress.\"\n\n\u00b6 112 Myers' scores indicate he did understand his Miranda rights. Myers was interviewed five times by Detective Wyatt. Miranda warnings were not required during the first interview as Myers was not in custody. Detective Wyatt administered Miranda warnings to Myers on three separate times; each time Myers stated he understood them. Myers invoked his right to counsel in the second interview and the detective ended the interview. Myers sought to re-initiate questioning during a third interview but was rebuffed because he had invoked his right to counsel. Myers subsequently re-initiated questioning during a fourth interview, was administered the Miranda warnings again, and provided a statement. Detective Wyatt administered the Miranda warnings for a third time before the fifth interview. Myers indicated he understood them and answered the detective's questions. On direct appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court found that Myers understood his Miranda rights, which was further demonstrated by his invocation of his right to counsel. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 69-71. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 15.\n\n\u00b6 113 Ground 16 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to support\nthe motion for a change of venue with news articles evidencing the extraordinary amount of pretrial publicity, failed to renew the motion after voir dire, and ultimately failed to achieve a change of venue. The trial court dismissed Ground 16, finding that the motion for change of venue was initially denied subject to reconsideration if a jury could not be empaneled in accordance with State v. Lundgren, 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 1995-Ohio-227. The motion was subsequently denied after the trial court was able to successfully seat a jury in accordance with Lundgren. Juror questionnaires submitted in support of Ground 16 indicate that six of the 12 jurors had seen or heard pretrial news coverage of the case. All jurors indicated that they could and would decide the case based solely on the evidence presented at trial. Furthermore, although Myers alleged claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase as part of his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, he did not challenge defense counsel's failure to achieve a change of venue. It is therefore barred by res judicata. See Piesciuk, 2013-Ohio-3879. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 16.\n\n{\u00b6 114} Ground 17 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to challenge the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook either through cross-examination of the state's witnesses or by expert testimony. As stated above, the notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after the original search warrant was executed. Counsel vigorously cross-examined Mosley about the notebook and objected to its admission. On direct appeal to the supreme court, Myers challenged the admission of the notebook into evidence and alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial. The issue regarding the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook was cognizable and could have been raised on direct appeal to the supreme court and is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Dickason, 5th Dist. Stark Case No. 1996CA00423, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 3241 (July 7, 1997). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 17.\nMyers' sixth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n4. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel during the Penalty Phase\n\nAssignment of Error No. 5:\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS THAT HIS TRIAL COUNSEL RENDERED CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFICIENT PERFORMANCE IN THE SENTENCING PHASE OF HIS CAPITAL TRIAL (GROUNDS 19-45, 49), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING, AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF ON THESE MERITORIOUS IAC CLAIMS.\n\nMyers argues that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 19 through 45, all of which allege several instances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial. Specifically, Myers argues that counsel was ineffective during the penalty phase of the trial because he failed to (1) conduct a competent mitigation investigation and consult with and hire a competent mitigation specialist in a timely fashion, (2) present the testimony of expert witnesses regarding Myers' youth and psychological history, (3) present expert testimony regarding the science on adolescent brain development, and (4) present the testimony of numerous witnesses who would have testified about Myers' background, family history, mental health, education, and relationships with others. Myers argues that defense counsel's primary mitigation strategy was that Myers should not receive a punishment harsher than the life sentence without parole imposed on Mosley. Myers avers that had defense counsel's focus been broader and include the testimony of experts and other witnesses, he would not have been sentenced to death.\n\nThe trial court dismissed the grounds for relief, finding that (1) the failure to\ncall witnesses is trial strategy that does not raise to a constitutional violation, (2) a PCR petition is not a vehicle to substitute another trial strategy for one that failed, (3) defense counsel did argue Myers' youth in mitigation and the trial court instructed the jury that youth was a mitigating factor, and (4) defense counsel's failure to present the testimony of an expert in adolescent brain development, and his decision to consult with but not call a psychology expert to the stand and instead rely on arguing that Myers' sentence should not be harsher than that of Mosley was trial strategy.\n\n\u00b6 120 Myers' foregoing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial were also the basis for his motions for discovery and why he argues the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery under his second and third assignments of error. As pertinent here, the trial court denied the discovery motions as follows:\n\nThis is not a case where the defense did not seek the assistance of an investigator, mitigation expert and mental health expert. Clearly, a decision by trial counsel not to even have these valuable tools available to him while defending a capital murder case can never be a tactical, strategic decision. However, the decision of whether or not to use these tools or how to use them, as a matter of strategy or in the context of marshalling resources, is the cornerstone in building a proper legal defense.\n\nPetitioner has made allegations that his attorneys and mitigation specialist were ineffective and did not properly investigate and prepare a defense. In support of this claim, he has provided affidavits and documentary evidence concerning their performance. However, petitioner has made no specific representation about what he expects to learn in a deposition of [lead defense counsel, co-counsel and/or the mitigation specialist]. Both [lead counsel and the mitigation specialist] provided affidavits explaining what they knew, what they did, and why they did it. The fact that an attorney may look back in a deposition or otherwise, with 20/20 hindsight, and question or revisit his trial strategy after the jury has rendered its verdict provides no real insight to the Court. Further, the fact that [lead counsel] may have limited his mitigation strategy to what he believed to be the strongest and most compelling arguments does not support conducting discovery on this issue. * * *\nIn short, the petitioner has not established good cause to conduct discovery with respect to the defense team, including the attorneys.\n\n\u00b6 121 During the penalty phase of the trial, defense counsel presented the testimony of Myers' father, mother, and younger brother Bryce. All three testified about Myers' family history and background, including the breakup of the family and the parents' divorce following the mother's affair with a coworker and resultant pregnancy. They further testified about Myers' close bond with his siblings and how he was a very good mediator and mentor for his stepsiblings. Myers' mother testified that as a child, Myers tested gifted in several areas, was a talented piano player, and had designed a business card for himself in sixth grade. However, she started seeing changes in Myers when he was 14 years old. After she discovered Myers had been cutting himself and shooting his legs with a pellet gun, he was hospitalized for five days at Kettering Hospital Youth Services. Myers' mother testified that Myers was initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder and upon discharge, was prescribed medications and weekly therapy with a psychologist. However, Myers discontinued both when he began living with his father later that year. Defense counsel introduced photographs of Myers and his family, the business card he had designed for himself, his letters to his family during his incarceration, the records of his hospitalization at Kettering Hospital, and his gifted test results when he was in fifth grade. The Kettering Hospital records show that Myers was hospitalized as a result of taking 20 Benadryl tablets and that he was initially diagnosed with \"depressive disorder not otherwise specified versus bipolar disorder most recent depressed; substance induced mood disorder; over-the-counter drug abuse.\" Myers was ultimately diagnosed with \"depressive disorder, not otherwise specified. Rule out bipolar disorder.\"\n\n\u00b6 122 Myers made an unsworn statement, telling the jury that he was sorry \"this\nhappened\" and wished he \"could go back in time and stop this before it even happened,\" and that the death penalty would not hurt him and would only cause more pain and suffering to innocent people such as his parents and siblings. Myers asked the jury to spare his life and give him a chance to become a better person.\n\n\u00b6 123 In closing argument, defense counsel stressed Myers' good qualities and the positive influence he could have in his siblings' lives, acknowledged there had been \"bumps in the road,\" such as issues with Myers' family, \"his mental health a little bit,\" and his cutting and shooting himself with the pellet gun, and asked the jury to consider Myers' age, the love of his family, and the Kettering Hospital records. Overall, defense counsel focused on Mosley's plea agreement and resulting life sentence, telling the jury that it was the most important mitigating factor in the case and that Myers should not be punished more than Mosley who was the one who actually killed Back.\n\n\u00b6 124 Grounds 22 through 43 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present or \"fully\" present the testimony of numerous witnesses who would have testified about Myers' background, family history, mental health, education, and relationships with others. In support of this claim, Myers attached 22 affidavits from relatives, friends, acquaintances, and former educators to his PCR petition. Of those witnesses, only three testified at the penalty phase, to wit, Myers' parents and his brother Bryce.\n\n\u00b6 125 It is well established that a \"defense decision to call or not call a mitigation witness is a matter of trial strategy. * * * Debatable trial tactics generally do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\" Graham, 2020-Ohio-6700 at \u00b6 139. The Ohio Supreme Court has further stated that trial counsel is not ineffective for failing to call all available family members. State v. McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 399, 1997-Ohio-335. Furthermore, \"[a]dditional mitigating evidence that is 'merely cumulative' of that already presented does not undermine the results of sentencing.\" State v. Herring, 142 Ohio St.3d 165, 2014-Ohio-\n5228, \u00b6 117. Instead, \"the new evidence * * * must differ in a substantial way \u2013 in strength and subject matter \u2013 from the evidence actually presented at sentencing.\" Id.\n\n\u00b6 126 Upon reviewing the witnesses' affidavits, we find that the trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 22 through 43. Although the 19 individuals who did not testify may have provided a more disinterested account of Myers' family, their testimony to a large extent was cumulative to and did not differ in substantial way from the testimony of Myers' parents and his brother Bryce. See State v. Twyford, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 98-JE-56, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 1443 (Mar. 19, 2001). Likewise, the affidavits of Myers' parents and brother did not differ in substantial way from their testimony at the penalty phase.\n\n\u00b6 127 Grounds 19 and 20 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to consult with and hire a competent mitigation specialist in a timely fashion.\n\n\u00b6 128 In March 2014, lead defense counsel moved to employ his wife, a licensed attorney with experience defending capital cases, as the mitigation specialist. The trial court balked at the request due to the family relationship and denied the motion. Lead counsel did not seek assistance from another mitigation specialist until he contacted the Ohio Public Defender's Office in May 2014. However, the public defender's office did not have the resources to provide a mitigation specialist. Unable to find another mitigation specialist, lead counsel moved the trial court to reconsider its previous denial. The trial court held a hearing on the motion for reconsideration on June 4, 2014. Thereafter, the trial court appointed lead counsel's wife as the mitigation specialist. The trial court's decision noted that counsel's wife had \"already undertaken some mitigation work in the case, including meeting with the family of the Defendant[.]\"\n\n\u00b6 129 The jury found Myers guilty on all counts and specifications on October 2, 2014. The penalty phase was held on October 6, 2014. In support of his PCR petition, Myers attached the affidavits of lead counsel and the mitigation specialist. Both affidavits\nstate that during the three-day weekend between the jury verdict and the penalty phase, lead counsel and the mitigation specialist met with and interviewed Myers' mother and two of his siblings at the mother's home. That same weekend, they also met with and interviewed Myers' father and stepmother at their home. The affidavits of Myers' parents and stepmother corroborated that the interviews took place that weekend. Myers' stepmother stated the interview was short. Myers' mother stated that her interview lasted about one hour and one half and that she gave photographs to the mitigation specialist at another time and \"spent another hour to an hour and a half with her.\"\n\n{\u00b6 130} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that capital defendants \"[do] not have a constitutional right to a mitigation specialist or a right to an effective one.\" Herring, 2014-Ohio-5228 at \u00b6 113, citing McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d at 399 (no requirement for counsel to hire mitigation specialist in capital case); Drummond, 2006-Ohio-7078 at \u00b6 69 (a mitigation specialist is not a requirement for effective assistance of counsel). The trial court noted that the mitigation specialist \"was a trained attorney who has handled a number of capital cases and therefore has the ability to determine what evidence is effective in the [penalty] phase.\" The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 19 and 20.\n\n{\u00b6 131} Grounds 21, 44, and 45 generally challenge counsel's failure to conduct a comprehensive investigation into Myers' background and counsel's failure to present effective mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of the trial. Specifically, Grounds 21, 44, and 45 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present the expert testimony of clinical forensic psychologist Dr. Bobbie Hopes, failed to consult with and present an expert in adolescent brain development, and failed to effectively present youth as a mitigation factor.\n\n{\u00b6 132} In support of his PCR petition, Myers submitted affidavits and reports from several experts related to adolescent brain development and expressing opinions based\nupon their evaluation of Myers and his mental health and social records. The evidence submitted by Myers generally reflects that individuals of his age are prone to risk taking, peer influence, and impulsivity more akin to adolescents than adults. Myers argues that this evidence established substantive grounds for relief and he is therefore entitled to discovery and an evidentiary hearing on his PCR petition. The state argues that the evidence was not presented as a matter of trial strategy because it was in conflict with defense counsel's mitigation strategy to emphasize Myers' good qualities and was cumulative to evidence presented at the penalty phase.\n\n\u00b6 133 In his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, Myers argued ineffective assistance of counsel in the penalty phase for failure to present any expert testimony. Specifically, Myers asserted that defense counsel \"should have adduced expert testimony to explain the meaning of his self-harming behavior in his early teens and how brain development affects the decision-making of young people.\" Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 198. The supreme court rejected Myers' claim on the ground that \"nothing in the record shows what such expert would have said in the penalty phase[.] Thus, Myers has not demonstrated prejudice from missing such testimony.\" Id. The supreme court further found, \"At trial, the defense requested and received funds to hire a consulting psychologist. The psychologist the defense chose was appointed, but the record does not show what she told Myers's counsel regarding her conclusions. Hence, there is nothing to show deficient performance by counsel.\" Id. at \u00b6 199.\n\n\u00b6 134 In a capital case, \"[d]efense counsel has a duty to investigate the circumstances of his client's case and explore all matters relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty, including the defendant's background, education, employment record, mental and emotional stability, and family relationships.\" State v. Pickens, 141 Ohio St.3d 462, 2014-Ohio-5445, \u00b6 219. Defense counsel has a duty to make reasonable\ninvestigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. *State v. Johnson*, 24 Ohio St.3d 87, 89 (1986). Counsel's \"investigations into mitigating evidence 'should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor.'\" *Wiggins v. Smith*, 539 U.S. 510, 524, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (2003), citing American Bar Association, *ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases*, Section 11.4.1(C), 93 (1989). Given the severity of the potential sentence and the reality that the life of a capital defendant is at stake, it is only after a full investigation of all the mitigating circumstances that counsel can make an informed, tactical decision about which information would be most helpful to the client's case. *Johnson* at 90. \"Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable[.] However, a failure to investigate, especially as to key evidence, must be supported by a reasoned and deliberate determination that investigation was not warranted.\" *O'Hara v. Wigginton*, 24 F.3d 823, 828 (6th Cir.1994). \"An attorney's failure to reasonably investigate the defendant's background and present mitigating evidence to the jury at sentencing can constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\" *Pickens* at \u00b6 219.\n\n\u00b6 135 Myers was examined by Dr. Barzman for purposes of the PCR petition and his report is attached to the petition. Myers was also examined by Dr. Daniel Davis, a forensic psychologist, and his report is attached to the PCR petition. In his report, Dr. Barzman opined that Myers' mental health history, which included significant depressive and manic symptoms, was consistent with bipolar disorder which is associated with increased impulsivity and a focus on immediate gratification.\n\n\u00b6 136 In his report, Dr. Davis stated that the symptoms Myers experienced in high school were associated with bipolar disorder and that he was not fully neurologically\ndeveloped at the time of his crimes and sentencing. Dr. Davis further stated that the trial court and jury were deprived of pertinent psychological information specific to Myers and general psychological research specific to youthful and capital offenders, evidence that would have been extremely helpful to understand Myers' actions and demeanor. In particular, Dr. Davis noted that while Myers' youth was clearly evident at trial, the crimes took place when Myers was still developing neurologically and psychologically, however \"there was no specific testimony as to the considerable scientific literature concerning neurological development in late adolescents and young adults.\" Dr. Davis also noted Myers' apparent lack of remorse for his crimes at sentencing but stated that scientific literature shows that an apparent lack of remorse is not indicative of anything atypical in adolescent males and is typically mistaken as one of the \"signs of the development of a psychopathic personality when they are, in fact, transient features of adolescent development.\" Dr. Davis' report continued,\n\nFurther, abused and neglected children, such as Austin demonstrate a limited range of emotions as a way to cope with very stressful home environments. These research findings apply specifically to Austin. He was raised in a highly neglectful environment. He was at the time of his sentence still in the commonly accepted development stage of late adolescence. Neither the trial court nor jury had this critically important research presented to them[.]\n\n\u00b6 137 In support of his PCR petition, Myers also submitted the affidavits of his lead defense counsel and Dr. Hopes. Lead counsel's affidavit details what he did and did not do. As pertinent here, lead counsel stated he believed \"that everyone close to the process thought that [Myers] would receive a life sentence regardless of the trial phase result, based upon Mosley's plea deal having been the principal offender in the aggravated murder of Justin Back.\" Counsel's affidavit further stated,\n\nI did not consider requesting funding for, or hiring, a youth/adolescent expert to help explain issues, including\nyouth/adolescent brain development, to the jury.\n\nEven though we did retain a psychologist, Dr. Bobbie Hopes, for mitigation, Dr. Hopes told me that she would not be able to provide anything for the jury except for a timeline of Austin's life, something which Dr. Hopes believed Austin's mother could provide and that it would be better if it came from her. Given her statements to me, I was concerned that if Dr Hopes presented this information to the jury, it would just be seen as \"psychobabble.\"\n\nWhen Austin's mother * * * did not effectively provide such a timeline as I had anticipated and that [the mitigation specialist] and I had worked with her on, I did not think to then call Dr. Bobbie Hopes to the stand to testify.\n\n{\u00b6 138} Lead counsel's averments were contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. Dr. Hopes evaluated Myers three times in August 2014, for a total of six hours, for purposes of death penalty mitigation. Dr. Hopes averred that she provided lead counsel with a report in which she expressed the opinion that Myers' age, his history of childhood physical abuse, including his history of being diagnosed and treated for depression, and his history of self-mutilation were mitigation factors. Following Myers' conviction for aggravated murder, lead counsel called Dr. Hopes and told her he did not intend to use her as a mitigation expert. Dr. Hopes suggested that Myers' age and relevant research on adolescent brain development were strong mitigation factors but was told by lead counsel that information about youth had come out during jury selection. Dr. Hopes averred that she was willing and prepared to testify about age and adolescent brain development research. Dr. Hopes further averred that she never advised lead counsel that she could only present a timeline of Myers' life and that she never discussed a timeline with counsel.\n\n{\u00b6 139} As stated above, \"[i]n a petition for post-conviction relief, which asserts ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner bears the initial burden to submit evidentiary documents containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness.\" Jackson, 64\nOhio St.2d 107 at syllabus. In order to secure an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner need not prove counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Rather, the PCR petition only needs to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.\n\n\u00b6 140 Upon reviewing the reports of Drs. Barzman and Davis and the affidavits of Dr. Hopes and lead defense counsel, we find that Myers has provided evidentiary documents setting forth sufficient operative facts to warrant an evidentiary hearing on his PCR petition regarding his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony at the penalty phase of the trial.\n\n\u00b6 141 Defense counsel has the affirmative duty to investigate mitigating evidence. State v. Herring, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08-MA-213, 2011-Ohio-662, \u00b6 55. Defense counsel \"can make the decision to forego the presentation of evidence, but only after a full investigation.\" Id. It is only after a full investigation of all the mitigating circumstances that counsel can make an informed, tactical decision about which information would be most helpful to their client's case. Johnson, 24 Ohio St.3d at 89.\n\n\u00b6 142 Lead counsel's averment that he did not consider requesting funding for, or hiring, a youth/adolescent expert to explain issues regarding adolescent brain development to the jury fails to indicate counsel's motivation and instead suggests that counsel's failure to present such expert testimony was not the product of an informed, tactical decision. That is, counsel's averment shows he did not engage into a reasoned and careful consideration of such expert testimony before ultimately rejecting it. The same can be said about counsel's failure to have Dr. Hopes testify as an expert witness at the penalty phase. While counsel averred in his affidavit that Dr. Hopes did not testify because she could only provide a timeline of Myers' life, this averment was explicitly contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. There is little evidence documenting the extent of defense counsel's reasoning for his\ninvestigation and decision making regarding expert testimony mitigation evidence.\n\n{\u00b6 143} The state argues that mitigation evidence regarding Myers\u2019 dysfunctional family, self-mutilation, and mental health issues such as childhood depression and bipolar disorder, was presented through the testimony of his mother at the penalty phase, and thus, much of the psychological testimony that Drs. Hopes, Barzman, and Davis could have presented would have been cumulative. However, Myers\u2019 mother's testimony was much more limited on the issue. Myers\u2019 mother testified that the deterioration of her marriage did not seem to affect Myers, that she had not noticed Myers' self-mutilation, and that she believed Kettering Hospital initially diagnosed Myers with bipolar disorder. There was no testimony regarding Myers' childhood depression. Furthermore, Myers\u2019 mother is not qualified to provide the expert testimony necessary to contextualize the factors above.\n\n{\u00b6 144} The state next argues that presenting this expert testimony at the penalty phase would have been inconsistent with defense counsel's mitigation theory emphasizing Myers' good qualities and the positive influence he could have in his siblings' lives. Thus, the state asserts, defense counsel's decision not to present such testimony was trial strategy which should not be second-guessed.\n\n{\u00b6 145} However, lead counsel's affidavit does not advance this as the reason he did not present Dr. Hopes' expert testimony at the penalty phase. Lead counsel avers only that he did not call Dr. Hopes as a witness because she could only provide a timeline of Myers' life, an averment explicitly contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. Whether it was defense counsel's mitigation strategy to emphasize Myers' qualities, which counsel's affidavit does not suggest, it is not apparent why such strategy excludes a parallel strategy to contextualize Myers' youth in light of the science on adolescent brain development. As her affidavit clearly indicates, Dr. Hopes was prepared and available to testify about these issues and advised lead counsel on the eve of the penalty phase that Myers' age and\nrelevant research on adolescent brain development were strong mitigation factors. And while a decision by defense counsel to present only positive mitigation can be a sound trial strategy, counsel's decision to pursue a positive-mitigation theory can properly be made only after counsel has conducted a full mitigation investigation. *Herring*, 2014-Ohio-5228 at \u00b6 90.\n\n{\u00b6 146} The state further asserts that defense counsel did argue that Myers was only 19 years old at the time of the crimes. Counsel did briefly ask the jury to take Myers' age into consideration as a mitigation factor. However, counsel never developed the significance of Myers' youth as a mitigating factor.\n\n{\u00b6 147} In light of the foregoing, we find that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing. The trial court further erred in finding that Myers did not establish good cause to conduct discovery regarding his claim counsel was ineffective at the penalty phase in failing to present expert testimony on adolescent brain development in conjunction with Myers' age and mental health issues. Myers' claims are \"neither patently frivolous nor palpably incredible\" and \"the discovery he requests\" in the form of depositions of the defense team is \"limited and reasonably calculated to lead to evidence in support of his claim[.]\" *Hill*, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71975 at *31-32; *Johnson v. Bobby*, S.D.Ohio No. 2:08-cv-55, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103351 (Sept. 30, 2010); *Stallings v. Bradshaw*, N.D.Ohio No. 5:05CV0722, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97540 (Feb. 28, 2006).\n\n{\u00b6 148} We therefore remand this case for the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition which allege ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase for failing to present expert testimony on adolescent brain development in conjunction with Myers' age and mental health issues. The advantages that an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition based on ineffective assistance of counsel\ncan provide a trial judge are well established:\n\nThe trial judge can delve into the motivation or reasoning of trial counsel through trial counsel's testimony. The court can hear the testimony of witnesses that were never called to testify at the original trial, and can determine the worth of their testimony as well as the witnesses' credibility. The trial judge can ask what the counsel knew, when he knew it, and whether a mistake was not strategic, but was instead careless. As here, in a postconviction hearing, a judge can hear testimony about what evidence was made available to trial counsel and when it was made available. A trial court in a postconviction proceeding thus plays a unique role in the consideration of ineffective assistance of counsel claims. It is the only court that actually hears testimony on that issue.\n\nState v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, \u00b6 54.\n\n\u00b6 149 Myers' fifth assignment of error is sustained. To the extent noted above, Myers' second and third assignments of error are sustained in part.\n\n5. Cumulative Errors\n\n\u00b6 150 Assignment of Error No. 10:\n\n\u00b6 151 THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C), MYERS' CLAIM OF CUMULATIVE ERROR (GROUND 60), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.\n\n\u00b6 152 Myers argues the trial court erred in dismissing Ground 60 which alleges cumulative errors. We include under this assignment of error Myers' claims that the trial court erred in dismissing Grounds 18 and 49, which allege cumulative effect of the denial of effective assistance of counsel during the guilt and penalty phases of the trial (as initially argued in the fifth and sixth assignments of error). Under the doctrine of cumulative errors, a judgment may be reversed if the cumulative effect of errors deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute\ncause for reversal. *State v. Kirkland*, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, \u00b6 140. Given our resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth assignments of error, this assignment of error is moot. See *State v. Stein*, 3d Dist. Logan No. 8-17-39, 2018-Ohio-2621, citing App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 153 In light of our resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth assignments of error, the trial court's judgments denying Myers' motions for discovery and his PCR petition regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to present expert testimony at the penalty phase of the trial are reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Specifically, on remand, the trial court shall permit discovery, conduct an evidentiary hearing, and rule on Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition.\n\n\u00b6 154 Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\nHENDRICKSON, P.J., and S.

ARMENGAU,\n\nPetitioner, : Case No. 2:19-cv-1146\n\n- vs -\n\nWARDEN, London\nCorrectional Institution,\n\n: Respondent.\n\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThis habeas corpus case is before the Court for decision on the merits on the Amended Petition (ECF No. 70), the State Court Record (ECF No. 72 (Exhibits 1-44), 72-1 (Exhibits 45-112, and 72-2 (Trial Transcript)), the Return of Writ to the Amended Petition (ECF No. 73), and Petitioner\u2019s Reply (ECF No. 77) and Summary of Reply (ECF No. 81).\n\nLitigation History\n\nOn May 13, 2013, a Franklin County, Ohio, grand jury indicted Petitioner on three counts of kidnapping in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2905.01)(Counts 1, 5, and 14), one count of public indecency in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.09) (Count 2), three counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.05) (Counts 3, 7, and 8), six counts of rape in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.02) (Counts 4, and 9-13), and five counts of sexual battery in\nviolation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.03) (Counts 6, and 15-18). (Indictment, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Exhibit 1).\n\nThe case was tried from June 19 until July 7, 2014, when the trial jury found Petitioner guilty as to Count 2 (public indecency), Counts 3 and 8 (gross sexual imposition), Count 10 (rape), Count 14 (kidnapping), and Counts 15-18 (sexual battery)(State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Exhibit 5). Petitioner was acquitted on Counts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13 (Judgment Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 5).\n\nOn August 26, 2014, the trial court found that Counts 10 (rape) and 15 (sexual battery) merged under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2945.71 for the purposes of sentencing, with the State electing sentencing on Count 10. Armengau was then sentenced to concurrent sentences of fifteen months each in prison for Counts 3 and 8, nine years in prison for Count 10, four years in prison for Count 14, and thirty months each in prison for Counts 16, 17, and 18. Counts 10 and 14 were ordered to be served consecutively with all other sentences to be served concurrently, for an aggregate sentence of thirteen years in prison. Id. Petitioner was also sentenced to thirty days on the public indecency misdemeanor and credited with time served.1\n\nThrough new counsel, Petitioner appealed to the Ohio Tenth District Court of Appeals. That court overruled his first, second, fourth through seventh, and ninth assignments of error, sustained his third and eighth assignments of error, and remanded for re-sentencing on Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17. State v. Armengau, 2017-Ohio-4452 (Ohio App. 10th Dist., Jun. 22, 2017)(copy at State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 11, sometimes cited by Petitioner as 14AP-679)(\u201cArmengau I\u201d), appellate jurisdiction declined, 151 Ohio St. 3d 1511 (2018).\n\nFrom its review of the trial record, the Tenth District Court of Appeals made the following findings:\n\n1 Because Petitioner\u2019s custody on Count 2 ended before he filed his Petition, any claims regarding that count are no longer cognizable in habeas corpus. Maleng v. Cook, 490 U.S. 488 (1989).\nI. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b6 2 During the period of the indicted offenses, appellant was an attorney licensed in Ohio, with a central Ohio general practice that over time became focused on criminal defense work. The women who accused him of sexual misconduct were clients or relatives of clients; two of the accusers also worked in appellant's law offices.\n\n\u00b6 3 Columbus police began investigating appellant in 2013 after one of the accusers, C.C., hired appellant to represent her son in criminal proceedings and complained of appellant's unwanted physical advances. After appellant's arrest at the termination of that investigation, other accusers began coming forth, leading to an 18-count indictment issued by the Franklin County Grand Jury alleging crimes victimizing five different women: Counts 1, 2, and 3 alleged kidnapping, public indecency, and gross sexual imposition involving accuser C.C., all occurring on or about April 4, 2013. Counts 4 and 5 alleged rape and kidnapping involving accuser L.G., arising out of a single incident occurring between August 1 and August 31, 2008. Counts 6 and 7 alleged sexual battery and gross sexual imposition involving accuser A.C., occurring between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2010. Count 8 alleged gross sexual imposition involving accuser K.R., occurring between August 8 and September 17, 2008. Counts 10 through 13 alleged rape involving accuser L.M. Count 14 alleged kidnapping involving L.M. in connection with one of the rape counts. Counts 15 through 18 alleged sexual battery against L.M. All the counts involving L.M. alleged conduct occurring between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. All counts involving all accusers alleged that the criminal conduct occurred in Franklin County, Ohio.\n\n\u00b6 4 The state provided a bill of particulars on June 1, 2014, amended it on the eve of trial on June 6, 2014, and further amended it at the close of the state's case on June 22, 2014. The state, over objection, also verbally amended the indictment during trial to conform to certain testimony. The specifics of these amendments are more extensively developed below in connection with appellant's first and sixth assignments of error (emphasis supplied).\n\nII. TRIAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n\u00b6 5 The prosecution relied chiefly on the testimony of the five accusers. In addition, three other similarly situated women testified as other-acts witnesses regarding events that did not give rise to further criminal charges. Two of these described appellant's conduct\nin connection with consensual sexual relationships, and one testified regarding appellant's offensive conduct or statements towards her.\n\n\u00b6 6 The first accuser that testified at trial was C.C. She stated that she hired appellant to represent her son in a criminal matter, and met with appellant at his office on South High Street in Columbus. On April 4, 2013, C.C. received a call from appellant's secretary asking her to come to appellant's Columbus office to discuss the upcoming trial. During the course of their interview, appellant retrieved a legal file and sat next to C.C., brushing up against her. Appellant then opened the file, C.C. testified, and when the file fell to the floor, he gripped C.C.'s left arm firmly and put his right arm down her shirt, pulling her bra away from her breasts. C.C. testified that she was unable to move during this episode because of appellant's physical restraint. C.C. then attempted to readjust her clothing, and realized that appellant had stood up and unzipped his pants, placing his penis before her face. C.C. was offended, and quickly left the office, calling a friend to pick her up. She later called her sister, K.C., to complain of the episode.\n\n\u00b6 7 K.C. herself testified to confirm the phone call from C.C. She described her sister as frantic during the call, which prompted K.C. to advise C.C. to call the police.\n\n\u00b6 8 After C.C. reported the incident to the Columbus police, investigators contacted C.C. and asked her to set up further meetings with appellant that could be recorded as evidence. She exchanged several recorded phone calls with appellant and eventually met him at a restaurant, where their conversation was recorded and observed by police. During this meeting, appellant again made unwanted advances towards C.C. by repeatedly putting his hand on her thigh, and did not deny his prior conduct during their meeting at his office. In the course of C.C.'s testimony, these recordings were played for the jury in open court.\n\n\u00b6 9 Officer Jeffrey Cain, of the Columbus Division of Police, testified that he went to C.C.'s apartment on April 4, 2013, to take the report of a sexual assault.\n\n\u00b6 10 Corporal Jeff Zech, of the Franklin County Sheriff's Office, testified regarding the technical aspects of the audio recording process used for the restaurant meeting between C.C. and appellant.\n\n\u00b6 11 Detective Jason Sprague, of the Columbus Division of Police, testified regarding the preparations for the restaurant meeting between C.C. and appellant. He was in the vicinity during\nthe meeting but had difficulty picking up the conversation because recording sound was poor. After appellant's arrest upon leaving the restaurant, Detective Sprague participated in a recorded interview with appellant at the police station.\n\n\u00b6 12 During Detective Sprague's testimony, the recording of appellant's post-arrest interview was played in open court. In this interview, appellant described in detail his recent meeting with C.C. at his office regarding her son's case. He denied any inappropriate conduct on his part towards C.C. on that or any other occasion. He professed to be baffled by some of C.C.'s text messages and phone calls that contained flirtatious or sexual references, and stated that he had previously asked her to refrain from such comments.\n\n\u00b6 13 Detective Jeffery Ackley, of the Columbus Division of Police, testified about his participation in the investigation. He acted as security backup and an observer during the restaurant meeting. His visual observations corroborated C.C.'s testimony regarding appellant's physical actions, although the ambient noise prevented him from overhearing their conversation directly. He was able to make a partial video recording of the meeting using his personal recording device, and this was later transferred to CD by investigators. The video was partially played for the jury but did not include any of appellant's alleged physical advances.\n\n\u00b6 14 On cross-examination of C.C., defense counsel played a video recording made in Columbus police facilities during a telephone conversation between C.C. and her incarcerated son, who was awaiting trial for aggravated murder and other charges. In the recorded conversation, C.C. several times assured her son that, due to the developing conflict with appellant, the son would receive not only new defense counsel but a different prosecutor and judge for his case. Upon further questioning, C.C. testified that she felt that these changes would benefit her son, because she was dismayed by the harsh 43-year sentence offered to her son in plea discussions, and doubted whether appellant had obtained the best available result.\n\n\u00b6 15 In his testimony at trial regarding C.C.'s accusations, appellant denied any inappropriate conduct towards C.C. He described his representation of her son against several extremely serious charges, including aggravated murder. Appellant testified that his primary contact was with other family members or his jailed client via telephone, because C.C., after two brief initial meetings, made herself unavailable. While other family members came to various court hearings, C.C. did not. After several months, in April\n2013, the trial date approached and appellant advised his client that the prosecution's 43\u2013year offer was preferable to trial and a life sentence. Appellant felt that the state had put together a very solid investigation and his client would have little chance in front of a jury, and a plea to the indictment without an agreed sentence would result in more time.\n\n\u00b6 16 Appellant testified that prior to the April 4 meeting, he instructed his assistant to contact C.C. and arrange a meeting to update C.C. regarding the case. The meeting was arranged for April 4, and C.C. arrived as agreed. Her behavior struck him as odd. He asked about an individual that she had previously introduced to him as her husband, and she laughed and stated that she had this individual arrested. They then discussed her son's case, and C.C. expressed extreme disappointment with the plea offer. Appellant explained the situation to her and showed her some of his case notes. He denied sitting next to her on the office couch or touching her in any way. He was taken aback when C.C., on leaving the office, asked if he would like to have dinner some time.\n\n\u00b6 17 Appellant testified that the next day he learned from his client, C.C.'s son, that the client no longer wanted to accept the plea deal. C.C. then called him, and, in one of the conversations that he later learned was recorded by her at police request, asked for a dinner meeting to further discuss her son's plea. During the phone call, C.C. made several flirtatious or sexually charged remarks, which appellant deflected. He was not particularly put off by this because he considered C.C. to be somewhat unstable or unpredictable, and in any case he had experienced flirtatious comments from other clients and could usually steer such conversations back to business without difficulty. Appellant then described the meeting with C.C. at the restaurant, and denied putting his hand on her thigh or touching her inappropriately.\n\n\u00b6 18 The defense called S.K., C.C.'s former roommate. She testified that, in March 2013, C.C. approached her about blackmailing appellant. C.C. appeared frustrated by appellant's representation and the poor plea offer made by the state in her son's murder case. C.C. was also upset about the amount of money she had paid appellant for her son's representation. C.C. told S.K. that she had lied regarding the sexual incident so that she could sue appellant and get a new attorney for her son. She promised to give S.K. a car if S.K. would participate in the blackmail scheme. S.K. refused to participate when she learned that appellant had been arrested, whereupon C.C. kicked S.K. out of their shared apartment.\n\u00b6 19 The second accuser to appear at trial was A.C. She testified that she began working for appellant in the late 1990's, during the time that appellant represented her in a custody dispute. Appellant's principal office at the time was in Marion, Ohio. A.C. worked for appellant for over seven years, and she eventually resided in one of his rental properties. Early in the working relationship, A.C. testified appellant approached her when she was working in his Marion office, rubbed her shoulders, put his hands down her shirt, and eventually requested that she perform oral sex. She acquiesced. These incidents went on for some time, including an incident when she was in his Columbus office during 2005 or 2006. She could provide no specific dates for any of the incidents except for one occurring on September 11, 2001. On direct and cross-examination, A.C. agreed that she has a lengthy history of disabling mental illness and experienced many civil and criminal legal difficulties as a result. She stated that the sexual activity with appellant was \u201cto an extent\u201d consensual, but that at the time she felt she had little choice but to comply with his demands. (Tr. at 834.)\n\n\u00b6 20 Appellant testified that he first met A.C., as she had testified, during representation of her in a custody matter in 1999. He agreed that she had worked for him off and on over the years and had rented a home from him. Appellant denied having any sexual relationship of any kind with A.C. He represented her on numerous legal matters, some arising from her mental health issues, which often led to run-ins with police. This legal representation ended when A.C. complained that appellant was taking too long obtaining a dissolution for her.\n\n\u00b6 21 The third accuser to testify was L.G., who testified that she met appellant in 2006 or 2007 when she retained appellant to represent her son in a legal matter. Their interactions began professionally, but she claimed appellant soon began acting inappropriately. She claimed that at one point, appellant demanded oral sex in exchange for a promise to help her son. On several occasions he stripped naked in front of her in his office and masturbated. Later, on the eve of her son's court appearance in September or October 2007, she went to appellant's office for a meeting. Appellant and another man were drinking in the office. L.G. claimed appellant offered her a drink and suggested that if she performed oral sex on both men, her son's case would have a better outcome. L.G. refused and left the office.\n\n\u00b6 22 L.G. testified that next day, while in court attending her son's sentencing hearing, she realized that the man she had seen the night before with appellant was, in fact, the judge in her son's case. She\nwas extremely upset when the judge imposed the maximum sentence on her son at this hearing. After the hearing, L.G. claimed appellant forced her to perform oral sex on him in an attorney conference room in the courthouse, physically restraining her from leaving. She claimed that after this, she was violently ill as she rejoined her family outside. L.G. testified that she had made a police report about the incident in 2009 and refiled it in 2013 when learning of appellant's arrest.\n\n\u00b6 23 Prosecution witness S.W. testified that she was L.G.'s aunt and had observed interaction between L.G. and appellant. She advanced some funds for appellant's fees in the defense of L.G.'s son and later took L.G. to retrieve paperwork from appellant's office after L.G. had terminated the attorney-client relationship on behalf of her son. S.W. observed a heated confrontation between L.G. and appellant, prompted in part by appellant's refusal to return the son's case file. At some point in the conversation, L.G. called appellant a rapist. From appellant's office, they drove to the Columbus police department, where L.G. went inside for at least two and one-half hours while S.W. remained in the car. On previous occasions, S.W. had accompanied L.G. for case conferences, and felt that appellant was upset that L.G. was not alone and would not come up to his office alone.\n\n\u00b6 24 Prosecution witness J.B. testified that she was L.G.'s de facto mother-in-law, as L.G. had lived with her son for 24 years even though the two were not married. She attended a meeting with L.G. at appellant's office in 2009 and observed an argument or scene in which L.G. called appellant a rapist. Thereafter, she rode in the car with L.G. and S.W. to the police station, and testified that L.G. was in the police station only 15 or 20 minutes. On another occasion, J.B. attended a hearing for her grandson at the courthouse and waited outside in the hall during proceedings. J.B. testified that, at some point, L.G. emerged from the courtroom and became violently ill. When J.B. asked what was the matter, L.G. replied \u201cif you only knew.\u201d (Tr. at 1291.)\n\n\u00b6 25 On cross-examination of L.G., the defense offered the dates and results of L.G.'s son's criminal cases, and the dates of appellant's representation in those cases, to impeach her testimony. In particular, the defense introduced court records indicating that her son had received only community control, rather than prison, in his appearance before the trial judge she identified as associating with appellant.\n\u00b6 26 In his testimony regarding his contact with L.G., appellant agreed that he had represented her son in a criminal case. He also noted that he had represented her personally in several criminal cases in 2006, as well as her other son during the same period. Appellant denied all allegations by L.G. regarding sexual conduct. He testified that his representation of her son ended when the son received probation in the cases on which appellant worked, but that she asked him to appear at sentencing involving the son's other case. On that occasion, appellant spoke briefly with L.G. before leaving after the son's current counsel, a public defender, arrived.\n\n\u00b6 27 Attorney Emily Huddleson testified for the defense regarding L.G.'s accusations. She stated that she was the public defender who represented L.G.'s son at the sentencing hearing in question. She testified that after sentencing, she and L.G. walked out in the lobby together, were met by an older woman, and the three discussed the sentence and the reasoning behind it for 20 or 30 minutes. Despite the fact that Huddleson was assigned counsel for all four cases involving L.G.'s son that day, L.G. complained to Huddleson that she had paid appellant a lot of money and felt he should still be there. Huddleson testified that appellant was initially present at the hearing but not there for the conclusion when the judge imposed a prison sentence on L.G.'s son. Huddleson described L.G. as furious after her son received prison time. Huddleson did not observe L.G. crying, being sick to her stomach, or going into a courthouse conference room with appellant or anyone else after the hearing.\n\n\u00b6 28 The fourth accuser to testify was K.R. K.R. testified that appellant represented K.R.'s boyfriend in a case in which he had been accused of domestic violence against K.R. Despite being the victim of the domestic violence at issue, K.R. met with appellant to pursue dropping the charges. Appellant subsequently represented K.R. in a criminal matter of her own. Before her trial in September 2008, K.R. testified they met in appellant's Marion office, where he offered her a drink, rubbed her shoulders, and began feeling her breasts. K.R. refused to have sex with appellant, whereupon appellant began masturbating in front of her. K.R. told her mother about the incident, and reported the incident to the bar association, police, and a judge of the Marion County common pleas court. After the incident, she obtained new representation. Despite the statement that she gave to police and court, she heard nothing more from local authorities. Her own criminal case concluded with a guilty plea and a one-year sentence in prison. The Columbus Bar Association referred her complaint to the Supreme Court of Ohio, and a representative of the Supreme Court interviewed her regarding her allegations. To her knowledge, nothing came of the matter. After\nlearning of appellant's 2013 arrest involving similar allegations, she contacted a detective with the Columbus police to renew her allegations in the matter.\n\n\u00b6 29} Regarding K.R., appellant testified that he recalled representing her in 2008, when they disagreed about a plea offer from the prosecution. She terminated representation when he refused to seek a continuance on what he felt were unwarranted medical grounds. He was later summoned to court for a pretrial and was requested by the prosecution and the judge to arrive early. When he arrived, the judge and prosecutor informed him that K.R. had reported a sexual assault. He withdrew from her case, and a new lawyer was appointed. Appellant denied any sexual misconduct with K.R.\n\n\u00b6 30} The final accuser to testify was L.M., who described a long history of coerced sexual relations with appellant. Her testimony with regard to dates was generally vague, and often established only by reference to the age of her young daughter, born in 1997, during the various incidents described.\n\n\u00b6 31} L.M. described her background as an immigrant from Venezuela with limited English. She came to America with her Venezuelan fianc\u00e9, and after they married in Florida he took a job in Ohio. She testified that she first retained appellant in late 1998 or early 1999 to represent her in divorce proceedings. She selected him based on his ability to communicate in Spanish. She also had difficulties with her immigration status, which was solely based on her then-husband's student visa, and appellant advised her to delay the divorce while dealing with these immigration issues. As a result, the divorce action went on for a considerable time, and L.M. met many times with appellant. She traveled from her home in Groveport, in southeast Franklin County, to appellant's office in Marion for these meetings, which appellant usually scheduled for Friday afternoon or Saturday. At first she brought her infant daughter along, but approximately three months after taking the case appellant requested that she not bring the child to meetings.\n\n\u00b6 32} The first incident she claimed occurred about four or five months after she retained appellant. She testified that during an office conference at appellant's Marion office, appellant offered L.M. a cup of coffee, and thereafter she lost consciousness. She awoke alone on appellant's office couch with her clothes in disarray and indications that she had experienced sexual intercourse. She felt confused, as if drugged or drunk. After a short time, appellant\nreturned to the room and told her she had fainted. As a result of this incident, L.M. avoided seeing appellant for the next two months.\n\n\u00b6 33 L.M. resumed contact with appellant after a series of phone calls from him in which he advised that she was at risk of deportation and would lose custody of her daughter. Around this time in 1999, appellant provided a tenant reference that helped L.M. move from Groveport to an apartment in Dublin, in northern Franklin County and thus closer to Marion. She claimed that she met again with appellant in his Marion office at this time, and another assault occurred. After briefly discussing her case, appellant suddenly approached her and pulled down his pants. Appellant threatened a poor result in her legal matters if she did not perform oral sex. He placed his hands behind her head, thereby \u201crestraining [her] head against his penis,\u201d told her to \u201cdo it,\u201d and forced his penis into her mouth. (Tr. at 1483.)\n\n\u00b6 34 L.M. testified that after that incident sexual conduct between appellant and L.M. was frequent over approximately the next three years, always under the implied threat that if he dropped her case she would lose her immigration status and custody of her daughter. These events first took place at appellant's Marion office, where appellant eventually hired her to do office work to help pay her legal bills. Later appellant kept a residential apartment in Marion and took her there. Some incidents also took place at her apartment in Dublin, where appellant would ask L.M. to lock her daughter in another room. Although L.M.\u2019s testimony did not provide details of any specific instances for most of the abuse occurring after the two specific incidents described above, she did testify in more detail about later events that formed the basis for two of the rape charges: sometime in 2000 or 2001, appellant drove L.M. in a white truck from his Marion office to a rural field where he forced her to have vaginal sex. Six months later, he repeated the offense.\n\n\u00b6 35 L.M. testified that around the time that her daughter was three and one-half or four years old, L.M. became pregnant by appellant and appellant insisted that she have an abortion. The last time she claimed she had sexual contact with appellant was 2003. This was the year in which she obtained her permanent U.S. residency, and with her immigration status settled she no longer felt compelled to submit to appellant's demands.\n\n\u00b6 36 L.M. learned of appellant's arrest in 2013 when her daughter emailed a link to a newspaper story. From this she learned that she was not the only person who claimed to suffer appellant's advances. After discovering this, L.M. called appellant to tell him that she was\nglad that the arrest would prevent him from taking advantage of other women. L.M. then contacted the Columbus police detective named in the news story to complain of the past incidents.\n\n\u00b6 37 On cross-examination, L.M. denied that appellant had ceased representing her in her divorce case by 2001. Defense counsel offered docket items to establish that a different attorney appeared on her behalf in the domestic action after that time. L.M. responded that many attorneys had represented her in different matters through this time, but she felt certain that appellant continued to act on her behalf. She acknowledged that her original divorce action was dismissed and she eventually divorced under a new case filed in 2003 by another attorney. She also acknowledged that, despite her professed hatred for appellant arising from past abuse, she had often approached appellant for informal assistance with legal or practical matters over the years during and after the abusive conduct. She stated that she viewed this assistance as repayment for past abuse: \u201cI wanted to take advantage of him because he abused me so\u2014for so long. * * * So he abusing [me] so long, so he has to do it for me.\u201d (Tr. at 1645.)\n\n\u00b6 38 Generally, appellant testified that he had a long-standing professional relationship with L.M., beginning when L.M. approached him for representation in a divorce matter. Even after his representation of her in her divorce matter terminated in approximately 2001, appellant testified L.M. repeatedly sought his assistance in several legal and non-legal matters. Regarding the duration of his legal representation, appellant testified that he filed L.M.\u2019s divorce paperwork in December 1999 and withdrew from representation in 2001. Other attorneys took her case thereafter. In 2004, appellant and his wife separated briefly, and appellant and L.M. dated for about two weeks. Appellant denied ever having any type of sexual contact with L.M. at any other time during their relationship. Their brief dating relationship ended abruptly when L.M. told appellant she was pregnant, and appellant, who had undergone a vasectomy, understood that she had been seeing other men. He denied arranging an abortion for her.\n\n\u00b6 39 The next witness was L.L., who was not the object of any indicted offenses, but testified as to appellant's conduct when he represented her in 2009 as she faced a murder charge. The defense objected unsuccessfully to this \u201cother acts\u201d evidence.\n\n\u00b6 40 L.L. testified that during one of her pre-trial meetings with appellant in a jailhouse conference room, appellant illustrated his views on witness credibility by stating that \u201che could rape [her] in\nthe room and it would be [her] word against his and nobody would be the wiser.\u201d (Tr. at 1794.) Appellant also stated on that occasion that L.L. could crawl under the table and perform oral sex on him because there were no correction officers around, and it would be only her word against his if she complained.\n\n\u00b6 41 In his testimony, appellant denied making any such comments to L.L.\n\n\u00b6 42 M.H. was another witness offered by the prosecution for \u201cother acts\u201d testimony, again over objection. M.H. testified that appellant represented her as her attorney for over a decade, beginning when she was 17 years old and incarcerated in the juvenile detention facility. Upon initial release, she and appellant met at his Marion office, went to dinner, and went back and had sex in his office. Over the ensuing 12 years, appellant represented M.H. on multiple cases but she never paid him. They continued to have sex during this time, and M.H. accompanied appellant on a vacation to Florida.\n\n\u00b6 43 Appellant testified that he met M.H. at the very beginning of his legal career, when he substituted for an attorney who had failed to appear at the Marion County Juvenile Center. M.H. was 17 and charged with a felony. She later approached appellant for representation in a divorce. Rather than going on a dinner date followed by sex, as described by M.H., appellant recalled that they had dinner with M.H.'s stepfather and mother, and he left that dinner meeting alone. Appellant adamantly denied ever having sex with M.H. He agreed that he continued to represent her in various criminal matters for 12 years after the initial case.\n\n\u00b6 44 C.P. testified over objection as the third and final \u201cother acts\u201d witness. She testified that she met appellant about handling her divorce. He did not do so because she eventually proceeded with a dissolution in another state. She then retained him to represent her boyfriend in a criminal case. C.P. acted as a liaison between the boyfriend and appellant while the boyfriend was incarcerated. During one jail call, which was recorded, C.P. told the boyfriend that appellant had slapped her buttocks while she was leaving appellant's office one day. Appellant learned of this conversation and told her he was upset about this both because it would create friction with his client and because he knew that all jailhouse calls were recorded. Later, after appellant was removed from the boyfriend's case because he was a potential witness, C.P. and appellant began a consensual sexual relationship. This continued intermittently until just prior to appellant's trial.\n\u00b6 45} Appellant's testimony with respect to C.P. denied any sexual conduct between them. He testified that in the course of his criminal defense practice, his office routinely obtained and reviewed audio discs of recorded jailhouse phone conversations involving many of his clients. After reviewing the recorded jailhouse phone call in which C.P. told her boyfriend that appellant had slapped or groped her buttocks, appellant asked for a meeting to explain why she would make such a false statement to his client. She stated that she was upset by reports of the boyfriend's past infidelity and merely wished to make the boyfriend jealous. He then advised her to be cautious with such conversations.\n\n\u00b6 46} In addition to his testimony addressing the specific accusations presented by the state's witnesses, appellant testified in his case-in-chief regarding his background. He stated that he graduated from Capital Law School in 1998 as an older, non-traditional student with a growing family. He clerked with an experienced criminal defense attorney in Marion, Ohio, during law school, and shared space in that office for one year after passing the bar. He then secured his own space and began his own practice in Marion and, eventually, in Columbus, Mansfield, and Cleveland. His practice, general at first, eventually focused on criminal defense with a smaller proportion of domestic and civil litigation. He testified that he believed the accusations against him were the result of a coordinated campaign by the Franklin County Prosecutor's Office, the Attorney General, and the Columbus police to remove him from the practice of law because of his effective advocacy in criminal cases.\n\n\u00b6 47} The defense presented testimony from several current or former female employees and clients of appellant's practice. These witnesses testified that they had never experienced or witnessed any misconduct by appellant. The defense also sought to attack the credibility of the accusers by introducing testimony, photographs, and documentary evidence that conflicted with the accuser's descriptions of appellant's office locations and interior furnishings.\n\n\u00b6 48} With respect to the charges involving L.M., the jury returned guilty verdicts on Count 10 of the indictment (rape), Count 14 of the indictment (kidnapping), and Counts 15, 16, 17, and 18 of the indictment (sexual battery). The court merged Counts 15 and 10 of the indictment for sentencing purposes, and the prosecution elected to sentence on Count 10 of the indictment for rape. The court declined to merge any other counts involving L.M., in particular,\nfinding that the rape and kidnapping counts, although arising out of the same transaction, were driven by a separate animus.\n\n\u00b6 49 The jury returned a guilty verdict on Count 2, public indecency, involving C.C. The trial court addressed this in a separate misdemeanor sentencing entry imposing 30 days jail time with full credit for time served.\n\nArmengau I, supra.\n\nUnder 28 U.S.C. 2254(e)(1) as enacted by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214)(the \"AEDPA\"), these findings of fact by the Tenth District are presumed to be correct by this Court unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. Warren v. Smith, 161 F.3d 358, 360-61 (6th Cir. 1998).\n\nIn evaluating state court findings of fact, this Court is limited to considering the evidence that was before the state courts. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170 (2011). On the basis of the Pinholster decision, the Magistrate Judge has excluded a number of exhibits tendered by Petitioner, all of them portions of indictments in other cases, which were not presented to the Ohio courts (See ECF Nos. 54, 55, 63, 71). Petitioner has objected (ECF No. 78), but Chief Judge Marbley has not yet resolved those Objections. Having reviewed the Objections, the Magistrate Judge notes that they argue Petitioner\u2019s case on the merits, but do not address the Pinholster bar. Petitioner offers the distinction that \u201cPinholster dealt with the petitioner's personal records that weren't demonstrative or comparative but rather related directly to the personal defense of the petitioner that would have been admissible in trial through testimony.\u201d However, the rule in Pinholster is not limited to the particular kinds of extra-record facts Pinholster tried to introduce in habeas, but applies broadly to all extra-record evidence.\n\nIn the course of these proceedings, Petitioner has often referred to the dissent of Judge Gary\nTyack\\(^2\\) in *Armengau I*. The Magistrate Judge notes that Judge Tyack dissented on issues of law and not from any of these findings of fact.\n\nOn August 7, 2015, Petitioner filed a motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial (State Court Record, ECF No. 77, Ex. 22). The trial court denied leave on a finding that Petitioner had not shown he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the new evidence he wished to present. *Id.* at Ex. 25. The Tenth District affirmed and the Supreme Court of Ohio denied review. *Id.* at Exs. 33, 36.\n\nOn September 19, 2017, Petitioner filed another motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial. *Id.* at Ex. 55. The trial court denied the motion, the Tenth District again affirmed, and the Supreme Court of Ohio again denied review. *Id.* at Exs. 58, 62, 65.\n\nOn January 16, 2018, prior to re-sentencing on remand, Petitioner moved to dismiss Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 29, arguing that he was convicted of crimes that were never presented to a grand jury and that he was actually innocent. (Presentence Motion for Dismissal, State Court Record, ECF No. 72-1, Ex. 70, PageID 9204-15). The trial court denied the motion. *Id.* at Ex. 72. The Tenth District affirmed.\\(^3\\) *State v. Armengau*, 2019-Ohio-101 (10th Dist. Mar. 21, 2019)(\u201c*Armengau II*\u201d), appellate jurisdiction declined, 157 Ohio St.3d 1405 (2019).\n\nOn March 27, 2018, pursuant to the Tenth District\u2019s remand, the trial court found that Counts 14 (kidnapping) and 17 (sexual battery) merged with Count 10 (rape) for the purposes of sentencing. The trial court imposed a four-year prison term for Count 15 (sexual battery) to run consecutively with Count 10. Armengau\u2019s previously imposed concurrent sentences of fifteen months each in prison for Counts 3 and 8, and thirty months each in prison for Counts 16 and 18 were ordered to remain in full force and effect. *Id.* at Ex. 77.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Return points out that Gary Tyack is now the elected prosecutor of Franklin County, Ohio. He will, however, be referred to in this Report as \u201cJudge Tyack,\u201d the capacity in which he was involved with this case.\n\n\\(^3\\) The panel on Armengau\u2019s first direct appeal were Judges Klatt, Sadler, and Tyack (dissenting); the panel on this second appeal were Judges Dorrian, Brown, and Luper Schuster.\nOn appeal, the Tenth District overruled Armengau\u2019s second assignment of error and determined that Armengau\u2019s third assignment of error was barred by the doctrines of res judicata and law of the case. The appellate court sustained Armengau\u2019s first assignment of error and remanded the matter to the trial court for resentencing on Count 15. *State v. Armengau*, 2020-Ohio-3552 (Ohio App. 10th Dist., Jun. 30, 2020) (*Armengau II*), appellate jurisdiction declined, 2020-Ohio-4811 (2020). That re-sentencing remains pending, but Magistrate Judge Deavers earlier decided that did not prevent the case from being ripe (ECF No. 40).\n\nPetitioner avers he placed his Petition in the prison mailing system on March 14, 2019 (Petition, ECF No. 1, PageID 126). This counts as the filing date. *Houston v. Lack*, 487 U.S. 266 (1988); *Cook v. Stegall*, 295 F.3d 517, 521 (6th Cir. 2002). Petitioner filed of right an Amended Petition on April 11, 2019 (ECF No. 7), and a Second Amended Petition with court permission on June 13, 2021 (ECF No. 70).\n\n**Positions of the parties:**\n\n**The Second Amended Petition**\n\nIn his Second Amended Petition (ECF No. 70), Petitioner pleads the following grounds for relief:\n\n**Ground One:** Petitioner was denied his Constitutional Rights to Due process and Fundamental Fairness when he was convicted, sentenced and resentenced upon insufficient evidence and convicted and resentenced for unindicted and uncharged alleged conduct in Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 in violation of the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and contrary to the United States Supreme Court's holding in *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307 (1979) and the Ohio Supreme Court's holdings in *State v. Hampton*, 2012-Ohio-5688 [footnote omitted; official citation 134 Ohio St.3d 44], *Knight v. State*, 54 Ohio St. 365 (1896), and *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St. 3d 259.\nSupporting Facts: Petitioner was indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged incidents that occurred in Columbus, Ohio (Franklin County) on unknown dates but sometime between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2008. During trial Petitioner established that he did not commit the indicted crimes. Prosecutors then, mid-trial, added three (3) years of unindicted and uncharged allegations to the indictment by amendment to circumvent the defense. After adding three (3) years to the indictment, Petitioner was able to establish that he could not have committed any of the indicted alleged crimes because by the relevant part of the expanded time frame, Petitioner had never been to the locations where the \"victims\" first claimed the indicted crimes occurred. Prosecutors then, mid-trial, changed the locations to Marion, Ohio, to circumvent the defense. No evidence was presented as to the elements of the factual incidents supporting the indictment.\n\nGround Two: Petitioner was denied his right to due process of law and notice of the specific offenses (charges) for which he was required to defend and for which he was convicted, sentenced and resentenced in Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Petitioner's Constitutional rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution were further violated where the charging document/instrument failed to adequately inform him of the specific crime for which he was indicted and for which he would be tried, convicted, sentenced and resentenced in Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.\n\nSupporting Facts: Petitioner was indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged incidents that occurred in Columbus, Ohio on unknown dates but sometime between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. During trial Petitioner established that he did not commit the indicted crimes. Prosecutors then added three (3) years of unindicted allegations to the indictment to circumvent the defense. After adding three years to the indictment, Petitioner was able to establish that he could not have committed any of the indicted alleged crimes because by the relevant part of the expanded time frame, Petitioner had never been to the locations where the alleged victims initially claimed the incidents occurred. Prosecutors then changed the locations to Marion, Ohio, mid-trial, to circumvent the defense. The indictment, jury instruction nor the verdict forms identify any specific factual basis for conviction. During trial prosecutors were substituting 404(B) and \"other act\" evidence for the charged crimes that were never mentioned prior to trial. Petitioner was ultimately being tried for factual bases that were not part of the indictment. During resentencing the trial court didn't know what factual basis was applied by prosecutors to any of the counts subject to resentencing and couldn't determine what incidents the jury considered and thereafter resentenced Petitioner to\nprison for alleged incidents that never resulted in conviction and which even prosecutors never asked the jury to consider. The Court of Appeals in 14 AP 679 confirmed that the alleged crimes for which Petitioner has supposedly been convicted were not the crimes for which he was indicted (\u00b6 56-61, June 22, 2017 decision). With regard to Counts 2 and 3, evidence was introduced which if believed allowed the jury to convict for an allegation that was \"other-act\" evidence. This alleged incident was not noticed in the indictment or bills of particulars. That claim was alleged to have occurred on April 10, 2013, at a different location. The probability that for Count 2 and 3 the jury considered the unindicted other-act of April 10, 2013 is supported by several facts. The jury acquitted Petitioner of the kidnapping with respect to the April 4th incident.\n\nAlthough legally not dispositive, logically and factually, the acquittal rendered the conviction for the April 4th alleged Gross Sexual Imposition an impossibility as the acquittal for the kidnapping negated the proof beyond a reasonable doubt required for \"force\" or \"threat of force\". In light of this fact, Petitioner's testimony, Jennifer Young's testimony, Leslie Todd's testimony and Shirley Koval's testimony, acknowledging that the alleged \"victim\" admitted her claims were untrue, the jury may have rejected the April 4th alleged incident and considered the April 10th allegation where the alleged \"victim\" testified that Petitioner squeezed her thigh several times and where Detective Jeff Ackley testified to witnessing and video-taping the incident. Ackley testified that while he video-taped the entire incident, due to a malfunction, the part where Petitioner was supposedly touching the alleged \"victim\" was not recorded. The indictment in Petitioner's case informed him of alleged offenses that he would not have to defend. Another fact that confirms the lack of constitutionally required notice, lack of unanimity, and violation of Petitioner's Sixth Amendment Apprendi claim is the material disagreement between what the Court of Appeals claims are the facts supporting Count 16 and the facts prosecutors assert support Count 16. The Court of Appeals claims that Count 16 is an alleged unspecified incident that occurred in Franklin County and prosecutors who indicted and tried the case assert that the incident supporting Count 16 occurred in Marion County, Ohio.\n\n**Ground Three:** Petitioner was denied his right to due process of law and protections against double jeopardy as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when the court allowed the state to constructively amend the indictment to add unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed conduct and where the trial court refused a requested unanimity instruction and failed to instruct the jury that the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard had to be applied to one factual incident and where after resentencing, Petitioner remains unable to plead a conviction or acquittal to Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 and where the factual basis for\nconviction cannot be determined as decided by the jury and where Petitioner has been resentenced for alleged crimes with which he was never charged and in several counts with crimes for which he wasn't even convicted.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** Petitioner was indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged incidents that occurred in Columbus, Ohio on unknown dates but sometime between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. The alleged \"victim\" in Counts 9-18 couldn't provide a date, week, month or year for any alleged assault. During trial Petitioner established that he did not commit the indicted crimes. Prosecutors then added three (3) years of unindicted allegations to the indictment to circumvent the defense. After adding three (3) years to the indictment, Petitioner was able to establish that he could not have committed any of the indicted alleged crimes because by the relevant part of the expanded time frame, Petitioner had never been to the locations where the \"victim\" initially claimed the indicted crimes occurred. Prosecutors then changed the locations to Marion, Ohio, rather than Columbus, Ohio, to circumvent the defense. The indictment, jury instructions nor the verdict forms identify any specific factual basis for conviction. During trial prosecutors were substituting other-act evidence for the charged crimes. The Court of Appeals confirmed that Petitioner was ultimately being tried for factual bases that were not part of the indictment. As Petitioner was able to present facts to defend the accusations, prosecutors simply kept amending the indictment and bill of particulars mid-trial to circumvent the defense. After trial and even after resentencing, Petitioner does not know what alleged facts resulted in conviction for any count for which Petitioner is imprisoned, according to the jury's findings. The Court of Appeals confirmed that the crimes for which Petitioner was convicted were not the alleged crimes for which he was indicted or charged. Petitioner was acquitted on Count 11, which is an identical charge to Count 10; Count 14 was indicted as the restraint involved in Count 9. The Court of Appeals confirmed that no evidence was presented of the indicted Count 9 and Count 14 incident. The trial court permitted prosecutors to arbitrarily reassign the Count 14 kidnapping to Count 10. Petitioner was not indicted with any kidnapping related to Count 10. The indictment in Petitioner's case informed him of alleged offenses that he would not have to defend. At resentencing on March 27, 2018, the trial court sentenced Petitioner on Count 15 to a consecutive term of imprisonment while Count 15 was represented by prosecutors to the jury in closing and the instructions as being the same incident as Count 18 for which the sentence had already been fully completed. After the serial amendments, the alleged victim in Counts 9-18 was still unable to assign a date, week, month, or even year to any of her allegations. The alleged \"victim\" in Counts 9-18, who first claimed to being raped repeatedly in Columbus, Ohio, between 2002 and 2008 (3 times per week for years), then changing her story mid-trial to being raped in Marion, Ohio, in 1998, 1999, or 2000, after being confronted with her\nown emails conceded she was initiating contact with Petitioner throughout the years and after moving to California in 2010, contacted Petitioner to provide him with her updated contact information. The alleged victim in Counts 9-18, in 2012 requested Petitioner go [to] California and offered for Petitioner to stay at her residence. Petitioner respectfully declined all of Ms. Melean's offers. On Count 8, the alleged victim was forced to change her initial story and the accusation to Marion, Ohio, rather than as indicted.\n\n**Ground Four:** Petitioner was denied his right to due process of law and protections against double jeopardy as guaranteed under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when the court failed to instruct the jury that the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard had to be applied to one factual incident and the jury instructions were constitutionally defective as they permitted the jury to consider and convict Petitioner of alleged crimes for which he was never charged, indicted or noticed [other-act] and where due to the defective instructions the trial court has resentenced Petitioner for alleged crimes for which no factual basis can be determined but that were clearly unindicted and in several counts for alleged crimes for which Petitioner wasn't even convicted.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** When Petitioner established that he did not commit any of the indicted crimes, prosecutors mid-trial changed not only the date range of the indictment to circumvent the defense, but then changed the locations to completely different locations after Petitioner established that he could not have committed the indicted alleged crimes because by the newly argued time frame, Petitioner had never been to the locations where the alleged crimes were supposedly committed according to the initial accounts provided by their \"victims.\" As Petitioner was able to present facts to defend the accusations, prosecutors simply kept amending the indictment and bill of particulars to circumvent the defense. After trial and even after resentencing, Petitioner does not know what alleged facts resulted in conviction for any count for which Petitioner is imprisoned. Whatever they may have been, the Court of Appeals confirmed that the crimes for which Petitioner was convicted were not the alleged crimes for which he was indicted or charged. While the trial court may have invoked jurisdiction for the specific offenses contained in the indictment for Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, none of the specific crimes in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, for which it obtained jurisdiction were ever presented to the jury. The trial court denied a requested unanimity instruction and the instructions allowed a non-unanimous verdict and a verdict upon uncharged alleged conduct.\n\n**Ground Five:** Petitioner was denied his rights to due process of law in violation of his state and federal constitutional rights as guaranteed to him by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when he was denied a fundamentally fair trial due\nto prosecutorial misconduct and where he was tried, convicted, and resented for convictions upon the admission of other-act evidence that was unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed prior to trial and which was presented by prosecutors to intentionally circumvent the defenses to the actually indicted alleged crimes.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** When Petitioner established that he did not commit the indicted crimes, prosecutors mid-trial changed not only the date range of the indictment to circumvent the defense but then changed the locations to completely different locations after Petitioner established that he could not have committed the indicted alleged crimes because by the newly argued time frame Petitioner had never been to the locations where the alleged victims claimed initially claimed the assaults were supposedly committed. As Petitioner was able to present facts to defend the accusations, prosecutors simply kept amending the indictment and bill of particulars throughout trial. Prosecutors continuously inserted allegations that were never disclosed, never indicted, or charged and allegations they confirmed in trial they never heard of until two weeks into trial. At one point in trial prosecutors advised the court and defense counsel that Petitioner would not have to defend a certain charge and later, after failing to present evidence on what they indicted, claimed the incident they acknowledged Petitioner didn't have to defend, was in fact one of the counts for consideration. After trial and even after resentencing, Petitioner does not know what alleged set of facts resulted in conviction for any crime for which Petitioner is imprisoned. None of the jury instructions identify or are confined to one factual incident. The jury instructions are devoid of any identifying fact for the jury to determine which alleged incident pertained to any count. The Court of Appeals confirmed prosecutors were substituting unindicted and uncharged allegations for alleged crimes that were indicted. To this day, prosecutors are unable to determine the alleged incidents for which Petitioner is imprisoned. In closing argument, prosecutors told the jury that Counts 15 through 18 were \"alternate\" theories of other counts. In their sentencing memorandum prosecutors told the jury the court that they \"did not rely on a single act to support multiple convictions.\". The conflicting statements confirms their inability to determine the alleged incident pertaining to any count and due to the prosecution\u2019s need to plug-in unindicted allegations to convict Petitioner, Petitioner was denied a fair trial as guaranteed under the United States Constitution as his counsel did not know what facts supported the counts in the indictment. Counsel repeatedly moved for a mistrial and advised the trial court that he was unprepared to defend any allegation prior to 2002 for Counts 9-18.\n\n**Ground Six:** Petitioner was denied his rights to due process of law as guaranteed to him under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when he was tried and convicted for crimes for which he was never charged or indicted or noticed and for\nwhich the court failed to obtain subject matter jurisdiction for alleged crimes that were never presented to the grand jury and that were never presented to Petitioner in any charging document.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** Petitioner was specifically indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged crimes that specifically occurred in Columbus, Ohio. Petitioner was not indicted or charged with any crime occurring anywhere else. As of the start of trial Petitioner was defending allegations that occurred in Columbus, Ohio, between 2002-2008. Once Petitioner proved he did not commit any of the charged and noticed crimes, prosecutors mid-trial inserted never alleged allegations of incidents each occurring at a different time and place than those indicted. The grand jury never heard of any of the alleged incidents for which Petitioner is imprisoned and Petitioner was never charged by any instrument for the alleged crimes for which he is now imprisoned. The indictment contained and informed Petitioner of specific offenses that he would not have to defend. The Court of Appeals confirmed the indicted offenses were not the offenses for which Petitioner stood trial and was convicted. Prosecutors midtrial conceded with respect to several counts that the alleged crimes they would later argue for conviction were unknown to them until after the case was indicted.\n\n**Ground Seven:** Petitioner was denied his right to Equal Protection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution when the Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court intentionally disregarded the law set by their respective courts and the United States Supreme Court in order to affirm the convictions and for which now after resentencing Petitioner is imprisoned for crimes for which he never committed and was never charged or noticed until midway through his trial and in several counts for which he wasn't even convicted.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** The state failed to prove that the crimes occurred in the County and State as alleged in the indictment for Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, which is a required element to be proven for conviction under Ohio law. The state did not prove that the alleged crimes occurred \"within the time frame alleged in the indictment\" which is also a requirement under Ohio law. State statutes and case-law set the elements to be proven and then the state is required to prove each of those elements. The state also changed the dates and locations of the charges after Petitioner established that he could not have committed the crimes for which he was indicted. The trial court failed to instruct the jury that they had to agree on one specific set of alleged facts for each count, notwithstanding counsel requesting the instruction. Prosecutors amended the indictment to add three (3) years of unindicted and uncharged conduct which is impermissible. Due to the Equal Protection challenge, Petitioner must reference at least in this section that state law and federal law as applied to other defendants\nunder identical facts has never allowed what has been permitted to occur in Petitioner's case. The holdings and rulings in Petitioner's case are contrary to established precedent. Any court that allows a defendant to be imprisoned for alleged crimes with which he was never charged or for which he was never convicted must violate a defendant's rights to equal protection as a matter of law.\n\n**Ground Eight:** Petitioner, an actually innocent prisoner, is imprisoned as a result of violations of state and federal law and his rights guaranteed by the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitutions.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** Regarding Counts 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, Petitioner was indicted for specific and then identifiable alleged crimes that occurred in Columbus, Ohio, between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. For every single referenced count, the state at trial presented absolutely no evidence related to the accusations identified in the indictment. Under the facts of Petitioner's case, Petitioner believes that when evidence of a specific crime that is identified in the indictment cannot be produced at trial, the failure to present any evidence of each indicted and charged crime must represent an accused's actual innocence. With regard to Counts 2 & 3, prosecutors inserted a second alleged incident that was unrelated to any alleged conduct occurring at a different location and at a different time after they realized that their corroborating witness, Shirley Koval, decided to testify for the defense. Based on the jury instructions, it cannot be determined which set of facts the jury elected to apply to Counts 2 and 3. This is not a case where the indictment reflected typographical errors or clerical mistakes. The Court of Appeals confirmed the state was permitted to substitute other-act 404(B) evidence for the indicted crimes they couldn't prove.\n\n**Ground Nine:** Petitioner was denied his right to a unanimous jury verdict in Counts 2, 3, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 when the trial court denied a requested jury instruction on unanimity and thereafter instructed the jury in a manner where individual jurors could select different alleged incidents for conviction that were uncharged and were admitted as other-act evidence. Unanimity independently affected Petitioner's resentencing as Petitioner has now been resentenced to prison for alleged crimes for which the jury never convicted and for which prosecutors didn't even request of the jury that it consider.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** Prosecutors were permitted to introduce without limitation as many other-act allegations as they needed and then select what \"other-acts\" they wished to apply to any count for which they were unable to prove the factual bases for the indicted crimes. Count 9 and Count 14, for example, were indicted as one factual incident. The Court of Appeals confirmed that no evidence was presented of the entire alleged incident. With no evidence presented at all of the indicted\nincident, Petitioner must be legally and factually innocent of that specific charge. Prosecutors mid-trial claimed that Count 9 was a never before mentioned \"drugging rape\". When defense counsel objected, the Court sustained the objection. At that juncture, prosecutors advised the Court that the \"drugging\" rape was not part of the indictment and was other-act evidence. Prosecutors notified the Court and defense counsel that the defense did not need to defend that charge. However, later in trial, when they were unable to procure any testimony of the underlying indicted incident for Count[s] 9 and 14, the trial court allowed prosecutors to then substitute the \"drugging\" rape incident, that prosecutors already acknowledged was not part of the indictment and Petitioner did not need to defend, for the count they couldn't prove based upon the evidence upon which Petitioner was indicted. With Count 10, the Court of Appeals confirmed that no factual incident was provided in the indictment.\n\nThe only facts regarding Count 10 were that the factual incident occurred in Franklin County and during 2002 and 2008. The Court of Appeals confirmed the factual basis for Count 10 changed from whatever had been indicted to an alleged incident in Marion, Ohio in either 1998, 1999, or 2000. The Court of Appeals confirmed Petitioner was not convicted of what originally supported Count 10. During resentencing on March 27, 2018, the trial court could not determine from the trial transcripts, opening, closing, jury instructions or verdict forms, which factual incidents applied to the respective counts for which Petitioner was being resentenced. The trial court actually resentenced Petitioner on Counts 15 and 18, for two incidents, when prosecutors argued to the jury in closing that Counts 15 and 18 were one incident. On Count 15 and 18, the trial court resentenced Petitioner for two incidents, supposedly occurring in Marion, Ohio, for which Petitioner was never convicted. In fact, prosecutors never requested of the jury that it consider the alleged incidents the court used to resentence Petitioner. A review of the indictment, opening statement, closing argument, jury instructions and verdict forms, the only parts of the record to which the jury had access, will confirm for this court that the factual incident(s) used by the Court to resentence Petitioner appear nowhere. Petitioner was resentenced on Count 10 for what the Court of Appeals confirmed was an uncharged factual basis. Comparing Counts 10 and 11, the jury may have acquitted Petitioner for whatever factual basis anyone believes resulted in conviction for Count 10. For Count 16, a review of the indictment, opening, closing, jury instructions and verdict forms confirms that prosecutors never even assigned an actual factual basis to that count. Perhaps confirming Petitioner's unanimity and due process argument, the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors don't agree on what facts support Count 16. The Court of Appeals believes that Count 16 was a factual incident that occurred in Franklin County while prosecutors believe Count 16 is a different incident that occurred in Marion County. Petitioner respectfully suggests that when the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors who are the ones who indicted\nand tried the case can't agree on what factual basis supports any count, there is clearly a due process, sufficiency, notice, double jeopardy, fair trial, and unanimity problem. A review of the same documents will further confirm that for Count 17, whatever the jury elected to apply to that count cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. The lack of unanimity impacted Petitioner's resentencing, notwithstanding any effort by the state courts to find that the jury's verdicts were unanimous. With Counts 8 through 18, Petitioner was indicted only with alleged crimes that occurred in Franklin County, Ohio, between 2002 and 2008. After what Court of Appeals coined \"Serial Amendments\", prosecutors then sought conviction for alleged \"other-acts\" that occurred in Marion County, Ohio, between 1998 and 2001. Defense counsel repeatedly sought a mistrial as he acknowledged being unprepared to defend any allegation prior to 2002 in Marion, Ohio. Petitioner had witnesses under subpoena for the locations and time frames identified in the indictment. Then Court of Appeals Judge Gary Tyack [footnote omitted] during oral arguments stated:\n\n\"So, that's part of what ties in here. Counsel has to prepare for a major trial based on what's in the indictment and bills of particulars. And, in this particular situation, all of a sudden you're mid-trial and the prosecution is throwing four (4) years of additional allegations in front of the jury and then arguing that the mere number of allegations is why this guy should be guilty of something . . . part of what you run into is you have no chance to create, to even investigate an alibi defense . . . for times that aren't alleged in the whole thing, you don't have a chance to tie down and bring in other witnesses . . . to contradict these folks. You just all of a sudden, you're in the middle of trial and the name of the game has changed . . . \". (Oral Arguments, August 23, 2016, 14 AP 679).\n\n**Ground Ten:** Petitioner was denied his right to trial by jury guaranteed under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution whereby facts forming the basis for conviction [footnote omitted] and sentence must be conclusively determined by a trial jury and where in Petitioner's case those facts were determined by trial and appellate judges.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** Prior to Petitioner's resentencing on March 27, 2018, Petitioner filed a motion with the trial court in advance of the proceedings requesting of the court that it confirm the factual incidents pertaining to the counts for which Petitioner was to be resentenced (10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18). The Court denied the motion. Since resentencing was to address allied offenses, Mr. Benton made the same request prior to the start of the hearing since in order to argue allied offenses the defense needed to know what facts the trial court was considering for each count. The court again denied the request. The court then resentenced Petitioner to\nprison for counts where the court could not determine the facts decided by the jury. Ultimately, the court sentenced Petitioner to prison for alleged crimes that were never even presented to the jury for conviction. Prosecutors were permitted to introduce without limitation as many other-act allegations as they needed and then select what \"other-acts\" they wished to apply to any count for which they were unable to prove the factual bases for the indicted crimes. Count 9 and Count 14, for example, were indicted as one factual incident. The Court of Appeals confirmed that no evidence was presented of the entire alleged incident. Prosecutors mid-trial claimed that Count 9 was a never before mentioned \"drugging rape\". However, earlier in trial, when defense counsel objected to that evidence, the Court sustained the objection. At that juncture, prosecutors advised the Court that the \"drugging\" rape was not part of the indictment and was other-act evidence. Prosecutors notified the Court and defense counsel that the defense did not need to defend that charge. Later in trial, when they were unable to procure any testimony of the underlying indicted incident for Count 9 and 14, the trial court allowed prosecutors to then substitute the \"drugging\" rape incident, that prosecutors already acknowledged was not part of the indictment for what they couldn't prove. With Count 10, the Court of Appeals confirmed that no factual incident was provided in the indictment. The only facts regarding Count 10 were that the factual incident occurred in Franklin County and during 2002 and 2008. The Court of Appeals confirmed the factual basis for Count 10 changed from whatever had been indicted to an alleged incident in Marion, Ohio, in either 1998, 1999 or 2000. During resentencing on March 27, 2018, the trial court could not determine from the trial transcripts, opening, closing, jury instructions, or verdict forms, which factual incidents applied to the respective counts for which Petitioner was being resentenced. The trial court actually resentenced Petitioner on Counts 15 and 18, for two incidents, when prosecutors argued to the jury in closing that Counts 15 and 18 were one incident. On Count 15 and 18, the trial court resentenced Petitioner for two incidents, supposedly occurring in Marion, Ohio, for which Petitioner was never convicted. In fact, the record confirms that prosecutors never requested of the jury that it consider the alleged incidents the court used to resentence Petitioner. A review of the indictment, opening statement, closing argument, jury instructions and verdict forms, the only parts of the record to which the jury had access, will confirm for this court that the factual incident(s) used by the Court to resentence Petitioner appear nowhere. Petitioner was resentenced on Count 10 for what the Court of Appeals confirmed was an uncharged factual basis. Comparing Counts 10 and 11, the jury may have acquitted Petitioner for whatever factual basis anyone believes resulted in conviction for Count 10. For Count 16, a review of the indictment, opening, closing, jury instructions, and verdict forms confirms that\nprosecutors never even assigned an actual factual basis to that count. Perhaps confirming Petitioner's unanimity, *Apprendi* and due process argument, the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors don't agree on what facts support Count 16. The Court of Appeals believes that Count 16 was a factual incident that occurred in Franklin County while prosecutors believe Count 16 occurred in Marion County. Petitioner respectfully suggests that when the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors who are the ones who indicted and tried the case can't agree on what factual basis supports any count, there is clearly a due process, sufficiency, notice, double jeopardy, fair trial, unanimity, and *Apprendi* problem. A review of the same documents will further confirm that for Count 17, whatever the jury elected to apply to that count cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. The lack of unanimity impacted Petitioner's resentencing, notwithstanding any effort by the state courts to find that the jury's verdicts were unanimous. With Counts 8 through 18, Petitioner was indicted only with alleged crimes that occurred in Franklin County, Ohio between 2002 and 2008. After what Court of Appeals coined \"Serial Amendments\", prosecutors then sought conviction for alleged \"other-acts\" that occurred in Marion County, Ohio between 1998 and 2001.\n\nSecond Amended Petition, ECF No. 70, PageID 7639-62.\n\n**The Warden\u2019s Return**\n\n**Non-Cognizable Claims**\n\n**Venue**\n\nThe Warden asserts that, to the extent Petitioner is complaining of the venue of trial (Franklin County), his claim is not cognizable under the United States Constitution (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13877-80). In this same section, the Warden argues \u201cArmengau had no federal constitutional right to prove [sic] \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 that the crimes for which he was convicted were committed in Franklin County, Ohio.\u201d *Id.* at PageID 13879.\n\n**Other Acts Evidence**\n\nTo the extent Petitioner claims \u201cother acts\u201d evidence was improperly admitted against him,\nthe Warden asserts this claim is also not cognizable. *Id.* at PageID 13880-81.\n\n**Improper Indictment**\n\nThe Warden notes Petitioner\u2019s claim in Grounds Two and Six that the indictment in this case \u201cfailed to inform him of the nature of the charges, and the trial court failed to obtain subject matter jurisdiction for crimes were never presented to the grand jury or in any charging instrument.\u201d (ECF No. 73, PageID 13881, quoting Second Amended Petition, ECF No. 70, PageID 8641-42 and 7651-52). Noting that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s grand jury guarantee does not apply to the States, the Warden asserts this claim is non-cognizable. (ECF No. 73, PageID 13881, citing *Hurtado v. California*, 110 U.S. 516, 537-538 (1884); and *Branzburg v. Hayes*, 408 U.S. 665 (1972)).\n\n**Lack of Specificity in the Indictment**\n\nThe Warden asserts Petitioner\u2019s claim of lack of specificity in the indictment is also not cognizable (ECF No. 73, PageID 13883-87).\n\n**Jury Instruction Error**\n\nThe Warden notes Petitioner claims in his Fourth Ground for Relief that the trial court committed error in instructing the jury and asserts jury instruction error is not ordinarily cognizable in habeas (ECF No. 73, PageID 13887-89).\n\n**State Law Claims**\n\nThe Warden notes \u201cIn his seventh ground for relief, Armengau alleges an equal protection violation when the Ohio courts \u201cintentionally disregarded the law set by their respective Courts.\u201d\n(ECF No. 73, PageID 13889, quoting Second Amended Petition, ECF No. Doc. No. 70, PageID 7653-54). The Warden argues this claim is also not cognizable in habeas. *Id.* at PageID 13889-90.\n\n**Actual Innocence**\n\nThe Warden asserts Petitioner\u2019s actual innocence claim in Ground for Relief Eight is not cognizable in habeas. *Id.* at PageID 13890-91.\n\n**Affirmative Defenses**\n\n**Procedural Default**\n\nThe Warden asserts Armengau has procedurally defaulted claims in Ground One related to Counts 2 and 16 because they were not fairly presented to the state courts as federal constitutional claims (ECF No. 73, PageID 13896). He makes the same assertion as to Ground Two respecting Counts 2, 3, and 8. Regarding \u201cother acts\u201d evidence, the Warden asserts that claim was presented to the state courts as a trial court error, but is presented here as a prosecutorial misconduct claim. *Id.*\n\nThe Warden further asserts Armengau\u2019s jury instructions claim in Ground Four is procedurally defaulted for failure to make a contemporaneous objection. *Id.* at PageID 13898-902.\n\nPetitioner asserts he raised Grounds One through Seven and Ground Nine in his postconviction motion for dismissal. The Tenth District held these claims were barred, at least in part, by Ohio\u2019s doctrine of *res judicata* in criminal cases. The Warden asserts this procedural default as a bar (ECF No. 73, PageID 13902-04).\n\nAs to Ground Nine on jury unanimity, the Warden asserts it is procedurally defaulted by Armengau\u2019s failure to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio from denial of the claim by the Tenth\nDistrict (ECF No. 73, PageID 13904-05).\n\nRespondent reads Ground Ten as alleging \u201cthat the facts purporting to form the factual basis for his conviction and sentence were determined by judicial fact-finding and not by the jury.\u201d (ECF No. 73, PageID 13906, citing ECF No. 70, PageID 7661-62). Respondent asserts this claim is also barred by res judicata. Id.\n\nThe Warden also responds on the merits to Petitioner\u2019s first, seventh, ninth, and tenth grounds for relief (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13907-21).\n\n**Petitioner\u2019s Reply**\n\n**Fair Presentation**\n\nPetitioner first argues that he has fairly presented all his claims to the Ohio courts (ECF No. 77, PageID 13929-32). As relevant precedent for what constitutes \u201cfair presentation,\u201d he relies repeatedly on *Gartrell v. Lynaugh*, 833 F. 2d 527 (5th Cir. 1987). There is, however, published precedent from the Sixth Circuit which is thirty years newer than *Gartrell* and holds a claim is fairly presented if the petitioner\n\n(1) relied upon federal cases employing constitutional analysis; (2) relied upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis; (3) phrased the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional right; or (4) alleged facts well within the mainstream of constitutional law.\n\n*Hand v. Houk*, 871 F.3d 390, 418 (6th Cir. 2017).\n\nPetitioner complains that the record is incomplete:\n\n---\n\n4 Petitioner timely filed his Reply on July 27, 2021 (ECF No. 77). Because of its extraordinary length (226 pages), the Court granted Petitioner leave to file a summary which he did on August 2, 2021 (ECF No. 81). These two documents will be read together as Petitioner\u2019s Reply.\nthe docket (PageID 6914-6921) establishes that Petitioner filed multiple Notices of Supplemental Authority and Motions for Leave to File Supplemental Authority, all which were granted. From what Petitioner has received, none of those documents are in the record filed with this Court.\n\n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13928, n. 2). Magistrate Judge Deavers\u2019 Order for Answer required the Warden to file an answer conforming to the requirements of Rule 5 of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases (ECF No. 8, PageID 239). Rule 5 does not require the Respondent to file in the habeas court a copy of everything filed in the state courts. To the extent that something is omitted which a petitioner believes is necessary for decision of the case, a petitioner may move to expand the record under Habeas Rule 7.\n\nPetitioner complains that \u201cseveral documents from the record appear not to have been filed or provided to Petitioner pursuant to this Court's May 27th and/or 28th, 2021 Order (Doc. 61, 62).\u201d Actually ECF No. 61 strikes the appearance of attorney John Gonzalez who purported to be appearing in a capacity not permitted by this Court\u2019s Local Rules. Petitioner cites a number of additional documents he says he has not received (ECF No. 77, PageID 13929), but the record had not been ordered expanded to include those documents as of the time the Reply was filed. Regarding these documents, the Magistrate Judge has ordered either that the record be expanded to include them or that Respondent provides reference to where they appear (ECF No. 86) and the Warden has responded as ordered (ECF No. 92).\n\n**Petitioner\u2019s Statement of Facts**\n\nThe Reply next contains a Statement of Facts, which appears to be an argumentative summary of the evidence from Petitioner\u2019s perspective (ECF No. 77, PageID 13932-46). With\nrespect to findings of fact, this habeas Court is bound by state court findings, including those made by the Tenth District Court of Appeals, unless Petitioner shows those findings to be in error by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e). That showing must be made from evidence already of record in the state court proceedings. Pinholster, supra. That is to say, this habeas court cannot make a de novo determination of the facts.\n\nRepeatedly in his Statement of Facts, Petitioner makes assertions of fact with no record reference. This violates Magistrate Judge Deavers\u2019 Order for Answer which requires \u201cAll papers filed in the case thereafter [after filing of the State Court Record] by each party shall include record references to the PAGEID number.\u201d (ECF No. 8, PageID 240). At PageID 13935-36, Petitioner purports to repeat comments made to the media by a Major Randy Caryer of the Marion Police. At PageID 13937, n.8, he purports to present facts that occurred September 17, 2008, in a court in Marion, Ohio, involving accuser K.R. At PageID 13938, n. 11, he asserts that \u201c[d]uring multiple pretrial hearings prosecutors repeatedly affirmed that all the alleged incidents with regards to these counts occurred in Petitioner's Columbus Office.\u201d On the same page he asserts that accuser L.M.\u2019s account of her referral to him is incorrect. At PageID 13939, he asserts accuser L.M. \u201cwas charged criminally for beating her young daughter in 2003 (Trial Exhibit H-5, Case No. 2003 CRB 8472, Domestic Violence Case Number).\u201d Whether this is a reference to a trial exhibit in this case or in the domestic violence case, the exhibit is not in the record. Petitioner also relies on an affidavit by a Diane Caldwell attached to his Petition (ECF No. 1, Ex. D. This Affidavit was not part of the State Court Record and this Court is therefore barred from considering it by Pinholster.\nNon-Cognizable Claims\n\nPetitioner asserts that he submitted his sufficiency of the evidence claim on direct appeal and the Tenth District elected instead to decide that claim as if it were about venue. Petitioner argues his case \u201crepresents an unreasonable application of federal and state law and an unreasonable determination of facts based on the record. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254 (d)(1) and (d)(2)\u201d (ECF No. 77, PageID 13949). That is not the correct standard. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), the state courts\u2019 decisions on claims of federal constitutional violations are entitled to deference unless they are contrary to or objectively unreasonable applications of United States Supreme Court precedent. On the other hand, we do not sit as an appellate court to decide whether any state court committed an error of state law. Instead, we are bound by state court determinations of state law. Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U.S. 74 (2005).\n\nPetitioner then, under this heading of Non-Cognizable Claims argues the merits of his Grounds for Relief for 159 pages as follows: Ground One at PageID 13948-14005; Ground Two at PageID 14005-36; Grounds Three and Six, argued together at PageID 14036-81; Ground Four at PageID 14081-86; Ground Seven at PageID 14087-91; Ground Eight at PageID 14091-95; Ground Nine at PageID 14095-104; and Ground Ten at PageID 14105-07.\n\n5 Throughout these 50+ pages, Petitioner repeatedly cites to the exhibits attached to ECF No. 54. The Magistrate Judge has twice held these exhibits cannot be added to the record (ECF Nos. 64 and 71, based on Pinholster, supra.) Petitioner has objected to both of those decisions. S. D. Ohio Civ. R. 72.3 provides \u201cWhen an objection is filed to a Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling on a non-case dispositive motion, the ruling remains in full force and effect unless and until it is (1) stayed by the Magistrate Judge or a District Judge, or (2) overruled by a District Judge.\u201d Since the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Pinholster ruling remains in effect, the exhibits will not be considered in rendering this Report.\nExhaustion, Procedural Default, and Waiver\n\nPetitioner argues that he has exhausted all available state court remedies and that he has neither procedurally defaulted nor waived any of his claims (ECF No. 77, PageID 14107-33).\n\nResentencing\n\nPetitioner contends that \u201cwhatever may have been used to determine the facts for the counts upon which Petitioner was resentenced, was obtained from uncharged other-acts\u201d (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14133).\n\nIt appears that the trial court at resentencing considered facts for each count that were different from the facts considered by the Court at the time of sentencing and which were different than the facts considered by the jury for conviction. A court is without jurisdiction to impose a sentence for an offense not charged in the indictment. United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 [(2002)].\n\nId. at PageID 14134. And again\n\nAt resentencing on March 27, 2018, the defense requested the Court provide the parties with the underlying factual basis for each count for which Appellant was convicted so that the defense could properly argue the respective sentencing issues (Doc. 28-3, PageID 6541, Tp. 15). The trial court refused the request and failed to provide the facts underlying each count.\n\nId. at PageID 14142.\n\nClaims and Issues Assertedly Not Challenged or Addressed by Respondent\n\nPetitioner asserts there are some claims he has made which Respondent has not addressed. \u201cAside from some general reference Respondent does not appear to provide any specific analysis\nto Petitioner's claims of Fair Trial, Prosecutorial Misconduct, or constructive amendment of the charging document.\u201d (ECF No. 77, PageID 14147).\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe following table sets forth the relationships, as the Magistrate Judge understands them, between accusers, counts of the Indictment and the verdicts.\n\n| Accuser | Counts Charged | Verdict |\n|---------|----------------|---------|\n| CC      | 1, 2, 3        | Guilty on Count 2 \u2013 sentenced to time served Acquitted on Counts 1 & 3 |\n| LG      | 4, 5           | Acquitted |\n| AC      | 6, 7           | Acquitted |\n| KR      | 8              | convicted |\n| LM      | 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 | Guilty on 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 & 18 (5 & 10 merged) \u00b6 48 Acquitted on 9, 11, 12, 13 |\n\n**Ground One: Conviction on Insufficient Evidence**\n\nIn his First Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he was convicted on insufficient evidence on Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. As noted above, because Petitioner\u2019s custody on Count 2 ended before he filed his Petition, any claims regarding that count are no longer cognizable in habeas corpus and Count Two will not be considered further. *Maleng v. Cook*, 490 U.S. 488 (1989).\n\nAn allegation that a verdict was entered upon insufficient evidence states a claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307 (1979); *In re Winship*, 397 U.S. 358 (1970); *Johnson v. Coyle*, 200 F.3d\n987, 991 (6th Cir. 2000); Bagby v. Sowders, 894 F.2d 792, 794 (6th Cir. 1990)(en banc). In order for a conviction to be constitutionally sound, every element of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship, 397 U.S. at 364.\n\n[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt . . . . This familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\n\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. at 319; Smith v. Nagy, 962 F.3d 192, 205 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Jackson). This standard \u201cmust be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.\u201d Id. (quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 324). This rule was recognized in Ohio law at State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St. 3d 259 (1991). Of course, it is state law which determines the elements of offenses; but once the state has adopted the elements, it must then prove each of them beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship, supra.\n\nIn cases such as Petitioner\u2019s challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and filed after enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214)(the \u201cAEDPA\u201d), two levels of deference to state decisions are required:\n\nIn an appeal from a denial of habeas relief, in which a petitioner challenges the constitutional sufficiency of the evidence used to convict him, we are thus bound by two layers of deference to groups who might view facts differently than we would. First, as in all sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges, we must determine whether, viewing the trial testimony and exhibits in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979). In doing so, we do not reweigh the evidence, re-evaluate the credibility of witnesses, or substitute our judgment for that of the jury. See United States v. Hilliard, 11 F.3d 618, 620 (6th Cir. 1993). Thus, even though we might have not voted to convict a defendant had we participated in jury deliberations, we must uphold\nthe jury verdict if any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty after resolving all disputes in favor of the prosecution. Second, even were we to conclude that a rational trier of fact could not have found a petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, on habeas review, we must still defer to the state appellate court's sufficiency determination as long as it is not unreasonable. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2).\n\nBrown v. Konteh, 567 F.3d 191, 205 (6th Cir. 2009). In a sufficiency of the evidence habeas corpus case, deference should be given to the trier-of-fact's verdict under Jackson v. Virginia and then to the appellate court's consideration of that verdict, as commanded by AEDPA. Tucker v. Palmer, 541 F.3d 652 (6th Cir. 2008); accord Davis v. Lafler, 658 F.3d 525, 531 (6th Cir. 2011)(en banc); Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. 37, 43 (2012).\n\nWe have made clear that Jackson claims face a high bar in federal habeas proceedings because they are subject to two layers of judicial deference. First, on direct appeal, \"it is the responsibility of the jury -- not the court -- to decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial. A reviewing court may set aside the jury's verdict on the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could have agreed with the jury.\" Cavazos v. Smith, 565 U. S. 1, ___, 132 S. Ct. 2, 181 L. Ed. 2d 311, 313 (2011) (per curiam). And second, on habeas review, \"a federal court may not overturn a state court decision rejecting a sufficiency of the evidence challenge simply because the federal court disagrees with the state court. The federal court instead may do so only if the state court decision was 'objectively unreasonable.'\" Ibid. (quoting Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___, 130 S. Ct. 1855, 176 L. Ed. 2d 678 (2010)).\n\nColeman v. Johnson, 566 U.S. 650, 651, (2012)(per curiam); Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. 37, 43 (2012) (per curiam). The federal courts do not make credibility determinations in reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims. Brooks v. Tennessee, 626 F.3d 878, 887 (6th Cir. 2010). Thompson v. Skipper, 981 F.3d 476 (6th Cir., 2020). \u201cTo evaluate a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, we consider \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 Smith v. Nagy, 962 F.3d 192, 205 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia,\n443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979)). This standard \u201cmust be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.\u201d Id. (quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 324).\u201d\n\nThe state court\u2019s application \u201cmust be \u2018objectively unreasonable,\u2019 not merely wrong; even \u2018clear error\u2019 will not suffice.\u201d Nagy, 962 F.3d at 199 (quoting White v. Woodall, 572 U.S. 415, 419 (2014)). In other words, \u201crelief is available under \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2019s unreasonable-application clause if, and only if, it is so obvious that a clearly established rule applies to a given set of facts that there could be no \u2018fairminded disagreement\u2019 on the question.\u201d Woodall, 572 U.S. at 427 (quoting Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 103 (2011)).\n\nTogether, Jackson and AEDPA\u2019s two layers of deference dictate that \u201ca federal court\u2019s \u2018review of a state-court conviction for sufficiency of the evidence is very limited.\u2019\u201d Tackett v. Trierweiler, 956 F.3d 358, 367 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Thomas v. Stephenson, 898 F.3d 693, 698 (6th Cir. 2018)).\n\nA habeas court cannot consider post-trial evidence in deciding a Jackson v. Virginia claim. McDaniel v. Brown, 558 U.S. 120 (2010).\n\nIn order to demonstrate that the state court's decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts under \u00a7 2254(d)(2), a petitioner must both establish the \"unreasonable determination\" and show \"that the resulting state court decision was 'based on' that unreasonable determination.\"\n\nTitlow v. Burt, 680 F.3d 577, 585 (6th Cir. 2012)(rev\u2019d on another issue Burt v. Titlow, 571 U.S. 12, 20 (2013). quoting Rice v. White, 660 F.3d 242, 250 (6th Cir. 2011).\n\nPetitioner does not state in the Second Amended Petition itself what elements of the convicted crimes were not supported by sufficient evidence. However, in his Reply he claims the State failed to prove that the location of the offenses with which he was charged was in Franklin\nCounty, Ohio, as alleged in the Indictment (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13949). He asserts the Tenth District Court of Appeals, in order \u201cto avoid reversing the convictions, . . . simply ignored the sufficiency issue raised by Petitioner.\u201d Further, he claims, the \u201clocation of the crime charged is a material \"fact\" that the state is required to prove.\u201d *Id.* citing *Knight v. State*, 54 Ohio State 365 (1896) [the location of the crime is an essential fact and essential element that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt because it is the place of the commission of the offense charged].\n\nPetitioner correctly notes that it is state law which determines the elements of a crime which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to satisfy the *Jackson* standard (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13950, citing *In re Winship*, 397 U.S. 358 (1970)).\n\nPetitioner asserts he presented this location-of-the-crime claim to the Tenth District on direct appeal, but that court decided a different claim, a location-of-the-trial claim (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13950-52).\n\nOn appeal Armengau presented the relevant sufficiency of the evidence claim as Assignment of Error VI:\n\n[VI.] The trial court erred in denying Javier Armengau's Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, and violated his rights to due process and a fair trial when, in the absence of sufficient evidence, it convicted him of counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18.\n\n*Armengau I* at \u00b6 53, quoting Armengau\u2019s appellate brief (State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 8).\n\nThe Brief sets forth the following Issue Presented for Review as to this Assignment of Error: \u201cIs a conviction based upon insufficient evidence when venue is not proved beyond a reasonable doubt as charged in the indictment?\u201d *Id.* at PageID 7730. Thus Petitioner himself (through counsel) characterized the issue presented as one of \u201cvenue.\u201d\n\nIn arguing Assignment of Error VI, Petitioner made it clear that his objection was that the State had presented no evidence that the offenses alleged in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18\nwere committed in Franklin County as alleged in the indictment. *Id.* at PageID 7857. That was because, he claimed, \"'Venue'\" has two applications-locale and element. Locale venue is governed by R.C. 2901.12. But that statute has no impact on element venue. Element venue is controlled by the indictment and the evidence,\" *Id.* at PageID 7859, relying on *State v. Hampton*, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24 (2012).\n\nThe Tenth District decided Assignment of Error VI as follows:\n\n**Venue**\n\n\u00b6 104 Appellant's sixth assignment of error asserts that appellant's convictions under Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the indictment must be reversed because the state failed to present evidence to support venue for those crimes as charged in the indictment, and the trial court accordingly erred in denying appellant's Crim.R. 29 motion made after the state rested. We disagree.\n\n\u00b6 105 Under Crim.R. 29(A), a court \u201cshall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses * * * if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.\u201d Because a Crim.R. 29 motion questions the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c[w]e apply the same standard of review to Crim.R. 29 motions as we use in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d *State v. Hernandez*, 10th Dist. No. 09AP-125, 2009-Ohio-5128, 2009 WL 3090423, \u00b6 6; *State v. Tenace*, 109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-Ohio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, \u00b6 37; *State v. Hubbard*, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-945, 2013-Ohio-2735, 2013 WL 3341171, \u00b6 16. \u201cSufficiency of the evidence is a legal standard that tests whether the evidence introduced at trial is legally sufficient to support a verdict.\u201d *State v. Cassell*, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-1093, 2010-Ohio-1881, 2010 WL 1731238, \u00b6 36, citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. Where the evidence, \u201cif believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d it is sufficient to sustain a conviction. *Id.; see also State v. Neil*, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-981, 2016-Ohio-4762, 2016 WL 3574549, \u00b6 94;\n1. Legal Standards\n\n{\u00b6 106} Venue commonly refers to the appropriate place of trial for a criminal prosecution within a state. \u201c[J]urisdiction and venue are not the same, as the former denotes the power of the court to hear the case and the latter denotes the situs of trial.\u201d State v. Giffin, 62 Ohio App.3d 396, 403, 575 N.E.2d 887 (10th Dist. 1991), citing State v. Loucks, 28 Ohio App.2d 77, 274 N.E.2d 773 (4th Dist. 1971). Proper venue insures that \u201cthe state [does not] indiscriminately [seek] a favorable location for trial or [select] a site that might be an inconvenience or disadvantage to the defendant.\u201d State v. Meridy, 12th Dist. No. CA2003-11-091, 2005-Ohio-241, 2005 WL 123993, \u00b6 12, quoting State v. Gentry, 61 Ohio Misc.2d 31, 34, 573 N.E.2d 220 (1990). The fact that venue is not a restriction on territorial jurisdiction is underscored by the provisions of Crim. R. 18(B) and R.C. 2901.12(K), which provide for a change of venue if the trial court finds that a fair and impartial jury cannot be seated in the court where the action is pending.\n\n{\u00b6 107} Because venue is neither a jurisdictional nor a material element of a criminal offense, the indictment is only required to contain an allegation that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the court. State v. Andrews, 148 Ohio App.3d 92, 772 N.E.2d 167 (10th Dist. 2002). Even when multiple offenses are alleged in an indictment, an indictment is not rendered invalid where the \u201cplace has been stated once therein.\u201d State v. Williams, 53 Ohio App.3d 1, 557 N.E.2d 818 (10th Dist. 1988). While venue is not a material element of the offense as charged, it is a fact that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt unless waived by a criminal defendant. State v. Hampton, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, 2012-Ohio-5688, 983 N.E.2d 324, \u00b6 22; State v. Birt, 2013-Ohio-1379, 5 N.E.3d 1000, \u00b6 27. \u201cVenue need not be proven in express terms; it may be established either directly or indirectly by all the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d State v. Jackson, 141 Ohio St.3d 171, 2014-Ohio-3707, 23 N.E.3d 1023, \u00b6 144.\n\n{\u00b6 108} The indictment in the present case alleged for each count that the criminal conduct occurred \u201cwithin the county of Franklin.\u201d (May 20, 2013 Indictment, Counts 1 through 18.) Appellant argues that for all but three of the counts for which he was convicted, the state failed to prove venue because it introduced no evidence at all that the crimes occurred in Franklin County: for Counts 8 (gross sexual imposition, K.R.), 10 (rape, L.M.), 14 (kidnapping, L.M.),\nand 15, 17, and 18 (sexual battery, L.M.), the only evidence heard placed the offenses in Marion County. In contrast, for Counts 2 and 3 (public indecency and gross sexual imposition, C.C.), and Count 16 (sexual battery, L.M.), appellant concedes on appeal that the evidence supported venue in Franklin County. At the close of the state's case, the defense moved, unsuccessfully, for a Crim.R. 29 acquittal for those incidents for which the evidence established the location as Marion County. Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his Crim.R. 29 motion.\n\n\u00b6 109 The state responds that any deficiency in the indictment was cured by subsequent amendment of either the indictment or the bill of particulars. We disagree. It is the language of the indictment that defines the venue for which the state bears the burden of proof. Hampton, supra, at \u00b6 23. As stated above, the original indictment specified Franklin County as venue for all crimes. The state never amended the venue allegation in the indictment. Therefore, the state had to prove that venue was proper in Franklin County.\n\n\u00b6 110 The state also argues that all crimes took place as part of a course of criminal conduct across several jurisdictions, including Franklin County, establishing venue in Franklin County under the course of criminal conduct terms of R.C. 2901.12(H). We conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence to prove venue under the course of criminal conduct provisions in R.C. 2901.12(H).\n\n2. Venue and Course of Criminal Conduct\u2013R.C. 2901.12(H)\n\n\u00b6 111 When an offender, as part of a course of criminal conduct, commits offenses in different jurisdictions, the offender may be tried for all of those offenses in any jurisdiction in which one of those offenses or any element of one of those offenses occurred. R.C. 2901.12(H). To establish a course of criminal conduct, the statute provides in relevant part:\n\n(H) * * * Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the course of criminal conduct, any of the following is prima-facie evidence of a course of criminal conduct:\n(1) The offenses involved the same victim, or victims of the same type or from the same group.\n(2) The offenses were committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, or capacity, or relationship to another.\n(3) The offenses were committed as part of the same transaction or chain of events, or in furtherance of the same purpose or objective.\n(4) The offenses were committed in furtherance of the same conspiracy.\n(5) The offenses involved the same or a similar modus operandi.\n(6) The offenses were committed along the offender's line of travel in this state, regardless of the offender's point of origin or destination.\n\nR.C. 2901.12(H).\n\n\u00b6 112 \u201cR.C. 2901.12(G) and (H) are statutory reflections of the modern mobility of criminals to perform unlawful deeds over vast geographical boundaries.\u201d State v. Draggo, 65 Ohio St.2d 88, 90, 418 N.E.2d 1343 (1981). Consistent with this multi-county venue, \u201ca grand jury of one county has authority to indict on offenses occurring in other counties provided that those offenses are part of a course of criminal conduct.\u201d State v. Ahmed, 8th Dist. No. 84220, 2005-Ohio-2999, 2005 WL 1406282, \u00b6 11. The Supreme Court of Ohio confirmed the law as stated in Ahmed when it decided Jackson at \u00b6 131:\n\nThere is no constitutional or statutory provision that prohibited the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury from indicting Jackson for offenses that occurred in Erie and Lorain Counties as part of a course of criminal conduct that included crimes within Cuyahoga County. R.C. 2901.11 and 2901.12 permit a grand jury to indict an offender for offenses that occurred outside the county, provided that the offenses are part of the same course of criminal conduct that took place in the county in which the grand jury resides.\n\n\u00b6 113 The present case involves a series of offenses that fit four of the criteria enumerated in R.C. 2901.12(H). The victims were \u201cof the same type, or from the same group\u201d under R.C. 2901.12(H)(1), because they are associated with appellant's law practice as clients, relatives of clients, or employees. The offenses were committed \u201cin the offender's same employment, or capacity, or relationship to another\u201d under R.C. 2901.12(H)(2), again based on the centrality of appellant's law practice in his selection of victims. The offenses involved \u201cthe same or similar modus operandi\u201d under R.C. 2901.12(H)(5), based on the grooming and exploitation of vulnerable female clients or relatives of clients. Finally, the offenses\nwere committed in furtherance of the same purpose or objective (sexual gratification). R.C. 2901.12(H)(3).\n\n\u00b6 114 A similar case involving abuse of clients in a professional practice is persuasively on point. In Ahmed, the defendant, a licensed obstetrician and gynecologist, operated medical offices in several counties. The grand jury in Cuyahoga County returned an indictment charging him with multiple counts of rape, sexual imposition, and sexual battery involving 37 former patients. The indictment specified that the offenses occurred at Ahmed's offices in Cuyahoga, Summit, and Geauga counties. After disposing of the preliminary question of whether the grand jury could return an indictment addressing the out-of-county crimes, the Eighth District Court of Appeals found that trial venue in Cuyahoga County for all offenses was appropriate: \u201cThe evidence at trial revealed that all of the victims were Ahmed's patients, all of the offenses occurred at his medical offices while the victims were seeking medical care from him, and while situated in a vulnerable position. Further, each victim identified the office location where the offense(s) occurred. Based on this evidence, we find that the State adequately proved that venue was proper.\u201d Ahmed at \u00b6 18.\n\n\u00b6 115 Ahmed presented the same type of course of criminal conduct that the state alleges here. Based on this precedent and analysis of the applicable statutes governing venue, we conclude that the state proved venue was proper in Franklin County for Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the indictment.\n\n\u00b6 116 Citing Hampton, appellant argues that because the indictment alleged the conduct associated with Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 occurred in Franklin County, the state could only establish venue by proving that the alleged conduct occurred in Franklin County. We do not read Hampton so restrictively. Hampton involved a situation where all of the alleged criminal conduct occurred outside the county where the case was venued. Therefore, R.C. 2901.12(H) was not applicable. Moreover, the Hampton court noted that \u201c[t]he General Assembly has given the state considerable flexibility with respect to establishing venue,\u201d citing R.C. 2901.12(G) as an example. Hampton at \u00b6 23. See also State v. Young, 2017-Ohio-1400, 89 N.E.3d 175, \u00b6 15\u201316 (finding no authority for proposition that an indictment must include \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d language when the state intends to proceed under R.C. 2901.12(H)). Lastly, appellant was on notice that the state would establish venue by proving the conduct occurred in Franklin County \u201cor otherwise properly venued under R.C. 2901.12, the defendant, as part of a criminal course of conduct as defined in R.C.\n2901.12(H)(1), which encompassed at least, Franklin and Marion Counties, Ohio.\u201d (June 1, 2014 Bill of Particulars at 6.) As previously noted, the indictment alleged and the state proved, that some of the alleged criminal conduct occurred in Franklin County and that the other offenses in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 were committed pursuant to a course of criminal conduct as defined in R.C. 2901.12(H).\n\n3. Conclusion\n\n\u00b6 117 For all of these reasons, we overrule appellant's sixth assignment of error.\n\nArmengau I, supra.\n\nArmengau appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio from this decision, represented by the same Assistant State Public Defender who had represented him before the Tenth District. He pleaded two relevant Propositions of Law:\n\nFirst Proposition of Law: This Court's decision in Hampton does not allow a defendant to be convicted of a crime when the indictment asserts the criminal conduct occurred in a specific county, and does not reference R.C. 2901.12, and all evidence presented demonstrates that the crime occurred in a different county than that named in the indictment. RC. 2901.12; State v. Hampton, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, 2012-Ohio-5688, 983 N.E.2d 324.\n\nSecond Proposition of Law: Revised Code 2901.12(1-1) is unconstitutional and violates Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution which requires that a criminal act be tried in the county in which it occurred. R.C. 2901.12(H); Article I, Section 10, Ohio Constitution.\n\n(Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 13, PageID 8041).\n\nArmengau admitted that the Ohio \u201cintermediate appellate courts remain vexed by the import of Hampton and the precise requirements and legal effects set forth therein\u201d and that the Tenth District had held Armengau\u2019s argument was \u201ctoo restrictive a reading of Hampton.\u201d Id. at PageID 8046. He asked the Supreme Court of Ohio \u201caccept this issue to determine whether an indictment that unequivocally represents a crime occurred in one county can be cured by R.C.2901.12.\u201d As\nan alternative he asked the court to declare Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.12(H) as interpreted by the Tenth District to be a violation of the Ohio Constitution. *Id.* at PageID 8047-48. The Ohio Supreme Court denied review in a form entry, *State v. Armengau*, 151 Ohio St. 3d 1511 (2018). (State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 14).\n\nPetitioner presented this issue again to a different panel of the Tenth District on appeal from denial of his Presentence Motion for Acquittal on Resentencing. The Tenth District again denied relief based on *res judicata*, law of the case, and the failure of Armengau to persuade the appellate court that its prior decision on \u201cvenue\u201d was in error. It noted that:\n\n{\u00b6 16} These are issues appellant could have raised in a motion to reconsider in *Armengau*, 2017-Ohio-4452. Appellant did not file a motion to reconsider this court's decision in *Armengau*, 2017-Ohio-4452.\n\n{\u00b6 17} Appellant did, however, file an appeal with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court did not accept his appeal for review. See *State v. Armengau*, 2018-Ohio-365. The Supreme Court also denied appellant's subsequent motion requesting reopening of appeal. See *State v. Armengau*, 2018-Ohio-1600. The Supreme Court denied another motion filed by appellant on April 30, 2018. Finally, the Supreme Court denied appellant's July 2, 2018 motion requesting the court grant motion and supplemental notice.\n\n{\u00b6 18} Finally, we note appellant has made another attempt to raise the same issues raised in this appeal and in his direct appeal in his appeal of the resentencing now pending before this court in *State v. Armengau*, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-300.\n\n*Armengau II.* To the extent Petitioner believes *Armengau I* is a misinterpretation of *Hampton*, he has offered both the Tenth District and the Ohio Supreme Court ample opportunity to accept his view, without any success. This Court is therefore bound by the Tenth District\u2019s interpretation of *Hampton*. *Bradshaw*, supra.\n\n\u201cVenue\u201d is a term that has, in recent years, come into common usage in American English to denote where some event has occurred or will occur. Thus Americans discuss \u201csports venues\u201d\nor \u201cconcert venues\u201d in common parlance. Brian Garner writes that the word in legal usage means \u201c(1) originally the neighborhood from which a jury had to be selected; (2) the county or other territorial unit over which a trial court had jurisdiction; or (3) the proper or a possible place for the trial of a lawsuit.\u201d Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 2nd, at 916 (Oxford Univ. Press 1995). None of these meanings fits comfortably with the claims Petitioner makes in his First Ground for Relief. Indeed, he criticizes the Tenth District for deciding what it labeled as a venue issue, but it was the same issue he had himself labeled \u201cvenue\u201d in his appellate brief.\n\nInstead of arguing about venue in any of these senses, Armengau is arguing about venue in the sense of location of the offense. In sum, he claims that the location of the offense as charged in the indictment is a material or substantive element which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no dispute that the conduct charged as criminal in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 occurred (if at all\\(^6\\)) in Marion County, Ohio, and not in Franklin County, Ohio. Nor is there any dispute that the indictment charged this conduct occurred in Franklin County and was never amended. The State did provide an amended bill of particulars prior to trial that alleged conduct in Marion County, but did not amend the indictment.\n\nUnder *Jackson v. Virginia, supra*, the State must prove all the substantial or material elements of a charged crime by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioner correctly asserts that it is state law which determines what are the elements. (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13950, citing *Winship*).\n\nArmengau relies principally on *State v. Hampton*, 134 Ohio St.3d 447 (2012). Hampton was indicted on charges he committed a home invasion and inflicted serious injuries in Franklin\n\n---\n\n\\(^6\\) The jury found, applying the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, that the conduct occurred. Petitioner does not concede that point and the Magistrate Judge respects his denial with the phrase \u201cif at all.\u201d It is not an expression of personal doubt, which would be inappropriate.\nCounty, Ohio. During the State\u2019s case in chief, the lead detective testified \u201che had just learned that these offenses had occurred in Fairfield County, not in Franklin County.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 5. The court took a motion for acquittal under Ohio R. Crim P. 29 under advisement, but granted it after defense rested without presenting evidence, holding the State had failed to prove \u201cvenue.\u201d The State appealed, but the Tenth District held the State had no right to appeal a judgment of acquittal. The Supreme Court of Ohio granted review on three propositions of law proposed by the State and decided:\n\n\u00b6 18 In the state's second proposition of law, the state suggests that lack of venue cannot result in an \u201cacquittal\u201d under Crim.R. 29 because motions under that rule are limited to claims of lack of proof of one or more material elements of the offense. Venue, the state argues, is not a material element of the offense.\n\n\u00b6 19 The Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10 provides an accused the right to \u201ca speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county in which the offense is alleged to have been committed.\u201d We have stated, \u201cSection 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution fixes venue, or the proper place to try a criminal matter * * *.\u201d *State v. Headley*, 6 Ohio St.3d 475, 477, 453 N.E.2d 716 (1983). We have also stated, \u201cA conviction may not be had in a criminal case where the proof fails to show that the crime alleged in the indictment occurred in the county where the indictment was returned.\u201d *State v. Nevius*, 147 Ohio St. 263, 71 N.E.2d 258 (1947), paragraph three of the syllabus. We have also stated that \u201cit is not essential that the venue of the crime be proven in express terms, provided it be established by all the facts and circumstances in the case, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime was committed in the county and state as alleged in the indictment.\u201d *State v. Dickerson*, 77 Ohio St. 34, 82 N.E. 969 (1907), paragraph one of the syllabus.\n\n\u00b6 20 Under Article I, Section 10 and R.C. 2901.12, evidence of proper venue must be presented in order to sustain a conviction for an offense. *Headley* at 477, 453 N.E.2d 716, citing *State v. Draggo*, 65 Ohio St.2d 88, 90, 418 N.E.2d 1343 (1981); *State v. Gribble*, 24 Ohio St.2d 85, 263 N.E.2d 904 (1970); *Nevius*, 147 Ohio St. 263, 71 N.E.2d 258.\n\n\u00b6 21 In *Nevius*, we affirmed the decision of the court of appeals as it related to the finding of insufficient evidence relating to venue,\nbut we then reversed the order of the court of appeals remanding the matter for a new trial, instead ruling that the trial court should have granted a directed verdict in favor of the defendant on count four of the indictment, and we discharged the defendant accordingly on that count. *Id.* at 266\u2013267, 287, 71 N.E.2d 258. This common-law concept of a directed verdict has now been memorialized through Crim.R. 29.\n\n{\u00b6 22} In arguing that insufficient proof of venue does not justify acquittal, the state would limit application of Crim.R. 29 to situations in which the elements of the offense have not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The plain language of the rule itself does not distinguish between \u201cmaterial\u201d elements and \u201cimmaterial\u201d elements. Instead, the plain language of the rule itself simply indicates that a judgment of acquittal is appropriate when \u201cthe evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.\u201d If the state fails to produce evidence of proper venue, then the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses. But, as stated above, Crim.R. 29 does not limit itself to elements or \u201cmaterial\u201d elements of the offense. The question is whether \u201cthe evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Most jurisdictions place some burden upon the state to prove venue\u2014whether it be beyond a reasonable doubt, by a preponderance of the evidence, or by some evidence\u2014because it is a fact of the crime. See 4 LaFave, *Criminal Procedure*, Section 16.1(c), at 714 (3d Ed.2007). And Ohio has required proof of venue beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction. *Knight v. State*, 54 Ohio St. 365, 377, 43 N.E. 995 (1896); *Dickerson*, 77 Ohio St. 34, 82 N.E. 969, paragraph one of the syllabus; *Nevius*, 147 Ohio St. 263, 71 N.E.2d 258.\n\n{\u00b6 23} Crim.R. 29 is clear and straightforward and does not limit its application to elements of the offense alone\u2014the trial judge may grant an acquittal when there is a failure of proof to sustain a conviction. Nothing in the Constitution, statutes, or rules requires a defendant to raise the issue of venue before trial. The state has the obligation to ensure the proper venue within the indictment, for the indictment puts the defendant on notice and the state to its proof. The General Assembly has given the state considerable flexibility with respect to establishing venue when the state cannot determine the precise location at which the offense took place. See, e.g., R.C. 2901.12(G), which allows for an offense that was committed in any of two or more jurisdictions to be charged in any of those jurisdictions.\nOver a century of well-established jurisprudence clearly mandates that a motion for judgment of acquittal must be granted when the evidence is insufficient for reasonable minds to find that venue is proper. Here, it is undisputed that all of the events in question occurred in Fairfield County, not Franklin County, as alleged in the indictment. Under Headley, Crim.R. 29, R.C. 2901.12, and the well-established common-law rule set forth in cases like Nevius, a judgment of acquittal may be entered when the state has failed at trial to prove the venue of the offense as alleged in the indictment.\n\nHampton, supra.\n\nHampton conflates under the label \u201cvenue\u201d the questions of the proper place for trial and location of the offense, but does hold location of the offense as alleged in the indictment must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. On the other hand, it does recognize the General Assembly, presumably constitutionally, \u201chas given the state considerable flexibility with respect to establishing venue when the state cannot determine the precise location at which the offense took place.\u201d The opinion provides no discussion of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.12(H), the statute relied on by the Tenth District in this case.\n\nWhat is the proper application of Hampton to this case? That is a question of Ohio, not federal, law and on questions of state law, federal habeas courts are bound by state court rulings. Bradshaw, supra. The Tenth District plainly understood Hampton as relevant binding precedent, but did not believe the decision should be read as narrowly as Armengau insisted. It noted the Hampton court had recognized the flexibility the General Assembly had given counties in complying with the Ohio Constitution in course-of-conduct/multiple county situations and found Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.12(H) applied in this case. It also noted that Hampton was a one offense indictment, not involving course of conduct, where all the charged misconduct occurred in a county other than the county of indictment.\n\nHampton was in part an enforcement of the Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10 which\nprovides an accused the right to \u201ca speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county in which the offense is alleged to have been committed.\u201d While the speedy and public trial and impartial jury requirements are embodied in the Sixth Amendment and all of these are made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, the U.S. Constitution says nothing about trial in the same county where the offenses are alleged to have occurred. Nor can Armengau\u2019s argument be successfully construed as a federal right to grand jury indictment for state crimes, because no such right exists. The Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not applicable to the States. Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516 (1884); Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 687-88 n. 25 (1972); Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975); Williams v. Haviland, 467 F.3d 527 (6th Cir. 2006) (Apprendi does not change this result).\n\nPetitioner has no federal due process right to have this Court enforce his Ohio Article I, \u00a7 10, right. Failure to abide by state law is not itself a constitutional violation. Roberts v. City of Troy, 773 F.2d 720 (6th Cir. 1985). Violation by a State of its own procedural rules does not necessarily constitute a violation of due process. Bates v. Sponberg, 547 F.2d 325 (6th Cir. 1976); Ryan v. Aurora City Bd. of Educ., 540 F.2d 222, 228 (6th Cir. 1976). \u201cA state cannot be said to have a federal due process obligation to follow all of its procedures; such a system would result in the constitutionalizing of every state rule, and would not be administrable.\u201d Levine v. Torvik, 986 F.2d 1506, 1515 (6th Cir. 1993).\n\nThere is no federal constitutional right to be tried for a crime in the same county where a grand jury charges the crime occurred. Armengau\u2019s First Ground for Relief should be dismissed as not cognizable in federal habeas corpus.\n\n---\n\n7 The Vicinage Clause requires that federal criminal trials be held in the judicial district in which they are alleged to have occurred and that those districts be determined in advance.\nGround Two: Lack of Notice of Crimes Charged\n\nIn his Second Ground for Relief in the Second Amended Petition, Armengau claims he was denied due process of law when the indictment did not adequately inform him of the \u201cspecific crimes\u201d he was charged with committing in that the prosecutors changed the date range and the location(s) of the offense(s).\n\nIn the Reply, however, Armengau labels Ground Two as being about \u201cNotice, Defective Indictment & Other Acts\u201d (ECF No. 77, PageID 14005). He argues\n\nWhat Ohio law doesn't permit is the use of \"other acts\" to form the factual basis of any charged crime. By Respondent's own admission, the convictions in Petitioner's case cannot stand as the factual basis for each crime was established by the introduction and substitution of \"other act\" evidence.\n\n* * *\n\nRespondent fails to note for this Court where Petitioner was provided notice that he would have to defend allegations for Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 that occurred in Marion, Ohio or that for counts 10 and 14 through 18, that he would have to defend allegations in 1998, 1999 or 2000.\n\nId.\n\nPetitioner begins his argument in the Reply on this claim by alleging he was subjected to a constructive amendment of the indictment (ECF No. 77, PageID 14006). He asserts that under both Ohio law and the United States Constitution, constructive amendments are forbidden. This argument misses an important distinction. The Ohio Constitution requires a grand jury indictment for state felonies to be tried in Ohio courts. Likewise the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution requires grand jury indictment for federal felonies to be tried in federal courts. The\n\n---\n\n8 Petitioner gives no record reference for this alleged admission.\nprohibition against constructive amendment enforces the grand jury requirement in each set of courts. However, the Fifth Amendment grand jury clause is not applicable to the States. *Hurtado v. California*, 110 U.S. 516 (1884); *Branzburg v. Hayes*, 408 U.S. 665, 687-88 n. 25 (1972); *Gerstein v. Pugh*, 420 U.S. 103 (1975); *Williams v. Haviland*, 467 F.3d 527 (6th Cir. 2006) (*Apprendi* does not change this result). Nor is the Ohio grand jury requirement enforceable in habeas corpus. Federal habeas corpus is available only to correct federal constitutional violations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); *Wilson v. Corcoran*, 562 U.S. 1 (2010); *Lewis v. Jeffers*, 497 U.S. 764, 780 (1990); *Smith v. Phillips*, 455 U.S. 209 (1982), *Barclay v. Florida*, 463 U.S. 939 (1983). Armengau\u2019s constructive amendment argument is not cognizable because constructive amendments do not violate any federal right to and jury indictment in state courts.\n\nPetitioner notes that his \u201cother acts\u201d argument under this Ground for Relief is not about the use of such evidence to convict a defendant by proving he has a bad character or has a propensity to crime, the usual argument against \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. Rather, his claim here is that \u201cother act\u201d evidence was substituted mid-trial for evidence of the crimes charged in the indictment (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14008-36).\n\nRespondent asserts Armengau has procedurally defaulted in presenting Ground Two as a federal constitutional claim to the Supreme Court of Ohio (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13896). Petitioner responds that \u201c[t]he \u2018other-act\u2019 issues were raised in Propositions III, IV, V and VI to the Ohio Supreme Court.\u201d (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14007). Those propositions of law as pleaded are as follows:\n\n**Third Proposition of Law:** If the purpose for which 404(B) evidence is sought to be introduced is already established by properly admitted evidence in the State's case-in-chief, then Evid.R. 403 precludes admission of those prior bad acts. R.C. 2945.59; Evid.R. 404(13); Evid.R. 403(H); *State v. Lowe*, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 530, 1994-Ohio-345, 63 N.E.2d 616; *State v. Burson*, 38 Ohio St.2d\nFourth Proposition of Law: Strictly construing prior bad acts evidence against admissibility does not allow the admission of testimony or evidence regarding non-criminal, consensual sexual encounters, absent highly specific, idiosyncratic facts such as those presented in Williams. R.C. 2945.59; Evid.R. 404(B); Evid.R. 403(8); State v. Lowe, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 530, 1994-Ohio-345, 634 N.E.2d 616; State v. Burson, 38 Ohio St.2d 157, 158, 311 N.E.2d 526 (1974); State v. Hector, 19 Ohio St.2d 167, 249 N.E.2d 912 (1969); State v. DeMarco, 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 194, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987); State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278.\n\nFifth Proposition of Law: Strictly construing prior bad acts evidence against admissibility does not allow the admission of testimony or evidence regarding non-criminal, consensual sexual encounters, absent highly specific, idiosyncratic facts such as those presented in Williams. R.C. 2945.59; Evid.R. 404(B); Evid.R. 403(8); State v. Lowe, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 530, 1994-Ohio-345, 634 N.E.2d 616; State v. Burson, 38 Ohio St.2d 157, 158, 311 N.E.2d 526 (1974); State v. Hector, 19 Ohio St.2d 167, 249 N.E.2d 912 (1969); State v. DeMarco, 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 194, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987); State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278.\n\nSixth Proposition of Law: When the State cannot provide a defendant with accurate information regarding the timeframe in which the alleged criminal conduct occurred, where it occurred, or the conduct at issue until its witness has testified at trial, a defendant is misled and prejudiced, and is entitled to mistrial. Crim.R. 7(D).\n\n(Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 13, PageID 8041-42). On their face, these Propositions of Law do not present federal constitutional claims. Instead, they exhibit the usual objections to other acts evidence, to wit, that it is \u201cpropensity\u201d evidence, used to convict a defendant because of his or her bad character. All of the case law cited is Ohio case law. In the body of his Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, Armengau argued\nPropositions of Law Three, Four, and Five together. *Id.* at PageID 8048-53. Nowhere in that argument does he claim the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence was substituted for the indicted conduct. Instead, the argument is all in terms of the propensity impact of other acts evidence. The Federal Constitution is not mentioned at all nor are any federal cases cited.\n\nIn arguing the Sixth Proposition of Law, Armengau states \u201c[i]n his direct appeal, Mr. Armengau asserted that this course of litigation functioned to deny him his rights to a fair trial, due process of law, and double jeopardy protections.\u201d *Id.* at PageID 8056. Nowhere else in this argument does he mention any federal right or cite any federal case law or state case law referencing the United States Constitution.\n\nTo preserve a federal constitutional claim for presentation in habeas corpus, the claim must be \"fairly presented\" to the state courts in a way which provides them with an opportunity to remedy the asserted constitutional violation, including presenting both the legal and factual basis of the claim. *Williams v. Anderson*, 460 F.3d 789, 806 (6th Cir. 2006); *Levine v. Torvik*, 986 F.2d 1506, 1516 (6th Cir.), *cert. denied*, 509 U.S. 907 (1993), overruled in part on other grounds by *Thompson v. Keohane*, 516 U.S. 99 (1995); *Riggins v. McMackin*, 935 F.2d 790, 792 (6th Cir. 1991). The claim must be fairly presented at every stage of the state appellate process. *Wagner v. Smith*, 581 F.3d 410, 418 (6th Cir. 2009).\n\nA claim is fairly presented if the petitioner\n\n(1) relied upon federal cases employing constitutional analysis; (2) relied upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis; (3) phrased the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional right; or (4) alleged facts well within the mainstream of constitutional law.\n\n*Hand v. Houk*, 871 F.3d 390, 418 (6th Cir. 2017); *Franklin v. Rose*, 811 F.2d 322, 326 (6th Cir. 1987); accord, *Whiting v. Birt*, 395 F.3d 602 (6th Cir. 2005); *McMeans v. Brigano*, 228 F.3d 674,\nMerely using talismanic constitutional phrases like \u201cfair trial\u201d or \u201cdue process of law\u201d does not constitute raising a federal constitutional issue. *Slaughter v. Parker*, 450 F.3d 224, 236 (6th Cir. 2006); *Franklin v. Rose*, 811 F.2d 322, 326 (6th Cir. 1987); *McMeans v. Brigano*, 228 F.3d 674, 681 (6th Cir. 2000), citing *Petrucelli v. Coombe*, 735 F.2d 684, 688-89 (2nd Cir. 1984). Mere use of the words \u201cdue process and a fair trial by an impartial jury\u201d are insufficient. *Slaughter v. Parker*, 450 F.3d 224, 236 (6th Cir. 2006); *Blackmon v. Booker*, 394 F.3d 399, 400 (6th Cir. 2004)(same). \u201cA lawyer need not develop a constitutional argument at length, but he must make one; the words \u2018due process\u2019 are not an argument.\u201d *Riggins v. McGinnis*, 50 F.3d 492, 494 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\nPetitioner did not fairly present his convicted-on-other-acts evidence claim as a federal constitutional claim to the Supreme Court of Ohio. The claim is therefore procedurally defaulted and Ground Two should be dismissed.\n\n**Ground Three: Denial of Due Process and Double Jeopardy Protection by Allowing Constructive Amendment and Refusing Unanimity Instruction**\n\nIn his Third Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he was denied due process and double jeopardy protection when the trial court allowed constructive amendment of the indictment and refused a requested unanimity instruction. Those are at least the issues on the face of Ground Three in the Second Amended Petition. In the Reply, however, Armengau argues Ground Three together with Ground Six. In the Sixth Ground for Relief he claims he was denied due process \u201cwhen he was tried and convicted for crimes for which he was never charged or indicted or noticed and for which the court failed to obtain subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d To make matters more confusing, he argues both Grounds for Relief under the label \u201cConstructive Amendment, Double Jeopardy, Jury\nInstructions, Defective Indictment & Notice\u201d and then asserts \u201cThis issue is inextricably related to the sufficiency [of the evidence] arguments set-forth above.\u201d (ECF No. 77, PageID 14036).\n\nThe combined argument on these two Grounds for Relief then occupies forty-five pages of the Reply (PageID 14036-81). He begins with an argument about a criminal defendant\u2019s entitlement to notice of the \u201capproximate time frame and at minimum, the general location as to where the crime(s) occurred. A defendant must also be advised of what he did (conduct)\u201d Id. at PageID 14036. Armengau asserts it is not only the indictment which is defective, but that no court has given him notice of the facts upon which he was convicted. \u201cPetitioner has been deprived of his Constitutional right to notice before trial, during trial, during sentencing and after resentencing.\u201d Id. at PageID 14041.\n\nPetitioner then switches to his jury unanimity argument:\n\nA jury has a duty to unanimously agree to a particular set of facts. United States v. Echeverry, 698 F.2d 375 (9th Cir. 1983). The U.S. Constitution does require a unanimous verdict in state prosecutions. A jury must be unanimous in what facts are being considered to determine guilt. Respondent does not dispute that as of today no one knows what \"act or incident\" constitutes any of the crimes for which Petitioner is imprisoned.\n\n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14042). Petitioner then argues the bill of particulars was insufficient to provide notice. Id. at PageID 14045-51. He then switches back to a jury instruction argument. At PageID 14067, et seq., he raises double jeopardy issues. Then, without any notice of a change of direction, Petitioner turns back to notice issues. Id.\n\nReturning to the double jeopardy claim, Armengau asserts:\n\nUnited States Supreme Court decisions are clear that the charging document itself must, on its face, protect a defendant from double jeopardy. Such holdings confirm that the federal constitutional requirement of double jeopardy protection is preemptive and must be reflected in the charging document.\n\n* * *\nClearly established federal law requires the protection be provided at the inception of the filing of the criminal charge.\n\n*Id.* at PageID 14079. However instead of citing any Supreme Court decisions, he cites instead to *State v. Freeman*, 2010-Ohio-3714 (Ohio App. 8th Dist. 2010), and *Isaac v. Grider*, 211 F.3d 1269 (6th Cir. 2000). In a single line at the conclusion of this section of the Reply, he asserts without any cited authority \u201cThe trial court in Petitioner's case never had jurisdiction for any alleged crime in Marion, Ohio[,] in 1998, 1999 or 2000 because the state never charged Petitioner with any such crime.\u201d PageID 14081.\n\n\u201c[T]here is no constitutional right in a state prosecution to a grand jury indictment with particular specificity.\u201d *Williams v. Haviland*, 467 F.3d 527, 534 (6th Cir. 2006) citing *Rose v. Mitchell*, 443 U.S. 545, 557, n. 7 (1979). \u201cDue process mandates only that the indictment provide the defendant with \u2018fair notice of the charges against him to permit adequate preparation of his defense.\u2019\u201d *Williams* at 535, quoting *Koontz v. Glossa*, 731 F.2d 365, 369 (6th Cir. 1984).\n\n*Russell v. United States*, 369 U.S. 749 (1962), holds the sufficiency of a federal indictment is to be measured by the following criteria:\n\n> These criteria are, first, whether the indictment \"contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, 'and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet,'\" and, secondly, \"'in case any other proceedings are taken against him for a similar offense whether the record shows with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction.'\"\n\n369 U.S. at 763-64. While the right to grand jury indictment has not been extended to the States, the Sixth Circuit has held these criteria are applicable as a matter of due process. *Valentine v. Konteh*, 395 F.3d 626, 631 (6th Cir. 2005). In *Valentine* the defendant faced twenty carbon-copy counts of rape of a minor and twenty carbon-copy counts of gross sexual imposition. Judge Merritt wrote for the court:\nThe problem in this case is not the fact that the prosecution did not provide the defendant with exact times and places. If there had been singular counts of each offense, the lack of particularity would not have presented the same problem. Instead, the problem is that within each set of 20 counts, there are absolutely no distinctions made. Valentine was prosecuted for two criminal acts that occurred twenty times each, rather than for forty separate criminal acts. In its charges and in its evidence before the jury, the prosecution did not attempt to lay out the factual bases of forty separate incidents that took place. Instead, the 8\u2013year\u2013old victim described \u201ctypical\u201d abusive behavior by Valentine and then testified that the \u201ctypical\u201d abuse occurred twenty or fifteen times. Outside of the victim's estimate, no evidence as to the number of incidents was presented.\n\nId. at 632-33.\n\nThis is not a case like Valentine. Armengau was charged with separate incidents involving separate victims, dates, and places. Testimony at trial varied from the dates and places in the indictment. Some of the variations in date were dealt with by amendment to the indictment at trial; the difference in location had been dealt with by an amended bill of particulars. As the Tenth District noted, Petitioner was not presenting alibi or impossibility defenses which would have been defeated by date changes.9\n\nThus Valentine does not read directly on the indictment in this case. More importantly, Valentine is not \u201cclearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d The Supreme Court has held, since Valentine, that a circuit court may not use circuit precedent \u201cto refine or sharpen a general rule of Supreme Court jurisprudence into a specific rule that\u201d the Supreme Court has not announced. Lopez v. Smith, 574 U.S. 1 (2014)(per curiam); Marshall v. Rodgers, 569 U.S. 58, 64 (2013)(per curiam). However, \u201can appellate panel may, in\n\n---\n\n9 Several times in his pleadings, Petitioner asserts he \u201cestablished\u201d during trial that he could not have committed the offenses alleged because he was not at the place or there at the time alleged. Facts are not established finally during the course of trial absent a stipulation or mid-trial dismissal. The Magistrate Judge therefore reads Petitioner\u2019s use of the word \u201cestablished\u201d as meaning Petitioner had presented evidence which he believed was convincing on certain dates and places, forcing the prosecutors to shift focus or make amendments.\naccordance with its usual law-of-the-circuit procedures, to ascertain whether it has already held that the particular point in issue is clearly established by Supreme Court precedent, see, e.g., *Tolliver v. Sheets*, 594 F.3d 900, 916, n.6 (\u201cWe are bound by prior Sixth Circuit determinations that a rule has been clearly established\u201d); *Chambers v. McDaniel*, 549 F.3d 1191, 1199 (9th Cir. 2008); it may not canvass circuit decisions to determine whether a particular rule of law is so widely accepted among the Federal Circuits that it would, if presented to this Court, be accepted as correct. See *Parker v. Matthews*, 567 U.S. 37 (2012); *Renico v. Lett*, 559 U.S. 766, 778-779 (2010).\u201d *Marshall*, 569 U.S. 58, 64 (2013).\n\nThe *Valentine* Court did not limit itself to the question whether the rule it adopted was clearly established by Supreme Court precedent. Instead, it opined,\n\n> [T]he \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d relevant under AEDPA encompasses \u201cthe governing legal principle or principles set forth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its decision.\u201d See *Lockyer v. Andrade*, 538 U.S. 63, 71\u201372, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). The Supreme Court has established a clear and consistent path for the courts regarding the due process sufficiency of criminal charges, and the Ohio Court of Appeals has strayed so far from that path as to warrant habeas relief. See id. at 72, 123 S.Ct. 1166.\n\n*Valentine*, 395 F.3d at 638 (Emphasis supplied). This formulation is inconsistent with later Supreme Court precedent requiring a tighter fit between Supreme Court holdings and the rule sought to be enforced in habeas.\n\nIn *Valentine* itself, the court held \u201cthat a court is permitted to review the indictment, the bill of particulars, and the evidence presented at trial to determine whether any defects in the indictment are cured.\u201d 395 F. 3d at 634.\n\nIn addition to not receiving from the indictment the notice to which he claims he is entitled, Petitioner also asserts the indictment provides insufficient double jeopardy protection. The Double\nJeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution affords a defendant three basic protections:\n\n- It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.\n- It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction.\n- And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\n\n*Brown v. Ohio*, 432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977), quoting *North Carolina v. Pearce*, 395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969). The Double Jeopardy Clause was held to be applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment in *Benton v. Maryland*, 395 U.S. 784, 794 (1969). The State of Ohio has not re-indicted Petitioner for any sexual misconduct allegedly occurring within the span of years eventually covered by this prosecution; no such indictment is threatened and its content is purely speculative. It is clear that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a second trial and not just a second conviction for the same offense. *Abney v. United States*, 431 U.S. 651 (1977). For that reason, a double jeopardy claim is cognizable in federal habeas corpus prior to the \u201csecond\u201d trial. *Justices of the Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon*, 466 U.S. 294 (1984); *Reimnitz v. State\u2019s Attorney of Cook County*, 761 F.2d 405, 408 (7th Cir. 1985); *Malinovsky v. Court of Common Pleas of Lorain County*, 7 F.3d 1263 (6th Cir. 1993). To put it another way, a habeas petitioner with a double jeopardy claim is not required to exhaust the remedy of direct appeal from a verdict at a second trial before invoking our habeas jurisdiction. Should a new indictment be filed, a habeas court would compare both the indictment in this case and the evidence adduced at trial to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause was being violated. The Supreme Court has never held that a state indictment must be so precise as to preclude a second indictment while examining only the face of the first indictment. *Valentine*, which reaches that conclusion, is not Supreme Court precedent and has never been followed by the Sixth Circuit itself in a habeas corpus case. *Lawwill v. Pineda*, 2011 WL 1882456 (N.D. Ohio 2011).\nRespecting jury unanimity, Armengau argues \u201c[a] jury has a duty to unanimously agree to a particular state of facts . . . . A jury must be unanimous in what facts are being considered to determine guilt.\u201d (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14042, citing United States v. Echeverry, 698 F.2d 375 (9th Cir. 1983)). At numerous points in his Reply, Petitioner argues that no court has been able to tell him what facts the jury relied upon to convict him of which offenses.\n\nPetitioner is correct that the United States Constitution requires that jury verdicts in criminal cases be unanimous. Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, 140 S. Ct. 1390, 206 L. Ed. 2d 583 (2020). However Ramos does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, such as this one. Edwards v. Vannoy, 593 U.S. ___, 141 S. Ct. 1547 (2021). Prior to Ramos, the Supreme Court had held nonunanimous verdicts were permissible. Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972). These cases, however, involved States (Oregon and Louisiana) which expressly allowed majority verdicts.\n\nPetitioner, however, insists on something more: unanimity on the facts supporting a verdict. How would a State achieve such a result? A possibility would be to sever counts of an indictment and try them one at a time, but Petitioner does not suggest that is constitutionally required, nor does he claim he ever asked for severance in the trial court.\n\nWe instruct a jury that its verdict on each count must be unanimous and we enforce that requirement by requiring each juror to sign the verdict and allowing jurors to be polled in open court on their vote. In this case the verdicts of the jury were returned and read in open court on July 7, 2014 (Transcript, State Court Record, ECF No. 72-2, PageID 13702, et seq.). In each case the bailiff announced that the form was signed by all jurors. When the reading was complete, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel asked that the jury be polled and they were, all answering that the verdicts as read were verdicts they had voted for and signed. Id. Thus the usual methods of ensuring jury\nunanimity were employed and the jurors affirmed their verdicts.\n\nIn *Echeverry*, the Ninth Circuit disapproved an ambiguous jury instruction in a federal conspiracy case which left the jury free to convict if they found a conspiracy existed \u201cfor some period of time\u201d when the evidence would have permitted a finding that there had been both a December and a June conspiracy, but did not require a unanimous finding as to either one. Nothing in the case suggests that the defendant could have, after the fact, required the jury or an appellate court to tell him what facts they found unanimously. To put it somewhat differently, a state criminal trial is not like a federal civil jury trial where a jury can be required to return special verdicts. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 49. Much less can a state appellate court be compelled, in the interest of jury unanimity, to make such separate findings.\n\nFinally, Petitioner\u2019s jury unanimity claim is procedurally defaulted because it was not presented to the Tenth District as a federal constitutional claim. The Tenth District noted that this claim had been presented as a jury unanimity claim under Ohio R. Crim. P. 31(A).\n\nFinally, appellant argues that the complex, and allegedly mismatched, assemblage of facts, testimony, indictment, and amendments of the bill of particulars allowed the jury to produce a \u201cpatchwork\u201d verdict in violation of Ohio's requirement of jury unanimity, under Crim.R. 31(A). Pursuant to that rule, jurors must unanimously agree not only on the defendant's guilt, but as to proof as to each element of the crime.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s Third Ground for Relief should therefore be dismissed.\n\n**Ground Four: Erroneous Jury Instructions**\n\nIn his Fourth Ground for Relief, Armengau asserts he was denied due process of law when the trial court \u201cdenied a requested unanimity instruction and the instructions allowed a non-unanimous verdict and a verdict upon uncharged alleged conduct.\u201d (Second Amended Petition, ECF No. 70,\nRespondent asserts this claim is procedurally defaulted. The procedural default doctrine in habeas corpus is described by the Supreme Court as follows:\n\nIn all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an adequate and independent state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause of the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law; or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\n\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991); see also Simpson v. Jones, 238 F.3d 399, 406 (6th Cir. 2000). That is, a petitioner may not raise on federal habeas a federal constitutional rights claim he could not raise in state court because of procedural default. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72 (1977); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 110 (1982). \u201cAbsent cause and prejudice, \u2018a federal habeas petitioner who fails to comply with a State\u2019s rules of procedure waives his right to federal habeas corpus review.\u2019\u201d Boyle v. Million, 201 F.3d 711, 716 (6th Cir. 2000), quoting Gravley v. Mills, 87 F.3d 779, 784-85 (6th Cir. 1996); Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 485 (1986); Engle, 456 U.S. at 110; Wainwright, 433 U.S. at 87.\n\n[A] federal court may not review federal claims that were procedurally defaulted in state court\u2014that is, claims that the state court denied based on an adequate and independent state procedural rule. E.g., Beard v. Kindler, 558 U.S. 53, 55, 130 S.Ct. 612, 175 L.Ed.2d 417 (2009). This is an important \u201ccorollary\u201d to the exhaustion requirement. Dretke v. Haley, 541 U.S. 386, 392, 124 S.Ct. 1847, 158 L.Ed. d 659 (2004). \u201cJust as in those cases in which a state prisoner fails to exhaust state remedies, a habeas petitioner who has failed to meet the State\u2019s procedural requirements for presenting his federal claims has deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address\u201d the merits of \u201cthose claims in the first instance.\u201d Coleman [v. Thompson], 501 U.S. [722,] 731-732, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 [(1991)]. The procedural default doctrine thus advances the same comity, finality, and federalism interests advanced by the exhaustion doctrine. See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 493, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991).\nDavila v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 2058, 2064 (2017). \u201c[A] federal court may not review federal claims that were procedurally defaulted in state courts.\u201d Theriot v. Vashaw, 982 F.3d 999 (6th Cir. 2020), citing Maslonka v. Hoffner, 900 F.3d 269, 276 (6th Cir. 2018) (alteration in original) (quoting Davila v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 2058, 2064 (2017)).\n\nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals requires a four-part analysis when the State alleges a habeas claim is precluded by procedural default. Barton v. Warden, S. Ohio Corr. Facility, 786 F.3d 450, 464 (6th Cir. 2015), Guilmette v. Howes, 624 F.3d 286, 290 (6th Cir. 2010)(en banc); Eley v. Bagley, 604 F.3d 958, 965 (6th Cir. 2010); Reynolds v. Berry, 146 F.3d 345, 347-48 (6th Cir. 1998), citing Maupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986); accord Lott v. Coyle, 261 F.3d 594, 601-02 (6th Cir. 2001); Jacobs v. Mohr, 265 F.3d 407, 417 (6th Cir. 2001).\n\nFirst the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner's claim and that the petitioner failed to comply with the rule.\n\nSecond, the court must decide whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction, citing County Court of Ulster County v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 149, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979).\n\nThird, the court must decide whether the state procedural forfeiture is an \"adequate and independent\" state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim.\n\nOnce the court determines that a state procedural rule was not complied with and that the rule was an adequate and independent state ground, then the petitioner must demonstrate under Sykes that there was \"cause\" for him to not follow the procedural rule and that he was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.\n\nMaupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986); accord, Hartman v. Bagley, 492 F.3d 347, 357 (6th Cir. 2007), quoting Monzo v. Edwards, 281 F.3d 568, 576 (6th Cir. 2002).\n\nPetitioner\u2019s trial counsel requested a particular instruction on unanimity which was not given.\nHowever, he \u201cdid not object to the jury instructions as given.\u201d *Armengau I* at \u00b6 64. The Tenth District therefore reviewed Armengau\u2019s jury instruction claims under a plain error standard. *Id.*\n\nPetitioner does not dispute that Ohio has a procedural rule that requires a litigant to preserve an alleged jury instruction error by objecting to the instruction as given nor does he dispute the Tenth District\u2019s factual finding that no such objection was made here. Instead he asserts the Tenth District did not enforce the rule.\n\nPetitioner respectfully suggests to this Court that the Court of Appeals did not rely on the \"procedural bar\" and in any event, notwithstanding defense counsel's failure to lodge an objection, notwithstanding the denial of his requested instruction, the Court of Appeals proceeded to analyze the issue in the same manner it would have had an objection been made.\n\n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14082, citing *Keeton v. Bradshaw*, 2006 U.S. Dist.LEXIS 102076 (fn7)(N.D. Ohio, Jul. 20, 2006), adopted, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64342 (N.D. Ohio, Sept. 8, 2006)).\n\nIn *Keeton* Magistrate Judge Veccharelli analyzed procedural default differentially as to different claims. As to the claim referenced in footnote seven, cited by Petitioner, she found the Ohio Court of Appeals had not actually enforced the relevant procedural rule. But as to Ground Three regarding excuse of jurors, she wrote:\n\nIn dismissing this claim, the Court of Appeals indicated that Keeton's trial counsel did not object to the dismissal of the prospective jurors for cause and reviewed the claim for plain error. The Court of Appeals held that the trial court did not commit plain error.\n\nThe Court of Appeals expressly relied upon and enforced the contemporaneous objection rule, a state procedural bar, to dismiss this claim. The Court of Appeals' plain error review does not excuse the court's reliance on the state procedural rule in dismissing the claims. See *Scott*, 209 F.3d at 868. Further, the Sixth Circuit has held the contemporaneous objection rule is an \"adequate and independent\" state ground. *Id.* at 869.\n\n2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102076 *16.\nIn this case the Tenth District did as the appellate court had in *Keeton*: it noted the failure to object and then reviewed for plain error. *Armengau I* at \u00b6 64. As Judge Veccharelli noted, the Sixth Circuit has frequently recognized that Ohio\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule is an adequate and independent state ground of decision. *Wogenstahl v. Mitchell*, 668 F.3d 307, 334 (6th Cir. 2012), citing *Keith v. Mitchell*, 455 F.3d 662, 673 (6th Cir. 2006); *Goodwin v. Johnson*, 632 F.3d 301, 315 (6th Cir. 2011); *Smith v. Bradshaw*, 591 F.3d 517, 522 (6th Cir. 2010); *Nields v. Bradshaw*, 482 F.3d 442 (6th Cir. 2007); *Biros v. Bagley*, 422 F.3d 379, 387 (6th Cir. 2005); *Mason v.

Bradshaw*, 591 F.3d 517, 522 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 562 U.S. 876 (2010).\n\nThe Sixth Circuit has also held that Ohio appellate review for plain error is enforcement of the contemporaneous objection rule and not a waiver of it. *Wogenstahl v. Mitchell*, 668 F.3d 307, 337 (6th Cir. 2012); *Jells v. Mitchell*, 538 F.3d 478, 511 (6th Cir. 2008); *Lundgren v. Mitchell*, 440 F.3d 754, 765 (6th Cir. 2006); *White v.

Randle*, 271 F.3d 239 (6th Cir. 2001).\n\nPetitioner also asserts that the failure to object does not prevent this Court from considering his constitutional claim. (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14083, citing *Osborne v. Ohio*, 495 U.S. 103 (1990)). In *Osborne* the Supreme Court enforced a procedural default consisting of failure to object to omission of a *sciente* instruction, but disregarded a similar default on an instruction on \u201clewdness\u201d because trial counsel had sufficiently pushed the issue of overbreadth to satisfy the state interest in giving the state courts a fair opportunity to correct constitutional error. 495 U.S. at 123-24. Thus the Supreme Court found an excusable default in the factual complexities of the\nOsborne case and did not announce a general rule which would apply here.\n\nRespondent asserts Armengau further procedurally defaulted this jury instruction claim by failing to present it to the Supreme Court of Ohio as a federal constitutional claim (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13896). Petitioner responds by asserting:\n\nWith regard to Respondent's claim that the jury instruction issue was not fairly presented, a claim of defective indictment, patchwork and non-unanimous verdict and a double jeopardy claim, by necessity, implicates a jury instruction issue.\n\nJury instructions are directly related to the sufficiency evaluation for an indictment, evidence and corresponding notice issues and these issue [sic] were raised in Propositions I and VI to the Ohio Supreme Court (Doc. 72, PageID 8046-8047, 8053-8058, PageID 610-622). Those issues by necessity extend to the jury instructions.\n\n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14082-83).\n\nThe referenced Propositions of Law read:\n\n**First Proposition of Law:** This Court's decision in Hampton does not allow a defendant to be convicted of a crime when the indictment asserts the criminal conduct occurred in a specific county, and does not reference R.C. 2901.12, and all evidence presented demonstrates that the crime occurred in a different county than that named in the indictment. RC. 2901.12; State v. Hampton, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, 2012-Ohio-5688, 983 N.E.2d 324\n\n**Sixth Proposition of Law:** When the State cannot provide a defendant with accurate information regarding the time frame in which the alleged criminal conduct occurred, where it occurred, or the conduct at issue until its witness has testified at trial, a defendant is misled and prejudiced, and is entitled to a mistrial. Crim. R. 7(D).\n\n(Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 13, PageID 8041-42). Neither of these Propositions of Law mentions jury instructions at all or any provision of the United States Constitution. Nor do the arguments on these propositions mention jury instructions or cite any federal law.\n\nBecause Petitioner did not fairly present his jury instruction claim to the Supreme Court of\nOhio as a federal constitutional claim, it is procedurally defaulted on that basis as well.\n\nBecause Petitioner\u2019s Fourth Ground for Relief is procedurally defaulted twice over, the Court cannot reach the merits of the claim. Davila, supra. The jury instructions claim should be dismissed as procedurally defaulted.\n\n**Ground Five: Prosecutorial Misconduct**\n\nIn his Fifth Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts he was deprived of due process and a fair trial by prosecutorial misconduct when \u201che was tried, convicted, and resentenced for convictions upon the admission of other-act evidence that was unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed prior to trial and which was presented by prosecutors to intentionally circumvent the defenses to the actually indicted alleged crimes.\u201d\n\nRespondent asserts this Ground for Relief is procedurally defaulted because the admission of other acts evidence claim was presented to the Tenth District as an issue of trial court error rather than prosecutorial misconduct (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13896). Petitioner\u2019s Reply asserts that the Return did not address his claim of prosecutorial misconduct and therefore does not respond to this defense (ECF No. 77, PageID 14147).\n\nThe Magistrate Judge finds the defense well taken. The relevant Assignment of Error on appeal argued trial court error, not prosecutorial misconduct. Armengau I, \u00b6 68. The Sixth Circuit has articulated the relevant standard for habeas claims of prosecutorial misconduct as follows:\n\n\u201cIn the evaluation of a claim for prosecutorial misconduct, it is not enough that the prosecutor's comments were improper, but '[t]he relevant question is whether the prosecutors' comments \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Smith, 567 F.3d [246] at 255 [6th Cir. 2009] (quoting Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986)) (quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416\nU.S. 637, 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)). In other words, \u201c[i]n order to satisfy the standard for prosecutorial misconduct, the conduct must be both improper and flagrant.\u201d Broom v. Mitchell, 441 F.3d 392, 412 (6th Cir.2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1255, 127 S.Ct. 1376, 167 L.Ed.2d 165 (2007). To determine whether improper conduct is flagrant, we consider four factors:\n\n(1) the likelihood that the remarks of the prosecutor tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) the total strength of the evidence against the defendant.\n\nBates v. Bell, 402 F.3d 635, 641 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 865, 126 S.Ct. 163, 163 L.Ed.2d 150 (2005).\n\nGoff v. Bagley, 601 F.3d 445, 480 (6th Cir. 2010). See also LaMar v. Houk, 798 F.3d 405, 430 (6th Cir., 2015).\n\nThe usual claim of prosecutorial misconduct involves a prosecutor\u2019s improper comment on evidence, presentation of perjured testimony, or failure to comply with Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny. Here the claim is the prosecutors deliberately relied on inadmissible other acts evidence. The first step in analyzing any claim of prosecutorial misconduct is to determine that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper. Bowling v. Parker, 344 F.3d 487, 512-13 (6th Cir. 2003). Here the Tenth District determined admission of the other acts evidence was not improper. It cannot be improper conduct for a prosecutor to offer admissible evidence.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s Fifth Ground for Relief should be denied as procedurally defaulted and without merit.\nGround Six: Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\nIn his Sixth Ground for Relief, Petitioner argues the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas never \u201cobtained\u201d subject matter jurisdiction to try his case (Amended Petition, ECF No. 70, PageID 7651). As noted above, Armengau combined arguments about Ground Six with his arguments on Ground Three. Other than the subject matter jurisdiction claim, these issues are dealt with above under Ground Three.\n\nRespondent treats this claim as of a piece with Armengau\u2019s other objections to the indictment and dismisses it with the assertion that there is no federal constitutional right to grand jury indictment in state courts (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13881, citing, inter alia, Hurtado). Other than adverting to the fact that he has alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction, Armengau does nothing in his Reply to argue the issue. Nor does it appear Armengau raised this issue on direct appeal.\n\nLack of subject matter jurisdiction was a basis for granting habeas corpus relief long before those bases were broadened to any constitutional error in Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443 (1953). See Ex parte Lange, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 163 (1873); Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371 (1880). However, in Ohio, the common pleas courts are the courts with subject matter jurisdiction to try felony criminal cases. See Ohio Rev. Code 2931.03; State v. Lauharn, 2012-Ohio-1572, \u00b6 22, 2012 Ohio App. LEXIS 1382, **12 (2nd App. Dist. 2012); Leyman v. Bradshaw, 2015-Ohio-751, \u00b6 13, 2015 Ohio App. LEXIS 699, **4 (5th App. Dist. 2015). Petitioner has not pled or proved any basis on which the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his case. Ground six should therefore be dismissed on the merits.\nGround Seven: Denial of Equal Protection\n\nIn his Seventh Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he was denied his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws when the Tenth District Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Ohio \u201cintentionally disregarded the law set by their respective courts and the United States Supreme Court in order to affirm the convictions.\u201d His theory is that \u201c[t]he holdings and rulings in Petitioner's case are contrary to established precedent.\u201d\n\nRespondent asserts this claim is not cognizable in federal habeas corpus, arguing \u201c[a]lleged errors involving a state court\u2019s interpretation of its own law or procedure are not cognizable in federal habeas corpus review (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13889, citing Simpson v. Jones, 238 F.3d 399, 406-07 (6th Cir. 2000); Allen v. Morris, 845 F.2d 610, 614 (6th Cir. 1988)).\n\nPetitioner responds that\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432 (1985). The sine qua non of an equal protection claim is dissimilar treatment of persons similarly situated. The Equal Protection Clause embodies a general rule that States must treat like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly.\n\n* * *\n\nPetitioner respectfully suggests that the case law he has cited throughout his petition and this reply specifically identifies him as similarly situated to defendants who have obtained relief under identical issues and material facts and that the court system has disregarded the law they have established in order to affirm the convictions.\n\n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14087-88). He then proceeds to discuss at length other allegedly similarly-situated defendants who have obtained relief in similar circumstances. Id. at PageID 14089-91.\nIt is of course fundamental to our American system of case law that like cases should be decided alike. Garner, et al., The Law of Judicial Precedent \u00a7 A.1(2016). Garner\u2019s treatise is devoted to explicating the doctrine of precedent which enables deciding like cases alike. Petitioner\u2019s premise \u2013 that equal protection doctrine must overlay the doctrine of precedent \u2013 seems an appropriate extension of the law in both of these areas. The Magistrate Judge therefore disagrees with Respondent\u2019s argument that only state law questions are involved. If, for example, a municipal judge intentionally applied a different standard to deciding red light cases depending on the race of the defendant, it is not difficult to see the equal protection issue involved.\n\nAt the same time, the entire doctrine of precedent cannot be constitutionalized; such a system would not be administrable. See Levine v. Torvik, supra. The Supreme Court has stated that the Equal Protection Clause \"embodies the general rule that States must treat like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly.\" Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793, 799 (1997). The States cannot make distinctions which either burden a fundamental right, target a suspect class, or intentionally treat a person differently from others similarly situated without any rational basis for the difference. Id.; Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per curiam); Radvansky v. City of Olmsted Falls, 395 F.3d 291, 312 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\nConsidering the general standards for establishment of an equal protection violation, Petitioner has not articulated, much less presented, a case which would support such a finding. He never presented a case to the Ohio courts for selective prosecution. Indeed, his allegation is that the Ohio appellate courts, not the prosecution, discriminated against him. He does not suggest an invidious basis such as race for deciding his case one way and other similarly-situated cases differently. Although he claims there are other similarly-situated cases, what are the similarities? Are there other men accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women who have not been\nprosecuted because they were not successful criminal defense lawyers?\n\nIn sum, while the Magistrate Judge agrees that an intentional misapplication of the doctrine of precedent on an invidious basis could violate the Equal Protection Clause, Armengau did not present such a case to either the Tenth District or the Supreme Court of Ohio. As with \u201cfair trial\u201d and \u201cdue process,\u201d mere recitation of the talismanic phrase \u201cequal protection\u201d is not an argument. Petitioner\u2019s Seventh Ground for Relief should be dismissed as procedurally defaulted because never fairly presented to the Ohio courts. It is also without merit in the form presented to this Court.\n\n**Ground Eight: Actual Innocence**\n\nIn his Eighth Ground for Relief, Armengau claims he is actually innocent of the crimes of which he was convicted and is entitled to habeas corpus relief on that basis. In habeas corpus parlance, this is denominated a \u201cstand alone\u201d actual innocence claim to distinguish it from the \u201cgateway\u201d actual innocence claim recognized by the Supreme Court in *Schlup v. Delo*, 513 U.S. 298 (1995).\n\nCase law in the Sixth Circuit establishes that the Supreme Court of the United States has never recognized a free-standing or substantive actual innocence claim. *Cress v. Palmer*, 484 F.3d 844, 854 (6th Cir. 2007), citing *Zuern v. Tate*, 336 F.3d 478, 482, n.1 (6th Cir. 2003), and *Staley v. Jones*, 239 F.3d 769, 780, n.12 (6th Cir. 2001).\n\nEven if a stand-alone claim were to be recognized, Petitioner has not submitted evidence of the quality required by *Schlup* to qualify. \"To be credible, such a claim requires petitioner to support his allegations of constitutional error with new reliable evidence -- whether it be\nexculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence -- that was not presented at trial.\" *Souter v. Jones*, 395 F.3d 577, 590 (6th Cir. 2005), citing *Schlup*, 513 U.S. at 324.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also noted that \"actual innocence means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.\" *Bousley v. United States*, 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998). Having committed the acts which the jury found to be sexual misconduct in Marion County as opposed to Franklin County does not amount to a claim of factual innocence.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s Eighth Ground for Relief should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which habeas corpus relief can be granted.\n\n**Ground Nine: Lack of Jury Unanimity**\n\nThis claim has been dealt with under Ground Three above.\n\n**Ground Ten: Denial of Right to Trial by Jury**\n\nIn his Tenth Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts he was denied his right to trial by jury because the factual bases of his convictions were determined by the trial and appellate judges instead of the jury. As Petitioner made clear when moving to amend to add this claim, he believes he suffered from a violation of the doctrine in *Apprendi v. New Jersey*, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), where the Supreme Court held \u201cunder the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that\nincreases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nThis is not a classic Apprendi case where some punishment beyond that authorized by the statute of conviction can be imposed upon a separate finding by the trial judge. For example, in Apprendi the Supreme Court was dealing with a statute which increased the penalties for a crime if the court determined it to be a \u201chate\u201d crime. Nothing of that sort happened here. Rather Ground Ten is a variant on Petitioner\u2019s claim that facts found by the jury\u2019s general verdicts were reassigned by the Tenth District upon resentencing. Petitioner points to no clearly established Supreme Court precedent violated by what occurred on re-sentencing. His Tenth Ground for Relief should therefore be denied on the merits.\n\nAdditional Claims\n\nAt the end of his Reply, Petitioner asserts that he has made other claims which Respondent has not addressed, to wit, fair trial, prosecutorial misconduct, and constructive amendment (Reply, ECF No. 72, PageID 14147).\n\nAs noted in the analysis of Ground Five, the Respondent did address the specific prosecutorial misconduct claim made here by noting it had not been presented in that form to the Tenth District, but rather as a claim of trial court error.\n\nCase law prohibiting constructive amendments of indictments during trial are designed to protect a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to grand jury indictment. A state defendant\u2019s grand jury\n\n---\n\n10 Armengau was ordered to serve some sentences consecutively. However, the Supreme Court has exempted the findings which may be needed for consecutive sentences from the application of Apprendi. Oregon v. Ice, 555 U.S. 160 (2009).\nright is protected by the Ohio Constitution, but violations of the Ohio Constitution do not state a claim for violating the federal Constitution, because there is no federal constitutional right to indictment in the state courts. *Hurtado, supra.* A federal defendant\u2019s grand jury right, protected by the Fifth Amendment, is protected by forbidding constructive amendments in federal trials. All the authority relied on by Petitioner in this section of his Reply was enforcing the federal grand jury right in federal cases. Because the Fifth Amendment Grand Jury Clause has not been incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, there is no federal constitutional prohibition on constructive amendments in state trials.\n\nPetitioner has not pleaded a separate ground for relief based on his claim of denial of a fair trial.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the Magistrate Judge respectfully recommends the Petition be dismissed with prejudice. Reasonable jurists could disagree with the proposed disposition of Grounds One (sufficiency of the evidence) and Three (double jeopardy); Petitioner should therefore be granted a certificate of appealability as to those Grounds. Because reasonable jurists would not disagree with dismissal of the other Grounds for Relief, it is also recommended that Petitioner be denied a certificate of appealability as to those Grounds. Petitioner should be permitted to proceed on appeal *in forma pauperis.*\n\nNovember 2, 2021.\n\ns/ Michael R. Merz\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nNOTICE REGARDING OBJECTIONS\n\nPursuant to Fed. R.
