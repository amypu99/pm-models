Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 2 - \nI.  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{\u00b6 2} On January 27, 2014, Myers and codefendant, Timothy Mosley, began to plot \nburglarizing the home of a known drug dealer or the home of Justin Back, Myers' childhood \nfriend.  Mark Cates, Back's stepfather, purportedly had a safe containing a firearm and \nmoney.  Ultimately, Myers and Mosley chose to burglarize the Cates' home.  The two men \ndrove to the Cates' home.  Upon knocking, they were surprised w hen Back answered the \ndoor.  The two men briefly visited with Back and then left.  Up on leaving the Cates' home, \nMyers suggested they return to the home, kill Back, and steal t he contents of the safe.  \nMyers and Mosley began to plan Back's murder. \n{\u00b6 3} They initially planned to kill Ba ck by injecting him with cold medicine.  In \nfurtherance of their plan, they attempted to purchase cold medi cine and a bottle of \npoisonous \"bug wash\"; however, Myers' credit card was declined.   Later that day, Myers \nand Mosley returned to the Cates' home and watched a movie with  Back.  When Cates \ncame home from work, he joined them in watching the movie for a  short time until he and \nBack had to leave for an appointment with a Navy recruiter.  Myers and Mosley then left the \nhouse. \n{\u00b6 4} Myers and Mosley continued to discuss how to murder Back and bu rglarize \nthe Cates' home.  As they discussed their plans, Mosley wrote d own their ideas in a small \nnotebook.  The two men hatched a scheme to strangle Back with a wire, take the safe, and \nmake it look as though Back had stolen the safe and run away fr om home.  The two men \nfurther planned to dump Back's body in a remote wooded area.  M yers and Mosley \npurchased galvanized steel cable and two metal rope cleats to f ashion a garrote.  The \ngarrote was put together by their friend Logan Zennie.  \n{\u00b6 5} The next morning, January 28, 2014, Myers and Mosley bought amm onia, \nseptic-tank cleaner, and rubber gloves.  They believed the sept ic enzymes would help to Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 3 - \ndecompose the body in cold weather.  Around 1:00 p.m., the two men went to the Cates' \nhome.  Mosley was carrying the garrote as well as a five- or six-inch pocketknife.  The plan \nwas for Myers to distract Back while Mosley came up behind him.  Myers would hold Back \ndown while Mosley would choke him to death with the garrote.  A fter the two men arrived \nat the Cates' home, Back offered them a drink which Myers accep t e d .   A s  B a c k  w a s  \nreaching into the refrigerator, Mosley came up behind him and t ried to pull the garrote \naround his throat.  However, the garrote only looped around Back's chin.  Mosley panicked \nand as Myers restrained Back, Mosley repeatedly stabbed him wit h his knife.  As Back \nbegged for his life, Myers simply told him it would be over soon.  \n{\u00b6 6} After the murder, Myers and Mosley wrapped Back's body in a bla nket, \ncleaned up the crime scene, and found the safe.  Myers also found a handgun belonging to \nCates, which he loaded.  The two men shoved Back's body into th e trunk of Mosley's car \nand left the house with the safe and various other stolen items .  They stopped at Mosley's \nhome where they cleaned up and changed clothes.  They eventuall y dumped Back's body \nbehind a log in a field in Preble County.  Myers poured ammonia and septic enzymes onto \nBack's body.  Myers then shot the body twice with the stolen ha ndgun before it jammed.  \nMyers and Mosley were later apprehended; Back's body was discov ered on January 29, \n2014.  An autopsy determined that Back had died of multiple sta b wounds.  At the time of \nthe murder, Myers and Mosley were both 19 years old. \n{\u00b6 7} Myers was indicted in February 2014 on one count of aggravated murder with \nprior calculation and design and one count of aggravated murder  in violation of R.C. \n2903.01(B).  Both counts were accompanied by three death-penalty specifications.  Myers \nwas further indicted for aggravated robbery, aggravated burglar y, grand theft of a firearm, \nand abuse of a corpse, all with an accompanying firearm specifi cation, and kidnapping, \ntampering with evidence, and safecracking.  Mosley was indicted  on similar charges.  Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 4 - \nHowever, a week before Myers' jury trial, Mosley reached a plea  agreement in which he \nagreed to testify against Myers.  Mosley pled guilty to all cha rges in exchange for the \ndismissal of the death-penalty specifications; he was sentenced to life in prison without the \npossibility of parole.   \n{\u00b6 8} The guilt phase of Myers' jury trial commenced on September 22,  2014.  On \nOctober 2, 2014, the jury found Myers guilty on all counts and specifications.  The two \naggravated-murder counts were merged for purposes of sentencing ; the state elected to \nproceed on the prior-calculation-and-design aggravated murder count with the aggravated-\nrobbery specification.   \n{\u00b6 9} The penalty phase of the jury trial was held on October 6, 2014 .   M y e r s  \npresented the testimony of his parents and a sibling and made a n unsworn statement by \nway of mitigation.  Myers had no prior criminal history or deli nquency adjudications.  The \njury recommended a death sentence.  On October 16, 2014, the trial court sentenced Myers \nto death and imposed prison sentences on the noncapital counts.   Myers' conviction and \ndeath sentence were subsequently upheld by the Ohio Supreme Cou rt.  State v. Myers , \n154 Ohio St.3d 405, 2018-Ohio-1903. \n{\u00b6 10} On November 10, 2016, while his appeal was pending before the s upreme \ncourt, Myers filed a petition for postconviction relief (\"PCR petition\"), raising 60 grounds for \nrelief.  The PCR petition challenged the constitutionality of t he death penalty and the Ohio \nstatutes governing its imposition, argued that Myers was denied the effective assistance of \ncounsel during both the guilt and penalty phases of the trial, and alleged violation of Myers' \ndue process rights.  On November 18, 2016, Myers moved for leav e to conduct discovery \nin support of his PCR petition.  In 2017, the state filed an an swer to the PCR petition, then \nmoved for summary judgment.  In January 2018, the trial court i ssued a scheduling order \nwhich provided that Myers could file a supplemental motion for discovery by March 1, 2018, Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 5 - \nand that the state's summary judgment motion would be held in a beyance pending \nresolution of Myers' discovery motion. \n{\u00b6 11} On March 1, 2018, Myers filed a supplemental motion for discove ry, arguing \nhe was entitled to conduct discovery in support of his PCR peti tion pursuant to newly-\namended R.C. 2953.21, which became effective on April 6, 2017.  The amended statute \nmakes substantial changes regarding PCR petitions in death-pena lty cases, and in \nparticular, allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery in a id of their PCR petition if good \ncause is shown.  State v. Ketterer, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2016-08-166, 2017-Ohio-4117, \n\u00b6 46. \n{\u00b6 12} On July 3, 2018, the trial court denied Myers' discovery motion s.  The trial \ncourt found that amended R.C. 2953.21 was not applicable in the case at bar because the \nstatute did not explicitly state it was retroactive.  Alternatively, the trial court found that even \nif the statutory amendment was applied retroactively, Myers was  not entitled to discovery \nas he had not demonstrated \"good cause.\"    \n{\u00b6 13} On November 26, 2018, Myers filed a memorandum opposing the sta te's \nmotion for summary judgment; the memorandum included 12 additio nal documents \nconsisting of affidavits, transcripts, and documentary evidence .  Myers' memorandum and \nsupplemental appendix triggered additional pleadings from the parties.  Ultimately, the trial \ncourt never ruled upon the state's summary judgment motion.  In stead, on June 27, 2019, \nthe trial court denied Myers' PCR petition without a hearing.  The trial court found that Myers' \nclaims were either barred by res judicata or failed to set fort h sufficient operative facts to \nestablish substantive grounds for relief, and therefore, \"no ev identiary hearing [was] \nrequired.\"      \n{\u00b6 14} Myers now appeals the trial court's denial of his PCR petition and discovery \nmotions, raising 11 assignments of error.   Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 6 - \nII.  ANALYSIS \nA.  Standards of Review for Postconviction Relief Petitions \n{\u00b6 15} A postconviction proceeding is a collateral civil attack on a criminal judgment, \nnot an appeal of a criminal conviction.  State v. Dillingham, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2012-\n02-037 and CA2012-02-042, 2012-Ohio-5841, \u00b6 8.  To prevail on a  PCR petition, the \npetitioner must establish a violation of his constitutional rights that renders the judgment of \nconviction void or voidable.  R.C. 2953.21.  A PCR petition doe s not provide a petitioner a \nsecond opportunity to litigate his or her conviction, nor is the petitioner automatically entitled \nto an evidentiary hearing.  State v. Rose, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-03-050, 2012-Ohio-\n5957, \u00b6 16.  A trial court properly denies a PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing if the \nsupporting affidavits, the documentary evidence, the files, and  the records of the case do \nnot demonstrate that the petitioner set forth sufficient operat ive facts to establish \nsubstantive grounds for relief.  State v. Blankenburg, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-04-088, \n2012-Ohio-6175, \u00b6 9; R.C. 2953.21.  \n{\u00b6 16} \"It is well established that a trial court may dismiss a postco nviction relief \npetition on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata.\"  State v. Davis, 12th Dist. Butler No. \nCA2012-12-258, 2013-Ohio-3878, \u00b6 30.  Under res judicata, a fin al judgment of conviction \nbars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in \nany proceeding except an appeal from judgment, any defense or a ny claimed lack of due \nprocess that was raised or could have been raised by the defend ant at the trial, which \nresulted in that judgment or conviction, or on an appeal from t hat judgment.  State v. \nWagers, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2011-08-007, 2012-Ohio-2258, \u00b6 10, ci ting State v. \nSzefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 1996-Ohio-337, syllabus.   \n{\u00b6 17} The presentation of competent, relevant, and material evidence outside the \nrecord may defeat the application of res judicata.  State v. Lawson, 103 Ohio App.3d 307, Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 7 - \n315 (12th Dist.1995).  The evidence submitted with the petition cannot be merely cumulative \nof or alternative to evidence presented at trial.  State v. Jackson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. \n104132, 2017-Ohio-2651, \u00b6 16.  To overcome the res judicata bar , evidence outside the \nrecord must demonstrate that the petitioner could not have appealed the constitutional claim \nbased upon information in the original record.  State v.  Piesciuk, 12th Dist. Butler No. \nCA2013-01-011, 2013-Ohio-3879, \u00b6 18.  If evidence outside the r ecord is \"'marginally \nsignificant and does not advance the petitioner's claim beyond a mere hypothesis and a \ndesire for further discovery,' res judicata still applies to the claim.\"  State v. Cowans, 12th \nDist. Clermont No. CA98-10-090, 1999 Ohio App. LEXIS 4157, *8-9 (Sept. 7, 1999).   \n{\u00b6 18} \"In reviewing an appeal of postconviction relief proceedings, this court applies \nan abuse of discretion standard.\"  State v. Snead, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2014-01-014, \n2014-Ohio-2895, \u00b6 16. \"The term 'abuse of discretion' connotes more than an error of law \nor of judgment; it implies that the court's attitude is unreaso nable, arbitrary or \nunconscionable.\"  State v. Thornton, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-09-063, 2013-Ohio-\n2394, \u00b6 34; State v. Hancock , 108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, \u00b6 130.  The trial court \ndoes not abuse its discretion in dismissing a PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing if \n(1) the petitioner fails to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds \nfor relief, or (2) the operation of res judicata prohibits the claims made in the petition.  State \nv. Maxwell, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107758, 2020-Ohio-3027, \u00b6 25. \n{\u00b6 19} With these principles and standards in mind, we now address Mye rs' \nassignments of error together and out of order where appropriate. \nB.  Summary Dismissal of Myers' PCR Petition \n{\u00b6 20} Assignment of Error No. 1:  \n{\u00b6 21} THE TRIAL COURT DENIED MYERS' RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS, \nACCESS TO THE OHIO COURTS, AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, AND Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 8 - \nVIOLATED R.C. \u00a7 2953.21, WHEN IT TREATED THE STATE'S POST-ANSWE R \n\"MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\" AS A MOTION SEEKING SUMMARILY \nDISMISSAL (sic) UNDER R.C. \u00a7 2953.21(C) [NOW (D)], AND FAILED TO APPLY THE \nREQUISITE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARDS IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING \nEVERY CLAIM SET FORTH IN MYERS' PCR PETITION. \n{\u00b6 22} This assignment of error  challenges the trial court's failure to rule upon the \nstate's summary judgment motion and the court's election instea d to grant a summary \ndismissal of Myers' PCR petition.  Specifically, Myers argues t hat the trial court erred in \ngranting a summary dismissal of his PCR petition where there was a pending, fully briefed \nmotion for summary judgment.  Myers asserts that because the state filed an answer to the \nPCR petition and a motion for summary judgment and failed to mo ve for dismissal of the \npetition under R.C. 2953.21(D), the trial court was required to  apply the standard set forth \nin R.C. 2953.21(E) and was precluded from summarily dismissing the PCR petition under \nR.C. 2953.21(D).1 \n{\u00b6 23} R.C. 2953.21 provides three methods for adjudicating a PCR peti tion: (1) \n\"summary dismissal\" under R.C. 2953.21(D) and State v. Calhoun , 86 Ohio St.3d 279, \n1999-Ohio-102, paragraph two of the syllabus; (2) \"summary judg ment\" under R.C. \n2953.21(E); and (3) an \"evidentiary hearing\" under R.C. 2953.21(F).  State v. Blankenburg, \n12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-11-197, 2014-Ohio-4621, \u00b6 23.  \n{\u00b6 24} Under R.C. 2953.21(E), either party may move for summary judgment on the \nissues raised.  In ruling on a summary judgment motion in proce edings involving a PCR \npetition, the trial court must use the same standards set forth in Civ.R. 56(C), i.e., a party is \n                     \n1.  As stated earlier, R.C. 2953.21 was amended, effective Apri l 6, 2017, and some of its provisions were \nrenumbered.  As pertinent here, former R.C. 2953.21(C), (D), and (E) were renumbered 2953.21(D), (E), and \n(F).  We note that for purposes of this assignment of error, th e language of the applicable renumbered \nstatutory provisions is identical to the language of their pre- amendment counterparts.  We therefore elect to \napply the current version of R.C. 2953.21.       Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 9 - \nentitled to summary judgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and \nreasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclu sion is adverse to the \nparty against whom the motion for summary judgment is made.  State v. Francis, 12th Dist. \nButler No. CA2013-05-078, 2014-Ohio-443, \u00b6 11.  Summary judgmen t in postconviction \nproceedings is appropriate only if the right to summary judgment appears on the face of the \nrecord.  R.C. 2953.21(E); Id.  \n{\u00b6 25} Under R.C. 2953.21(D), \"a trial court properly denies a defenda nt's petition \nfor postconviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearin g where the petition, the \nsupporting affidavits, the documentary evidence, the files, and  the records do not \ndemonstrate that petitioner set forth sufficient operative fact s to establish substantive \ngrounds for relief.\"  Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279 at paragraph two of the syllabus; Francis \nat \u00b6 12.  \n{\u00b6 26} We find that the trial court did not err in granting a summary dismissal of \nMyers' PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D) notwithstanding the state's motion for summary \njudgment and its failure to move for dismissal of the PCR petit ion under R.C. 2953.21(D).  \nWe have held that R.C. 2953.21(D) \"explicitly requires the tria l court to look beyond the \npetition and examine the record in order to determine whether t here are substantive \ngrounds for relief.  The trial court must independently review the record and address the \nsubstance of a petitioner's claims regardless of whether the st ate responds to his petition \nfor postconviction relief.\"  State v. Wallen, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA97-02-017, 1997 Ohio \nApp. LEXIS 3647, *4 (Aug. 11, 1997).  See also State v. Hartman, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. \n27162, 2017-Ohio-7933 (a trial court has an independent duty to  analyze a PCR petition \nunder R.C. 2953.21[D]); State v. McCabe , 4th Dist. Washington No. 97CA32, 1998 Ohio \nApp. LEXIS 4487 (Sept. 14, 1998) (it is well settled that, rega rdless of whether or not the \nstate responds to a petition for postconviction relief, R.C. 2953.21[D] requires the trial court Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 10 - \nto sua sponte analyze the petition).  Thus, the trial court was  required to independently \ndetermine whether there were substantive grounds for relief and the pendency of the state's \nmotion for summary judgment did not preclude the trial court from summarily dismissing the \nPCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D).  See State v. McKelton, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-\n02-028, 2015-Ohio-4228; State v. Noling , 11th Dist. Portage No. 98-P-0049, 2003-Ohio-\n5008.    \n{\u00b6 27} In his reply brief Myers argues for the first time that the tri al court's summary \ndismissal of the PCR petition without prior notice to the parti es violated the notice \nrequirement of procedural due process.  However, it is well est ablished that an appellant \nmay not raise new issues or assignments of error in a reply brief.  State v. Renfro, 12th Dist. \nButler No. CA2011-07-142, 2012-Ohio-2848, \u00b6 28, citing App.R. 1 6; State ex rel. Colvin v. \nBrunner, 120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041.  A reply brief simply provides the appellant \nwith an opportunity to respond to the arguments raised in the a ppellee's brief.  State v. \nQuaterman, 140 Ohio St.3d 464, 2014-Ohio-4034, \u00b6 18.  Myers' argument is  not \nappropriately before the court and will not be considered.  Fur thermore, as the discussion \nabove makes clear, parties in postconviction proceedings are on notice of a trial court's sua \nsponte authority to grant a summary dismissal of a PCR petition .  R.C. 2953.21; Hartman, \n2017-Ohio-7933; McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228; McCabe, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 4487.      \n{\u00b6 28} Myers' first assignment of error is overruled. \nC.  Discovery Motions \n{\u00b6 29} Assignment of Error No. 2:  \n{\u00b6 30} THE TRIAL COURT DENIED MYERS' RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS, \nACCESS TO THE OHIO COURTS, AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, AND \nVIOLATED R.C. \u00a7 2953.21(A)(1) AND ITS DISCOVERY AMENDMENTS, WHE N THE \nCOURT HELD THAT THE DISCOVERY AMENDMENTS WERE NON-RETROACTIVE Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 11 - \nAND THUS INAPPLICABLE TO MYERS' CASE, AND THEN ENFORCED AN \nUNREASONABLE AND IMPROPERLY-RESTRICTIVE DEFINITION OF \"GOOD CAUSE\" \nTO DENY DISCOVERY TO MYERS ON EVERY ONE OF HIS CLAIMS. \n{\u00b6 31} Assignment of Error No. 3:  \n{\u00b6 32} EVEN UNDER THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE PCR STATUTE, THE TRIAL \nCOURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED MYERS' PCR PETITION WITHOUT AFFORDING HIM \nANY OPPORTUNITY TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY. \n{\u00b6 33} These assignments of error challenge the trial court's denial o f Myers' \ndiscovery motions.  As stated above, the trial court found that amended R.C. 2953.21 was \nnot applicable in the case at bar because the statute did not explicitly state it was retroactive.  \nAlternatively, the trial court found that even if the statutory  amendment was applied \nretroactively, Myers was not entitled to discovery as he had not demonstrated \"good cause.\"  \nThe statute was amended after Myers filed his PCR petition and first motion for discovery \nbut before he filed his supplemental motion for discovery. \n{\u00b6 34} Before R.C. 2953.21 was amended on April 6, 2017, it was well e stablished \nthat the statutory scheme governing postconviction relief did n ot entitle a petitioner to \nconduct discovery.  State ex rel. Love v. Cuyahoga Cty. Prosecutor's Office, 87 Ohio St.3d \n158, 159, 1999-Ohio-314; Ketterer, 2017-Ohio-4117 at \u00b6 45.  Nevertheless, discovery could \nbe proper where a petitioner set forth operative facts outside the record that revealed a \nconstitutional error in his or her case.  Id.  The granting or overruling of discovery motions \nrested within the sound discretion of the trial court.  State v. Lawson, 12th Dist. Clermont \nNo. CA2011-07-056, 2012-Ohio-548, \u00b6 17. \n{\u00b6 35} Amended R.C. 2953.21 makes substantial changes regarding PCR pe titions \nin death-penalty cases, and in particular, allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery in aid \nof their PCR petition if good cause is shown.  Specifically, R. C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) now Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 12 - \nprovides that  \nAt any time in conjunction with the filing of a petition for \npostconviction relief under division (A) of this section by a \nperson who has been sentenced to death, or with the litigation \nof a petition so filed, the court, for good cause shown, may \nauthorize the petitioner in seeking the postconviction relief and \nthe prosecuting attorney of the county served by the court in \ndefending the proceeding, to take depositions and to issue \nsubpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in accordance with \ndivisions (A)(1)(d), (A)(1)(e), and (C) of this section, and to any \nother form of discovery as in a civil action that the court in its \ndiscretion permits.  The court may limit the extent of discover y \nunder this division.  In addition to discovery that is relevant  to \nthe claim and was available under Criminal Rule 16 through \nconclusion of the original criminal trial, the court, for good cause \nshown, may authorize the petitioner or prosecuting attorney to \ntake depositions and issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces \ntecum in either of the following circumstances: \n \n(i) For any witness who testified at trial or who was disclosed by \nthe state prior to trial, except as otherwise provided in this \ndivision, the petitioner or prosecuting attorney shows clear and \nconvincing evidence that the witness is material and that a \ndeposition of the witness or the issuing of a subpoena or \nsubpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to substantiate \nor refute the petitioner's claim that there is a reasonable \nprobability of an altered verdict.  This division does not apply if \nthe witness was unavailable for trial or would not voluntarily be \ninterviewed by the defendant or prosecuting attorney. \n \n(ii) For any witness with respect to whom division (A)(1) (d)(i) of \nthis section does not apply, the petitioner or prosecuting \nattorney shows good cause that the witness is material and that \na deposition of the witness or the issuing of a subpoena or \nsubpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to substantiate \nor refute the petitioner's claim that there is a reasonable \nprobability of an altered verdict.  \n{\u00b6 36} We first address whether the trial court erred in finding that amended R.C. \n2953.21 does not apply to the case at bar because it is not retroactive.  This is a strict legal \nissue which we review de novo.  State v. Consilio, 114 Ohio St.3d 295, 2007-Ohio-4163, \u00b6 \n8; State v. Gloff, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2019-06-047, 2020-Ohio-3143, \u00b6 17. \n{\u00b6 37} It is well settled that a statute is presumed to apply prospect ively unless Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 13 - \nexpressly declared to be retroactive.  R.C. 1.48.  Additionally , Section 28, Article II of the \nOhio Constitution, prohibits the General Assembly from passing retroactive laws.  Applying \nthese two provisions, the Supreme Court of Ohio has established  a  t w o - p a r t  t e s t  t o  \ndetermine whether a statute may be applied retroactively.  Consilio. \n{\u00b6 38} Under this test, a reviewing court must first determine as a th reshold matter \nwhether the statute is expressly made retroactive.  Consilio, 2007-Ohio-4163 at \u00b6 10.  \"The \nGeneral Assembly's failure to clearly enunciate retroactivity e nds the analysis and the \nrelevant statute may be applied only prospectively.\"  Id.  If, however, the General Assembly \nexpressly indicated its intention that the statute apply retroactively, the reviewing court must \nthen move to the second step of the analysis and \"determine whe t h e r  t h e  s t a t u t e  i s  \nremedial, in which case retroactive application is permitted, o r substantive, in which case \nretroactive application is forbidden.\"  State v. White, 132 Ohio St.3d 344, 2012-Ohio-2583, \n\u00b6 27.   \n{\u00b6 39} As the trial court properly found, R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) as amended does not \nexplicitly state it is to be applied retroactively.  \"A statute  must clearly proclaim its own \nretroactivity to overcome the presumption of prospective application.  Retroactivity is not to \nbe inferred.\"  Consilio at \u00b6 15.  \"If the retroactivity of a statute is not expressly stated in plain \nterms, the presumption in favor of prospective application controls.  Moreover, the General \nAssembly is presumed to know that it must include expressly retroactive language to create \nthat effect, and it has done so in the past.\"  Id.  Because amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) \ndoes not expressly mention retroactivity, we find that the stat ute applies prospectively and \nwe need not determine whether the statute is remedial or substa ntive under the second \nprong of the test.   \n{\u00b6 40} We further find that by its plain terms the statute applies pro spectively to \npending PCR petitions in that it allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery, for good cause Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 14 - \nshown, \"at any time in conjunction with the filing of a [PCR petition], or with the litigation of \na petition so filed[.]\"  (Emphasis added.)  In the case at bar, amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) \nwas not yet in effect when Myers filed his PCR petition.  However, the PCR petition was still \nbeing litigated on April 6, 2017, when the amended statute beca me effective.  Amended \nR.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d), therefore,  applies to Myers' PCR petitio n.  See Gloff, 2020-Ohio-\n3143.    \n{\u00b6 41} The statute requires that the petitioner demonstrate \"good caus e\" as a \nprerequisite for a trial court to allow discovery.  As stated above, the trial court alternatively \nfound that Myers failed to show \"good cause.\"   \n{\u00b6 42} \"Good cause\" is not defined by the statute.  Consequently, the trial court \nadopted the definition applied in federal habeas corpus proceed ings, to wit, good cause \nexists \"where specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner \nmay, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is * * * entitled to relief, \nit is the duty of the courts to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate \ninquiry.\"  Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 908-909, 117 S.Ct. 1793 (1997).   \"Conversely, \nwhere a petitioner would not be entitled to relief on a particu lar claim, regardless of what \nfacts he developed, he cannot show good cause for discovery on that claim.\"  Murphy v. \nBradshaw, S.D.Ohio No. C-1-03-053, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15978, *2 (Sept. 13, 2003). \n{\u00b6 43} Before determining whether a petitioner is entitled to discover y under \"good \ncause,\"  the court must first identify the essential elements of the claim on which discovery \nis sought.  Bracy at 904.  The burden of demonstrating the materiality of the in formation \nrequested is on the moving party.  Stanford v. Parker , 266 F.3d 442, 460 (6th Cir.2001).  \nDiscovery may be allowed where the petitioner's claims are \"nei ther patently frivolous nor \npalpably incredible\" and where \"the discovery he requests is sp ecific, limited, and \nreasonably calculated to lead to evidence in support of his claim[.]\"  Hill v. Mitchell, S.D.Ohio Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 15 - \nNo. 1:98-cv-452, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71975, *31-32 (Sept. 27, 2007).  A petitioner is not \nentitled to go on a fishing expedition based on conclusory allegations.  Id. at *5; Williams v. \nBagley, 380 F.3d 932, 974 (6th Cir.2004).  \"Even in a death penalty c ase, 'bald assertions \nand conclusory allegations do not provide sufficient ground to warrant requiring the state to \nrespond to discovery or to require an evidentiary hearing.'\"  Stanford at 460.  Rather, the \npetitioner must set forth specific allegations of fact.  Williams at 974. \n{\u00b6 44} Myers argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery \nbecause he demonstrated \"good cause\" or, alternatively, set for th operative facts outside \nthe record that revealed constitutional errors.  Myers further argues that the trial court \nmisapplied the Bracy good cause standard by essentially requiring him to prove his claims \nas a prerequisite to discovery.   \n{\u00b6 45} Myers' discovery motions were broad overall, seeking a wide ran ge of \ninformation, records, and depositions of individuals, some of whom were identified only by \ncategory.  The trial court broke down Myers' discovery requests into nine general categories \nof inquiry: (1) records in the custody of the Warren County Children's Services, the Warren \nCounty Department of Job and Family Services, and the Warren Co unty Juvenile Court \nregarding Myers' family, (2) Myers' records from the Warren Cou nty Jail, (3) grand jury \nproceedings, (4) Mosley's institutional records, (5) records of  the prosecutor's office and \nseveral law enforcement agencies relating to their investigatio n of Back's death and the \narrest of Myers and Mosley, (6) depositions of law enforcement officers, (7) depositions of \nthe jurors, (8) depositions of the attorneys on the prosecution  team, and (9) depositions of \nthe defense team.   \n{\u00b6 46} Myers' first motion for discovery did not identify how his disc overy requests \nrelated to his postconviction claims.  By contrast, the supplem ental motion for discovery \nargued that Myers was entitled to conduct discovery on (1) his claims of ineffective Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 16 - \nassistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial, (2) his claims of ineffective \nassistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial, an d (3) his claims challenging \nthe constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for a n offender who was still a \nteenager at the time of the offense.  In his brief, Myers argues the trial court erred in denying \nhis motions for discovery on the foregoing claims.  We will address the trial court's denial of \nMyers' discovery motions concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during \nthe penalty phase of the trial in conjunction with Myers' fifth assignment of error. \n{\u00b6 47} Myers first argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery \nregarding his claims challenging the constitutionality and prop riety of the death sentence \nfor a 19-year-old offender at the time of the offense.  In supp ort of these constitutional \nchallenges, Myers sought discovery of (1) the Warren County's t raining and instructional \nmaterials for judges, prosecutors, and sheriff deputies concerning behavioral characteristics \nand brain development of juveniles, adolescents, and late-adole scents (18-21 years old) \noffenders, and (2) Warren County's data concerning the prosecut ion of such juvenile, \nadolescent, and late-adolescent offenders for the previous seven years.   \n{\u00b6 48} We find that Myers' requested discovery falls more into the cat egory of a \nfishing expedition.  Furthermore, as we discuss  in the fourth assignment of error, Myers' \nclaims are barred by res judicata and fail to set forth suffici ent operative facts to establish \nsubstantive grounds for relief, given the election of the Unite d States Supreme Court and \nOhio Supreme Court not to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over \nthe age of 18 at the time of the crime.  \"[W]here a petitioner would not be entitled to relief \non a particular claim, regardless of what facts he developed, h e cannot show good cause \nfor discovery on that claim.\"  Murphy, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15978 at *2.  The trial court, \ntherefore, did not err in denying Myers' motions for discovery regarding his claims \nchallenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death se ntence for a 19-year-old Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 17 - \noffender at the time of the offense. \n{\u00b6 49} Myers next argues that the trial court erred in denying his mot ions for \ndiscovery concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of co unsel during the guilt phase \nof the trial.  Counsel's alleged ineffective assistance include d the failure to (1) pursue a \nyouth-based defense theory, (2) hire a fact investigator, (3) fully cross-examine Mosley, (4) \ncross-examine a sergeant and a detective regarding their failure to follow police procedure \nmanuals, (5) present the testimony of a crime scene expert, (6)  present the testimony of a \npolice procedure expert to challenge Miranda issues, (7) present the testimony of an expert \nto evaluate Myers' understanding of his Miranda rights, (8) achieve a change of venue, and \n(9) challenge the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook.  As we  d i s c u s s  i n  t h e  s i x t h  \nassignment of error, Myers' claims regarding the testimony of a  police procedure expert to \nchallenge Miranda issues, change of venue, and the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook \nare barred by res judicata as they could have been raised on di rect appeal to the Ohio \nSupreme Court.  As we further discuss in the sixth assignment of error, Myers' other claims \nfail to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.  Murphy \nat *2.  The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying Myer s' motions for discovery \nconcerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial.   \n{\u00b6 50} To that extent, Myers' second and third assignments of error are overruled. \nD.  Constitutional Challenges \n{\u00b6 51} Assignment of Error No. 4:   \n{\u00b6 52} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND \nAN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT FOUND PROCEDURALLY \nBARRED MYERS' CLAIMS CHALLENGING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY, PROPRIETY, \nAND/OR PROPORTIONALITY OF A DEATH SENTENCE FOR AN OFFENDER, LIK E \nMYERS, WHO WAS STILL A TEENAGER AT THE TIME OF HIS OFFENSE (GRO UNDS Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 18 - \n5, 8, 9, 46, 47, 48), AND IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING SUCH CLAIMS U NDER R.C. \n2953.21(C) WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING  AND \nIN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.  \n{\u00b6 53} Myers argues that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 5, 8, \n9, 46, 47, and 48 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged the constitutionality, propriety, \nand/or proportionality of a death sentence for an offender, like Myers, who was a teenager \nat the time of the offense.  In this assignment of error, Myers details the scientific research \non adolescent brain development, references various cases ackno wledging that young \nadults under the age of 21 share many of the characteristics of  late-age adolescents, and \nargues that the imposition of a death sentence upon a teenage offender, such as him, is an \nunconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment.  Myers asserts that a cut-off of age 18 for \nimposing a death penalty is arbitrary.  Myers further asserts h is death sentence is \nunconstitutionally disproportionate to the life sentence Mosley received. \n{\u00b6 54} Ground 5 argues that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), Ohio's felony-murder s tatute, is \nunconstitutional because it fails to adequately account for you th in violation of the Eighth \nAmendment.  Ground 8 argues that the death sentence was disproportionate compared to \nMosley and others convicted of similar crimes in violation of M yers' Eighth Amendment \nrights.  Ground 9 argues that Myers' death sentence was void because the trial court failed \nto consider the R.C. 2929.11 purposes of felony sentencing when  determining the \nappropriateness of the death sentence on the capital specifications.  Ground 46 argues that \nMyers' Eighth Amendment rights were violated because the trial court failed to accord his \nyouth the mitigating value it deserved.  Ground 47 argues that the death penalty was a \ndisproportionate punishment for Myers given his youth and other individual characteristics.  \nGround 48 argues that the death penalty is per se unconstitutio nal for a youthful offender \nconvicted of committing a crime prior to turning 21 years old. Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 19 - \n{\u00b6 55} The trial court dismissed Grounds 8 and 9, finding that both ar guments were \nraised in Myers' direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, were addressed by the supreme \ncourt, and were therefore barred by res judicata.  The trial court further dismissed Grounds \n5 and 46 through 48 as follows: \nThe Ohio Supreme Court has already addressed whether the \nsentence of death for Myers based on his age is a violation of \nthe Eighth Amendment and found that it is not a violation of his \nconstitutional rights.  Therefore, this argument is barred by r es \njudicata. \n \nFurther, the Supreme Court of the United States has addressed \nthe age of youthful offenders in a number of contexts and has \nnot chosen to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals \nwho are over the age of eighteen at the time of the crime.  \n[Myers] has submitted evidence related to the development in \nbrain science, however, the Ohio Supreme Court and the United \nStates Supreme Court have considered these new \ndevelopments and similar arguments to the ones set forth by \n[Myers].  The United States Supreme Court acknowledged that \nindividuals over eighteen may still exhibit signs of a juvenile but \nalso found that since eighteen is the line society draws for many \npurposes between childhood and adulthood, that was the age \nthat the line for death penalty ought to rest.  Roper v. Simmons, \n543 U.S. 551, 574, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 1197-98 (2005). \n{\u00b6 56} We find that the trial court properly dismissed Grounds 5, 8, 9, and 46 through \n48.  On direct appeal to the supreme court, Myers argued that the death sentence violated \nthe Eighth Amendment proscription of cruel and unusual punishme nt, given recent \ndecisions of the United States Supreme Court and a growing body of new developments in \nbrain science indicating that age 18 is not the proper cut-off point for the death penalty.  \nMyers further argued that his death sentence was comparatively disproportionate to the life \nsentence Mosley received and that he should not have been sente nced to death because \nhe was a 19-year-old immature adolescent with mental and youth-related behavioral issues \nwhen he committed his crimes.  The supreme court addressed and rejected these claims.  \nMyers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 173-176.  They are therefore barred by res judicata.  Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 20 - \n{\u00b6 57} Myers' other claims were properly dismissed by the trial court as failing to set \nforth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, given the election \nof the United States Supreme Court and Ohio Supreme Court not to extend the ban on the \ndeath penalty to individuals who are over the age of 18 at the time of the crime.  Myers \nnotes that while his direct appeal made a brief reference to th e newer brain science, it did \nnot make the constitutional claim for a Roper-extension that his PRC petition makes.  See \nMyers at \u00b6 176 (\"Although Myers argues that new developments in brai n science indicate \nthat age 18 is not the 'proper cut off point for the death pena lty,' he does not propose that \nthe categorical exclusion for those under age 18 be extended to 19-year-olds\").  However, \nsuch constitutional argument was recently addressed and rejecte d by the Ohio Supreme \nCourt in State v. Graham, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-6700.   \n{\u00b6 58} Graham, who turned 19 years old the month before he committed h is crimes \nand who was sentenced to death, argued that imposing a death se ntence on a capital \ndefendant who was under the age of 21 at the time of the crime violated the Eighth \nAmendment.  Extrapolating from the United States Supreme Court' s Roper decision, \nGraham argued that it was possible the Supreme Court could exte nd Roper to find that a \ndefendant who turned 19 the month before committing the offense is constitutionally barred \nfrom receiving a death sentence.  The Ohio Supreme Court squarely rejected the argument: \n\"[B]ecause the United States Supreme Court has drawn the line a t 18 for Eighth \nAmendment purposes, state courts are not free to invoke the Eig hth Amendment as \nauthority for drawing it at a higher age.  * * * Roper is controlling, and we must follow it.\"  \nGraham at \u00b6 182, citing In re Phillips, 6th Cir. No. 17-3729, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 17766 \n(July 20, 2017) (no authority exists at the present time to sup port the argument that a \ndefendant who was 19 years old at the time of the offense is in eligible to receive a death \nsentence). Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 21 - \n{\u00b6 59} Myers' fourth assignment of error is overruled.  \n{\u00b6 60} Assignment of Error No. 9:   \n{\u00b6 61} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND \nAN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT FOUND PROCEDURALLY \nBARRED MYERS' CLAIMS CHALLENGING IN MULTIPLE RESPECTS THE \nCONSTITUTIONALITY OF OHIO'S DEATH PENALTY STATUTE AND SYSTEMS \n(GROUNDS 2-4, 7, 57), AND IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING SUCH CLAIMS UNDER R.C. \n2953.21(C) WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING  AND \nIN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.  \n{\u00b6 62} Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 2, 3, 4, 7, \nand 57 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged the constit utionality of Ohio's death-\npenalty scheme and the statutes governing it.  Specifically, Myers argues that Ohio's death-\npenalty scheme (1) is per se unconstitutional due to several fu ndamental constitutional \ndefects, (2) is unconstitutional because it allows racial dispa rities in capital indictment \npractices and the actual infliction of the death penalty, (3) i s incompatible with modern \nstandards of decency, and (4) violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under Hurst \nv. Florida, 577 U.S. 92, 136 S.Ct. 616 (2016).  Myers further argues that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), \nOhio's felony-murder statute, is unconstitutional as a capital specification because it allows \nfor invidious racial discrimination in its application and fails to provide adequate safeguards \nto ensure only the most culpable offenders are sentenced to death. \n{\u00b6 63} Myers' claims are barred by res judicata as they were either ra ised or could \nhave been raised in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.  Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 \nat \u00b6 201-202.  This includes his Sixth Amendment argument under  Hurst as his merit brief \nwas filed in the supreme court four months after Hurst was decided.  Myers acknowledges \nthat the supreme court \"has t hus far been unwilling to conclude  that Ohio's death penalty Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 22 - \nstatute is unconstitutional under the U.S. and/or Ohio constitutions in the respect alleged * \n* * in these Grounds.\"  See, e.g., Myers; State v. Mason, 153 Ohio St.3d 476, 2018-Ohio-\n1462; State v. Mammone, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942.  In December 2020, the \nsupreme court once again held that Ohio's death-penalty scheme was not unconstitutional \nunder Hurst.  Graham, 2020-Ohio-6700 at \u00b6 185-186. \n{\u00b6 64} Myers' ninth assignment of error is overruled. \n{\u00b6 65} Assignment of Error No. 11:  \n{\u00b6 66} THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION, AND COMMITTED AN \nERROR OF LAW, WHEN IT DENIED MYERS RELIEF ON HIS FIRST GROUND F OR \nRELIEF, BECAUSE OHIO'S POSTCONVICTION PROCEDURES FAIL TO PROVID E \nDEATH-SENTENCED PETITIONERS WITH AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS  \nAND THEY VIOLATE THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS. \n{\u00b6 67} Myers argues that Ohio's statutory scheme for postconviction re lief is \nunconstitutional because it does not provide an adequate correc tive process due to its \n\"rigid\" reliance on principles of res judicata and a petitioner 's inability to conduct discovery \nuntil convincing a trial court that a hearing is warranted.  This court has already determined \nthat \"the statutory procedure for postconviction relief constit utes an adequate corrective \nprocess.\"  State v. Lindsey , 12th Dist. Brown No. CA2002-02-002, 2003-Ohio-811, \u00b6 13; \nState v. Lawson , 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2013-12-093, 2014-Ohio-3554, \u00b6 43.  Other \nOhio appellate courts have likewise rejected the claim that Ohi o's postconviction relief \nstatute does not afford an adequate corrective process.  See, e.g. State v. Conway , 10th \nDist. Franklin No. 17AP-504, 2019-Ohio-2260.  Furthermore, the propriety of resolving a \npostconviction petitioner's arguments on the basis of res judic ata is well settled.  E.g., \nSzefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93.  We see no reason to deviate from our prior precedent.  Lawson. \n{\u00b6 68} Myers' eleventh assignment of error is overruled.

Prosecutorial Misconduct \n{\u00b6 69} Assignment of Error No. 7:   \n{\u00b6 70} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND \nAN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER \nR.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT \n(GROUNDS 50, 58), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY \nHEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF. \n{\u00b6 71} Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily denying Grounds  50 and 58 \nof his PCR petition which allege prosecutorial misconduct.    \n{\u00b6 72} For a conviction to be reversed on the basis of prosecutorial m isconduct, a \ndefendant must prove the prosecutor's comments were improper and that they prejudicially \naffected the defendant's substantial rights.  State v. Elmore , 111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-\nOhio-6207, \u00b6 62; McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228 at \u00b6 13.  However, \"[t]he focus of an inquiry \ninto allegations of prosecutorial misconduct is upon the fairne ss of the trial, not upon \nculpability of the prosecutor.\"  State v. Gray, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-09-176, 2012-\nOhio-4769, \u00b6 56.  Therefore, \"[p]rosecutorial misconduct is not grounds for error unless the \ndefendant has been denied a fair trial.\"  State v. Olvera-Guillen , 12th Dist. Butler No. \nCA2007-05-118, 2008-Ohio-5416, \u00b6 27, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239 (1984). \n{\u00b6 73} We first address Myers' averment that \"the late and questionabl e disclosure \nof Mosley's notebook may very well have been the result of prosecutorial misconduct.\"  \n{\u00b6 74} R.C. 2953.21(A)(4) requires a petitioner to \"state in the origi nal or amended \npetition filed under division (A) of this section all grounds for relief claimed by the petitioner.\"  \nExcept as provided in R.C. 2953.23, inapplicable here, \"any gro und for relief that is not so \nstated in the petition is waived.\"  R.C. 2953.21(A)(4); State v.

Mye rs did not raise this \nclaim of prosecutorial misconduct in his PCR petition and has t herefore forfeited it.  State \nv. Zeune, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-147, 2013-Ohio-4156, \u00b6 30; State v. Barb, 8th Dist. \nCuyahoga No. 94054, 2010-Ohio-5239, \u00b6 25; State v. McKee , 9th Dist. Lorain No. \n96CA006599, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4433, *9 (Oct. 1, 1997) (failure to raise issue in PCR \npetition results in a waiver of the right to assert the issue on appeal). \n{\u00b6 75} Ground 50 alleges that Myers' due process rights were violated when \nprivileged attorney-client discussions were potentially broadcast throughout the courthouse \nand into the prosecutor's office via the trial court's audio/vi deo recording system.  In his \nbrief, Myers asserts the fact that conversations from the defen se table could be broadcast \nin such a manner should cause \"great concern about whether any privileged conversations \nwere 'overheard,' whether any were recorded, whether someone to ok notes of what they \nheard, [and] whether such information was utilized by the State in any fashion[.]\"  \n{\u00b6 76} Myers does not identify the resulting prejudice.  The trial cou rt sua sponte  \naddressed the issue at a pretrial hearing in August 2014, subse quently conducted an \nevaluation of its audio/video recording system to make sure that conversations taking place \nat the defense table could not be heard by others, and provided  a copy of that evaluation \nto counsel.  In dismissing Ground 50, the trial court found \"NO  evidence that any \nconversation of counsel was ever overheard,\" noted its investig ation into the issue, and \n\"determined that the mute button was sufficient to prevent anyo ne from overhearing any \nconversation between counsel and the petitioner.\"  Furthermore, this issue could have been \nraised on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court and is therefore barred by res judicata.  \nThe trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 50. \n{\u00b6 77} Ground 58 alleges that the elected prosecutor engaged in miscon duct by \nextensively posting about the case on his county prosecutor Facebook and Twitter accounts Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 25 - \nduring and after the trial and via statements he made in an int erview during a 2016 BBC \ndocumentary.  Ground 58 further alleges that Myers was prejudic ed by the prosecutor's \nmisconduct.  The trial court dismissed the ground, finding that  Myers \"failed to establish \nsufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for  relief.\"  In his brief, Myers \nasserts that the prosecutor's social media postings and interview \"tainted\" his right to a fair \ntrial.     \n{\u00b6 78} We find that the trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 5 8 .   T h e  \nprosecutor's post-trial social media posts, post-trial media st atements, and statements in \nthe 2016 BBC documentary are irrelevant and could not and did not deprive Myers of a fair \ntrial.  Regarding the prosecutor's social media postings and statements that occurred before \nand during trial, Myers does not articulate how any specific po st or media statement \nprejudiced his right to a fair trial.  A review of the posts an d statements shows that they \nwere restricted to providing the public with information about the criminal proceedings \nagainst Myers and communicated the results of various stages of the criminal proceedings \nagainst Myers either directly or by sharing links to news headl ines.  Following the guilty \nverdict, the prosecutor simply recognized Back's family and the  efforts of the investigators \nand his office.   \n{\u00b6 79} Furthermore, the trial court repeatedly admonished the jurors n ot to view or \nlisten to any news reports in any form.  We presume the jury fo llowed the trial court's \nadmonitions unless it is demonstrated otherwise.  State v. Miller , 12th Dist. Preble No. \nCA2019-11-010, 2021-Ohio-162, \u00b6 50.  Myers has not introduced a ny evidence to the \ncontrary.  Prejudice to a defendant will not be presumed in the  absence of proof of jury \nexposure to possibly prejudicial news reports, or in this case, the prosecutor's social media \nposts.  See State v. Wright , 3d Dist. Crawford No. 3-92-24, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 6090 \n(Dec. 30, 1994). Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 26 - \n{\u00b6 80} Finally, this issue could have been raised by Myers in his direct appeal to the \nO h i o  S u p r e m e  C o u r t .   W e  n o t e  t h a t  M y e r s  a c t u a l l y  d i d  a l l e g e  c l aims of prosecutorial \nmisconduct as part of his direct appeal under his tenth proposi tion of law.  Res judicata \napplies to any issue that could have been raised on direct appeal, including a claim alleging \nprosecutorial misconduct.  McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228 at \u00b6 23, citing State v. Zych , 12th \nDist. Clermont No. CA97-02-012, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4731 (Oct. 27, 1997).  Myers fails \nto identify any reason why this claim of prosecutorial misconduct could not have been raised \non direct appeal.  Myers does not assert he learned about the p rosecutor's social media \nposts after filing his direct appeal.  Nor does he allege the posts were not known or available \nat the time of trial or his direct appeal.  Dillingham, 2012-Ohio-5841 at \u00b6 10.  \n{\u00b6 81} Myers' seventh assignment of error is overruled. \n2.  Trial Court Rulings \n{\u00b6 82} Assignment of Error No. 8:  \n{\u00b6 83} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND \nAN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER \nR.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS OF TRIAL COURT ERROR S IN \nMULTIPLE RESPECTS (GROUNDS 51-56, 59), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR \nAN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF. \n{\u00b6 84} Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grou nds 51 \nthrough 56 and 59 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged several trial court's rulings. \n{\u00b6 85} Ground 51 challenges the trial court's failure to grant a continuance of the trial \ndate to allow defense counsel to obtain a mitigation specialist .  This issue involves lead \ndefense counsel's request to have his wife appointed as a mitig ation specialist, which was \ninitially denied by the trial court.  After he was unable to fi nd another mitigation specialist, \nlead counsel moved the trial court to reconsider its previous r uling.  Alternatively, counsel Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 27 - \nmoved the court for a continuance of the trial date.  The trial court reconsidered its previous \ndenial, appointed lead counsel's wife as the mitigation specialist, and denied the alternative \nrequest for continuance.  The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 51.   \n{\u00b6 86} Ground 52 challenges the trial court's failure to grant a continuance of the trial \ndate to allow defense counsel to investigate Mosley's notebook after it was disclosed to the \ndefense the day before trial was to commence.  Ground 53 challe nges the trial court's \nadmission of the notebook into evidence and its failure to inst ruct the jury on the break in \nthe chain of custody.  The notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after \nthe original search warrant was executed.  On direct appeal, th e Ohio Supreme Court \naddressed the state's delayed disclosure of the notebook, the trial court's denial of defense \ncounsel's motion for a continuance, and the admissibility of th e notebook into evidence.  \nMyers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 86-93, 112-120.  In his direct appeal, defense counsel did not \nchallenge the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on chain of custody.  Because the issues \nabove could have been or were raised on direct appeal to the su preme court, they are \nbarred by res judicata.  The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 52 and 53.   \n{\u00b6 87} Grounds 54 and 55 challenge the trial court's denial of Myers' motion to \nsuppress his \"involuntary\" statements to Detective Michael Wyat t where he \"did not \nunderstand his Miranda rights and never signed a Miranda waiver.\"  In support of these \ngrounds, Myers submitted the reports of Gary Rini, a crime scene/police procedure expert, \nand Dr. Drew Barzman, a psychiatrist.  Upon reviewing Myers' vi deotaped police \ninterrogations, Rini concluded that Myers \"was clearly confused  and befuddled during his \nquestioning\" and was \"therefore apparently unable to appreciate the gravity of his situation, \nnor was he aware of the constitutional rights afforded to him.\"  Upon reviewing Myers' police \ninterrogations, administering the Miranda Rights Comprehension Instruments test (\"MCRI\"), \nand reviewing comprehensive historical information regarding My ers, Dr. Barzman opined Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 28 - \nthat \"due to his young age of 19, probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and \nlack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal j ustice system in general,\" \nMyers \"was unable to adequately apply his Miranda rights at the time of the interrogations.\"   \n{\u00b6 88} On direct appeal, the supreme court overruled Myers' propositio n of law \nrelating to the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress and the claims that he never \nvalidly waived his right to remain silent, that he was denied h is constitutional right to \ncounsel, and that his statements were involuntary.  Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 61-82.  In \nhis brief, Myers asserts that the expert reports of Rini and Dr. Barzman \"were necessary to \nsubstantiate the claim\" his statements were not voluntarily mad e and were obtained in \nviolation of Miranda.  With the exception of the MCRI test, the same facts and hist orical \ninformation reviewed by Rini and Dr. Barzman were known and ava ilable to Myers at the \ntime of his direct appeal to the supreme court.  Myers, therefo re, could have appealed his \nstatements to police on the basis of his demeanor during questi oning, his age, his \n\"probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and hi s lack of experience with \ninterrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general ,\" but did not.  \"A report not \nfound in the record does not automatically equate to a valid issue for post-conviction review \npurposes where, as here, the issue could have been raised on di rect appeal.\"  State v. \nDrummond, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05 MA 197, 2006-Ohio-7078, \u00b6 43.  The trial court did \nnot err in dismissing Grounds 54 and 55. \n{\u00b6 89} Ground 56 challenges the trial court's denial of Myers' motion for change of \nvenue based on the \"overwhelming\" pretrial media publicity rega rding the case.  Although \nMyers moved the trial court for a change of venue, he did not c hallenge the trial court's \ndenial of his motion in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme C ourt.  It is therefore barred \nby res judicata.  See McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228.  The trial court did not err in dismissing \nGround 56.   Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 29 - \n{\u00b6 90} Ground 59 challenges the trial court's failure to instruct the jury that Mosley's \nplea deal to a life sentence without parole was a mitigating fa ctor.  The record shows that \nthe trial court did instruct the jury that, in addition to the specific statutory mitigation factors, \nit could consider any additional factors that were not specific ally mentioned in favor of a \nsentence other than death.  Defense counsel was allowed to and did argue Mosley's plea \ndeal as a mitigating factor.  Furthermore, this claim could have been raised on direct appeal \nto the supreme court and is therefore barred by res judicata.  See State v. Jennings, 10th \nDist. Franklin No. 17AP-248, 2018-Ohio-3871; State v. Southers , 12th Dist. Butler No. \nCA88-03-027, 1988 Ohio App. LEXIS 2720 (June 30, 1988).  The tr ial court did not err in \ndismissing Ground 59.   \n{\u00b6 91} Myers' eighth assignment of error is overruled. \n3.  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel during the Guilt Phase \n{\u00b6 92} Assignment of Error No. 6:   \n{\u00b6 93} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND \nAN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER \nR.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS THAT HIS TRIAL COUNS EL \nRENDERED CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFICIENT PERFORMANCE IN THE TRIAL PHASE \nOF HIS CAPITAL TRIAL (GROUNDS 6, 10-18), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCO VERY OR \nAN EVIDENTIARY HEARING, AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF ON THESE  \nMERITORIOUS IAC CLAIMS. \n{\u00b6 94} Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 6 and 10 \nthrough 17 of his PCR petition, all of which allege numerous in stances of ineffective \nassistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial. \n{\u00b6 95} In order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of coun sel, it must be \nshown that an attorney's performance was deficient and that the  deficient performance Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 30 - \nprejudiced the defense.  Strickland v. Washington , 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 \n(1984).  In postconviction proceedings, a petitioner bears the initial burden of submitting \nevidentiary materials containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of \ncompetent counsel and also that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness.  \nState v. Jackson, 64 Ohio St.2d 107, 111 (1980).  Pursuant to the res judicata doctrine, a \nPCR petition may be dismissed where a petitioner, represented b y new counsel on direct \nappeal, could have raised the ineffective assistance of trial c ounsel claim on direct appeal \nwithout resort to evidence outside the record.  State v. Lentz , 70 Ohio St.3d 527 (1994), \nsyllabus; State v. Loza, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA96-10-214, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4574,  \n*9-10 (Oct. 13, 1997).  Additionally, mere presentation of evidence outside the record does \nnot transform a claim into one addressable in postconviction.  Drummond, 2006-Ohio-7078 \nat \u00b6 17.  The evidence must show that the petitioner could not have appealed his claim \nbased upon the information in the original record.  Id.   \n{\u00b6 96} Ground 6 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a \nyouth-based defense theory during the guilt phase of the trial in anticipation of the penalty \nphase.  Myers asserts that his \"youth, its specific effects on him, and its manifestation in \nthe conduct alleged by the State at trial should have all formed a central, consistent theme \npresented during both phases of the trial.\"  Counsel's defense theory during the guilt phase \nwas that Mosley committed the murder, Myers was simply present during the crime, and \nMosley subsequently turned on Myers by entering into a plea dea l and testifying against \nhim.  This was consistent with the penalty phase during which d efense counsel argued \nMyers' sentence should not be more severe than Mosley's sentence.  \n{\u00b6 97} The decision regarding which defense theory to pursue at trial is a matter of \ntrial strategy, and trial strategy decisions are not the basis of a finding of ineffective \nassistance of counsel.  State v. Murphy, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 524, 2001-Ohio-112; State v. Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 31 - \nKinsworthy, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2013-06-053, 2014-Ohio-1584, \u00b6 43.  M oreover, as \nthe trial court noted when it dismissed Ground 6, the fact that another defense attorney may \nhave or would have employed a different approach does not mean the alternative strategy \nfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.  State v. Casey, 12th Dist. Butler No. \nCA2017-08-013, 2018-Ohio-2084, \u00b6 34.  \"[T]here is a strong presumption that counsel has \nrendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions  in the exercise of \nreasonable professional judgment.\"  Id.  Defense counsel's guilt-phase strategy will not be \nsecond-guessed even though appellate counsel now argue that they would have defended \ndifferently.  State v. Mason, 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 169, 1998-Ohio-370.  The trial court did not \nerr in dismissing Ground 6. \n{\u00b6 98} Ground 10 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he faile d to hire a \nfact investigator even though the trial court had approved fund s for an investigator.  Lead \ndefense counsel's affidavit submitted in support of the PCR pet ition indicates that counsel \n\"ultimately did not retain\" an investigator because the case was not a \"who done it.\"  Ground \n11 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to fu lly cross-examine Mosley.  \nMyers asserts that an investigator would have discovered, inter  alia, that Mosley was \nsuffering from rage and depression in the days leading to Back' s murder, suffered from \nsevere drug addiction and had violent tendencies, and was not i n the habit of taking notes \nin a notebook.  The investigation would have further discovered  that Mosley's cellphone \nrecords belied his trial testimony.  Myers claims that this information could have been used \nto properly cross-examine Mosley and impeach his credibility. \n{\u00b6 99} \"The Strickland holding and the American Bar Association's Guidelines only \nrequire trial counsel to perform a reasonable investigation, not to hire an investigator.\"  State \nv. Hairston , 9th Dist. Lorain No. 05CA008768, 2006-Ohio-4925, \u00b6 36.  \"Furt her, '[a]n \nattorney's decision not to hire an investigator does not equate to a failure to investigate and Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 32 - \nresult in ineffective assistance of counsel.'\"  State v. Thompson, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-\nOhio-4751, \u00b6 247, quoting Hairston at \u00b6 36.  Defense counsel's failure to hire a fact \ninvestigator does not mean counsel did not investigate Mosley's  background.  The \naffidavits, reports, and records submitted by Myers in support of Ground 10 do not show a \nfailure to investigate. \n{\u00b6 100} Furthermore, as the Ohio Supreme Court specifically noted on direct appeal, \ndefense counsel did cross-examine Mosley \"vigorously and at length.\"  Myers, 2018-Ohio-\n1903 at \u00b6 186.  Defense counsel's cross-examination of Mosley s hows that counsel was \nvery familiar with Mosley's statements to police and demonstrat ed his investigation and \nfamiliarity with personal facts about Mosley, including Mosley's substance abuse issues and \nthe fact he engaged in illegal activity.  Defense counsel's cro ss-examination elicited \ntestimony that later allowed counsel to argue that Mosley was t he principal offender, that \nhe had a financial motive to commit the crimes, that he had a motive to keep his testimony \nconsistent with his statements to Detective Wyatt because of his plea agreement, and that \nhe lied to the police about Zennie to protect Zennie over Myers.  Defense counsel's cross-\nexamination of Mosley refutes any suggestion counsel did not in vestigate Mosley's \nbackground. \n{\u00b6 101} Whether defense counsel discovered all of the information Myers  identifies \nas topics of cross-examination is unknown.  However, counsel's strategy was to cast Mosley \nas the leader who planned the crimes and executed them with lit tle help from Myers and \nwho was now turning on Myers to save himself.  Some of the info rmation that Myers \nsuggests should have been a topic during Mosley's cross-examina tion is the same type of \ninformation which would have undermined Myers' mitigation strat egy that Mosley bore \nprimary responsibility for Back's murder.  In this sense, portraying Mosley as suffering from \ndepression and cocaine withdrawal at the time of the crime woul d have run counter to Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 33 - \ndefense counsel's strategy that Mosley was fully responsible for Back's murder.  In addition, \nin light of the overwhelming evidence of Myers' guilt and the f act that Mosley's testimony \nregarding his and Myers' actions on the days leading to and culminating in the murder was \ncorroborated by third-party witnesses, there is no reasonable probability Myers would have \nbeen acquitted of the charges.  The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 10 and 11. \n{\u00b6 102} Ground 12 challenges counsel's failure to cross-examine Sergean t Jeff \nGarrison of the Clayton Police Department and Detective Wyatt d uring the hearing on \nMyers' motion to suppress and at trial regarding their failure to follow their respective police \nprocedure manual in handcuffing Myers when he was only wanted for an interview.  Myers \nasserts that had counsel used the manuals when cross-examining the officers, this would \nhave aided in showing that Myers was \"effectively seized\" when he was handcuffed and \nwould have tarnished the officers' credibility. \n{\u00b6 103} The record shows that it was Clayton police officers who handcuffed Myers \nand placed him in the back seat of a Clayton police cruiser after he was located at Mosley's \nhome.  At the time, Myers was a suspect who was detained at the  request of the Warren \nCounty Sheriff's Office.  The Clayton Police Department manual allows one to be restrained \nwhen the officer can articulate a need to handcuff for safety r easons.  The sergeant's \ntestimony at the suppression hearing indicates that Myers was h andcuffed for safety \nreasons and to prevent him from running.  Detective Wyatt's tes timony reveals that the \ndetective did not direct that Myers be handcuffed, and that in fact, he directed that the \nhandcuffs be removed after he discovered that Myers was handcuffed.  \n{\u00b6 104} Furthermore, as the trial court found, the extent and scope of cross-\nexamination clearly fall within the ambit of trial strategy, an d debatable trial tactics do not \nestablish ineffective assistance of counsel.  State v. Leonard , 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-\nOhio-6235, \u00b6 146.  Even assuming, arguendo, that defense counsel was deficient in failing Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 34 - \nto use the manuals when he cross-examined the officers, Myers f ails to establish that, but \nfor counsel's error, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the suppression hearing \nand his trial would have been different.  The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 12. \n{\u00b6 105} Ground 13 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present \na crime scene expert testimony to question the veracity of Mosl ey's notebook and rebut \nsuch evidence.  The notebook was discovered in Mosley's home ei ght months after the \noriginal search warrant was executed in January 2014.  In suppo rt of Ground 13, Myers \nsubmitted Rini's report.  The report indicates that photographs  taken during the January \n2014 search of Mosley's home do not show the notebook at all, n or was the notebook \nmentioned in any investigative report generated as a result of the January 2014 search of \nMosley's home.  Rini's report states that the \"discovery\" of the notebook \"eight months later, \nduring a warrantless search in a location previously photograph ed during the January \n[2014] search, draws into question the legitimacy of the 'find'  by investigating officers.\"  \nThus, \"[i]t is not unwarranted for one to conclude the possibility that the [notebook] was not, \nin fact present during the original crime scene search, and may  have been placed at the \nscene sometime after the search was completed.\" \n{\u00b6 106} \"As an initial matter, the failure to call an expert and instea d rely on cross-\nexamination does not constitute ineffective assistance of couns el.\"  State v. Hunter , 131 \nOhio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, \u00b6 66.  Further, even if the wisd om of such an approach is \ndebatable, \"debatable trial tactics\" do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.  State \nv. Clayton, 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49 (1980).  Defense counsel cross-examined Mosley upon all \nissues identified in Rini's report and revisited those issues i n closing argument.  Detective \nWyatt testified the notebook was found where Mosley said it wou ld be.  The trial court did \nnot err in dismissing Ground 13. \n{\u00b6 107} Ground 14 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 35 - \na police procedure expert such as Rini to challenge Miranda issues.  Myers asserts that \nRini could have testified, based on his review of Myers' police  interrogations, that Myers \nwas \"clearly confused\" during questioning, that Detective Wyatt did not adequately explain \nthe Miranda warnings to Myers, and that the detective provided Myers with inaccurate \ninformation concerning how he could obtain an attorney.  Ground  15 alleges that counsel \nwas ineffective because he failed to present an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of \nhis Miranda rights.  In support of this ground, Myers submitted the report  of Dr. Barzman.  \nUpon reviewing Myers' police interrogations, administering the  MCRI test, and reviewing \ncomprehensive historical information regarding Myers, Dr. Barzman opined that \"due to his \nyoung age of 19, probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and lack of \nexperience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,\" Myers \"was \nunable to adequately apply his Miranda rights at the time of the interrogations.\" \n{\u00b6 108} During the suppression hearing defense counsel's cross-examinat ion of \nDetective Wyatt addressed the issues raised in Rini's report, a nd the videotapes of Myers' \ninterrogations were played and admitted into evidence.  The vid eotapes were likewise \nplayed to the jury and admitted into evidence at Myers' trial.  The trial court denied Myer's \nmotion to suppress, finding that Myers validly waived his Miranda rights.  The trial court \nfurther found that, based on the totality of the evidence, Myers understood the nature of his \nMiranda rights and the consequences in declining to exercise them.  In his direct appeal to \nthe Ohio Supreme Court, Myers challenged the validity of his Miranda waiver and argued \nthat counsel was ineffective during the guilt phase of his tria l.  Myers' alleged confusion \nduring police questioning, Detective Wyatt's explanation to Myers of the Miranda warnings \nand the information he provided Myers concerning how to retain an attorney, and counsel's \nalleged ineffectiveness in failin g to present expert testimony to challenge Miranda issues \nwere cognizable and could have been raised on direct appeal bas ed solely on the original Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 36 - \nrecord.  Rini's report does not constitute evidence outside the  record as Myers asserts.  \nMyers' argument is therefore barred by res judicata.  See State v. Dempsey , 8th Dist. \nCuyahoga No. 76386, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 2628 (June 15, 2000); State v. Holloway, 1st \nDist. Hamilton No. C-900805, 1992 Ohio App. LEXIS 283 (Jan. 29,  1992).  The trial court \ndid not err in dismissing Ground 14.   \n{\u00b6 109} The trial court dismissed Ground 15, finding that \"even if the defense had \nrequested an expert to evaluate Myers['] understanding of his Miranda rights, based on the \nevidence presented at the motion to suppress hearing it is unli kely that the Court would \nhave granted that request since the Court denied the motion to suppress.\"  The trial court \nfurther found that \"[t]he failure to request a * * * police procedures expert or another expert \nto challenge Miranda issues was not such an error as to deny [Myers'] constitutional rights.  \n[Myers] was not entitled to any such expert[.]\"   Thus, the tri al court found that even \nconsidering Dr. Barzman's report, Myers failed to set forth suf ficient operative facts \nestablishing a substantive ground for relief. \n{\u00b6 110} The MRCI administered by Dr. Barzman in October 2016 is the upd ated \nversion of the Thomas Grisso's Instruments for Assessing Understanding & Appreciation of \nMiranda Rights, commonly referred to as the Grisso test.  The t est specifically assesses a \nperson's capacity to understand and appreciate Miranda rights at the time of the evaluation.  \nGarner v. Mitchell , 557 F.3d 257, 266 (6th Cir.2009).  The test consists of four subtests, \ncalled \"instruments\": Comprehension of Miranda Rights (CMR), Comprehension of Miranda \nRights \u2013 Recognition (CMR-R), Function of Rights in Interrogati on (FRI), and \nComprehension of Miranda Vocabulary (CMV).  Id.; State v. Higgins, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. \n12 JE 11, 2013-Ohio-2555, \u00b6 43. \n{\u00b6 111} Myers' scores were within the range for 19-year-old individuals with a verbal \nIQ of 101 to 110 in the first three instruments; his score of 2 9 out of 32 in the fourth Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 37 - \ninstrument (CMV) was good in comparison to 19-year-old individuals with a verbal IQ of 101 \nto 110.  As stated above, the Grisso test purports to assess on e's capacity to understand \nthe Miranda warnings only at the time of the evaluation, not at the time t he warnings were \ngiven.  Garner at 270.  The test does not purport to measure the validity of the waiver of \nMiranda rights or legal competence to waive Miranda rights.  Id. at 269.  In his report Dr. \nBarzman admitted the limited usefulness of Myers' scores \"since  his interrogations were \nalmost 3 years ago[.]\"  Nonetheless, Dr. Barzman opined that \"[b]ased on his responses to \nthe [test], it is evident that Austin currently understands the words of the Miranda Rights but \nhe had problems with applying his rights.  Although [he] appeared to have average to above \naverage intelligence, he did not have the 'street smarts' three  years ago to actually apply \nhis Miranda Rights under intense stress.\" \n{\u00b6 112} Myers' scores indicate he did understand his Miranda rights.  Myers was \ninterviewed five times by Detective Wyatt.  Miranda warnings were not required during the \nfirst interview as Myers was not in custody.  Detective Wyatt administered Miranda warnings \nto Myers on three separate times; each time Myers stated he und erstood them.  Myers \ninvoked his right to counsel in the second interview and the de tective ended the interview.  \nMyers sought to re-initiate questioning during a third interview but was rebuffed because he \nhad invoked his right to counsel.  Myers subsequently re-initiated questioning during a fourth \ninterview, was administered the Miranda warnings again, and provided a statement.  \nDetective Wyatt administered the Miranda warnings for a third time before the fifth interview.  \nMyers indicated he understood them and answered the detective's  questions.  On direct \nappeal, the Ohio Supreme Court found that Myers understood his Miranda rights, which \nwas further demonstrated by his invocation of his right to counsel.  Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 \nat \u00b6 69-71. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 15.  \n{\u00b6 113} Ground 16 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to support Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 38 - \nthe motion for a change of venue with news articles evidencing the extraordinary amount \nof pretrial publicity, failed to renew the motion after voir dire, and ultimately failed to achieve \na change of venue.  The trial court dismissed Ground 16, finding that the motion for change \nof venue was initially denied subject to reconsideration if a j ury could not be empaneled in \naccordance with State v. Lundgren, 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 1995-Ohio-227.  The motion was \nsubsequently denied after the trial court was able to successfully seat a jury in accordance \nwith Lundgren.  Juror questionnaires submitted in support of Ground 16 indicate that six of \nthe 12 jurors had seen or heard pretrial news coverage of the case.  All jurors indicated that \nthey could and would decide the case based solely on the eviden ce presented at trial.  \nFurthermore, although Myers alleged claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the \nguilt phase as part of his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Co urt, he did not challenge \ndefense counsel's failure to achieve a change of venue.  It is therefore barred by res \njudicata.  See Piesciuk, 2013-Ohio-3879.  The trial court did not err in dismissing Gr ound \n16. \n{\u00b6 114} Ground 17 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he faile d to \nchallenge the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook either thro ugh cross-examination of \nthe state's witnesses or by expert testimony.  As stated above, the notebook was discovered \nin Mosley's home eight months after the original search warrant  was executed.  Counsel \nvigorously cross-examined Mosley about the notebook and objecte d to its admission. On \ndirect appeal to the supreme court, Myers challenged the admiss ion of the notebook into \nevidence and alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during t he guilt phase of the trial.  \nThe issue regarding the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook w as cognizable and could \nhave been raised on direct appeal to the supreme court and is t herefore barred by res \njudicata.  See State v. Dickason, 5th Dist. Stark Case No. 1996CA00423, 1997 Ohio App. \nLEXIS 3241 (July 7, 1997).  The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 17. Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 39 - \n{\u00b6 115} Myers' sixth assignment of error is overruled. \n4.  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel during the Penalty Phase \n{\u00b6 116} Assignment of Error No. 5:   \n{\u00b6 117} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND \nAN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER \nR.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS THAT HIS TRIAL COUNS EL \nRENDERED CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFICIENT PERFORMANCE IN THE SENTENCING \nPHASE OF HIS CAPITAL TRIAL (GRO UNDS 19-45, 49), WITHOUT ALLOWIN G \nDISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING, AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF ON \nTHESE MERITORIOUS IAC CLAIMS. \n{\u00b6 118} Myers argues that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 19 \nthrough 45, all of which allege several instances of ineffective assistance of counsel during \nthe penalty phase of the trial.  Specifically, Myers argues that counsel was ineffective during \nthe penalty phase of the trial because he failed to (1) conduct  a competent mitigation \ninvestigation and consult with and hire a competent mitigation specialist in a timely fashion, \n(2) present the testimony of expert witnesses regarding Myers' youth and psychological \nhistory, (3) present expert testimony regarding the science on adolescent brain \ndevelopment, and (4) present the testimony of numerous witnesse s who would have \ntestified about Myers' background, family history, mental healt h, education, and \nrelationships with others.  Myers argues that defense counsel's primary mitigation strategy \nwas that Myers should not receive a punishment harsher than the  life sentence without \nparole imposed on Mosley.  Myers avers that had defense counsel 's focus been broader \nand include the testimony of experts and other witnesses, he wo uld not have been \nsentenced to death. \n{\u00b6 119} The trial court dismissed the grounds for relief, finding that (1) the failure to Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 40 - \ncall witnesses is trial strategy that does not raise to a const itutional violation, (2) a PCR \npetition is not a vehicle to substitute another trial strategy for one that failed, (3) defense \ncounsel did argue Myers' youth in mitigation and the trial court instructed the jury that youth \nwas a mitigating factor, and (4) defense counsel's failure to p resent the testimony of an \nexpert in adolescent brain development, and his decision to con sult with but not call a \npsychology expert to the stand and instead rely on arguing that Myers' sentence should not \nbe harsher than that of Mosley was trial strategy.   \n{\u00b6 120} Myers' foregoing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel du ring the \npenalty phase of the trial were also the basis for his motions for discovery and why he \nargues the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery under his second and third \nassignments of error.  As pertinent here, the trial court denie d the discovery motions as \nfollows:   \nThis is not a case where the defense did not seek the assistance \nof an investigator, mitigation expert and mental health expert.   \nClearly, a decision by trial counsel not to even have these \nvaluable tools available to him while defending a capital murder \ncase can never be a tactical, strategic decision.  However, the  \ndecision of whether or not to use these tools or how to use them, \nas a matter of strategy or in the context of marshalling \nresources, is the cornerstone in building a proper legal defense. \n \nPetitioner has made allegations that his attorneys and mitigation \nspecialist were ineffective and did not properly investigate an d \nprepare a defense.  In support of this claim, he has provided \naffidavits and documentary evidence concerning their \nperformance.  However, petitioner has made no specific \nrepresentation about what he expects to learn in a deposition of \n[lead defense counsel, co-counsel and/or the mitigation \nspecialist].  Both [lead counsel and the mitigation specialist]  \nprovided affidavits explaining what they knew, what they did, \nand why they did it.  The fact that an attorney may look back in \na deposition or otherwise, with 20/20 hindsight, and question or \nrevisit his trial strategy after the jury has rendered its verdict \nprovides no real insight to the Court.  Further, the fact that [lead \ncounsel] may have limited his mitigation strategy to what he \nbelieved to be the strongest and most compelling arguments \ndoes not support conducting discovery on this issue.  * * *  Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 41 - \n \nIn short, the petitioner has not established good cause to \nconduct discovery with respect to the defense team, including \nthe attorneys. \n{\u00b6 121} During the penalty phase of the trial, defense counsel presente d the \ntestimony of Myers' father, mother, and younger brother Bryce.  All three testified about \nMyers' family history and background, including the breakup of the family and the parents' \ndivorce following the mother's affair with a coworker and resultant pregnancy.  They further \ntestified about Myers' close bond with his siblings and how he was a very good mediator \nand mentor for his stepsiblings.  Myers' mother testified that as a child, Myers tested gifted \nin several areas, was a talented piano player, and had designed a business card for himself \nin sixth grade.  However, she started seeing changes in Myers w hen he was 14 years old.  \nAfter she discovered Myers had been cutting himself and shootin g his legs with a pellet \ngun, he was hospitalized for five days at Kettering Hospital Youth Services.  Myers' mother \ntestified that Myers was initially diagnosed with bipolar disor der and upon discharge, was \nprescribed medications and weekly therapy with a psychologist.  However, Myers \ndiscontinued both when he began living with his father later th at year.  Defense counsel \nintroduced photographs of Myers and his family, the business ca rd he had designed for \nhimself, his letters to his family during his incarceration, the records of his hospitalization at \nKettering Hospital, and his gifted test results when he was in fifth grade.  The Kettering \nHospital records show that Myers was hospitalized as a result of taking 20 Benadryl tablets \nand that he was initially diagnosed with \"depressive disorder not otherwise specified versus \nbipolar disorder most recent depressed; substance induced mood disorder; over-the-\ncounter drug abuse.\"  Myers was ultimately diagnosed with \"depr essive disorder, not \notherwise specified.  Rule out bipolar disorder.\"  \n{\u00b6 122} Myers made an unsworn statement, telling the jury that he was s orry \"this Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 42 - \nhappened\" and wished he \"could go back in time and stop this be fore it even happened,\" \nand that the death penalty would not hurt him and would only cause more pain and suffering \nto innocent people such as his parents and siblings.  Myers asked the jury to spare his life \nand give him a chance to become a better person.   \n{\u00b6 123} In closing argument, defense counsel stressed Myers' good quali ties and \nthe positive influence he could have in his siblings' lives, ac knowledged there had been \n\"bumps in the road,\" such as issues with Myers' family, \"his me ntal health a little bit,\" and \nhis cutting and shooting himself with the pellet gun, and asked  the jury to consider Myers' \nage, the love of his family, and the Kettering Hospital records .  Overall, defense counsel \nfocused on Mosley's plea agreement and resulting life sentence,  telling the jury that it was \nthe most important mitigating factor in the case and that Myers  should not be punished \nmore than Mosley who was the one who actually killed Back.  \n{\u00b6 124} Grounds 22 through 43 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed \nto present or \"fully\" present the testimony of numerous witnesses who would have testified \nabout Myers' background, family history, mental health, educati on, and relationships with \nothers.  In support of this claim, Myers attached 22 affidavits  from relatives, friends, \nacquaintances, and former educators to his PCR petition.  Of th ose witnesses, only three \ntestified at the penalty phase, to wit, Myers' parents and his brother Bryce.   \n{\u00b6 125} It is well established that a \"defense decision to call or not call a mitigation \nwitness is a matter of trial strategy.  * * * Debatable trial t actics generally do not constitute \nineffective assistance of counsel.\"  Graham, 2020-Ohio-6700 at \u00b6 139.  The Ohio Supreme \nCourt has further stated that trial counsel is not ineffective for failing to call all available \nfamily members.  State v. McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 399, 1997-Ohio-335.  Furthermore, \n\"[a]dditional mitigating evidence that is 'merely cumulative' o f that already presented does \nnot undermine the results of sentencing.\"  State v. Herring, 142 Ohio St.3d 165, 2014-Ohio-Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 43 - \n5228, \u00b6 117.  Instead, \"the new evidence * * * must differ in a substantial way \u2013 in strength \nand subject matter \u2013 from the evidence actually presented at sentencing.\"  Id. \n{\u00b6 126} Upon reviewing the witnesses' affidavits, we find that the tria l court did not \nerr in dismissing Grounds 22 through 43.  Although the 19 indiv iduals who did not testify \nmay have provided a more disinterested account of Myers' family, their testimony to a large \nextent was cumulative to and did not differ in substantial way from the testimony of Myers' \nparents and his brother Bryce.  See State v. Twyford , 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 98-JE-56, \n2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 1443 (Mar. 19, 2001).  Likewise, the affidavits of Myers' parents and \nbrother did not differ in substantial way from their testimony at the penalty phase. \n{\u00b6 127} Grounds 19 and 20 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to \nconsult with and hire a competent mitigation specialist in a timely fashion.   \n{\u00b6 128} In March 2014, lead defense counsel moved to employ his wife, a  licensed \nattorney with experience defending capital cases, as the mitigation specialist.  The trial court \nbalked at the request due to the family relationship and denied  the motion.  Lead counsel \ndid not seek assistance from another mitigation specialist until he contacted the Ohio Public \nDefender's Office in May 2014.  However, the public defender's office did not have the \nresources to provide a mitigation specialist.  Unable to find a nother mitigation specialist, \nlead counsel moved the trial court to reconsider its previous d enial.  The trial court held a \nhearing on the motion for reconsideration on June 4, 2014.  The reafter, the trial court \nappointed lead counsel's wife as the mitigation specialist.  Th e trial court's decision noted \nthat counsel's wife had \"already undertaken some mitigation wor k in the case, including \nmeeting with the family of the Defendant[.]\"   \n{\u00b6 129} The jury found Myers guilty on all counts and specifications on  October 2, \n2014.  The penalty phase was held on October 6, 2014.  In suppo rt of his PCR petition, \nMyers attached the affidavits of lead counsel and the mitigatio n specialist.  Both affidavits Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 44 - \nstate that during the three-day weekend between the jury verdic t and the penalty phase, \nlead counsel and the mitigation specialist met with and interviewed Myers' mother and two \nof his siblings at the mother's home.  That same weekend, they also met with and \ninterviewed Myers' father and stepmother at their home.  The af fidavits of Myers' parents \nand stepmother corroborated that the interviews took place that  weekend.  Myers' \nstepmother stated the interview was short.  Myers' mother state d that her interview lasted \nabout one hour and one half and that she gave photographs to th e mitigation specialist at \nanother time and \"spent another hour to an hour and a half with her.\" \n{\u00b6 130} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that capital defendants \"[do] n ot have a \nconstitutional right to a mitigation specialist or a right to a n effective one.\"  Herring, 2014-\nOhio-5228 at \u00b6 113, citing McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d at 399 (no requirement for counsel to \nhire mitigation specialist in capital case); Drummond, 2006-Ohio-7078 at \u00b6 69 (a mitigation \nspecialist is not a requirement for effective assistance of counsel).  The trial court noted that \nthe mitigation specialist \"was a trained attorney who has handled a number of capital cases \nand therefore has the ability to determine what evidence is effective in the [penalty] phase.\"  \nThe trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 19 and 20.   \n{\u00b6 131} Grounds 21, 44, and 45 generally challenge counsel's failure to  conduct a \ncomprehensive investigation into Myers' background and counsel' s failure to present \neffective mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of the trial.  Specifically, Grounds 21, \n44, and 45 allege that counsel was ineffective because he faile d to present the expert \ntestimony of clinical forensic psychologist Dr. Bobbie Hopes, f ailed to consult with and \npresent an expert in adolescent brain development, and failed t o effectively present youth \nas a mitigation factor.   \n{\u00b6 132} In support of his PCR petition, Myers submitted affidavits and reports from \nseveral experts related to adolescent brain development and exp ressing opinions based Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 45 - \nupon their evaluation of Myers and his mental health and social  records.  The evidence \nsubmitted by Myers generally reflects that individuals of his a ge are prone to risk taking, \npeer influence, and impulsivity more akin to adolescents than a dults.  Myers argues that \nthis evidence established substantive grounds for relief and he  is therefore entitled to \ndiscovery and an evidentiary hearing on his PCR petition.  The state argues that the \nevidence was not presented as a matter of trial strategy becaus e it was in conflict with \ndefense counsel's mitigation strategy to emphasize Myers' good qualities and was \ncumulative to evidence presented at the penalty phase.    \n{\u00b6 133} In his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, Myers argued in effective \nassistance of counsel in the penalty phase for failure to prese nt any expert testimony.  \nSpecifically, Myers asserted that defense counsel \"should have adduced expert testimony \nto explain the meaning of his self-harming behavior in his earl y teens and how brain \ndevelopment affects the decision-making of young people.\"  Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 \n198.  The supreme court rejected Myers' claim on the ground tha t \"nothing in the record \nshows what such expert would have said in the penalty phase[.]  T h u s ,  M y e r s  h a s  n o t  \ndemonstrated prejudice from missing such testimony.\"  Id.  The supreme court further \nfound, \"At trial, the defense requested and received funds to hire a consulting psychologist.  \nThe psychologist the defense chose was appointed, but the record does not show what she \ntold Myers's counsel regarding her conclusions.  Hence, there i s nothing to show deficient \nperformance by counsel.\"  Id. at \u00b6 199.  \n{\u00b6 134} In a capital case, \"[d]efense counsel has a duty to investigate  the \ncircumstances of his client's case and explore all matters relevant to the merits of the case \nand the penalty, including the defendant's background, educatio n, employment record, \nmental and emotional stability, and family relationships.\"  State v. Pickens, 141 Ohio St.3d \n462, 2014-Ohio-5445, \u00b6 219.  Defense counsel has a duty to make  reasonable Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 46 - \ninvestigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes part icular investigations \nunnecessary.  State v. Johnson , 24 Ohio St.3d 87, 89 (1986).  Counsel's \"investigations \ninto mitigating evidence 'should comprise efforts to discover a ll reasonably available \nmitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced \nby the prosecutor.'\"  Wiggins v. Smith , 539 U.S. 510, 524, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (2003), citing \nAmerican Bar Association, ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of \nCounsel in Death Penalty Cases , Section 11.4.1(C), 93 (1989).  Given the severity of the \npotential sentence and the reality that the life of a capital d efendant is at stake, it is only \nafter a full investigation of all the mitigating circumstances that counsel can make an \ninformed, tactical decision about which information would be mo st helpful to the client's \ncase.  Johnson at 90.  \"Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts \nrelevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable[.]  However, a failure to \ninvestigate, especially as to key evidence, must be supported by a reasoned and deliberate \ndetermination that investigation was not warranted.\"  O'Hara v. Wigginton, 24 F.3d 823, 828 \n(6th Cir.1994).  \"An attorney's failure to reasonably investigate the defendant's background \nand present mitigating evidence to the jury at sentencing can c onstitute ineffective \nassistance of counsel.\"  Pickens at \u00b6 219.  \n{\u00b6 135} Myers was examined by Dr. Barzman for purposes of the PCR petition and \nhis report is attached to the petition.  Myers was also examine d by Dr. Daniel Davis, a \nforensic psychologist, and his report is attached to the PCR pe tition.  In his report, Dr. \nBarzman opined that Myers' mental health history, which include d significant depressive \nand manic symptoms, was consistent with bipolar disorder which is associated with \nincreased impulsivity and a focus on immediate gratification.   \n{\u00b6 136} In his report, Dr. Davis stated that the symptoms Myers experienced in high \nschool were associated with bipolar disorder and that he was no t fully neurologically Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 47 - \ndeveloped at the time of his crimes and sentencing.  Dr. Davis further stated that the trial \ncourt and jury were deprived of pertinent psychological informa tion specific to Myers and \ngeneral psychological research specific to youthful and capital  offenders, evidence that \nwould have been extremely helpful to understand Myers' actions and demeanor.  In \nparticular, Dr. Davis noted that while Myers' youth was clearly  evident at trial, the crimes \ntook place when Myers was still developing neurologically and p sychologically, however \n\"there was no specific testimony as to the considerable scienti fic literature concerning \nneurological development in late adolescents and young adults.\"   Dr. Davis also noted \nMyers' apparent lack of remorse for his crimes at sentencing bu t stated that scientific \nliterature shows that an apparent lack of remorse is not indica tive of anything atypical in \nadolescent males and is typically mistaken as one of the \"signs  of the development of a \npsychopathic personality when they are, in fact, transient feat ures of adolescent \ndevelopment.\"  Dr. Davis' report continued, \nFurther, abused and neglected children, such as Austin \ndemonstrate a limited range of emotions as a way to cope with \nvery stressful home environments.  These research findings \napply specifically to Austin.  He was raised in a highly neglectful \nenvironment.  He was at the time of his sentence still in the \ncommonly accepted development stage of late adolescence.  \nNeither the trial court nor jury had this critically important \nresearch presented to them[.]     \n{\u00b6 137} In support of his PCR petition, Myers also submitted the affidavits of his lead \ndefense counsel and Dr. Hopes.  Lead counsel's affidavit detail s what he did and did not \ndo.  As pertinent here, lead counsel stated he believed \"that everyone close to the process \nthought that [Myers] would receive a life sentence regardless of the trial phase result, based \nupon Mosley's plea deal having been the principal offender in t he aggravated murder of \nJustin Back.\"  Counsel's affidavit further stated, \nI did not consider requesting funding for, or hiring, a \nyouth/adolescent expert to help explain issues, including Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 48 - \nyouth/adolescent brain development, to the jury. \n \nEven though we did retain a psychologist, Dr. Bobbie Hopes, for \nmitigation, Dr. Hopes told me that she would not be able to \nprovide anything for the jury except for a timeline of Austin's life, \nsomething which Dr. Hopes believed Austin's mother could \nprovide and that it would be better if it came from her.  Given \nher statements to me, I was concerned that if Dr Hopes \npresented this information to the jury, it would just be seen as \n\"psychobabble.\" \n \nWhen Austin's mother * * * did not effectively provide such a \ntimeline as I had anticipated and that [the mitigation specialist] \nand I had worked with her on, I did not think to then call Dr. \nBobbie Hopes to the stand to testify.  \n{\u00b6 138} Lead counsel's averments were contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affida v it.  Dr. \nHopes evaluated Myers three times in August 2014, for a total of six hours, for purposes of \ndeath penalty mitigation.  Dr. Hopes averred that she provided lead counsel with a report in \nwhich she expressed the opinion that Myers' age, his history of  childhood physical abuse, \nincluding his history of being diagnosed and treated for depres sion, and his history of self-\nmutilation were mitigation factors.  Following Myers' conviction for aggravated murder, lead \ncounsel called Dr. Hopes and told her he did not intend to use her as a mitigation expert.  \nDr. Hopes suggested that Myers' age and relevant research on ad olescent brain \ndevelopment were strong mitigation factors but was told by lead  counsel that information \nabout youth had come out during jury selection.  Dr. Hopes aver red that she was willing \nand prepared to testify about age and adolescent brain development research.  Dr. Hopes \nfurther averred that she never advised lead counsel that she co uld only present a timeline \nof Myers' life and that she never discussed a timeline with counsel. \n{\u00b6 139} As stated above, \"[i]n a petition for post-conviction relief, w hich asserts \nineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner bears the initial burden to submit evidentiary \ndocuments containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent \ncounsel and that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffe ctiveness.\"  Jackson, 64 Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 49 - \nOhio St.2d 107 at syllabus.  In order to secure an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition \nasserting ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner need not prove counsel rendered \nineffective assistance.  Rather, the PCR petition only needs to set forth sufficient operative \nfacts to establish substantive grounds for relief.   \n{\u00b6 140} Upon reviewing the reports of Drs. Barzman and Davis and the affidavits of \nDr. Hopes and lead defense counsel, we find that Myers has prov ided evidentiary \ndocuments setting forth sufficient operative facts to warrant a n evidentiary hearing on his \nPCR petition regarding his claim that counsel was ineffective f or failing to present expert \ntestimony at the penalty phase of the trial. \n{\u00b6 141} Defense counsel has the affirmative duty to investigate mitigating evidence.  \nState v. Herring , 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08-MA-213, 2011-Ohio-662, \u00b6 55.  Defen se \ncounsel \"can make the decision to forego the presentation of evidence, but only after a full \ninvestigation.\"  Id.  It is only after a full investigation of all the mitigating circumstances that \ncounsel can make an informed, tactical decision about which inf ormation would be most \nhelpful to their client's case.  Johnson, 24 Ohio St.3d at 89.  \n{\u00b6 142} Lead counsel's averment that he did not consider requesting funding for, or \nhiring, a youth/adolescent expert to explain issues regarding adolescent brain development \nto the jury fails to indicate counsel's motivation and instead suggests that counsel's failure \nto present such expert testimony was not the product of an informed, tactical decision.  That \nis, counsel's averment shows he did not engage into a reasoned and careful consideration \nof such expert testimony before ultimately rejecting it.  The s ame can be said about \ncounsel's failure to have Dr. Hopes testify as an expert witness at the penalty phase.  While \ncounsel averred in his affidavit that Dr. Hopes did not testify because she could only provide \na timeline of Myers' life, this averment was explicitly contrad icted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit.  \nThere is little evidence documenting the extent of defense coun sel's reasoning for his Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 50 - \ninvestigation and decision making regarding expert testimony mitigation evidence.   \n{\u00b6 143} The state argues that mitigation evidence regarding Myers' dysf unctional \nfamily, self-mutilation, and mental health issues such as child hood depression and bipolar \ndisorder, was presented through the testimony of his mother at the penalty phase, and thus, \nmuch of the psychological testimony that Drs. Hopes, Barzman, a nd Davis could have \npresented would have been cumulative.  However, Myers' mother's  testimony was much \nmore limited on the issue.  Myers' mother testified that the deterioration of her marriage did \nnot seem to affect Myers, that she had not noticed Myers' self- mutilation, and that she \nbelieved Kettering Hospital initially diagnosed Myers with bipo lar disorder.  There was no \ntestimony regarding Myers' childhood depression.  Furthermore, Myers' mother is not \nqualified to provide the expert testimony necessary to contextualize the factors above.  \n{\u00b6 144} The state next argues that presenting this expert testimony at the penalty \nphase would have been inconsistent with defense counsel's mitigation theory emphasizing \nMyers' good qualities and the positive influence he could have in his siblings' lives.  Thus, \nthe state asserts, defense counsel's decision not to present su ch testimony was trial \nstrategy which should not be second-guessed.   \n{\u00b6 145} However, lead counsel's affidavit does not advance this as the reason he \ndid not present Dr. Hopes' expert testimony at the penalty phase.  Lead counsel avers only \nthat he did not call Dr. Hopes as a witness because she could o nly provide a timeline of \nMyers' life, an averment explicitly contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit.  Whether it was \ndefense counsel's mitigation strategy to emphasize Myers' quali ties, which counsel's \naffidavit does not suggest, it is not apparent why such strategy excludes a parallel strategy \nto contextualize Myers' youth in light of the science on adoles cent brain development.  As \nher affidavit clearly indicates, Dr. Hopes was prepared and ava ilable to testify about these \nissues and advised lead counsel on the eve of the penalty phase  that Myers' age and Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 51 - \nrelevant research on adolescent brain development were strong m itigation factors.  And \nwhile a decision by defense counsel to present only positive mitigation can be a sound trial \nstrategy, counsel's decision to pursue a positive-mitigation th eory can properly be made \nonly after counsel has conducted a full mitigation investigatio n.  Herring, 2014-Ohio-5228 \nat \u00b6 90.   \n{\u00b6 146} The state further asserts that defense counsel did argue that M yers was \nonly 19 years old at the time of the crimes.  Counsel did brief ly ask the jury to take Myers' \nage into consideration as a mitigation factor.  However, counse l never developed the \nsignificance of Myer's youth as a mitigating factor. \n{\u00b6 147} In light of the foregoing, we find that the trial court erred i n summarily \ndismissing Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing.  The \ntrial court further erred in finding that Myers did not establi sh good cause to conduct \ndiscovery regarding his claim counsel was ineffective at the pe nalty phase in failing to \npresent expert testimony on adolescent brain development in con junction with Myers' age \nand mental health issues.  Myers' claims are \"neither patently frivolous nor palpably \nincredible\" and \"the discovery he requests\" in the form of depo sitions of the defense team \nis \"limited and reasonably calculated to lead to evidence in support of his claim[.]\"  Hill, 2007 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 71975 at *31-32; Johnson v. Bobby, S.D.Ohio No. 2:08-cv-55, 2010 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 103351 (Sept. 30, 2010); Stallings v. Bradshaw , N.D.Ohio No. 5:05CV0722, \n2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97540 (Feb. 28, 2006). \n{\u00b6 148} We therefore remand this case for the trial court to conduct an  evidentiary \nhearing on Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition which all ege ineffective assistance \nof counsel at the penalty phase for failing to present expert t estimony on adolescent brain \ndevelopment in conjunction with Myers' age and mental health is sues.  The advantages \nthat an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition based on ineffect ive assistance of counsel Warren CA2019-07-074 \n \n - 52 - \ncan provide a trial judge are well established:  \nThe trial judge can delve into the motivation or reasoning of trial \ncounsel through trial counsel's testimony. The court can hear \nthe testimony of witnesses that were never called to testify at \nthe original trial, and can determine the worth of their testimony \nas well as the witnesses' credibility. The trial judge can ask what \nthe counsel knew, when he knew it, and whether a mistake was \nnot strategic, but was instead careless. As here, in a \npostconviction hearing, a judge can hear testimony about what \nevidence was made available to trial counsel and when it was \nmade available.  A trial court in a postconviction proceeding thus \nplays a unique role in the consideration of ineffective assistance \nof counsel claims. It is the only court that actually hears \ntestimony on that issue. \nState v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, \u00b6 54. \n{\u00b6 149} Myers' fifth assignment of error is sustained.  To the extent n oted above, \nMyers' second and third assignments of error are sustained in part. \n5.  Cumulative Errors \n{\u00b6 150} Assignment of Error No. 10:   \n{\u00b6 151} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND \nAN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER \nR.C. 2953.21(C), MYERS' CLAIM OF CUMULATIVE ERROR (GROUND 60), WITHOUT \nALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT \nRELIEF. \n{\u00b6 152} Myers argues the trial court erred in dismissing Ground 60 whic h alleges \ncumulative errors.  We include under this assignment of error M yers' claims that the trial \ncourt erred in dismissing Grounds 18 and 49, which allege cumul ative effect of the denial \nof effective assistance of counsel during the guilt and penalty phases of the trial (as initially \nargued in the fifth and sixth assignments of error).

State v. Kirkland, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, \u00b6 140.  Given \nour resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth assignments o f error, this assignment of \nerror is moot.  See State v.

CONCLUSION \n{\u00b6 153} In light of our resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth a ssignments of \nerror, the trial court's judgments denying Myers' motions for discovery and his PCR petition \nregarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to present expert testimony \nat the penalty phase of the trial are reversed and the matter i s remanded for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion.  Specifically, on remand, the trial court shall permit \ndiscovery, conduct an evidentiary hearing, and rule on Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR \npetition.   \n{\u00b6 154} Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. \n \n HENDRICKSON, P.J.,  and S.

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b6 2 On January 27, 2014, Myers and codefendant, Timothy Mosley, began to plot burglarizing the home of a known drug dealer or the home of Justin Back, Myers\u2019 childhood friend. Mark Cates, Back's stepfather, purportedly had a safe containing a firearm and money. Ultimately, Myers and Mosley chose to burglarize the Cates' home. The two men drove to the Cates' home. Upon knocking, they were surprised when Back answered the door. The two men briefly visited with Back and then left. Upon leaving the Cates' home, Myers suggested they return to the home, kill Back, and steal the contents of the safe. Myers and Mosley began to plan Back's murder.\n\n\u00b6 3 They initially planned to kill Back by injecting him with cold medicine. In furtherance of their plan, they attempted to purchase cold medicine and a bottle of poisonous \"bug wash\"; however, Myers' credit card was declined. Later that day, Myers and Mosley returned to the Cates' home and watched a movie with Back. When Cates came home from work, he joined them in watching the movie for a short time until he and Back had to leave for an appointment with a Navy recruiter. Myers and Mosley then left the house.\n\n\u00b6 4 Myers and Mosley continued to discuss how to murder Back and burglarize the Cates' home. As they discussed their plans, Mosley wrote down their ideas in a small notebook. The two men hatched a scheme to strangle Back with a wire, take the safe, and make it look as though Back had stolen the safe and run away from home. The two men further planned to dump Back's body in a remote wooded area. Myers and Mosley purchased galvanized steel cable and two metal rope cleats to fashion a garrote. The garrote was put together by their friend Logan Zennie.\n\n\u00b6 5 The next morning, January 28, 2014, Myers and Mosley bought ammonia, septic-tank cleaner, and rubber gloves. They believed the septic enzymes would help to\ndecompose the body in cold weather. Around 1:00 p.m., the two men went to the Cates' home. Mosley was carrying the garrote as well as a five- or six-inch pocketknife. The plan was for Myers to distract Back while Mosley came up behind him. Myers would hold Back down while Mosley would choke him to death with the garrote. After the two men arrived at the Cates' home, Back offered them a drink which Myers accepted. As Back was reaching into the refrigerator, Mosley came up behind him and tried to pull the garrote around his throat. However, the garrote only looped around Back's chin. Mosley panicked and as Myers restrained Back, Mosley repeatedly stabbed him with his knife. As Back begged for his life, Myers simply told him it would be over soon.\n\nAfter the murder, Myers and Mosley wrapped Back's body in a blanket, cleaned up the crime scene, and found the safe. Myers also found a handgun belonging to Cates, which he loaded. The two men shoved Back's body into the trunk of Mosley's car and left the house with the safe and various other stolen items. They stopped at Mosley's home where they cleaned up and changed clothes. They eventually dumped Back's body behind a log in a field in Preble County. Myers poured ammonia and septic enzymes onto Back's body. Myers then shot the body twice with the stolen handgun before it jammed. Myers and Mosley were later apprehended; Back's body was discovered on January 29, 2014. An autopsy determined that Back had died of multiple stab wounds. At the time of the murder, Myers and Mosley were both 19 years old.\n\nMyers was indicted in February 2014 on one count of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design and one count of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B). Both counts were accompanied by three death-penalty specifications. Myers was further indicted for aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, grand theft of a firearm, and abuse of a corpse, all with an accompanying firearm specification, and kidnapping, tampering with evidence, and safecracking. Mosley was indicted on similar charges.\nHowever, a week before Myers' jury trial, Mosley reached a plea agreement in which he agreed to testify against Myers. Mosley pled guilty to all charges in exchange for the dismissal of the death-penalty specifications; he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\n\u00b6 8 The guilt phase of Myers' jury trial commenced on September 22, 2014. On October 2, 2014, the jury found Myers guilty on all counts and specifications. The two aggravated-murder counts were merged for purposes of sentencing; the state elected to proceed on the prior-calculation-and-design aggravated murder count with the aggravated-robbery specification.\n\n\u00b6 9 The penalty phase of the jury trial was held on October 6, 2014. Myers presented the testimony of his parents and a sibling and made an unsworn statement by way of mitigation. Myers had no prior criminal history or delinquency adjudications. The jury recommended a death sentence. On October 16, 2014, the trial court sentenced Myers to death and imposed prison sentences on the noncapital counts. Myers' conviction and death sentence were subsequently upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court. State v. Myers, 154 Ohio St.3d 405, 2018-Ohio-1903.\n\n\u00b6 10 On November 10, 2016, while his appeal was pending before the supreme court, Myers filed a petition for postconviction relief (\"PCR petition\"), raising 60 grounds for relief. The PCR petition challenged the constitutionality of the death penalty and the Ohio statutes governing its imposition, argued that Myers was denied the effective assistance of counsel during both the guilt and penalty phases of the trial, and alleged violation of Myers' due process rights. On November 18, 2016, Myers moved for leave to conduct discovery in support of his PCR petition. In 2017, the state filed an answer to the PCR petition, then moved for summary judgment. In January 2018, the trial court issued a scheduling order which provided that Myers could file a supplemental motion for discovery by March 1, 2018,\nand that the state's summary judgment motion would be held in abeyance pending resolution of Myers' discovery motion.\n\n\u00b6 11 On March 1, 2018, Myers filed a supplemental motion for discovery, arguing he was entitled to conduct discovery in support of his PCR petition pursuant to newly-amended R.C. 2953.21, which became effective on April 6, 2017. The amended statute makes substantial changes regarding PCR petitions in death-penalty cases, and in particular, allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery in aid of their PCR petition if good cause is shown. State v. Ketterer, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2016-08-166, 2017-Ohio-4117, \u00b6 46.\n\n\u00b6 12 On July 3, 2018, the trial court denied Myers' discovery motions. The trial court found that amended R.C. 2953.21 was not applicable in the case at bar because the statute did not explicitly state it was retroactive. Alternatively, the trial court found that even if the statutory amendment was applied retroactively, Myers was not entitled to discovery as he had not demonstrated \"good cause.\"\n\n\u00b6 13 On November 26, 2018, Myers filed a memorandum opposing the state's motion for summary judgment; the memorandum included 12 additional documents consisting of affidavits, transcripts, and documentary evidence. Myers' memorandum and supplemental appendix triggered additional pleadings from the parties. Ultimately, the trial court never ruled upon the state's summary judgment motion. Instead, on June 27, 2019, the trial court denied Myers' PCR petition without a hearing. The trial court found that Myers' claims were either barred by res judicata or failed to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, and therefore, \"no evidentiary hearing [was] required.\"\n\n\u00b6 14 Myers now appeals the trial court's denial of his PCR petition and discovery motions, raising 11 assignments of error.\nII. ANALYSIS\n\nA. Standards of Review for Postconviction Relief Petitions\n\n{\u00b6 15} A postconviction proceeding is a collateral civil attack on a criminal judgment, not an appeal of a criminal conviction. State v. Dillingham, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2012-02-037 and CA2012-02-042, 2012-Ohio-5841, \u00b6 8. To prevail on a PCR petition, the petitioner must establish a violation of his constitutional rights that renders the judgment of conviction void or voidable. R.C. 2953.21. A PCR petition does not provide a petitioner a second opportunity to litigate his or her conviction, nor is the petitioner automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing. State v. Rose, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-03-050, 2012-Ohio-5957, \u00b6 16. A trial court properly denies a PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing if the supporting affidavits, the documentary evidence, the files, and the records of the case do not demonstrate that the petitioner set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief. State v. Blankenburg, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-04-088, 2012-Ohio-6175, \u00b6 9; R.C. 2953.21.\n\n{\u00b6 16} \"It is well established that a trial court may dismiss a postconviction relief petition on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata.\" State v. Davis, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-12-258, 2013-Ohio-3878, \u00b6 30. Under res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment or conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment. State v. Wagers, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2011-08-007, 2012-Ohio-2258, \u00b6 10, citing State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 1996-Ohio-337, syllabus.\n\n{\u00b6 17} The presentation of competent, relevant, and material evidence outside the record may defeat the application of res judicata. State v. Lawson, 103 Ohio App.3d 307,\n315 (12th Dist.1995). The evidence submitted with the petition cannot be merely cumulative of or alternative to evidence presented at trial. *State v. Jackson*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104132, 2017-Ohio-2651, \u00b6 16. To overcome the res judicata bar, evidence outside the record must demonstrate that the petitioner could not have appealed the constitutional claim based upon information in the original record. *State v. Piesciuk*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-01-011, 2013-Ohio-3879, \u00b6 18. If evidence outside the record is \"'marginally significant and does not advance the petitioner's claim beyond a mere hypothesis and a desire for further discovery,' res judicata still applies to the claim.\" *State v. Cowans*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA98-10-090, 1999 Ohio App. LEXIS 4157, *8-9 (Sept. 7, 1999).\n\n{\u00b6 18} \"In reviewing an appeal of postconviction relief proceedings, this court applies an abuse of discretion standard.\" *State v. Snead*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2014-01-014, 2014-Ohio-2895, \u00b6 16. \"The term 'abuse of discretion' connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court's attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\" *State v. Thornton*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-09-063, 2013-Ohio-2394, \u00b6 34; *State v. Hancock*, 108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, \u00b6 130. The trial court does not abuse its discretion in dismissing a PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing if (1) the petitioner fails to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, or (2) the operation of res judicata prohibits the claims made in the petition. *State v. Maxwell*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107758, 2020-Ohio-3027, \u00b6 25.\n\n{\u00b6 19} With these principles and standards in mind, we now address Myers' assignments of error together and out of order where appropriate.\n\n**B. Summary Dismissal of Myers' PCR Petition**\n\n{\u00b6 20} Assignment of Error No. 1:\n\n{\u00b6 21} THE TRIAL COURT DENIED MYERS' RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS, ACCESS TO THE OHIO COURTS, AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, AND\nVIOLATED R.C. \u00a7 2953.21, WHEN IT TREATED THE STATE'S POST-ANSWER \"MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\" AS A MOTION SEEKING SUMMARILY DISMISSAL (sic) UNDER R.C. \u00a7 2953.21(C) [NOW (D)], AND FAILED TO APPLY THE REQUISITE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARDS IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING EVERY CLAIM SET FORTH IN MYERS' PCR PETITION.\n\n\u00b6 22 This assignment of error challenges the trial court's failure to rule upon the state's summary judgment motion and the court's election instead to grant a summary dismissal of Myers' PCR petition. Specifically, Myers argues that the trial court erred in granting a summary dismissal of his PCR petition where there was a pending, fully briefed motion for summary judgment. Myers asserts that because the state filed an answer to the PCR petition and a motion for summary judgment and failed to move for dismissal of the petition under R.C. 2953.21(D), the trial court was required to apply the standard set forth in R.C. 2953.21(E) and was precluded from summarily dismissing the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D).\u00b9\n\n\u00b6 23 R.C. 2953.21 provides three methods for adjudicating a PCR petition: (1) \"summary dismissal\" under R.C. 2953.21(D) and State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 1999-Ohio-102, paragraph two of the syllabus; (2) \"summary judgment\" under R.C. 2953.21(E); and (3) an \"evidentiary hearing\" under R.C. 2953.21(F). State v. Blankenburg, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-11-197, 2014-Ohio-4621, \u00b6 23.\n\n\u00b6 24 Under R.C. 2953.21(E), either party may move for summary judgment on the issues raised. In ruling on a summary judgment motion in proceedings involving a PCR petition, the trial court must use the same standards set forth in Civ.R. 56(C), i.e., a party is\n\n\u00b9. As stated earlier, R.C. 2953.21 was amended, effective April 6, 2017, and some of its provisions were renumbered. As pertinent here, former R.C. 2953.21(C), (D), and (E) were renumbered 2953.21(D), (E), and (F). We note that for purposes of this assignment of error, the language of the applicable renumbered statutory provisions is identical to the language of their pre-amendment counterparts. We therefore elect to apply the current version of R.C. 2953.21.\nentitled to summary judgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. *State v. Francis*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-05-078, 2014-Ohio-443, \u00b6 11. Summary judgment in postconviction proceedings is appropriate only if the right to summary judgment appears on the face of the record. R.C. 2953.21(E); *Id.*\n\n\u00b6 25 Under R.C. 2953.21(D), \"a trial court properly denies a defendant's petition for postconviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing where the petition, the supporting affidavits, the documentary evidence, the files, and the records do not demonstrate that petitioner set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.\" *Calhoun*, 86 Ohio St.3d 279 at paragraph two of the syllabus; *Francis* at \u00b6 12.\n\n\u00b6 26 We find that the trial court did not err in granting a summary dismissal of Myers' PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D) notwithstanding the state's motion for summary judgment and its failure to move for dismissal of the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D). We have held that R.C. 2953.21(D) \"explicitly requires the trial court to look beyond the petition and examine the record in order to determine whether there are substantive grounds for relief. The trial court must independently review the record and address the substance of a petitioner's claims regardless of whether the state responds to his petition for postconviction relief.\" *State v. Wallen*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA97-02-017, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 3647, *4 (Aug. 11, 1997). See also *State v. Hartman*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27162, 2017-Ohio-7933 (a trial court has an independent duty to analyze a PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21[D]); *State v. McCabe*, 4th Dist. Washington No. 97CA32, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 4487 (Sept. 14, 1998) (it is well settled that, regardless of whether or not the state responds to a petition for postconviction relief, R.C. 2953.21[D] requires the trial court\nto sua sponte analyze the petition). Thus, the trial court was required to independently determine whether there were substantive grounds for relief and the pendency of the state's motion for summary judgment did not preclude the trial court from summarily dismissing the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D). See State v. McKelton, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-02-028, 2015-Ohio-4228; State v. Noling, 11th Dist. Portage No. 98-P-0049, 2003-Ohio-5008.\n\n\u00b6 27 In his reply brief Myers argues for the first time that the trial court's summary dismissal of the PCR petition without prior notice to the parties violated the notice requirement of procedural due process. However, it is well established that an appellant may not raise new issues or assignments of error in a reply brief. State v. Renfro, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-07-142, 2012-Ohio-2848, \u00b6 28, citing App.R. 16; State ex rel. Colvin v. Brunner, 120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041. A reply brief simply provides the appellant with an opportunity to respond to the arguments raised in the appellee's brief. State v. Quaterman, 140 Ohio St.3d 464, 2014-Ohio-4034, \u00b6 18. Myers' argument is not appropriately before the court and will not be considered. Furthermore, as the discussion above makes clear, parties in postconviction proceedings are on notice of a trial court's sua sponte authority to grant a summary dismissal of a PCR petition. R.C. 2953.21; Hartman, 2017-Ohio-7933; McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228; McCabe, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 4487.\n\n\u00b6 28 Myers' first assignment of error is overruled.\n\nC. Discovery Motions\n\n\u00b6 29 Assignment of Error No. 2:\n\n\u00b6 30 THE TRIAL COURT DENIED MYERS' RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS, ACCESS TO THE OHIO COURTS, AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, AND VIOLATED R.C. \u00a7 2953.21(A)(1) AND ITS DISCOVERY AMENDMENTS, WHEN THE COURT HELD THAT THE DISCOVERY AMENDMENTS WERE NON-RETROACTIVE\nAND THUS INAPPLICABLE TO MYERS' CASE, AND THEN ENFORCED AN UNREASONABLE AND IMPROPERLY-RESTRICTIVE DEFINITION OF \"GOOD CAUSE\" TO DENY DISCOVERY TO MYERS ON EVERY ONE OF HIS CLAIMS.\n\n{\u00b6 31} Assignment of Error No. 3:\n\n{\u00b6 32} EVEN UNDER THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE PCR STATUTE, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED MYERS' PCR PETITION WITHOUT AFFORDING HIM ANY OPPORTUNITY TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY.\n\n{\u00b6 33} These assignments of error challenge the trial court's denial of Myers' discovery motions. As stated above, the trial court found that amended R.C. 2953.21 was not applicable in the case at bar because the statute did not explicitly state it was retroactive. Alternatively, the trial court found that even if the statutory amendment was applied retroactively, Myers was not entitled to discovery as he had not demonstrated \"good cause.\" The statute was amended after Myers filed his PCR petition and first motion for discovery but before he filed his supplemental motion for discovery.\n\n{\u00b6 34} Before R.C. 2953.21 was amended on April 6, 2017, it was well established that the statutory scheme governing postconviction relief did not entitle a petitioner to conduct discovery. State ex rel. Love v. Cuyahoga Cty. Prosecutor's Office, 87 Ohio St.3d 158, 159, 1999-Ohio-314; Ketterer, 2017-Ohio-4117 at \u00b6 45. Nevertheless, discovery could be proper where a petitioner set forth operative facts outside the record that revealed a constitutional error in his or her case. Id. The granting or overruling of discovery motions rested within the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Lawson, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2011-07-056, 2012-Ohio-548, \u00b6 17.\n\n{\u00b6 35} Amended R.C. 2953.21 makes substantial changes regarding PCR petitions in death-penalty cases, and in particular, allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery in aid of their PCR petition if good cause is shown. Specifically, R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) now\nprovides that\n\nAt any time in conjunction with the filing of a petition for postconviction relief under division (A) of this section by a person who has been sentenced to death, or with the litigation of a petition so filed, the court, for good cause shown, may authorize the petitioner in seeking the postconviction relief and the prosecuting attorney of the county served by the court in defending the proceeding, to take depositions and to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in accordance with divisions (A)(1)(d), (A)(1)(e), and (C) of this section, and to any other form of discovery as in a civil action that the court in its discretion permits. The court may limit the extent of discovery under this division. In addition to discovery that is relevant to the claim and was available under Criminal Rule 16 through conclusion of the original criminal trial, the court, for good cause shown, may authorize the petitioner or prosecuting attorney to take depositions and issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in either of the following circumstances:\n\n(i) For any witness who testified at trial or who was disclosed by the state prior to trial, except as otherwise provided in this division, the petitioner or prosecuting attorney shows clear and convincing evidence that the witness is material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to substantiate or refute the petitioner's claim that there is a reasonable probability of an altered verdict. This division does not apply if the witness was unavailable for trial or would not voluntarily be interviewed by the defendant or prosecuting attorney.\n\n(ii) For any witness with respect to whom division (A)(1)(d)(i) of this section does not apply, the petitioner or prosecuting attorney shows good cause that the witness is material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to substantiate or refute the petitioner's claim that there is a reasonable probability of an altered verdict.\n\n\u00b6 36 We first address whether the trial court erred in finding that amended R.C. 2953.21 does not apply to the case at bar because it is not retroactive. This is a strict legal issue which we review de novo. State v. Consilio, 114 Ohio St.3d 295, 2007-Ohio-4163, \u00b6 8; State v. Gloff, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2019-06-047, 2020-Ohio-3143, \u00b6 17.\n\n\u00b6 37 It is well settled that a statute is presumed to apply prospectively unless\nexpressly declared to be retroactive. R.C. 1.48. Additionally, Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, prohibits the General Assembly from passing retroactive laws. Applying these two provisions, the Supreme Court of Ohio has established a two-part test to determine whether a statute may be applied retroactively. *Consilio*.\n\n{\u00b6 38} Under this test, a reviewing court must first determine as a threshold matter whether the statute is expressly made retroactive. *Consilio*, 2007-Ohio-4163 at \u00b6 10. \"The General Assembly's failure to clearly enunciate retroactivity ends the analysis and the relevant statute may be applied only prospectively.\" *Id.* If, however, the General Assembly expressly indicated its intention that the statute apply retroactively, the reviewing court must then move to the second step of the analysis and \"determine whether the statute is remedial, in which case retroactive application is permitted, or substantive, in which case retroactive application is forbidden.\" *State v. White*, 132 Ohio St.3d 344, 2012-Ohio-2583, \u00b6 27.\n\n{\u00b6 39} As the trial court properly found, R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) as amended does not explicitly state it is to be applied retroactively. \"A statute must clearly proclaim its own retroactivity to overcome the presumption of prospective application. Retroactivity is not to be inferred.\" *Consilio* at \u00b6 15. \"If the retroactivity of a statute is not expressly stated in plain terms, the presumption in favor of prospective application controls. Moreover, the General Assembly is presumed to know that it must include expressly retroactive language to create that effect, and it has done so in the past.\" *Id.* Because amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) does not expressly mention retroactivity, we find that the statute applies prospectively and we need not determine whether the statute is remedial or substantive under the second prong of the test.\n\n{\u00b6 40} We further find that by its plain terms the statute applies prospectively to pending PCR petitions in that it allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery, for good cause\nshown, \"at any time in conjunction with the filing of a [PCR petition], or with the litigation of a petition so filed[.]\" (Emphasis added.) In the case at bar, amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) was not yet in effect when Myers filed his PCR petition. However, the PCR petition was still being litigated on April 6, 2017, when the amended statute became effective. Amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d), therefore, applies to Myers' PCR petition. See Gloff, 2020-Ohio-3143.\n\n\u00b6 41 The statute requires that the petitioner demonstrate \"good cause\" as a prerequisite for a trial court to allow discovery. As stated above, the trial court alternatively found that Myers failed to show \"good cause.\"\n\n\u00b6 42 \"Good cause\" is not defined by the statute. Consequently, the trial court adopted the definition applied in federal habeas corpus proceedings, to wit, good cause exists \"where specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is * * * entitled to relief, it is the duty of the courts to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry.\" Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 908-909, 117 S.Ct. 1793 (1997). \"Conversely, where a petitioner would not be entitled to relief on a particular claim, regardless of what facts he developed, he cannot show good cause for discovery on that claim.\" Murphy v. Bradshaw, S.D.Ohio No. C-1-03-053, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15978, *2 (Sept. 13, 2003).\n\n\u00b6 43 Before determining whether a petitioner is entitled to discovery under \"good cause,\" the court must first identify the essential elements of the claim on which discovery is sought. Bracy at 904. The burden of demonstrating the materiality of the information requested is on the moving party. Stanford v. Parker, 266 F.3d 442, 460 (6th Cir.2001). Discovery may be allowed where the petitioner's claims are \"neither patently frivolous nor palpably incredible\" and where \"the discovery he requests is specific, limited, and reasonably calculated to lead to evidence in support of his claim[.]\" Hill v. Mitchell, S.D.Ohio\nNo. 1:98-cv-452, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71975, *31-32 (Sept. 27, 2007). A petitioner is not entitled to go on a fishing expedition based on conclusory allegations. *Id.* at *5; *Williams v. Bagley*, 380 F.3d 932, 974 (6th Cir.2004). \"Even in a death penalty case, 'bald assertions and conclusory allegations do not provide sufficient ground to warrant requiring the state to respond to discovery or to require an evidentiary hearing.'\" *Stanford* at 460. Rather, the petitioner must set forth specific allegations of fact. *Williams* at 974.\n\n\u00b6 44 Myers argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery because he demonstrated \"good cause\" or, alternatively, set forth operative facts outside the record that revealed constitutional errors. Myers further argues that the trial court misapplied the *Bracy* good cause standard by essentially requiring him to prove his claims as a prerequisite to discovery.\n\n\u00b6 45 Myers' discovery motions were broad overall, seeking a wide range of information, records, and depositions of individuals, some of whom were identified only by category. The trial court broke down Myers' discovery requests into nine general categories of inquiry: (1) records in the custody of the Warren County Children's Services, the Warren County Department of Job and Family Services, and the Warren County Juvenile Court regarding Myers' family, (2) Myers' records from the Warren County Jail, (3) grand jury proceedings, (4) Mosley's institutional records, (5) records of the prosecutor's office and several law enforcement agencies relating to their investigation of Back's death and the arrest of Myers and Mosley, (6) depositions of law enforcement officers, (7) depositions of the jurors, (8) depositions of the attorneys on the prosecution team, and (9) depositions of the defense team.\n\n\u00b6 46 Myers' first motion for discovery did not identify how his discovery requests related to his postconviction claims. By contrast, the supplemental motion for discovery argued that Myers was entitled to conduct discovery on (1) his claims of ineffective\nassistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial, (2) his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial, and (3) his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for an offender who was still a teenager at the time of the offense. In his brief, Myers argues the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery on the foregoing claims. We will address the trial court's denial of Myers' discovery motions concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial in conjunction with Myers' fifth assignment of error.\n\n\u00b6 47 Myers first argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery regarding his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for a 19-year-old offender at the time of the offense. In support of these constitutional challenges, Myers sought discovery of (1) the Warren County's training and instructional materials for judges, prosecutors, and sheriff deputies concerning behavioral characteristics and brain development of juveniles, adolescents, and late-adolescents (18-21 years old) offenders, and (2) Warren County's data concerning the prosecution of such juvenile, adolescent, and late-adolescent offenders for the previous seven years.\n\n\u00b6 48 We find that Myers' requested discovery falls more into the category of a fishing expedition. Furthermore, as we discuss in the fourth assignment of error, Myers' claims are barred by res judicata and fail to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, given the election of the United States Supreme Court and Ohio Supreme Court not to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of 18 at the time of the crime. \"[W]here a petitioner would not be entitled to relief on a particular claim, regardless of what facts he developed, he cannot show good cause for discovery on that claim.\" Murphy, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15978 at *2. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying Myers' motions for discovery regarding his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for a 19-year-old\noffender at the time of the offense.\n\n\u00b6 49 Myers next argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial. Counsel's alleged ineffective assistance included the failure to (1) pursue a youth-based defense theory, (2) hire a fact investigator, (3) fully cross-examine Mosley, (4) cross-examine a sergeant and a detective regarding their failure to follow police procedure manuals, (5) present the testimony of a crime scene expert, (6) present the testimony of a police procedure expert to challenge Miranda issues, (7) present the testimony of an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his Miranda rights, (8) achieve a change of venue, and (9) challenge the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook. As we discuss in the sixth assignment of error, Myers' claims regarding the testimony of a police procedure expert to challenge Miranda issues, change of venue, and the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook are barred by res judicata as they could have been raised on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. As we further discuss in the sixth assignment of error, Myers' other claims fail to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief. Murphy at *2. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying Myers' motions for discovery concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial.\n\n\u00b6 50 To that extent, Myers' second and third assignments of error are overruled.\n\nD. Constitutional Challenges\n\n\u00b6 51 Assignment of Error No. 4:\n\n\u00b6 52 THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT FOUND PROCEDURALLY BARRED MYERS' CLAIMS CHALLENGING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY, PROPRIETY, AND/OR PROPORTIONALITY OF A DEATH SENTENCE FOR AN OFFENDER, LIKE MYERS, WHO WAS STILL A TEENAGER AT THE TIME OF HIS OFFENSE (GROUNDS\n5, 8, 9, 46, 47, 48), AND IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING SUCH CLAIMS UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.\n\n\u00b6 53 Myers argues that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 5, 8, 9, 46, 47, and 48 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged the constitutionality, propriety, and/or proportionality of a death sentence for an offender, like Myers, who was a teenager at the time of the offense. In this assignment of error, Myers details the scientific research on adolescent brain development, references various cases acknowledging that young adults under the age of 21 share many of the characteristics of late-age adolescents, and argues that the imposition of a death sentence upon a teenage offender, such as him, is an unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. Myers asserts that a cut-off of age 18 for imposing a death penalty is arbitrary. Myers further asserts his death sentence is unconstitutionally disproportionate to the life sentence Mosley received.\n\n\u00b6 54 Ground 5 argues that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), Ohio's felony-murder statute, is unconstitutional because it fails to adequately account for youth in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Ground 8 argues that the death sentence was disproportionate compared to Mosley and others convicted of similar crimes in violation of Myers' Eighth Amendment rights. Ground 9 argues that Myers' death sentence was void because the trial court failed to consider the R.C. 2929.11 purposes of felony sentencing when determining the appropriateness of the death sentence on the capital specifications. Ground 46 argues that Myers' Eighth Amendment rights were violated because the trial court failed to accord his youth the mitigating value it deserved. Ground 47 argues that the death penalty was a disproportionate punishment for Myers given his youth and other individual characteristics. Ground 48 argues that the death penalty is per se unconstitutional for a youthful offender convicted of committing a crime prior to turning 21 years old.\nThe trial court dismissed Grounds 8 and 9, finding that both arguments were raised in Myers' direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, were addressed by the supreme court, and were therefore barred by res judicata. The trial court further dismissed Grounds 5 and 46 through 48 as follows:\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court has already addressed whether the sentence of death for Myers based on his age is a violation of the Eighth Amendment and found that it is not a violation of his constitutional rights. Therefore, this argument is barred by res judicata.\n\nFurther, the Supreme Court of the United States has addressed the age of youthful offenders in a number of contexts and has not chosen to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of eighteen at the time of the crime. [Myers] has submitted evidence related to the development in brain science, however, the Ohio Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court have considered these new developments and similar arguments to the ones set forth by [Myers]. The United States Supreme Court acknowledged that individuals over eighteen may still exhibit signs of a juvenile but also found that since eighteen is the line society draws for many purposes between childhood and adulthood, that was the age that the line for death penalty ought to rest. *Roper v. Simmons*, 543 U.S. 551, 574, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 1197-98 (2005).\n\nWe find that the trial court properly dismissed Grounds 5, 8, 9, and 46 through 48. On direct appeal to the supreme court, Myers argued that the death sentence violated the Eighth Amendment proscription of cruel and unusual punishment, given recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court and a growing body of new developments in brain science indicating that age 18 is not the proper cut-off point for the death penalty. Myers further argued that his death sentence was comparatively disproportionate to the life sentence Mosley received and that he should not have been sentenced to death because he was a 19-year-old immature adolescent with mental and youth-related behavioral issues when he committed his crimes. The supreme court addressed and rejected these claims. *Myers*, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 173-176. They are therefore barred by res judicata.\nMyers\u2019 other claims were properly dismissed by the trial court as failing to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, given the election of the United States Supreme Court and Ohio Supreme Court not to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of 18 at the time of the crime. Myers notes that while his direct appeal made a brief reference to the newer brain science, it did not make the constitutional claim for a *Roper*-extension that his PRC petition makes. See *Myers* at \u00b6 176 (\"Although Myers argues that new developments in brain science indicate that age 18 is not the 'proper cut off point for the death penalty,' he does not propose that the categorical exclusion for those under age 18 be extended to 19-year-olds\"). However, such constitutional argument was recently addressed and rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court in *State v. Graham*, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-6700.\n\nGraham, who turned 19 years old the month before he committed his crimes and who was sentenced to death, argued that imposing a death sentence on a capital defendant who was under the age of 21 at the time of the crime violated the Eighth Amendment. Extrapolating from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s *Roper* decision, Graham argued that it was possible the Supreme Court could extend *Roper* to find that a defendant who turned 19 the month before committing the offense is constitutionally barred from receiving a death sentence. The Ohio Supreme Court squarely rejected the argument: \"[B]ecause the United States Supreme Court has drawn the line at 18 for Eighth Amendment purposes, state courts are not free to invoke the Eighth Amendment as authority for drawing it at a higher age. * * * *Roper* is controlling, and we must follow it.\" *Graham* at \u00b6 182, citing *In re Phillips*, 6th Cir. No. 17-3729, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 17766 (July 20, 2017) (no authority exists at the present time to support the argument that a defendant who was 19 years old at the time of the offense is ineligible to receive a death sentence).\nMyers' fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nAssignment of Error No. 9:\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT FOUND PROCEDURALLY BARRED MYERS' CLAIMS CHALLENGING IN MULTIPLE RESPECTS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF OHIO'S DEATH PENALTY STATUTE AND SYSTEMS (GROUNDS 2-4, 7, 57), AND IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING SUCH CLAIMS UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.\n\nMyers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 2, 3, 4, 7, and 57 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged the constitutionality of Ohio's death-penalty scheme and the statutes governing it. Specifically, Myers argues that Ohio's death-penalty scheme (1) is per se unconstitutional due to several fundamental constitutional defects, (2) is unconstitutional because it allows racial disparities in capital indictment practices and the actual infliction of the death penalty, (3) is incompatible with modern standards of decency, and (4) violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under Hurst v. Florida, 577 U.S. 92, 136 S.Ct. 616 (2016). Myers further argues that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), Ohio's felony-murder statute, is unconstitutional as a capital specification because it allows for invidious racial discrimination in its application and fails to provide adequate safeguards to ensure only the most culpable offenders are sentenced to death.\n\nMyers' claims are barred by res judicata as they were either raised or could have been raised in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 201-202. This includes his Sixth Amendment argument under Hurst as his merit brief was filed in the supreme court four months after Hurst was decided. Myers acknowledges that the supreme court \"has thus far been unwilling to conclude that Ohio's death penalty\nstatute is unconstitutional under the U.S. and/or Ohio constitutions in the respect alleged * * in these Grounds.\" See, e.g., Myers; State v. Mason, 153 Ohio St.3d 476, 2018-Ohio-1462; State v. Mammone, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942. In December 2020, the supreme court once again held that Ohio's death-penalty scheme was not unconstitutional under Hurst. Graham, 2020-Ohio-6700 at \u00b6 185-186.\n\n\u00b6 64 Myers' ninth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n\u00b6 65 Assignment of Error No. 11:\n\n\u00b6 66 THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION, AND COMMITTED AN ERROR OF LAW, WHEN IT DENIED MYERS RELIEF ON HIS FIRST GROUND FOR RELIEF, BECAUSE OHIO'S POSTCONVICTION PROCEDURES FAIL TO PROVIDE DEATH-SENTENCED PETITIONERS WITH AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS AND THEY VIOLATE THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS.\n\n\u00b6 67 Myers argues that Ohio's statutory scheme for postconviction relief is unconstitutional because it does not provide an adequate corrective process due to its \"rigid\" reliance on principles of res judicata and a petitioner's inability to conduct discovery until convincing a trial court that a hearing is warranted. This court has already determined that \"the statutory procedure for postconviction relief constitutes an adequate corrective process.\" State v. Lindsey, 12th Dist. Brown No. CA2002-02-002, 2003-Ohio-811, \u00b6 13; State v. Lawson, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2013-12-093, 2014-Ohio-3554, \u00b6 43. Other Ohio appellate courts have likewise rejected the claim that Ohio's postconviction relief statute does not afford an adequate corrective process. See, e.g. State v. Conway, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-504, 2019-Ohio-2260. Furthermore, the propriety of resolving a postconviction petitioner's arguments on the basis of res judicata is well settled. E.g., Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93. We see no reason to deviate from our prior precedent. Lawson.\n\n\u00b6 68 Myers' eleventh assignment of error is overruled.\nE. Merits of Myers' Grounds for Relief\n\n1. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n{\u00b6 69} Assignment of Error No. 7:\n\n{\u00b6 70} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT (GROUNDS 50, 58), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.\n\n{\u00b6 71} Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily denying Grounds 50 and 58 of his PCR petition which allege prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n{\u00b6 72} For a conviction to be reversed on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must prove the prosecutor's comments were improper and that they prejudicially affected the defendant's substantial rights. State v. Elmore, 111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, \u00b6 62; McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228 at \u00b6 13. However, \"[t]he focus of an inquiry into allegations of prosecutorial misconduct is upon the fairness of the trial, not upon culpability of the prosecutor.\" State v. Gray, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-09-176, 2012-Ohio-4769, \u00b6 56. Therefore, \"[p]rosecutorial misconduct is not grounds for error unless the defendant has been denied a fair trial.\" State v. Olvera-Guillen, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2007-05-118, 2008-Ohio-5416, \u00b6 27, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239 (1984).\n\n{\u00b6 73} We first address Myers' averment that \"the late and questionable disclosure of Mosley's notebook may very well have been the result of prosecutorial misconduct.\"\n\n{\u00b6 74} R.C. 2953.21(A)(4) requires a petitioner to \"state in the original or amended petition filed under division (A) of this section all grounds for relief claimed by the petitioner.\" Except as provided in R.C. 2953.23, inapplicable here, \"any ground for relief that is not so stated in the petition is waived.\" R.C. 2953.21(A)(4); State v. Lawrence, 12th Dist. Butler\nNos. CA2017-06-078 and CA2019-03-048, 2020-Ohio-855, \u00b6 17. Myers did not raise this claim of prosecutorial misconduct in his PCR petition and has therefore forfeited it. State v. Zeune, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-147, 2013-Ohio-4156, \u00b6 30; State v. Barb, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94054, 2010-Ohio-5239, \u00b6 25; State v. McKee, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 96CA006599, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4433, *9 (Oct. 1, 1997) (failure to raise issue in PCR petition results in a waiver of the right to assert the issue on appeal).\n\n\u00b6 75 Ground 50 alleges that Myers' due process rights were violated when privileged attorney-client discussions were potentially broadcast throughout the courthouse and into the prosecutor's office via the trial court's audio/video recording system. In his brief, Myers asserts the fact that conversations from the defense table could be broadcast in such a manner should cause \"great concern about whether any privileged conversations were 'overheard,' whether any were recorded, whether someone took notes of what they heard, [and] whether such information was utilized by the State in any fashion[.]\n\n\u00b6 76 Myers does not identify the resulting prejudice. The trial court sua sponte addressed the issue at a pretrial hearing in August 2014, subsequently conducted an evaluation of its audio/video recording system to make sure that conversations taking place at the defense table could not be heard by others, and provided a copy of that evaluation to counsel. In dismissing Ground 50, the trial court found \"NO evidence that any conversation of counsel was ever overheard,\" noted its investigation into the issue, and \"determined that the mute button was sufficient to prevent anyone from overhearing any conversation between counsel and the petitioner.\" Furthermore, this issue could have been raised on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court and is therefore barred by res judicata. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 50.\n\n\u00b6 77 Ground 58 alleges that the elected prosecutor engaged in misconduct by extensively posting about the case on his county prosecutor Facebook and Twitter accounts\nduring and after the trial and via statements he made in an interview during a 2016 BBC documentary. Ground 58 further alleges that Myers was prejudiced by the prosecutor's misconduct. The trial court dismissed the ground, finding that Myers \"failed to establish sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.\" In his brief, Myers asserts that the prosecutor's social media postings and interview \"tainted\" his right to a fair trial.\n\n\u00b6 78 We find that the trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 58. The prosecutor's post-trial social media posts, post-trial media statements, and statements in the 2016 BBC documentary are irrelevant and could not and did not deprive Myers of a fair trial. Regarding the prosecutor's social media postings and statements that occurred before and during trial, Myers does not articulate how any specific post or media statement prejudiced his right to a fair trial. A review of the posts and statements shows that they were restricted to providing the public with information about the criminal proceedings against Myers and communicated the results of various stages of the criminal proceedings against Myers either directly or by sharing links to news headlines. Following the guilty verdict, the prosecutor simply recognized Back's family and the efforts of the investigators and his office.\n\n\u00b6 79 Furthermore, the trial court repeatedly admonished the jurors not to view or listen to any news reports in any form. We presume the jury followed the trial court's admonitions unless it is demonstrated otherwise. State v. Miller, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2019-11-010, 2021-Ohio-162, \u00b6 50. Myers has not introduced any evidence to the contrary. Prejudice to a defendant will not be presumed in the absence of proof of jury exposure to possibly prejudicial news reports, or in this case, the prosecutor's social media posts. See State v. Wright, 3d Dist. Crawford No. 3-92-24, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 6090 (Dec. 30, 1994).\nFinally, this issue could have been raised by Myers in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. We note that Myers actually did allege claims of prosecutorial misconduct as part of his direct appeal under his tenth proposition of law. Res judicata applies to any issue that could have been raised on direct appeal, including a claim alleging prosecutorial misconduct. *McKelton*, 2015-Ohio-4228 at \u00b6 23, citing *State v. Zych*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA97-02-012, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4731 (Oct. 27, 1997). Myers fails to identify any reason why this claim of prosecutorial misconduct could not have been raised on direct appeal. Myers does not assert he learned about the prosecutor's social media posts after filing his direct appeal. Nor does he allege the posts were not known or available at the time of trial or his direct appeal. *Dillingham*, 2012-Ohio-5841 at \u00b6 10.\n\nMyers' seventh assignment of error is overruled.\n\n2. Trial Court Rulings\n\nAssignment of Error No. 8:\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS OF TRIAL COURT ERRORS IN MULTIPLE RESPECTS (GROUNDS 51-56, 59), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.\n\nMyers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 51 through 56 and 59 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged several trial court's rulings.\n\nGround 51 challenges the trial court's failure to grant a continuance of the trial date to allow defense counsel to obtain a mitigation specialist. This issue involves lead defense counsel's request to have his wife appointed as a mitigation specialist, which was initially denied by the trial court. After he was unable to find another mitigation specialist, lead counsel moved the trial court to reconsider its previous ruling. *Alternatively*, counsel\nmoved the court for a continuance of the trial date. The trial court reconsidered its previous\ndenial, appointed lead counsel's wife as the mitigation specialist, and denied the alternative\nrequest for continuance. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 51.\n\n{\u00b6 86} Ground 52 challenges the trial court's failure to grant a continuance of the trial\ndate to allow defense counsel to investigate Mosley's notebook after it was disclosed to the\ndefense the day before trial was to commence. Ground 53 challenges the trial court's\nadmission of the notebook into evidence and its failure to instruct the jury on the break in\nthe chain of custody. The notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after\nthe original search warrant was executed. On direct appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court\naddressed the state's delayed disclosure of the notebook, the trial court's denial of defense\ncounsel's motion for a continuance, and the admissibility of the notebook into evidence.\nMyers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 86-93, 112-120. In his direct appeal, defense counsel did not\nchallenge the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on chain of custody. Because the issues\nabove could have been or were raised on direct appeal to the supreme court, they are\nbarred by res judicata. The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 52 and 53.\n\n{\u00b6 87} Grounds 54 and 55 challenge the trial court's denial of Myers' motion to\nsuppress his \"involuntary\" statements to Detective Michael Wyatt where he \"did not\nunderstand his Miranda rights and never signed a Miranda waiver.\" In support of these\ngrounds, Myers submitted the reports of Gary Rini, a crime scene/police procedure expert,\nand Dr. Drew Barzman, a psychiatrist. Upon reviewing Myers' videotaped police\ninterrogations, Rini concluded that Myers \"was clearly confused and befuddled during his\nquestioning\" and was \"therefore apparently unable to appreciate the gravity of his situation,\nnor was he aware of the constitutional rights afforded to him.\" Upon reviewing Myers' police\ninterrogations, administering the Miranda Rights Comprehension Instruments test (\"MCRI\"),\nand reviewing comprehensive historical information regarding Myers, Dr. Barzman opined\nthat \"due to his young age of 19, probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,\" Myers \"was unable to adequately apply his Miranda rights at the time of the interrogations.\"\n\n\u00b6 88 On direct appeal, the supreme court overruled Myers' proposition of law relating to the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress and the claims that he never validly waived his right to remain silent, that he was denied his constitutional right to counsel, and that his statements were involuntary. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 61-82. In his brief, Myers asserts that the expert reports of Rini and Dr. Barzman \"were necessary to substantiate the claim\" his statements were not voluntarily made and were obtained in violation of Miranda. With the exception of the MCRI test, the same facts and historical information reviewed by Rini and Dr. Barzman were known and available to Myers at the time of his direct appeal to the supreme court. Myers, therefore, could have appealed his statements to police on the basis of his demeanor during questioning, his age, his \"probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and his lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,\" but did not. \"A report not found in the record does not automatically equate to a valid issue for post-conviction review purposes where, as here, the issue could have been raised on direct appeal.\" State v. Drummond, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05 MA 197, 2006-Ohio-7078, \u00b6 43. The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 54 and 55.\n\n\u00b6 89 Ground 56 challenges the trial court's denial of Myers' motion for change of venue based on the \"overwhelming\" pretrial media publicity regarding the case. Although Myers moved the trial court for a change of venue, he did not challenge the trial court's denial of his motion in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. It is therefore barred by res judicata. See McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 56.\nGround 59 challenges the trial court's failure to instruct the jury that Mosley's plea deal to a life sentence without parole was a mitigating factor. The record shows that the trial court did instruct the jury that, in addition to the specific statutory mitigation factors, it could consider any additional factors that were not specifically mentioned in favor of a sentence other than death. Defense counsel was allowed to and did argue Mosley's plea deal as a mitigating factor. Furthermore, this claim could have been raised on direct appeal to the supreme court and is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Jennings, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-248, 2018-Ohio-3871; State v. Southers, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA88-03-027, 1988 Ohio App. LEXIS 2720 (June 30, 1988). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 59.\n\nMyers' eighth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n3. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel during the Guilt Phase\n\nAssignment of Error No. 6:\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS THAT HIS TRIAL COUNSEL RENDERED CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFICIENT PERFORMANCE IN THE TRIAL PHASE OF HIS CAPITAL TRIAL (GROUNDS 6, 10-18), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING, AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF ON THESE MERITORIOUS IAC CLAIMS.\n\nMyers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 6 and 10 through 17 of his PCR petition, all of which allege numerous instances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial.\n\nIn order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, it must be shown that an attorney's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance\nprejudiced the defense. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). In postconviction proceedings, a petitioner bears the initial burden of submitting evidentiary materials containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and also that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness. *State v. Jackson*, 64 Ohio St.2d 107, 111 (1980). Pursuant to the res judicata doctrine, a PCR petition may be dismissed where a petitioner, represented by new counsel on direct appeal, could have raised the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim on direct appeal without resort to evidence outside the record. *State v. Lentz*, 70 Ohio St.3d 527 (1994), syllabus; *State v. Loza*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA96-10-214, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4574, *9-10 (Oct. 13, 1997). Additionally, mere presentation of evidence outside the record does not transform a claim into one addressable in postconviction. *Drummond*, 2006-Ohio-7078 at \u00b6 17. The evidence must show that the petitioner could not have appealed his claim based upon the information in the original record. *Id.*\n\n\u00b6 96 Ground 6 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a youth-based defense theory during the guilt phase of the trial in anticipation of the penalty phase. Myers asserts that his \"youth, its specific effects on him, and its manifestation in the conduct alleged by the State at trial should have all formed a central, consistent theme presented during both phases of the trial.\" Counsel's defense theory during the guilt phase was that Mosley committed the murder, Myers was simply present during the crime, and Mosley subsequently turned on Myers by entering into a plea deal and testifying against him. This was consistent with the penalty phase during which defense counsel argued Myers' sentence should not be more severe than Mosley's sentence.\n\n\u00b6 97 The decision regarding which defense theory to pursue at trial is a matter of trial strategy, and trial strategy decisions are not the basis of a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Murphy*, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 524, 2001-Ohio-112; *State v.\nMoreover, as the trial court noted when it dismissed Ground 6, the fact that another defense attorney may have or would have employed a different approach does not mean the alternative strategy fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. *State v. Casey*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2017-08-013, 2018-Ohio-2084, \u00b6 34. \"[T]here is a strong presumption that counsel has rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\" *Id.* Defense counsel's guilt-phase strategy will not be second-guessed even though appellate counsel now argue that they would have defended differently. *State v. Mason*, 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 169, 1998-Ohio-370. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 6.\n\nGround 10 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to hire a fact investigator even though the trial court had approved funds for an investigator. Lead defense counsel's affidavit submitted in support of the PCR petition indicates that counsel \"ultimately did not retain\" an investigator because the case was not a \"who done it.\" Ground 11 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to fully cross-examine Mosley. Myers asserts that an investigator would have discovered, inter alia, that Mosley was suffering from rage and depression in the days leading to Back's murder, suffered from severe drug addiction and had violent tendencies, and was not in the habit of taking notes in a notebook. The investigation would have further discovered that Mosley's cellphone records belied his trial testimony. Myers claims that this information could have been used to properly cross-examine Mosley and impeach his credibility.\n\n\"The *Strickland* holding and the American Bar Association's Guidelines only require trial counsel to perform a reasonable investigation, not to hire an investigator.\" *State v. Hairston*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 05CA008768, 2006-Ohio-4925, \u00b6 36. \"Further, '[a]n attorney's decision not to hire an investigator does not equate to a failure to investigate and\nresult in ineffective assistance of counsel.\" State v. Thompson, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, \u00b6 247, quoting Hairston at \u00b6 36. Defense counsel's failure to hire a fact investigator does not mean counsel did not investigate Mosley's background. The affidavits, reports, and records submitted by Myers in support of Ground 10 do not show a failure to investigate.\n\n\u00b6 100 Furthermore, as the Ohio Supreme Court specifically noted on direct appeal, defense counsel did cross-examine Mosley \"vigorously and at length.\" Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 186. Defense counsel's cross-examination of Mosley shows that counsel was very familiar with Mosley's statements to police and demonstrated his investigation and familiarity with personal facts about Mosley, including Mosley's substance abuse issues and the fact he engaged in illegal activity. Defense counsel's cross-examination elicited testimony that later allowed counsel to argue that Mosley was the principal offender, that he had a financial motive to commit the crimes, that he had a motive to keep his testimony consistent with his statements to Detective Wyatt because of his plea agreement, and that he lied to the police about Zennie to protect Zennie over Myers. Defense counsel's cross-examination of Mosley refutes any suggestion counsel did not investigate Mosley's background.\n\n\u00b6 101 Whether defense counsel discovered all of the information Myers identifies as topics of cross-examination is unknown. However, counsel's strategy was to cast Mosley as the leader who planned the crimes and executed them with little help from Myers and who was now turning on Myers to save himself. Some of the information that Myers suggests should have been a topic during Mosley's cross-examination is the same type of information which would have undermined Myers' mitigation strategy that Mosley bore primary responsibility for Back's murder. In this sense, portraying Mosley as suffering from depression and cocaine withdrawal at the time of the crime would have run counter to\ndefense counsel's strategy that Mosley was fully responsible for Back's murder. In addition, in light of the overwhelming evidence of Myers' guilt and the fact that Mosley's testimony regarding his and Myers' actions on the days leading to and culminating in the murder was corroborated by third-party witnesses, there is no reasonable probability Myers would have been acquitted of the charges. The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 10 and 11.\n\n\u00b6 102 Ground 12 challenges counsel's failure to cross-examine Sergeant Jeff Garrison of the Clayton Police Department and Detective Wyatt during the hearing on Myers' motion to suppress and at trial regarding their failure to follow their respective police procedure manual in handcuffing Myers when he was only wanted for an interview. Myers asserts that had counsel used the manuals when cross-examining the officers, this would have aided in showing that Myers was \"effectively seized\" when he was handcuffed and would have tarnished the officers' credibility.\n\n\u00b6 103 The record shows that it was Clayton police officers who handcuffed Myers and placed him in the back seat of a Clayton police cruiser after he was located at Mosley's home. At the time, Myers was a suspect who was detained at the request of the Warren County Sheriff's Office. The Clayton Police Department manual allows one to be restrained when the officer can articulate a need to handcuff for safety reasons. The sergeant's testimony at the suppression hearing indicates that Myers was handcuffed for safety reasons and to prevent him from running. Detective Wyatt's testimony reveals that the detective did not direct that Myers be handcuffed, and that in fact, he directed that the handcuffs be removed after he discovered that Myers was handcuffed.\n\n\u00b6 104 Furthermore, as the trial court found, the extent and scope of cross-examination clearly fall within the ambit of trial strategy, and debatable trial tactics do not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, \u00b6 146. Even assuming, arguendo, that defense counsel was deficient in failing\nto use the manuals when he cross-examined the officers, Myers fails to establish that, but for counsel's error, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the suppression hearing and his trial would have been different. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 12.\n\n{\u00b6 105} Ground 13 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a crime scene expert testimony to question the veracity of Mosley's notebook and rebut such evidence. The notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after the original search warrant was executed in January 2014. In support of Ground 13, Myers submitted Rini's report. The report indicates that photographs taken during the January 2014 search of Mosley's home do not show the notebook at all, nor was the notebook mentioned in any investigative report generated as a result of the January 2014 search of Mosley's home. Rini's report states that the \"discovery\" of the notebook \"eight months later, during a warrantless search in a location previously photographed during the January [2014] search, draws into question the legitimacy of the 'find' by investigating officers.\" Thus, \"[i]t is not unwarranted for one to conclude the possibility that the [notebook] was not, in fact present during the original crime scene search, and may have been placed at the scene sometime after the search was completed.\"\n\n{\u00b6 106} \"As an initial matter, the failure to call an expert and instead rely on cross-examination does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\" State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, \u00b6 66. Further, even if the wisdom of such an approach is debatable, \"debatable trial tactics\" do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Clayton, 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49 (1980). Defense counsel cross-examined Mosley upon all issues identified in Rini's report and revisited those issues in closing argument. Detective Wyatt testified the notebook was found where Mosley said it would be. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 13.\n\n{\u00b6 107} Ground 14 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present\na police procedure expert such as Rini to challenge *Miranda* issues. Myers asserts that Rini could have testified, based on his review of Myers' police interrogations, that Myers was \"clearly confused\" during questioning, that Detective Wyatt did not adequately explain the *Miranda* warnings to Myers, and that the detective provided Myers with inaccurate information concerning how he could obtain an attorney. Ground 15 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his *Miranda* rights. In support of this ground, Myers submitted the report of Dr. Barzman. Upon reviewing Myers' police interrogations, administering the MCRI test, and reviewing comprehensive historical information regarding Myers, Dr. Barzman opined that \"due to his young age of 19, probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,\" Myers \"was unable to adequately apply his *Miranda* rights at the time of the interrogations.\"\n\n\u00b6 108 During the suppression hearing defense counsel's cross-examination of Detective Wyatt addressed the issues raised in Rini's report, and the videotapes of Myers' interrogations were played and admitted into evidence. The videotapes were likewise played to the jury and admitted into evidence at Myers' trial. The trial court denied Myers' motion to suppress, finding that Myers validly waived his *Miranda* rights. The trial court further found that, based on the totality of the evidence, Myers understood the nature of his *Miranda* rights and the consequences in declining to exercise them. In his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, Myers challenged the validity of his *Miranda* waiver and argued that counsel was ineffective during the guilt phase of his trial. Myers' alleged confusion during police questioning, Detective Wyatt's explanation to Myers of the *Miranda* warnings and the information he provided Myers concerning how to retain an attorney, and counsel's alleged ineffectiveness in failing to present expert testimony to challenge *Miranda* issues were cognizable and could have been raised on direct appeal based solely on the original\nrecord. Rini's report does not constitute evidence outside the record as Myers asserts. Myers' argument is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Dempsey, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 76386, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 2628 (June 15, 2000); State v. Holloway, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-900805, 1992 Ohio App. LEXIS 283 (Jan. 29, 1992). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 14.\n\n\u00b6 109 The trial court dismissed Ground 15, finding that \"even if the defense had requested an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his Miranda rights, based on the evidence presented at the motion to suppress hearing it is unlikely that the Court would have granted that request since the Court denied the motion to suppress.\" The trial court further found that \"[t]he failure to request a * * * police procedures expert or another expert to challenge Miranda issues was not such an error as to deny [Myers'] constitutional rights. [Myers] was not entitled to any such expert[.]\") Thus, the trial court found that even considering Dr. Barzman's report, Myers failed to set forth sufficient operative facts establishing a substantive ground for relief.\n\n\u00b6 110 The MRCI administered by Dr. Barzman in October 2016 is the updated version of the Thomas Grisso's Instruments for Assessing Understanding & Appreciation of Miranda Rights, commonly referred to as the Grisso test. The test specifically assesses a person's capacity to understand and appreciate Miranda rights at the time of the evaluation. Garner v. Mitchell, 557 F.3d 257, 266 (6th Cir.2009). The test consists of four subtests, called \"instruments\": Comprehension of Miranda Rights (CMR), Comprehension of Miranda Rights \u2013 Recognition (CMR-R), Function of Rights in Interrogation (FRI), and Comprehension of Miranda Vocabulary (CMV). Id.; State v. Higgins, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 12 JE 11, 2013-Ohio-2555, \u00b6 43.\n\n\u00b6 111 Myers' scores were within the range for 19-year-old individuals with a verbal IQ of 101 to 110 in the first three instruments; his score of 29 out of 32 in the fourth\ninstrument (CMV) was good in comparison to 19-year-old individuals with a verbal IQ of 101 to 110. As stated above, the Grisso test purports to assess one's capacity to understand the Miranda warnings only at the time of the evaluation, not at the time the warnings were given. Garner at 270. The test does not purport to measure the validity of the waiver of Miranda rights or legal competence to waive Miranda rights. Id. at 269. In his report Dr. Barzman admitted the limited usefulness of Myers' scores \"since his interrogations were almost 3 years ago[.]\" Nonetheless, Dr. Barzman opined that \"[b]ased on his responses to the [test], it is evident that Austin currently understands the words of the Miranda Rights but he had problems with applying his rights. Although [he] appeared to have average to above average intelligence, he did not have the 'street smarts' three years ago to actually apply his Miranda Rights under intense stress.\"\n\n\u00b6 112 Myers' scores indicate he did understand his Miranda rights. Myers was interviewed five times by Detective Wyatt. Miranda warnings were not required during the first interview as Myers was not in custody. Detective Wyatt administered Miranda warnings to Myers on three separate times; each time Myers stated he understood them. Myers invoked his right to counsel in the second interview and the detective ended the interview. Myers sought to re-initiate questioning during a third interview but was rebuffed because he had invoked his right to counsel. Myers subsequently re-initiated questioning during a fourth interview, was administered the Miranda warnings again, and provided a statement. Detective Wyatt administered the Miranda warnings for a third time before the fifth interview. Myers indicated he understood them and answered the detective's questions. On direct appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court found that Myers understood his Miranda rights, which was further demonstrated by his invocation of his right to counsel. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 69-71. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 15.\n\n\u00b6 113 Ground 16 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to support\nthe motion for a change of venue with news articles evidencing the extraordinary amount of pretrial publicity, failed to renew the motion after voir dire, and ultimately failed to achieve a change of venue. The trial court dismissed Ground 16, finding that the motion for change of venue was initially denied subject to reconsideration if a jury could not be empaneled in accordance with State v. Lundgren, 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 1995-Ohio-227. The motion was subsequently denied after the trial court was able to successfully seat a jury in accordance with Lundgren. Juror questionnaires submitted in support of Ground 16 indicate that six of the 12 jurors had seen or heard pretrial news coverage of the case. All jurors indicated that they could and would decide the case based solely on the evidence presented at trial. Furthermore, although Myers alleged claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase as part of his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, he did not challenge defense counsel's failure to achieve a change of venue. It is therefore barred by res judicata. See Piesciuk, 2013-Ohio-3879. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 16.\n\n{\u00b6 114} Ground 17 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to challenge the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook either through cross-examination of the state's witnesses or by expert testimony. As stated above, the notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after the original search warrant was executed. Counsel vigorously cross-examined Mosley about the notebook and objected to its admission. On direct appeal to the supreme court, Myers challenged the admission of the notebook into evidence and alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial. The issue regarding the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook was cognizable and could have been raised on direct appeal to the supreme court and is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Dickason, 5th Dist. Stark Case No. 1996CA00423, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 3241 (July 7, 1997). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 17.\nMyers' sixth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n4. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel during the Penalty Phase\n\nAssignment of Error No. 5:\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS THAT HIS TRIAL COUNSEL RENDERED CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFICIENT PERFORMANCE IN THE SENTENCING PHASE OF HIS CAPITAL TRIAL (GROUNDS 19-45, 49), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING, AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF ON THESE MERITORIOUS IAC CLAIMS.\n\nMyers argues that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 19 through 45, all of which allege several instances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial. Specifically, Myers argues that counsel was ineffective during the penalty phase of the trial because he failed to (1) conduct a competent mitigation investigation and consult with and hire a competent mitigation specialist in a timely fashion, (2) present the testimony of expert witnesses regarding Myers' youth and psychological history, (3) present expert testimony regarding the science on adolescent brain development, and (4) present the testimony of numerous witnesses who would have testified about Myers' background, family history, mental health, education, and relationships with others. Myers argues that defense counsel's primary mitigation strategy was that Myers should not receive a punishment harsher than the life sentence without parole imposed on Mosley. Myers avers that had defense counsel's focus been broader and include the testimony of experts and other witnesses, he would not have been sentenced to death.\n\nThe trial court dismissed the grounds for relief, finding that (1) the failure to\ncall witnesses is trial strategy that does not raise to a constitutional violation, (2) a PCR petition is not a vehicle to substitute another trial strategy for one that failed, (3) defense counsel did argue Myers' youth in mitigation and the trial court instructed the jury that youth was a mitigating factor, and (4) defense counsel's failure to present the testimony of an expert in adolescent brain development, and his decision to consult with but not call a psychology expert to the stand and instead rely on arguing that Myers' sentence should not be harsher than that of Mosley was trial strategy.\n\n\u00b6 120 Myers' foregoing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial were also the basis for his motions for discovery and why he argues the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery under his second and third assignments of error. As pertinent here, the trial court denied the discovery motions as follows:\n\nThis is not a case where the defense did not seek the assistance of an investigator, mitigation expert and mental health expert. Clearly, a decision by trial counsel not to even have these valuable tools available to him while defending a capital murder case can never be a tactical, strategic decision. However, the decision of whether or not to use these tools or how to use them, as a matter of strategy or in the context of marshalling resources, is the cornerstone in building a proper legal defense.\n\nPetitioner has made allegations that his attorneys and mitigation specialist were ineffective and did not properly investigate and prepare a defense. In support of this claim, he has provided affidavits and documentary evidence concerning their performance. However, petitioner has made no specific representation about what he expects to learn in a deposition of [lead defense counsel, co-counsel and/or the mitigation specialist]. Both [lead counsel and the mitigation specialist] provided affidavits explaining what they knew, what they did, and why they did it. The fact that an attorney may look back in a deposition or otherwise, with 20/20 hindsight, and question or revisit his trial strategy after the jury has rendered its verdict provides no real insight to the Court. Further, the fact that [lead counsel] may have limited his mitigation strategy to what he believed to be the strongest and most compelling arguments does not support conducting discovery on this issue. * * *\nIn short, the petitioner has not established good cause to conduct discovery with respect to the defense team, including the attorneys.\n\n\u00b6 121 During the penalty phase of the trial, defense counsel presented the testimony of Myers' father, mother, and younger brother Bryce. All three testified about Myers' family history and background, including the breakup of the family and the parents' divorce following the mother's affair with a coworker and resultant pregnancy. They further testified about Myers' close bond with his siblings and how he was a very good mediator and mentor for his stepsiblings. Myers' mother testified that as a child, Myers tested gifted in several areas, was a talented piano player, and had designed a business card for himself in sixth grade. However, she started seeing changes in Myers when he was 14 years old. After she discovered Myers had been cutting himself and shooting his legs with a pellet gun, he was hospitalized for five days at Kettering Hospital Youth Services. Myers' mother testified that Myers was initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder and upon discharge, was prescribed medications and weekly therapy with a psychologist. However, Myers discontinued both when he began living with his father later that year. Defense counsel introduced photographs of Myers and his family, the business card he had designed for himself, his letters to his family during his incarceration, the records of his hospitalization at Kettering Hospital, and his gifted test results when he was in fifth grade. The Kettering Hospital records show that Myers was hospitalized as a result of taking 20 Benadryl tablets and that he was initially diagnosed with \"depressive disorder not otherwise specified versus bipolar disorder most recent depressed; substance induced mood disorder; over-the-counter drug abuse.\" Myers was ultimately diagnosed with \"depressive disorder, not otherwise specified. Rule out bipolar disorder.\"\n\n\u00b6 122 Myers made an unsworn statement, telling the jury that he was sorry \"this\nhappened\" and wished he \"could go back in time and stop this before it even happened,\" and that the death penalty would not hurt him and would only cause more pain and suffering to innocent people such as his parents and siblings. Myers asked the jury to spare his life and give him a chance to become a better person.\n\n\u00b6 123 In closing argument, defense counsel stressed Myers' good qualities and the positive influence he could have in his siblings' lives, acknowledged there had been \"bumps in the road,\" such as issues with Myers' family, \"his mental health a little bit,\" and his cutting and shooting himself with the pellet gun, and asked the jury to consider Myers' age, the love of his family, and the Kettering Hospital records. Overall, defense counsel focused on Mosley's plea agreement and resulting life sentence, telling the jury that it was the most important mitigating factor in the case and that Myers should not be punished more than Mosley who was the one who actually killed Back.\n\n\u00b6 124 Grounds 22 through 43 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present or \"fully\" present the testimony of numerous witnesses who would have testified about Myers' background, family history, mental health, education, and relationships with others. In support of this claim, Myers attached 22 affidavits from relatives, friends, acquaintances, and former educators to his PCR petition. Of those witnesses, only three testified at the penalty phase, to wit, Myers' parents and his brother Bryce.\n\n\u00b6 125 It is well established that a \"defense decision to call or not call a mitigation witness is a matter of trial strategy. * * * Debatable trial tactics generally do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\" Graham, 2020-Ohio-6700 at \u00b6 139. The Ohio Supreme Court has further stated that trial counsel is not ineffective for failing to call all available family members. State v. McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 399, 1997-Ohio-335. Furthermore, \"[a]dditional mitigating evidence that is 'merely cumulative' of that already presented does not undermine the results of sentencing.\" State v. Herring, 142 Ohio St.3d 165, 2014-Ohio-\n5228, \u00b6 117. Instead, \"the new evidence * * * must differ in a substantial way \u2013 in strength and subject matter \u2013 from the evidence actually presented at sentencing.\" Id.\n\n\u00b6 126 Upon reviewing the witnesses' affidavits, we find that the trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 22 through 43. Although the 19 individuals who did not testify may have provided a more disinterested account of Myers' family, their testimony to a large extent was cumulative to and did not differ in substantial way from the testimony of Myers' parents and his brother Bryce. See State v. Twyford, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 98-JE-56, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 1443 (Mar. 19, 2001). Likewise, the affidavits of Myers' parents and brother did not differ in substantial way from their testimony at the penalty phase.\n\n\u00b6 127 Grounds 19 and 20 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to consult with and hire a competent mitigation specialist in a timely fashion.\n\n\u00b6 128 In March 2014, lead defense counsel moved to employ his wife, a licensed attorney with experience defending capital cases, as the mitigation specialist. The trial court balked at the request due to the family relationship and denied the motion. Lead counsel did not seek assistance from another mitigation specialist until he contacted the Ohio Public Defender's Office in May 2014. However, the public defender's office did not have the resources to provide a mitigation specialist. Unable to find another mitigation specialist, lead counsel moved the trial court to reconsider its previous denial. The trial court held a hearing on the motion for reconsideration on June 4, 2014. Thereafter, the trial court appointed lead counsel's wife as the mitigation specialist. The trial court's decision noted that counsel's wife had \"already undertaken some mitigation work in the case, including meeting with the family of the Defendant[.]\"\n\n\u00b6 129 The jury found Myers guilty on all counts and specifications on October 2, 2014. The penalty phase was held on October 6, 2014. In support of his PCR petition, Myers attached the affidavits of lead counsel and the mitigation specialist. Both affidavits\nstate that during the three-day weekend between the jury verdict and the penalty phase, lead counsel and the mitigation specialist met with and interviewed Myers' mother and two of his siblings at the mother's home. That same weekend, they also met with and interviewed Myers' father and stepmother at their home. The affidavits of Myers' parents and stepmother corroborated that the interviews took place that weekend. Myers' stepmother stated the interview was short. Myers' mother stated that her interview lasted about one hour and one half and that she gave photographs to the mitigation specialist at another time and \"spent another hour to an hour and a half with her.\"\n\n{\u00b6 130} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that capital defendants \"[do] not have a constitutional right to a mitigation specialist or a right to an effective one.\" Herring, 2014-Ohio-5228 at \u00b6 113, citing McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d at 399 (no requirement for counsel to hire mitigation specialist in capital case); Drummond, 2006-Ohio-7078 at \u00b6 69 (a mitigation specialist is not a requirement for effective assistance of counsel). The trial court noted that the mitigation specialist \"was a trained attorney who has handled a number of capital cases and therefore has the ability to determine what evidence is effective in the [penalty] phase.\" The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 19 and 20.\n\n{\u00b6 131} Grounds 21, 44, and 45 generally challenge counsel's failure to conduct a comprehensive investigation into Myers' background and counsel's failure to present effective mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of the trial. Specifically, Grounds 21, 44, and 45 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present the expert testimony of clinical forensic psychologist Dr. Bobbie Hopes, failed to consult with and present an expert in adolescent brain development, and failed to effectively present youth as a mitigation factor.\n\n{\u00b6 132} In support of his PCR petition, Myers submitted affidavits and reports from several experts related to adolescent brain development and expressing opinions based\nupon their evaluation of Myers and his mental health and social records. The evidence submitted by Myers generally reflects that individuals of his age are prone to risk taking, peer influence, and impulsivity more akin to adolescents than adults. Myers argues that this evidence established substantive grounds for relief and he is therefore entitled to discovery and an evidentiary hearing on his PCR petition. The state argues that the evidence was not presented as a matter of trial strategy because it was in conflict with defense counsel's mitigation strategy to emphasize Myers' good qualities and was cumulative to evidence presented at the penalty phase.\n\n\u00b6 133 In his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, Myers argued ineffective assistance of counsel in the penalty phase for failure to present any expert testimony. Specifically, Myers asserted that defense counsel \"should have adduced expert testimony to explain the meaning of his self-harming behavior in his early teens and how brain development affects the decision-making of young people.\" Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at \u00b6 198. The supreme court rejected Myers' claim on the ground that \"nothing in the record shows what such expert would have said in the penalty phase[.] Thus, Myers has not demonstrated prejudice from missing such testimony.\" Id. The supreme court further found, \"At trial, the defense requested and received funds to hire a consulting psychologist. The psychologist the defense chose was appointed, but the record does not show what she told Myers's counsel regarding her conclusions. Hence, there is nothing to show deficient performance by counsel.\" Id. at \u00b6 199.\n\n\u00b6 134 In a capital case, \"[d]efense counsel has a duty to investigate the circumstances of his client's case and explore all matters relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty, including the defendant's background, education, employment record, mental and emotional stability, and family relationships.\" State v. Pickens, 141 Ohio St.3d 462, 2014-Ohio-5445, \u00b6 219. Defense counsel has a duty to make reasonable\ninvestigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. *State v. Johnson*, 24 Ohio St.3d 87, 89 (1986). Counsel's \"investigations into mitigating evidence 'should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor.'\" *Wiggins v. Smith*, 539 U.S. 510, 524, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (2003), citing American Bar Association, *ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases*, Section 11.4.1(C), 93 (1989). Given the severity of the potential sentence and the reality that the life of a capital defendant is at stake, it is only after a full investigation of all the mitigating circumstances that counsel can make an informed, tactical decision about which information would be most helpful to the client's case. *Johnson* at 90. \"Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable[.] However, a failure to investigate, especially as to key evidence, must be supported by a reasoned and deliberate determination that investigation was not warranted.\" *O'Hara v. Wigginton*, 24 F.3d 823, 828 (6th Cir.1994). \"An attorney's failure to reasonably investigate the defendant's background and present mitigating evidence to the jury at sentencing can constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\" *Pickens* at \u00b6 219.\n\n\u00b6 135 Myers was examined by Dr. Barzman for purposes of the PCR petition and his report is attached to the petition. Myers was also examined by Dr. Daniel Davis, a forensic psychologist, and his report is attached to the PCR petition. In his report, Dr. Barzman opined that Myers' mental health history, which included significant depressive and manic symptoms, was consistent with bipolar disorder which is associated with increased impulsivity and a focus on immediate gratification.\n\n\u00b6 136 In his report, Dr. Davis stated that the symptoms Myers experienced in high school were associated with bipolar disorder and that he was not fully neurologically\ndeveloped at the time of his crimes and sentencing. Dr. Davis further stated that the trial court and jury were deprived of pertinent psychological information specific to Myers and general psychological research specific to youthful and capital offenders, evidence that would have been extremely helpful to understand Myers' actions and demeanor. In particular, Dr. Davis noted that while Myers' youth was clearly evident at trial, the crimes took place when Myers was still developing neurologically and psychologically, however \"there was no specific testimony as to the considerable scientific literature concerning neurological development in late adolescents and young adults.\" Dr. Davis also noted Myers' apparent lack of remorse for his crimes at sentencing but stated that scientific literature shows that an apparent lack of remorse is not indicative of anything atypical in adolescent males and is typically mistaken as one of the \"signs of the development of a psychopathic personality when they are, in fact, transient features of adolescent development.\" Dr. Davis' report continued,\n\nFurther, abused and neglected children, such as Austin demonstrate a limited range of emotions as a way to cope with very stressful home environments. These research findings apply specifically to Austin. He was raised in a highly neglectful environment. He was at the time of his sentence still in the commonly accepted development stage of late adolescence. Neither the trial court nor jury had this critically important research presented to them[.]\n\n\u00b6 137 In support of his PCR petition, Myers also submitted the affidavits of his lead defense counsel and Dr. Hopes. Lead counsel's affidavit details what he did and did not do. As pertinent here, lead counsel stated he believed \"that everyone close to the process thought that [Myers] would receive a life sentence regardless of the trial phase result, based upon Mosley's plea deal having been the principal offender in the aggravated murder of Justin Back.\" Counsel's affidavit further stated,\n\nI did not consider requesting funding for, or hiring, a youth/adolescent expert to help explain issues, including\nyouth/adolescent brain development, to the jury.\n\nEven though we did retain a psychologist, Dr. Bobbie Hopes, for mitigation, Dr. Hopes told me that she would not be able to provide anything for the jury except for a timeline of Austin's life, something which Dr. Hopes believed Austin's mother could provide and that it would be better if it came from her. Given her statements to me, I was concerned that if Dr Hopes presented this information to the jury, it would just be seen as \"psychobabble.\"\n\nWhen Austin's mother * * * did not effectively provide such a timeline as I had anticipated and that [the mitigation specialist] and I had worked with her on, I did not think to then call Dr. Bobbie Hopes to the stand to testify.\n\n{\u00b6 138} Lead counsel's averments were contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. Dr. Hopes evaluated Myers three times in August 2014, for a total of six hours, for purposes of death penalty mitigation. Dr. Hopes averred that she provided lead counsel with a report in which she expressed the opinion that Myers' age, his history of childhood physical abuse, including his history of being diagnosed and treated for depression, and his history of self-mutilation were mitigation factors. Following Myers' conviction for aggravated murder, lead counsel called Dr. Hopes and told her he did not intend to use her as a mitigation expert. Dr. Hopes suggested that Myers' age and relevant research on adolescent brain development were strong mitigation factors but was told by lead counsel that information about youth had come out during jury selection. Dr. Hopes averred that she was willing and prepared to testify about age and adolescent brain development research. Dr. Hopes further averred that she never advised lead counsel that she could only present a timeline of Myers' life and that she never discussed a timeline with counsel.\n\n{\u00b6 139} As stated above, \"[i]n a petition for post-conviction relief, which asserts ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner bears the initial burden to submit evidentiary documents containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness.\" Jackson, 64\nOhio St.2d 107 at syllabus. In order to secure an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner need not prove counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Rather, the PCR petition only needs to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.\n\n\u00b6 140 Upon reviewing the reports of Drs. Barzman and Davis and the affidavits of Dr. Hopes and lead defense counsel, we find that Myers has provided evidentiary documents setting forth sufficient operative facts to warrant an evidentiary hearing on his PCR petition regarding his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony at the penalty phase of the trial.\n\n\u00b6 141 Defense counsel has the affirmative duty to investigate mitigating evidence. State v. Herring, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08-MA-213, 2011-Ohio-662, \u00b6 55. Defense counsel \"can make the decision to forego the presentation of evidence, but only after a full investigation.\" Id. It is only after a full investigation of all the mitigating circumstances that counsel can make an informed, tactical decision about which information would be most helpful to their client's case. Johnson, 24 Ohio St.3d at 89.\n\n\u00b6 142 Lead counsel's averment that he did not consider requesting funding for, or hiring, a youth/adolescent expert to explain issues regarding adolescent brain development to the jury fails to indicate counsel's motivation and instead suggests that counsel's failure to present such expert testimony was not the product of an informed, tactical decision. That is, counsel's averment shows he did not engage into a reasoned and careful consideration of such expert testimony before ultimately rejecting it. The same can be said about counsel's failure to have Dr. Hopes testify as an expert witness at the penalty phase. While counsel averred in his affidavit that Dr. Hopes did not testify because she could only provide a timeline of Myers' life, this averment was explicitly contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. There is little evidence documenting the extent of defense counsel's reasoning for his\ninvestigation and decision making regarding expert testimony mitigation evidence.\n\n{\u00b6 143} The state argues that mitigation evidence regarding Myers\u2019 dysfunctional family, self-mutilation, and mental health issues such as childhood depression and bipolar disorder, was presented through the testimony of his mother at the penalty phase, and thus, much of the psychological testimony that Drs. Hopes, Barzman, and Davis could have presented would have been cumulative. However, Myers\u2019 mother's testimony was much more limited on the issue. Myers\u2019 mother testified that the deterioration of her marriage did not seem to affect Myers, that she had not noticed Myers' self-mutilation, and that she believed Kettering Hospital initially diagnosed Myers with bipolar disorder. There was no testimony regarding Myers' childhood depression. Furthermore, Myers\u2019 mother is not qualified to provide the expert testimony necessary to contextualize the factors above.\n\n{\u00b6 144} The state next argues that presenting this expert testimony at the penalty phase would have been inconsistent with defense counsel's mitigation theory emphasizing Myers' good qualities and the positive influence he could have in his siblings' lives. Thus, the state asserts, defense counsel's decision not to present such testimony was trial strategy which should not be second-guessed.\n\n{\u00b6 145} However, lead counsel's affidavit does not advance this as the reason he did not present Dr. Hopes' expert testimony at the penalty phase. Lead counsel avers only that he did not call Dr. Hopes as a witness because she could only provide a timeline of Myers' life, an averment explicitly contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. Whether it was defense counsel's mitigation strategy to emphasize Myers' qualities, which counsel's affidavit does not suggest, it is not apparent why such strategy excludes a parallel strategy to contextualize Myers' youth in light of the science on adolescent brain development. As her affidavit clearly indicates, Dr. Hopes was prepared and available to testify about these issues and advised lead counsel on the eve of the penalty phase that Myers' age and\nrelevant research on adolescent brain development were strong mitigation factors. And while a decision by defense counsel to present only positive mitigation can be a sound trial strategy, counsel's decision to pursue a positive-mitigation theory can properly be made only after counsel has conducted a full mitigation investigation. *Herring*, 2014-Ohio-5228 at \u00b6 90.\n\n{\u00b6 146} The state further asserts that defense counsel did argue that Myers was only 19 years old at the time of the crimes. Counsel did briefly ask the jury to take Myers' age into consideration as a mitigation factor. However, counsel never developed the significance of Myers' youth as a mitigating factor.\n\n{\u00b6 147} In light of the foregoing, we find that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing. The trial court further erred in finding that Myers did not establish good cause to conduct discovery regarding his claim counsel was ineffective at the penalty phase in failing to present expert testimony on adolescent brain development in conjunction with Myers' age and mental health issues. Myers' claims are \"neither patently frivolous nor palpably incredible\" and \"the discovery he requests\" in the form of depositions of the defense team is \"limited and reasonably calculated to lead to evidence in support of his claim[.]\" *Hill*, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71975 at *31-32; *Johnson v. Bobby*, S.D.Ohio No. 2:08-cv-55, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103351 (Sept. 30, 2010); *Stallings v. Bradshaw*, N.D.Ohio No. 5:05CV0722, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97540 (Feb. 28, 2006).\n\n{\u00b6 148} We therefore remand this case for the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition which allege ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase for failing to present expert testimony on adolescent brain development in conjunction with Myers' age and mental health issues. The advantages that an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition based on ineffective assistance of counsel\ncan provide a trial judge are well established:\n\nThe trial judge can delve into the motivation or reasoning of trial counsel through trial counsel's testimony. The court can hear the testimony of witnesses that were never called to testify at the original trial, and can determine the worth of their testimony as well as the witnesses' credibility. The trial judge can ask what the counsel knew, when he knew it, and whether a mistake was not strategic, but was instead careless. As here, in a postconviction hearing, a judge can hear testimony about what evidence was made available to trial counsel and when it was made available. A trial court in a postconviction proceeding thus plays a unique role in the consideration of ineffective assistance of counsel claims. It is the only court that actually hears testimony on that issue.\n\nState v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, \u00b6 54.\n\n\u00b6 149 Myers' fifth assignment of error is sustained. To the extent noted above, Myers' second and third assignments of error are sustained in part.\n\n5. Cumulative Errors\n\n\u00b6 150 Assignment of Error No. 10:\n\n\u00b6 151 THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C), MYERS' CLAIM OF CUMULATIVE ERROR (GROUND 60), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.\n\n\u00b6 152 Myers argues the trial court erred in dismissing Ground 60 which alleges cumulative errors. We include under this assignment of error Myers' claims that the trial court erred in dismissing Grounds 18 and 49, which allege cumulative effect of the denial of effective assistance of counsel during the guilt and penalty phases of the trial (as initially argued in the fifth and sixth assignments of error). Under the doctrine of cumulative errors, a judgment may be reversed if the cumulative effect of errors deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute\ncause for reversal. *State v. Kirkland*, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, \u00b6 140. Given our resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth assignments of error, this assignment of error is moot. See *State v. Stein*, 3d Dist. Logan No. 8-17-39, 2018-Ohio-2621, citing App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 153 In light of our resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth assignments of error, the trial court's judgments denying Myers' motions for discovery and his PCR petition regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to present expert testimony at the penalty phase of the trial are reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Specifically, on remand, the trial court shall permit discovery, conduct an evidentiary hearing, and rule on Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition.\n\n\u00b6 154 Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\nHENDRICKSON, P.J., and S.

Votel, Preble County Prosecuting Attorney, Gractia S. Manning, 101 East Main \nStreet, Eaton, Ohio 45320, for appellee \n \nWilliam O. Cass, Jr., 135 W. Dorothy Lane, Suite 117, Kettering, Ohio 45429, for appellant \n \n \n \n PIPER, J.  \n{\u00b6 1} In November 2017, the Preble County Sheriff's Office used a confidential \ninformant to conduct a controlled buy of methamphetamine from appellant, Brian Shaner.  \nThe transaction occurred in the parking lot of a local medical facility where appellant's motor \nvehicle was parked.  Appellant had his infant child with him in the car during the drug sale.   \n{\u00b6 2} Appellant was subsequently indicted for three offenses: aggravated trafficking \nin drugs, a second-degree felony; aggravated possession of drugs, a third-degree felony; and Preble CA2018-09-013 \n \n - 2 - \nendangering children, a first-degree misdemeanor.  The case proceeded to a one-day jury \ntrial on June 11, 2018 and the jury found appellant guilty as charged.   \n{\u00b6 3} Within fourteen days of the jury's verdict, appellant's trial attorney filed a written \nmotion for a new trial based on alleged discovery violations.  The trial court denied the \nmotion.  Meanwhile, appellant's trial counsel indicated to the prosecutor that juror misconduct \nmay have occurred.  The prosecutor notified the court by filing a notice of alleged jury \nmisconduct.  The trial court appointed new counsel for appellant and scheduled a hearing on \nthe matter.   \n{\u00b6 4} At the end of the hearing, appellant's new trial counsel suggested a new trial \nwas appropriate.  The court assumed the request was an oral motion for a new trial, but \ndisagreed, finding that no misconduct occurred and denied the motion.  The case then \nproceeded to sentencing.  The court merged the drug trafficking and possession offenses \nand sentenced appellant to an aggregate four-year prison term. \n{\u00b6 5} Appellant now appeals his convictions, raising two assignments of error. \n{\u00b6 6} Assignment of Error No. 1: \n{\u00b6 7} THE JURY'S FINDING OF GUILTY WAS BASED ON INSUFFICIENT \nEVIDENCE AND WAS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE. \n{\u00b6 8} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that his conviction was not \nsupported by sufficient evidence and was otherwise against the manifest weight of the \nevidence.   \n{\u00b6 9} The concepts of sufficiency of the evidence and weight of the evidence are both \nquantitatively and qualitatively different.  State v. Couch, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2016-03-\n062, 2016-Ohio-8452, \u00b6 9, citing State v. Thompkins , 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386 (1997).  \nSufficiency of the evidence is the concept of whether the conviction can be supported as a \nmatter of law.  State v. Green, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2017-11-161, 2018-Ohio-3991, \u00b6 25. Preble CA2018-09-013 \n \n - 3 - \nThe standard of review for a sufficiency of the evidence challenge is whether any rational trier \nof fact could have found the prosecution prov ed the essential elements of the criminal \noffense beyond a reasonable doubt, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the \nprosecutor.  State v. Beverly, 143 Ohio St.3d 258, 2015-Ohio-219, \u00b6 15.  On a sufficiency \nchallenge, the reviewing court will not consider the credibility of the witnesses.  State v. Wilks, \n154 Ohio St.3d 359, 2018-Ohio-1562, \u00b6 162.  Inst ead, the appellate court will defer to the \ntrier of fact on questions of credibility and weight.  State v. Kirkland, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-\nOhio-1966, \u00b6 132. \n{\u00b6 10} A manifest weight challenge, on the other hand, requires the appellate court \nexamine the evidence to determine whether the \"greater amount of credible evidence\" \nsupports one side of the issue over the other.  State v. Bell, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2008-\n05-044, 2009-Ohio-2335, \u00b6 57.  As such the appellate court must review the entire record,  \nweigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the \ncredibility of the witnesses, and determine whether in resolving \nthe conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way \nand created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the \nconviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. \n \nState v. Spencer, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2018-08-082, 2019-Ohio-2165, \u00b6 21.  While the \nissue of credibility is relevant to the mani fest weight review, an appellate court \"must be \nmindful the trier of fact has the primary role of weighing the evidence and evaluating witness \ncredibility.\"  State v. Salinger, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2014-10-208, 2015-Ohio-2821, \u00b6 15, \nciting State v. DeHass , 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 231 (1967).  An  appellate court will overturn a \nconviction only in \"extraordinary circumstances to correct a manifest miscarriage of justice, \nand only when the evidence presented at trial weighs heavily in favor of acquittal.\"  State v. \nCobb, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2007-06-153, 2008-Ohio-5210, \u00b6 95, citing Thompkins, 78 \nOhio St.3d at 387. \n{\u00b6 11} To convict appellant for the aggravated trafficking offense the prosecutor had to Preble CA2018-09-013 \n \n - 4 - \nprove that appellant knowingly sold, or offered to sell, a controlled substance or controlled \nsubstance analog.  R.C. 2925.03(A)(1).  For th is offense to constitute a second-degree \nfelony, the prosecutor had to prove that the amount of the drug exceeded the bulk amount, \nbut was less than five times the bulk amount, and appellant committed the offense \"in the \nvicinity of a juvenile.\"  R.C. 2925.03(C)(1)(c).  Regarding the aggravated possession offense, \nthe prosecutor had to prove that appellant knowingly obtained, possessed, or used a \ncontrolled substance or a controlled substance analog.  R.C. 2925.11(A).  For this offense to \nconstitute a third-degree felony, the prosec utor had to prove that appellant possessed an \namount of the drug greater than the bulk amount, but less than five times the bulk amount.  \nR.C. 2925.11(C)(1)(b).   \n{\u00b6 12} As relevant here, the controlled substance appellant was accused of trafficking \nwas methamphetamine, a schedule II substance pursuant to R.C. 3719.41.  The bulk amount \nof a schedule II substance is three grams.  R.C. 2925.01(D)(1)(g).  The requisite mental state \nfor these offenses was knowingly.  This mental state is defined as \"regardless of purpose, \nwhen the person is aware that the person\u2019s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will \nprobably be of a certain nature.\"  R.C. 2901.22(B).   \n{\u00b6 13} After review of the record, this court finds that the evidence was sufficient to \nconvict appellant of both drug offenses and was not otherwise against the manifest weight of \nthe evidence.  At trial the prosecutor presented testimony from three witnesses: two \ndetectives from the Preble County Sheriff's Office and a confidential informant.  Both \ndetectives testified that before the target drug buy, they observed a female correctional \nofficer perform a patdown search of the confidential informant to check the informant for \ncontraband.  This search yielded nothing.  The detectives further testified that at least one \nofficer was present with the informant up to the time the informant made contact with \nappellant and after the buy.  The first detective testified that during the transaction he acted Preble CA2018-09-013 \n \n - 5 - \nas the \"cover\" officer to provide overwatch of the operation.  In his position as overwatch, he \nwas able to observe appellant  and his girlfriend exit t he medical facility and approach \nappellant's vehicle in the parking lot prior to the transaction.   \n{\u00b6 14} The second detective testified that he rode in the vehicle with the informant to \nthe parking lot of the medical facility.  Th is detective provided the informant with an \naudio/visual recording device.  Upon arrival, the second detective testified that he and the \ninformant exited the vehicle and walked to their respective positions.  The informant headed \ntowards appellant's vehicle, while the second detective walked into the medical facility to \nobserve the transaction through a window of the building.  This detective testified that he \nobserved appellant and his girlfriend walk towards appellant's vehicle from the medical \nbuildings.  Appellant was carrying an infant child.  The detective then testified he watched the \ninformant meet appellant and the girlfriend at the vehicle.  The informant and appellant \nmoved to the passenger side of the vehicle out of the detective's line of sight, so the \ndetective was unable to see the exchange occur.  During this time the detective saw the child \nin the rear seat of the vehicle on the driver's side.  After the transaction, the detective testified \nthat he met the informant in the medical building and received the bag of suspected \nmethamphetamine from the informant. \n{\u00b6 15} Finally, the informant testified that prior to the target purchase she did not \npossess any type of contraband.  She then testified that she approached appellant's vehicle \nin the parking lot, saw a child in the back seat of the vehicle, and engaged in casual \nconversation with appellant's girlfriend before moving to the passenger side of the car to \nconduct the exchange and retrieve the methamphetamine.  The informant testified that while \nshe gave appellant money for the sale, she was unsure of whether she directly handed him \nthe cash or if she placed the money inside the car.  After the sale, the informant walked away \nfrom appellant's vehicle and into the medical facility.  She then convened with the second Preble CA2018-09-013 \n \n - 6 - \ndetective and provided him the methamphetamine. \n{\u00b6 16} In addition to testimony, the prosecutor admitted into evidence the bag of \nmethamphetamine, a laboratory analysis report that established that the substance was \naround 6.98 grams of methamphetamine, and a video of the transaction.  While the video \nalone was not dispositive of the drug sale, it did corroborate the testimonies of the three \nwitnesses.  Unfortunately, the video only captured images of the ground and the subjects' \nfeet during the transaction.  Nevertheless, at the point of the suspected transaction, the video \nshows that of the three individuals present, the informant moved away from the girlfriend and \nstood near appellant, at which time a zipping sound can be heard indicating appellant was \nretrieving something from a zippered bag. \n{\u00b6 17} Consequently, the evidence established that appellant knowingly possessed \nand then sold 6.98 grams of methamphetamine to the confidential informant in the presence \nof appellant's infant child.  The testimony from the witnesses, the laboratory report, the video, \nand the bag of methamphetamine together comprised sufficient proof that any rational trier of \nfact could have found the essential elements of the trafficking and possession offenses \nproven beyond a reasonable doubt.     \n{\u00b6 18} Furthermore, this court finds that the jury did not clearly lose its way and create \na manifest miscarriage of justice when it found appellant guilty.  Appellant argues that the \nconfidential informant had a self-serving motive to carry out the drug sale, or was otherwise \nbiased, because her aid in this investigation would lead to the state dismissing charges \nagainst her.  However, the record shows that the informant was searched for contraband \nprior to the operation and nothing was found.  Moreover, the detectives testified that they did \nnot have any reason to believe that the methamphetamine did not come from appellant as a \npart of the transaction, because they were able to observe the informant throughout the \noperation.  The guilty verdicts indicate that the jury found the informant's and detectives' Preble CA2018-09-013 \n \n - 7 - \ntestimony credible.  Therefore, this is not a case where the evidence weighs heavily in favor \nof appellant.  The drug offense convictions were not against the manifest weight of the \nevidence.   \n{\u00b6 19} Next, to convict appellant for the endangering children offense, the prosecutor \nhad to prove that appellant was a \"parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or \ncontrol of a child or person in loco parentis of under eighteen years of age\" and created a \n\"substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a duty of care, protection, or \nsupport.\"  R.C. 2919.22(A).  The prosecutor had to prove that the appellant acted with the \nculpable mental state of recklessness.  State v. McGee, 79 Ohio St.3d 193, 195 (1997).  This \nmeans the prosecutor had to show that appell ant acted with \"heedless indifference to the \nconsequences\" and disregarded a \"substantial and unjustifiable risk\" that his conduct was \n\"likely to cause a certain result.\"  R.C. 2901.22(C).  For our purposes, a substantial risk is \"a \nstrong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result \nmay occur or that certain circumstances may exist.\" R.C. 2901.01(A)(8).   \n{\u00b6 20} Other Ohio appellate districts have held that permitting illegal drugs to be in the \npresence of children is sufficient to constitute a violation of R.C. 2919.22(A).  State v. Ray, 2d \nDist. Montgomery No. 24536, 2012-Ohio-840, \u00b6 16; State v. Thompson, 3d Dist. Seneca No. \n13-17-26, 2018-Ohio-637, \u00b6 95; see also State v. Norris, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 14CA010699, \n2015-Ohio-5180, \u00b6 17.  Moreover, this court has previously explained that dealing drugs is, \nitself, \"inherently dangerous.\"  State v. Workman, 12th Dist. Clermont Nos. CA2016-10-065 \nand CA2016-10-066, 2017-Ohio-2802, \u00b6 24. \n{\u00b6 21} In State v. Ray, supra, the Second District Court of Appeals considered a case \nwith similar facts to the case sub judice.  In that case, the defendant and her boyfriend \nbrought the defendant's five-year-old child along with them when they went to purchase \nheroin.  The child was present when police arrested the defendant and found heroin on the Preble CA2018-09-013 \n \n - 8 - \ncodefendant and drug paraphernalia in the defendant's house.  Ray at \u00b6 16.  Even though \npolice apprehended the defendant after the sale, the Ray court held there was \"legally \nsufficient evidence to support a child-endangering conviction based on [the defendant's] act \nof transporting her child to a drug buy especially when the occupants of the vehicle return \nwith the drugs in their possession.\"  Id.   \n{\u00b6 22} In this case, the second detective and the confidential informant testified that \nthey saw appellant with an infant child at the time the drug sale was made.  Moreover, the \nfirst detective testified that he knew the child was present with appellant.  The informant \ntestified that appellant produced the methamphetamine from a bag located in the passenger \ncompartment.  This would obviously be near the child's position in the rear seat of the \nvehicle.  Whether appellant possessed more drugs in the vehicle after the sale is irrelevant \nbecause the evidence shows that appellant permitted a child under his control to be in close \nproximity to methamphetamine.  Therefore, there was sufficient evidence that any rational \ntrier of fact could have found the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.   \n{\u00b6 23} Turning to the manifest weight challenge, the facts are such that we do not find \nthe jury clearly lost its way.  While it is true that law enforcement did not act immediately to \narrest appellant and that the child may have been adequately restrained in a child safety \nseat, these facts do not weigh against the conviction.  Appellant permitted illegal and \ndangerous drugs to be near a child under his control.  This again is not a case where the \nevidence weighs in favor of acquittal and the jury's verdict created a manifest miscarriage of \njustice.   \n{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant for each offense \nand these convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.  Appellant's first \nassignment of error is overruled.   \n{\u00b6 25} Assignment of Error No. 2: Preble CA2018-09-013 \n \n - 9 - \n{\u00b6 26} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT GRANT THE APPELLANT A \nNEW TRIAL BASED UPON JUROR MISCONDUCT. \n{\u00b6 27} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court abused \nits discretion when it denied his motion for a new trial because the court improperly decided \nno juror misconduct occurred. \n{\u00b6 28} The decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial pursuant to Crim.R. 33 is \nwithin the discretion of the trial court.  State v. Brakeall, 12th Dist. Fayette Nos. CA2008-06-\n022 and CA2008-06-023, 2009-Ohio-3542, \u00b6 9.  An appellate court reviews the trial court's \ndecision for an abuse of discretion.  State v. Carroll, 12th Dist. Clermont Nos. CA2007-02-\n030 and CA2007-03-041, 2007-Ohio-7075, \u00b6 64.  A motion for new trial must be made within \nfourteen days of the jury's verdict.  Crim.R. 33(B).  Appellant's counsel filed a motion for new \ntrial on June 25, 2018 which suggested prosecutorial misconduct, not juror misconduct.  \nAppellant's motion was denied July 26, 2018.  There was no formal motion for a new trial \nbased on juror misconduct made within fourteen days of the jury's verdict and in any event, \nthere were no supporting affidavits provided as required by Crim.R. 33(C).  However, \nbecause the state does not assert these reasons for supporting the trial court's denial of a \nnew trial, we will address the merits of appellant's argument. \n{\u00b6 29} In criminal trials, the accused has the constitutional right to be tried before a fair \nand impartial jury.  State v. Villarreal, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2004-02-035, 2005-Ohio-1924, \n\u00b6 37, citing Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444 (1968) and Article I, Section \n10, Ohio Constitution.  This means a \"jury must decide a case solely on the evidence before \nit, and not reach its verdict based upon influences outside the courtroom.\" Villarreal at \u00b6 37.  \nA deviation from this standard constitutes juror misconduct.  State v. Taylor, 73 Ohio App.3d \n827, 831 (4th Dist.1991).  The determination of juror misconduct requires a two-part analysis. \n Id. at 833.  First, the court must determine if juror misconduct occurred.  Id.  Second, the Preble CA2018-09-013 \n \n - 10 - \ncourt must determine whether the misconduc t materially prejudiced the defendant's \nsubstantial rights.  Id.1   \n{\u00b6 30} In this case, appellant argues that one of the jurors used outside information by \nsuggesting the possibility that the juror used the clerk of court's website to look up appellant's \ncriminal history to find appellant guilty.  The trial court held a hearing on the matter in which \nappellant's former trial counsel and the juror testified.  The juror testified that she rode in the \nelevator with appellant's former counsel and briefly chatted with the attorney before exiting \nthe elevator.  The juror acknowledged that the attorney had remarked about the speed of the \nguilty verdict, but the juror testified that she only mentioned that people were sick of drugs in \nresponse to the statement.  The juror denied accessing any court records or otherwise being \ninfluenced by outside information.   \n{\u00b6 31} Next, appellant's former counsel testified that after the trial she rode the \nelevator with the juror.  During the ride she engaged in a conversation with the juror about the \nquickness with which the jury arrived at the guilty verdict.  According to the former counsel, \nthe juror told her the reason they convicted appellant was because appellant had \"done it \nbefore.\"  However, the attorney later admitted that the juror in the elevator did not expressly \ntell her that she looked up appellant's prior record. \n{\u00b6 32} As part of its reason for denying the motion for a new trial, the trial court found \nthere was no credible evidence that juror misconduct occurred.  This court agrees.  \nAppellant's argument suggesting juror misconduct is unsupported and premised upon \ninferences from mere possibilities, not established facts.  The trial court was in the best \nposition to determine credibility of the witnesses.  Since no misconduct occurred, appellant \n                     \n1.  We note the aliunde rule, Evid.R. 606(B), is not implicated herein.  Neither party raised the rule's application \nand the juror's testimony was not offered to impeach the jury's verdict, but rather to give clarification and context \nto the conversation that took place as previously reported by appellant's former trial counsel. Preble CA2018-09-013 \n \n - 11 - \ncannot show prejudice.  Consequently, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it \ndenied appellant's motion for a new trial.  Accordingly, appellant's second assignment of error \nis overruled.   \n{\u00b6 33} Judgment affirmed. \n \n RINGLAND, P.J., and S. POWELL, J., concur.

CA2018-09-013\n\nOPINION\n7/15/2019\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL FROM PREBLE COUNTY COURT OF COMMON PLEAS\nCase No. 17-CR12522\n\nMartin P. Votel, Preble County Prosecuting Attorney, Gractia S. Manning, 101 East Main Street, Eaton, Ohio 45320, for appellee\n\nWilliam O. Cass, Jr., 135 W. Dorothy Lane, Suite 117, Kettering, Ohio 45429, for appellant\n\nPIPER, J.\n\n\u00b6 1 In November 2017, the Preble County Sheriff's Office used a confidential informant to conduct a controlled buy of methamphetamine from appellant, Brian Shaner. The transaction occurred in the parking lot of a local medical facility where appellant's motor vehicle was parked. Appellant had his infant child with him in the car during the drug sale.\n\n\u00b6 2 Appellant was subsequently indicted for three offenses: aggravated trafficking in drugs, a second-degree felony; aggravated possession of drugs, a third-degree felony; and\nendangering children, a first-degree misdemeanor. The case proceeded to a one-day jury trial on June 11, 2018 and the jury found appellant guilty as charged.\n\n\u00b6 3 Within fourteen days of the jury's verdict, appellant's trial attorney filed a written motion for a new trial based on alleged discovery violations. The trial court denied the motion. Meanwhile, appellant's trial counsel indicated to the prosecutor that juror misconduct may have occurred. The prosecutor notified the court by filing a notice of alleged jury misconduct. The trial court appointed new counsel for appellant and scheduled a hearing on the matter.\n\n\u00b6 4 At the end of the hearing, appellant's new trial counsel suggested a new trial was appropriate. The court assumed the request was an oral motion for a new trial, but disagreed, finding that no misconduct occurred and denied the motion. The case then proceeded to sentencing. The court merged the drug trafficking and possession offenses and sentenced appellant to an aggregate four-year prison term.\n\n\u00b6 5 Appellant now appeals his convictions, raising two assignments of error.\n\n\u00b6 6 Assignment of Error No. 1:\n\n\u00b6 7 THE JURY'S FINDING OF GUILTY WAS BASED ON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND WAS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\n\n\u00b6 8 In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence and was otherwise against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n\u00b6 9 The concepts of sufficiency of the evidence and weight of the evidence are both quantitatively and qualitatively different. State v. Couch, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2016-03-062, 2016-Ohio-8452, \u00b6 9, citing State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386 (1997). Sufficiency of the evidence is the concept of whether the conviction can be supported as a matter of law. State v. Green, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2017-11-161, 2018-Ohio-3991, \u00b6 25.\nThe standard of review for a sufficiency of the evidence challenge is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the prosecution proved the essential elements of the criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecutor. *State v. Beverly*, 143 Ohio St.3d 258, 2015-Ohio-219, \u00b6 15. On a sufficiency challenge, the reviewing court will not consider the credibility of the witnesses. *State v. Wilks*, 154 Ohio St.3d 359, 2018-Ohio-1562, \u00b6 162. Instead, the appellate court will defer to the trier of fact on questions of credibility and weight. *State v. Kirkland*, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, \u00b6 132.\n\n\u00b6 10 A manifest weight challenge, on the other hand, requires the appellate court examine the evidence to determine whether the \"greater amount of credible evidence\" supports one side of the issue over the other. *State v. Bell*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2008-05-044, 2009-Ohio-2335, \u00b6 57. As such the appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether in resolving the conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. *State v. Spencer*, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2018-08-082, 2019-Ohio-2165, \u00b6 21. While the issue of credibility is relevant to the manifest weight review, an appellate court \"must be mindful the trier of fact has the primary role of weighing the evidence and evaluating witness credibility.\" *State v. Salinger*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2014-10-208, 2015-Ohio-2821, \u00b6 15, citing *State v. DeHass*, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 231 (1967). An appellate court will overturn a conviction only in \"extraordinary circumstances to correct a manifest miscarriage of justice, and only when the evidence presented at trial weighs heavily in favor of acquittal.\" *State v. Cobb*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2007-06-153, 2008-Ohio-5210, \u00b6 95, citing *Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387.\n\n\u00b6 11 To convict appellant for the aggravated trafficking offense the prosecutor had to\nprove that appellant knowingly sold, or offered to sell, a controlled substance or controlled substance analog. R.C. 2925.03(A)(1). For this offense to constitute a second-degree felony, the prosecutor had to prove that the amount of the drug exceeded the bulk amount, but was less than five times the bulk amount, and appellant committed the offense \u201cin the vicinity of a juvenile.\u201d R.C. 2925.03(C)(1)(c). Regarding the aggravated possession offense, the prosecutor had to prove that appellant knowingly obtained, possessed, or used a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog. R.C. 2925.11(A). For this offense to constitute a third-degree felony, the prosecutor had to prove that appellant possessed an amount of the drug greater than the bulk amount, but less than five times the bulk amount. R.C. 2925.11(C)(1)(b).\n\n\u00b6 12 As relevant here, the controlled substance appellant was accused of trafficking was methamphetamine, a schedule II substance pursuant to R.C. 3719.41. The bulk amount of a schedule II substance is three grams. R.C. 2925.01(D)(1)(g). The requisite mental state for these offenses was knowingly. This mental state is defined as \"regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person\u2019s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature.\" R.C. 2901.22(B).\n\n\u00b6 13 After review of the record, this court finds that the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of both drug offenses and was not otherwise against the manifest weight of the evidence. At trial the prosecutor presented testimony from three witnesses: two detectives from the Preble County Sheriff\u2019s Office and a confidential informant. Both detectives testified that before the target drug buy, they observed a female correctional officer perform a patdown search of the confidential informant to check the informant for contraband. This search yielded nothing. The detectives further testified that at least one officer was present with the informant up to the time the informant made contact with appellant and after the buy. The first detective testified that during the transaction he acted\nas the \"cover\" officer to provide overwatch of the operation. In his position as overwatch, he was able to observe appellant and his girlfriend exit the medical facility and approach appellant's vehicle in the parking lot prior to the transaction.\n\n\u00b6 14 The second detective testified that he rode in the vehicle with the informant to the parking lot of the medical facility. This detective provided the informant with an audio/visual recording device. Upon arrival, the second detective testified that he and the informant exited the vehicle and walked to their respective positions. The informant headed towards appellant's vehicle, while the second detective walked into the medical facility to observe the transaction through a window of the building. This detective testified that he observed appellant and his girlfriend walk towards appellant's vehicle from the medical buildings. Appellant was carrying an infant child. The detective then testified he watched the informant meet appellant and the girlfriend at the vehicle. The informant and appellant moved to the passenger side of the vehicle out of the detective's line of sight, so the detective was unable to see the exchange occur. During this time the detective saw the child in the rear seat of the vehicle on the driver's side. After the transaction, the detective testified that he met the informant in the medical building and received the bag of suspected methamphetamine from the informant.\n\n\u00b6 15 Finally, the informant testified that prior to the target purchase she did not possess any type of contraband. She then testified that she approached appellant's vehicle in the parking lot, saw a child in the back seat of the vehicle, and engaged in casual conversation with appellant's girlfriend before moving to the passenger side of the car to conduct the exchange and retrieve the methamphetamine. The informant testified that while she gave appellant money for the sale, she was unsure of whether she directly handed him the cash or if she placed the money inside the car. After the sale, the informant walked away from appellant's vehicle and into the medical facility. She then convened with the second\ndetective and provided him the methamphetamine.\n\n{\u00b6 16} In addition to testimony, the prosecutor admitted into evidence the bag of methamphetamine, a laboratory analysis report that established that the substance was around 6.98 grams of methamphetamine, and a video of the transaction. While the video alone was not dispositive of the drug sale, it did corroborate the testimonies of the three witnesses. Unfortunately, the video only captured images of the ground and the subjects' feet during the transaction. Nevertheless, at the point of the suspected transaction, the video shows that of the three individuals present, the informant moved away from the girlfriend and stood near appellant, at which time a zipping sound can be heard indicating appellant was retrieving something from a zippered bag.\n\n{\u00b6 17} Consequently, the evidence established that appellant knowingly possessed and then sold 6.98 grams of methamphetamine to the confidential informant in the presence of appellant's infant child. The testimony from the witnesses, the laboratory report, the video, and the bag of methamphetamine together comprised sufficient proof that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the trafficking and possession offenses proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n{\u00b6 18} Furthermore, this court finds that the jury did not clearly lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice when it found appellant guilty. Appellant argues that the confidential informant had a self-serving motive to carry out the drug sale, or was otherwise biased, because her aid in this investigation would lead to the state dismissing charges against her. However, the record shows that the informant was searched for contraband prior to the operation and nothing was found. Moreover, the detectives testified that they did not have any reason to believe that the methamphetamine did not come from appellant as a part of the transaction, because they were able to observe the informant throughout the operation. The guilty verdicts indicate that the jury found the informant's and detectives'\ntestimony credible. Therefore, this is not a case where the evidence weighs heavily in favor of appellant. The drug offense convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n\u00b6 19 Next, to convict appellant for the endangering children offense, the prosecutor had to prove that appellant was a \"parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control of a child or person in loco parentis of under eighteen years of age\" and created a \"substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a duty of care, protection, or support.\" R.C. 2919.22(A). The prosecutor had to prove that the appellant acted with the culpable mental state of recklessness. State v. McGee, 79 Ohio St.3d 193, 195 (1997). This means the prosecutor had to show that appellant acted with \"heedless indifference to the consequences\" and disregarded a \"substantial and unjustifiable risk\" that his conduct was \"likely to cause a certain result.\" R.C. 2901.22(C). For our purposes, a substantial risk is \"a strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.\" R.C. 2901.01(A)(8).\n\n\u00b6 20 Other Ohio appellate districts have held that permitting illegal drugs to be in the presence of children is sufficient to constitute a violation of R.C. 2919.22(A). State v. Ray, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24536, 2012-Ohio-840, \u00b6 16; State v. Thompson, 3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-17-26, 2018-Ohio-637, \u00b6 95; see also State v. Norris, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 14CA010699, 2015-Ohio-5180, \u00b6 17. Moreover, this court has previously explained that dealing drugs is, itself, \"inherently dangerous.\" State v. Workman, 12th Dist. Clermont Nos. CA2016-10-065 and CA2016-10-066, 2017-Ohio-2802, \u00b6 24.\n\n\u00b6 21 In State v. Ray, supra, the Second District Court of Appeals considered a case with similar facts to the case sub judice. In that case, the defendant and her boyfriend brought the defendant's five-year-old child along with them when they went to purchase heroin. The child was present when police arrested the defendant and found heroin on the\ncodefendant and drug paraphernalia in the defendant's house. Ray at \u00b6 16. Even though police apprehended the defendant after the sale, the Ray court held there was \"legally sufficient evidence to support a child-endangering conviction based on [the defendant's] act of transporting her child to a drug buy especially when the occupants of the vehicle return with the drugs in their possession.\" Id.\n\n{\u00b6 22} In this case, the second detective and the confidential informant testified that they saw appellant with an infant child at the time the drug sale was made. Moreover, the first detective testified that he knew the child was present with appellant. The informant testified that appellant produced the methamphetamine from a bag located in the passenger compartment. This would obviously be near the child's position in the rear seat of the vehicle. Whether appellant possessed more drugs in the vehicle after the sale is irrelevant because the evidence shows that appellant permitted a child under his control to be in close proximity to methamphetamine. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n{\u00b6 23} Turning to the manifest weight challenge, the facts are such that we do not find the jury clearly lost its way. While it is true that law enforcement did not act immediately to arrest appellant and that the child may have been adequately restrained in a child safety seat, these facts do not weigh against the conviction. Appellant permitted illegal and dangerous drugs to be near a child under his control. This again is not a case where the evidence weighs in favor of acquittal and the jury's verdict created a manifest miscarriage of justice.\n\n{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant for each offense and these convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Appellant's first assignment of error is overruled.\n\n{\u00b6 25} Assignment of Error No. 2:\n{\u00b6 26} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT GRANT THE APPELLANT A NEW TRIAL BASED UPON JUROR MISCONDUCT.\n\n{\u00b6 27} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a new trial because the court improperly decided no juror misconduct occurred.\n\n{\u00b6 28} The decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial pursuant to Crim.R. 33 is within the discretion of the trial court. State v. Brakeall, 12th Dist. Fayette Nos. CA2008-06-022 and CA2008-06-023, 2009-Ohio-3542, \u00b6 9. An appellate court reviews the trial court's decision for an abuse of discretion. State v. Carroll, 12th Dist. Clermont Nos. CA2007-02-030 and CA2007-03-041, 2007-Ohio-7075, \u00b6 64. A motion for new trial must be made within fourteen days of the jury's verdict. Crim.R. 33(B). Appellant's counsel filed a motion for new trial on June 25, 2018 which suggested prosecutorial misconduct, not juror misconduct. Appellant's motion was denied July 26, 2018. There was no formal motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct made within fourteen days of the jury's verdict and in any event, there were no supporting affidavits provided as required by Crim.R. 33(C). However, because the state does not assert these reasons for supporting the trial court's denial of a new trial, we will address the merits of appellant's argument.\n\n{\u00b6 29} In criminal trials, the accused has the constitutional right to be tried before a fair and impartial jury. State v. Villarreal, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2004-02-035, 2005-Ohio-1924, \u00b6 37, citing Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444 (1968) and Article I, Section 10, Ohio Constitution. This means a \"jury must decide a case solely on the evidence before it, and not reach its verdict based upon influences outside the courtroom.\" Villarreal at \u00b6 37. A deviation from this standard constitutes juror misconduct. State v. Taylor, 73 Ohio App.3d 827, 831 (4th Dist.1991). The determination of juror misconduct requires a two-part analysis. Id. at 833. First, the court must determine if juror misconduct occurred. Id. Second, the\ncourt must determine whether the misconduct materially prejudiced the defendant's substantial rights. *Id.*\n\n{\u00b6 30} In this case, appellant argues that one of the jurors used outside information by suggesting the possibility that the juror used the clerk of court's website to look up appellant's criminal history to find appellant guilty. The trial court held a hearing on the matter in which appellant's former trial counsel and the juror testified. The juror testified that she rode in the elevator with appellant's former counsel and briefly chatted with the attorney before exiting the elevator. The juror acknowledged that the attorney had remarked about the speed of the guilty verdict, but the juror testified that she only mentioned that people were sick of drugs in response to the statement. The juror denied accessing any court records or otherwise being influenced by outside information.\n\n{\u00b6 31} Next, appellant's former counsel testified that after the trial she rode the elevator with the juror. During the ride she engaged in a conversation with the juror about the quickness with which the jury arrived at the guilty verdict. According to the former counsel, the juror told her the reason they convicted appellant was because appellant had \"done it before.\" However, the attorney later admitted that the juror in the elevator did not expressly tell her that she looked up appellant's prior record.\n\n{\u00b6 32} As part of its reason for denying the motion for a new trial, the trial court found there was no credible evidence that juror misconduct occurred. This court agrees. Appellant's argument suggesting juror misconduct is unsupported and premised upon inferences from mere possibilities, not established facts. The trial court was in the best position to determine credibility of the witnesses. Since no misconduct occurred, appellant\n\n---\n\n1.

BOYLE, A.J.: \n \n Defendant-appellant, Henry Jordan, appeals the trial court\u2019s denial \nof his petition for postconviction relief.  He raises six assignments of error for our \nreview:  \n1. It was a violation of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment \nof the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution \nand the Ohio Revised Code for the trial court or his agent to \ncommunicate ex parte with the prosecutor concerning the findings of \nfacts and conclusions of law and for the prosecutor to write verbatim \nthe [findings of fact and conclusions of law]. \n2. The trial Judge in [postconviction] was biased or \u201cprobably biased\u201d \nwhich violated appellant\u2019s right to a neutral and detached magistrate \nand Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal \nConstitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution. \n3. Defense counsel was ineffective under the Sixth and Fourteenth \nAmendments of the federal Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the \nOhio Constitution when he failed to conduct an adequate investigation \nthat prejudiced his client\u2019s defense at trial. \n4. Mr. Jordan\u2019s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal \nConstitution and Article I section 10 of the Ohio Constitution were \nviolated when Brady evidence was not disclosed to the defense as \nevidenced by the [postconviction] exhibits. \n5. Mr. Jordan is actually innocent and his convictions and sentence \nviolate the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution and \nArticle I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution. \n6. The cumulative effect of the errors presented demonstrate Mr. \nJordan was denied Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment and \nArticle I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution. \n Finding no merit to his arguments, we affirm.   \nI. Procedural History and Factual Background \n In January 2017, Jordan was convicted after a bench trial of two \ncounts of rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), one count of aggravated burglary under \nR.C. 2911.11(A)(1), and one count of kidnapping under R.C. 2905.01(A)(4).  The trial \ncourt sentenced Jordan to seven years in prison on each count and ordered them to \nbe served concurrent to each other.  The trial court notified Jordan that he would be  \nsubject to a mandatory period of five years of postrelease control upon his release \nfrom prison and that he would be classified as a Tier II sex offender.    \n Jordan appealed his convictions to this court, raising five \nassignments of error.  We overruled his assigned errors, upheld his convictions, and \naffirmed the judgment of the trial court.  See State v. Jordan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga \nNo. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108.  \n In Jordan, this court set forth the facts as follows at \u00b6 8-25:   \n[T]he first witness to testify was M.S.\u2019s daughter C.M., who was five \nyears old at the time of the incident and nine years old at the time of \ntrial.  C.M. testified that on the night of December 23, 2012, her mom \nM.S. was getting her and her younger brother ready for bed when \nsomeone knocked on their door.  M.S. went to see who was at the door, \nand C.M. heard her mother scream and yell for help.  C.M. went into \nthe living room and saw \u201cstuff, broken stuff all over the floor.\u201d  M.S. was \nnaked and on the floor, and a man was there with \u201chis pants down \nhalfway.  * * *  He was on top of her and she was on the bottom.\u201d  C.M. \ntestified that she did not know who this man was and she had never \nseen him before.  M.S. \u201chad scratches all over her body,\u201d and she was \ncrying. \nM.S. told C.M. to get her phone.  C.M. called her aunt and said that \u201ca \nbad guy was there.\u201d  C.M.\u2019s aunt, who lived down the street, came to \nM.S.\u2019s house and called 911.  The police arrived shortly after.  C.M. \ncould not make an in-court identification of the man she saw that day, \ntestifying, \u201cI don\u2019t remember how his face looked.\u201d  Asked if she had \never seen Jordan before, C.M. stated, \u201cNo.\u201d  Asked if her mom had a \nboyfriend, C.M. replied, \u201cNo.\u201d  Asked if she knew \u201ca guy named Marcus \nLadson,\u201d C.M. answered, \u201cI don\u2019t remember him.\u201d \nM.S. testified that in 2012, she was living with her two children and her \nfianc\u00e9 Marcus Ladson.  She had met Jordan that summer while walking \ndown the street.  M.S. and Jordan exchanged phone numbers and had \na consensual sexual relationship.  On December 23, 2012, when M.S. \nwas putting her kids to bed, she heard a knock on the door.  She opened \nthe door but did not see anyone there, although she saw a silver car \nparked outside.  All of a sudden, Jordan \u201crushed in\u201d to her house \nsmelling of liquor.  M.S. testified about what happened next:  \nO n c e  h e  \u2014  o n c e  h e  c a m e  i n ,  h e  h a d ,  l i k e ,  m y  n e c k ,  a n d ,  y o u  k n o w ,  \nforced me, like, on the floor where \u2014 I had my son\u2019s bed, like a \u2014 \ntoddler bed.  I was, like, on the floor, like, towards the TV and he had \nme, like, towards my stomach, like I was down on my stomach, and, \nyou know, forced me \u2014 * * * he rushed into the door, like, having \u2014 you \nknow, from behind my neck and, you know, I was on the floor and all I \nremember is I was on my stomach and his pants was down.  * * *  My \nstomach was, like \u2014 I was, like, facing down on my stomach and he was \non top of me. \nM.S. testified that Jordan \u201cshoved\u201d her to the floor \u201cand his pants was \ndown and his penis was in my vagina.\u201d  M.S. was crying and screaming.  \nM.S. testified that she thought Jordan used a condom because she saw \n\u201ca wrapper on the floor.\u201d  Jordan then turned her around and put his \npenis in her mouth.  \u201cHis stuff, you know, was in.  I guess he was \u2014 had \nused a condom, but his stuff was in my mouth.  * * *  He just had my \nneck and grabbed his penis and put it in my mouth[.]  I was coughing.  \nI was gagging.  I was throwing up.\u201d \nM.S. testified that she could not physically get up and leave.  M.S. tried \nto get Jordan to stop by throwing a lamp at him.  M.S. does not \nremember Jordan leaving, but she recalls her daughter C.M. and her \nson standing in the doorway as she was crying and screaming. \nAll I know is my daughter was \u2014 my daughter and my son was, like, \nstanding there.  My daughter, she had got \u2014 somehow she got to my \nphone.  She found my phone and she had called her auntie, whether \u2014 \nshe didn\u2019t know \u2014 it was just whoever she called first and realized it \nwas her auntie and her auntie came down because she lived down the \nstreet from me and her auntie came, which is Alexis, she had came.  She \ncalled the police. \nM.S. testified that when the nurse at the hospital and the police \ninterviewed her, she told them that she did not know who did this to \nher, although she \u201ctried to say his name, * * * Harry or Henry\u201d and \nallegedly described him as being bald.  M.S. also testified that she told \nthe police her attacker had tattoos.  \u201cI was scared and I thought that, \nyou know, nobody would believe me, you know, and that actually that \nhe actually had done it and had hurt me, you know, but I admit that I \ndo know him.\u201d  M.S. testified that she never saw or talked to Jordan \nagain after the night of the assault.  However, on cross examination \nM.S. testified inconsistently about whether her relationship with \nJordan continued after December 23, 2012.  \nM.S. testified that in 2015, a detective contacted her about a \u201cDNA hit \nfrom a case from 2012.\u201d  The police showed M.S. a photographic lineup, \nand she picked out Jordan as \u201cthe one that came into my house\u201d and \nraped her on December 23, 2012. \nFormer Cleveland police detective Andrew Harasimchuk testified that \non December 27, 2012, he interviewed M.S. concerning her allegations \nof rape.  M.S. indicated that she had a consensual sexual partner at the \ntime, Marcus Ladson.  Det. Harasimchuk had Ladson come to the \nstation to give the police \u201can elimination standard swab\u201d of his DNA.  \nThis sample was sent to the DNA lab so Ladson\u2019s DNA \u201ccan be \neliminated from the sexual assault kit.\u201d  The results of M.S.\u2019s rape kit \nshowed one swab from M.S.\u2019s neck that contained \u201cunknown DNA.\u201d \nThere was no testimony from Det. Harasimchuk about a condom, the \nname \u201cHarry or Henry,\u201d or M.S.\u2019s assailant being bald or having \ntattoos.  By May 2013, the police were unable to develop a suspect from \nthis information, and the case went cold. \nCleveland police officer Timothy McGinty testified that he responded \nto a sexual assault call at M.S.\u2019s house on December 23, 2012.  Officer \nMcGinty testified that the front door jamb was pushed out, indicating \nforced entry, and there was \u201csome kind of lamp globe that\u2019s broken on \nthe floor.\u201d  Officer McGinty testified that M.S. was \u201cvery upset,\u201d and he \nrequested EMS transport her to the hospital.  Furthermore, Officer \nMcGinty testified that he went back to M.S.\u2019s house after accompanying \nher to the hospital to look for a fingernail that M.S. stated broke off \nduring the attack. \nQ: Okay.  And included in your work was a visit to Fairview Hospital \nand then a return visit to the house to look for a fingernail? \nA: Correct. \nQ: * * * Did you look for a condom wrapper while you were at the scene \nof the house? \nA: We looked for any kind of evidence. \nQ: Were you ever told about a condom wrapper? \nA: No. \nMeredith Molnar testified that, in 2012, she was working as a sexual \nassault nurse examiner (\u201cSANE nurse\u201d) at Fairview Hospital.  On  \nDecember 23, 2012, she examined M.S. for a sexual assault.  Molnar \ntestified that she asked M.S. what happened and M.S. reported to her \nthat the following occurred: \nMe and my fianc\u00e9 and my kids were chilling in my house watching TV \nand my fianc\u00e9 was getting ready to go to the bus for work and I was \ngetting my kids ready for bed around 9 p.m.  I went to the hallway to \nget clothes and into the kitchen to get food for dinner and into the \nbathroom to wash [C.M.] up.  She was in the tub.  I told her to give me \na few minutes to get dinner ready and she said okay. \nThen I went into the hallway and I heard someone banging really loud \non the front door.  I waited in the hallway and someone was banging \nagain on the front door, so I went to go see who it was through the \ncurtain on the door and the man bum-rushed the door somehow.  The \ndoor hit me on my head and I stumbled back and he got past me in the \nhallway in the house, and I heard my daughter yell out for me, and I \nthink it scared him or something and he started choking me from \nbehind with one of his arms and my mouth started foaming and I think \nI passed out.  I woke up because my daughter was hitting my legs above \nmy knees yelling at me to get up.  I woke up and I didn\u2019t see him and \nmy shorts were messed up and down to my thighs.  My shirt was still \non.  I panicked and all I could do is cry. \nMy daughter called her auntie, who lived down the street, and she came \nover and called 911. \nMolnar testified that M.S. assumed she was penetrated vaginally, \nbecause her pants were down, \u201cbut she was unsure if a penis or fingers \nwere penetrating her vagina.\u201d  Furthermore, M.S. indicated \u201cthat she \nthinks she remembers performing oral sex\u201d on the offender.  Based on \nthese allegations, Molnar took swabs of M.S.\u2019s vaginal and oral cavities, \nas well as other areas of her body, including a \u201cdried stain\u201d of M.S.\u2019s \nneck \u201cbecause she stated [she] was being choked by the assailant with \none arm.\u201d  Molnar explained that for a dried stain, \u201cwe will dip sterile \nswabs in sterile water and swab that area for possible DNA.\u201d \nMolnar also took pictures of M.S.\u2019s neck, on which was a \u201clinear \nsuperficial laceration.\u201d  M.S. had additional \u201cfresh\u201d bruising on her \nchin, upper back, left arm, wrist, and hand, and both knees.  Molnar \ntestified that M.S. was \u201cvery emotional, crying, shaking, talking very \nquickly.\u201d  According to Molnar, M.S. indicated to her that Ladson left \nthe house prior to the incident occurring.  Nothing in Molnar\u2019s \ntestimony or M.S.\u2019s medical records indicated a description of M.S.\u2019s  \nattacker, including whether he was bald or had tattoos.  There is also \nno mention of the name \u201cHarry or Henry\u201d; rather, M.S.\u2019s medical \nrecords indicated that the attacker was a \u201cstranger.\u201d  Additionally, a \nchecklist that is part of M.S.\u2019s medical records asked if a condom was \nused at the time of the assault, and the box checked is \u201cUnsure.\u201d \nHristina Lekova is a DNA analyst at the Cuyahoga County Regional \nForensic Science Laboratory, and she processed M.S.\u2019s rape kit in \nJanuary 2013.  According to Lekova, \u201cMarcus Ladson\u2019s DNA is present \nin the sperm fraction of the anal swab and the cutting from the crotch \narea of the underpants.  It\u2019s also in the sperm fraction of the vaginal \nswab * * *.  He\u2019s also part of the mixture in the dried stain on the neck \n* * * as well as the fingernail scrapings.\u201d \nNo \u201cseminal fluid\u201d was found in M.S.\u2019s oral swab.  An enzyme \nconsistent with vaginal fluid or sali va was found in M.S.\u2019s oral swab, \nalthough Lekova did not reach a conclusion regarding the oral swab, \nother than the enzyme \u201cdid not come from the seminal material.\u201d  The \nstate asked Lekova, \u201cif somebody was wearing a condom and put a \ncondom in a victim mouth and had vaginal fluid on that condom, would \nthat be consistent with your findings?\u201d  Lekova answered, \u201cYes, that\u2019s \npossible for that vaginal fluid to be transferred in the mouth cavity.\u201d \nOther than Ladson\u2019s and M.S.\u2019s DNA, an unknown DNA profile was \nfound on the \u201cdried stain\u201d swab taken from M.S.\u2019s neck.  This unknown \nDNA profile was uploaded to the CODIS database, and the case went \ncold. \nLekova\u2019s involvement in this case resumed in December 2015, when \nshe was given a reference swab of Jordan\u2019s DNA that was submitted in \nanother case.  Lekova testified that \u201cJordan could not be excluded as a \npossible contributor to the DNA mixture obtain[ed] from * * * the dried \nstain\u201d found on M.S.\u2019s neck.  According to Lekova, the material of the \ndried stain, i.e., what kind of bodily fluid, was unknown.  Asked if \nJordan\u2019s DNA was found in M.S.\u2019s vaginal swab, Lekova replied, \u201cThere \nis no Mr. Jordan in the vaginal swab.\u201d  Lekova further explained that if \nan offender uses a condom, she would not expect to find his DNA in the \nvictim\u2019s vaginal swab. \nCleveland police detective Karl Lessman testified that he works in the \nCODIS Task Force of the Sex Crimes Unit.  In October 2015, he received \ninformation from the coroner\u2019s office identifying Jordan as \u201ca hit\u201d in \nM.S.\u2019s cold case.  Det. Lessman compiled a photo array and, along with \nf o r m e r  D e t .  H a r a s i m c h u k ,  w e n t  t o  M . S . \u2019 s  h o u s e  t o  s e e  i f  s h e  c o u l d   \nidentify her attacker.  M.S. picked Jordan\u2019s photo out of the lineup.  \nDet. Lessman located Jordan and took a bucal swab from him, which \nwas sent to the DNA lab.  Jordan\u2019s DNA was identified as a match with \nthe DNA found on the dried stain on M.S.\u2019s neck. \n In January 2019, Jordan filed a petition for postconviction relief, \nwhich the trial court denied on March 22, 2019.  While the trial court initially denied \nJordan\u2019s requests for findings of fact and conclusions of law, it ultimately issued \nthem in December 2019, after Jordan filed a writ of mandamus in the Ohio Supreme \nCourt.  It is from this judgment that Jordan now appeals.     \nII. Petition for Postconviction Relief \n R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) permits a petitioner who claims \u201cthat there was \nsuch a denial or infringement of the person\u2019s rights as to render the judgment void \nor voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States\u201d to \npetition \u201cthe court to vacate or set aside the judgment or sentence or to grant other \nappropriate relief.\u201d  Petitioners must state all grounds for relief on which they rely, \nand they waive all other grounds not set forth in the petition.  R.C. 2953.21(A)(4).  \nIn determining whether substantive grounds for relief exist, the trial court must \nconsider, among other things, the petition, the supporting affidavits, and the \ndocumentary evidence filed in support of the petition.  R.C. 2953.21(C). \n A postconviction proceeding is not an appeal of a criminal conviction, \nbut, rather, a collateral civil attack on the judgment.  State v. Steffen, 70 Ohio St.3d \n399, 410, 639 N.E.2d 67 (1994).  \u201cIt is a means to reach constitutional issues which \nwould otherwise be impossible to reach because the evidence supporting those  \nissues is not contained in the record.\u201d  State v. Murphy , 10th Dist. Franklin No. \n00AP-233, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 6129, 5 (Dec. 26, 2000).   \n A postconviction petition, however, does not provide a petitioner a \nsecond opportunity to litigate the conviction.  State v. Hessler, 10th Dist. Franklin \nNo. 01 AP-1011, 2002-Ohio-3321, \u00b6 32.  Therefore, a petition for postconviction \nrelief is not the proper vehicle to raise issues that were or could have been \ndetermined on direct appeal.  State v. Perry , 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 \n(1967), paragraph seven of the syllabus.     \n A criminal defendant seeking to challenge his conviction through a \npetition for postconviction relief is not automatically entitled to a hearing.  R.C. \n2953.21; State v. Calhoun , 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 282, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999).  \nAccording to R.C. 2953.21(C), a petitioner is entitled to a hearing when, upon review \nof the petition and the record, the trial court finds that there are \u201csubstantive \ngrounds for relief.\u201d  In making such a determination, the trial court must consider \nthe petition and supporting affidavits as well as all of the files and records pertaining \nto the proceedings against the petitioner.  R.C. 2953.21(C).  A trial court\u2019s decision \nto deny a postconviction petition without a hearing is reviewed under the abuse of \ndiscretion standard.  State v. Gondor , 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 \nN.E.2d 77, \u00b6 45; State v. Abdussatar, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92439, 2009-Ohio-\n5232, \u00b6 15.     \n The trial court does not abuse its discretion in dismissing a petition \nfor postconviction relief without a hearing where (1) the petitioner fails to set out  \nsufficient operative facts to establish su bstantive grounds for relief, or (2) the \noperation of res judicata prohibits the claims advanced in the petition.  Id.  The \nevidence submitted with the petition must be competent, relevant, and material and \nnot merely cumulative of or alternative to evidence presented at trial.  State v. \nCombs, 100 Ohio App.3d 90, 97-98, 652 N.E.2d 205 (1st Dist.1994). \nIII. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law \n In his first assignment of error, Jordan argues that his due process \nrights were violated when the trial court had an ex parte communication with the \nstate \u201cconcerning the findings of fact[] and conclusions of law\u201d and because the trial \ncourt adopted the state\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions verbatim.  In his second \nassignment of error, he argues that \u201c[t]he odor of bias\u201d against him was \n\u201coverwhelming\u201d because the trial court \u201cimproperly conduct[ed] ex parte \ncommunications with the prosecutor.\u201d  We will address these assignments of error \ntogether because they are interrelated.   \n When a trial court denies a postconviction relief petition, R.C. \n2953.21(H) requires the trial court to make and file findings of fact and conclusions \nof law.  The purpose of requiring findings of fact and conclusions of law is to apprise \nthe petitioner of the basis for the court\u2019s disposition and to facilitate meaningful \nappellate review.  State ex rel. Carrion v. Harris, 40 Ohio St.3d 19, 19, 530 N.E.2d \n1330 (1988).  \n In State v. Maxwell , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107758, 2020-Ohio-\n3027, a case involving a trial court\u2019s denial of a postconviction petition, this court \nrecently explained:  \nWhen a party\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law are \naccurate in law and in fact, nothing prohibits a trial court from adopting \nthat party\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a \npostconviction proceeding.  State v. Williams, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. \n85180, 2005-Ohio-3023, \u00b6 35, citing State v. Combs, 100 Ohio App.3d \n90, 652 N.E.2d 205 (1st Dist.1994).  \u201cIn the absence of demonstrated \nprejudice, it is not erroneous for the trial court to adopt, in verbatim \nform, findings of fact and conclusions of law which are submitted by \nthe state.\u201d  State v. Thomas , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87666, 2006-\nOhio-6588, \u00b6 15, citing State v. Powell, 90 Ohio App.3d 260, 263, 629 \nN.E.2d 13 (1st Dist.1993).  Moreover, a trial court may adopt verbatim \na party\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law as its own if \nit has thoroughly read the document to ensure that it is completely \naccurate in fact and law.  State v. Jester, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 83520, \n2004-Ohio-3611, \u00b6 16; see also Thomas at id. \nId. at \u00b6 13. \n There is nothing in the record in this case that establishes the trial \ncourt had an ex parte communication with the state at any point.  Jordan makes \nassumptions based upon how quickly the state filed findings of fact and conclusions \nof law and how quickly the trial court adopted them verbatim.  Jordan questions \n\u201chow * * * the [s]tate [knew] to file such proposed findings.\u201d  Jordan makes an \nunsupported assumption that \u201c[e]vidently, the [j]udge or the [j]udge\u2019s counsel (his \nagent) told the prosecutor handling the [postconviction] [p]etition to prepare \n[findings of fact and conclusions of law] ex parte.\u201d  In support of his assumption, he \npoints out that \u201c[a] lot of activity took place on this [p]etition in the 48 hours  \nbetween December 17 \u2013 19, 2019, after months of inactivity.\u201d  But Jordan fails to \nacknowledge that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s docket is public for anyone to view.       \n Jordan further argues that a \u201ctrial court cannot delegate its \ndeliberative process,\u201d and the trial court here did so when it used the state\u2019s \nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.  Jordan cites to State v. Roberts, \n110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168, and State v. Pickens, 2016-\nOhio-5257, 60 N.E.3d 20 (1st Dist.), claiming his case \u201cfits squarely in the analysis\u201d \nof these cases.  However, both Roberts and Pickens involved the trial court\u2019s ex parte \ncommunications with the state in rendering its judicial opinions, and there is simply \nno evidence of that here.   \n Roberts is further distinguishable because it involved a trial court \n\u201cdirectly involv[ing] the prosecutor in preparing the sentencing opinion\u201d in a death-\npenalty case, which the Ohio Supreme Court stated is not permitted.  Id. at \u00b6 159.  \nPickens is also distinguishable because the prosecutor in the case did not file the \nproposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and did not serve them on the \ndefendant.  Id. at \u00b6 9.  Here, the prosecutor both filed her proposed findings and \nconclusions and served a copy on Jordan\u2019s counsel the same day that she filed them.  \nAccordingly, we disagree with Jordan that this case falls \u201csquarely in the analysis\u201d \nof Roberts and Pickens.   \n Further, we find no merit to Jordan\u2019s second assignment of error that \nthe trial court was biased against him due to ex parte communications occurring \nbetween the judge and the state.  We further note that Jordan had every opportunity  \nalong the way, from May until December, to file his own proposed findings and \nconclusions of law, and he did not do so. \n Thus, we overrule Jordan\u2019s first and second assignments of error.   \nIV. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel \n In his third assignment of error, Jordan argues that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective for failing to adequately investigate his case, violating his \nconstitutional rights.   \n The trial court found that Jordan\u2019s claim for ineffective assistance of \ncounsel is barred by res judicata because he raised the same issue in his direct \nappeal.  Additionally, the trial court addressed the merits of Jordan\u2019s claim and \nfound it to be meritless.   \nA. Res Judicata   \n Under the doctrine of res judicata, \u201ca valid, final judgment rendered \nupon the merits bars all subsequent actions based upon any claim arising out of the \ntransaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the previous action.\u201d  State \nv. Patrick, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99418, 2013-Ohio-5020, \u00b6 7, citing Grava v. \nParkman Twp., 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 382, 653 N.E.2d 226 (1995).  To overcome the \nres judicata bar, the petitioner must show, using extrinsic evidence, that he or she \ncould not have appealed the original constitutional claim based on the information \nin the original trial record.  Combs, 100 Ohio App.3d at 97-98, 652 N.E.2d 205.  Said \nanother way, issues properly raised in a petition for postconviction relief are only \nthose that could not have been raised on direct appeal because the evidence  \nsupporting such issues is outside the record.  State v. Milanovich, 42 Ohio St.2d 46, \n50, 325 N.E.2d 540 (1975).  Thus, a trial court may dismiss a petition based on res \njudicata if an issue was or should have been raised on direct appeal.  State v. Dowell, \n8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 86232, 2006-Ohio-110, \u00b6 10, citing Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, \n226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph seven of the syllabus. \n Extrinsic evidence attached to the petition, however, does not \nautomatically defeat the res judicata bar.  Rather, evidence outside the record must \nmeet \u201c\u2018some threshold standard of cogency; otherwise it would be too easy to defeat \nthe holding of Perry b y  s i m p l y  a t t a c h i n g  a s  e x h i b i t s  e v i d e n c e  w h i c h  i s  o n l y  \nmarginally significant and does not advance the petitioner\u2019s claim[.]\u2019\u201d  State v. \nLawson, 103 Ohio App.3d 307, 315, 659 N.E.2d 362 (12th Dist.1995), quoting State \nv. Coleman, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-900811, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 1485, 21 (Mar. \n17, 1993).  Moreover, the evidence dehors the record must not be evidence that was \nin existence and available for use at the time of trial and that could and should have \nbeen submitted at trial if the defendant wished to use it.  Dowell at \u00b6 10. \n In his direct appeal, Jordan argued that \nhis trial counsel was ineffective by failing to investigate and pursue the \ntheory that Ladson was the man who raped M.S.  Jordan alleges that \ncounsel should have cross examined witnesses about Ladson and \npresented \u201cevidence in the public record concerning\u201d Ladson, \nincluding Ladson\u2019s 2015 and 2016 convictions for murder and other \ngang-related violent felonies, which resulted in a sentence of life in \nprison.  \nJordan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106272, 2018-Ohio-4108, at \u00b6 42.    \n The state argued that trial counsel was not ineffective because trial \ncounsel\u2019s decision was a strategic decision and that Jordan was not prejudiced \nbecause it was only speculation that the outcome of trial would have been different \nhad trial counsel investigated Ladson.  Id. at \u00b6 42.  We agreed.  Id. at \u00b6 43-44.  We \npointed out that the victim had \u201cconsistently maintained that her sexual activity with \nLadson was consensual.\u201d  Id. at \u00b6 43.  We rejected Jordan\u2019s argument, finding that \nJordan failed to show that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that he \nwas prejudiced.  Id. at \u00b6 44.    \n In his direct appeal, Jordan had asked this court to take judicial notice \nof four exhibits that the state used in Ladson\u2019s murder trial, including three pictures \nof Ladson showing his tattoos and one expert report from a detective in the \nCleveland Police Department\u2019s Gang Impact Unit concluding that Ladson was a \nmember of the criminal gang the Heartless Felons.  We declined to do so.  Id. at \u00b6 7.  \nJordan attached those exhibits to his petition for postconviction relief as well as an \naffidavit from his trial counsel.     \n Jordan\u2019s trial counsel averred that he \u201cdid not employ an investigator \nand did not otherwise discover any photographs of the victim\u2019s [fianc\u00e9] or any \nreports about him being a Heartless Felon gang member.\u201d  Trial counsel further \nstated that he \u201cwas aware that the [fianc\u00e9] was serving a prison sentence at the time\u201d \nof Jordan\u2019s trial and that if counsel had \u201chad the photographs of the [fianc\u00e9] and the \nreport of him being a member of the Heartless Felons gang then [he] would have \nused them to [Jordan\u2019s] benefit at his trial.\u201d  Thus, although the exhibits were  \navailable at the time of Jordan\u2019s trial, his trial counsel stated in the affidavit attached \nto Jordan\u2019s petition for postconviction relief that he did not investigate the matter \nor discover the exhibits.  That is the basis of Jordan\u2019s claim now.   \n When a postconviction claim depends for its resolution upon outside \nevidence, a common pleas court may not apply res judicata to dismiss the claim.  \nPerry at paragraph nine of the syllabus.  But a reviewing court may sustain the \nclaim\u2019s dismissal on other grounds.  State v. Peagler, 76 Ohio St.3d 496, 668 N.E.2d \n489 (1996), paragraph one of the syllabus.  After review, we do not agree with the \ntrial court that Jordan\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was barred by res \njudicata.  We will therefore address the merits of Jordan\u2019s ineffective assistance of \ncounsel claim, which the trial court did as well.   \nB. Merits of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim \n To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance, a defendant must \nestablish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the defendant was \nprejudiced by the deficient performance.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, \n687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).  Counsel will only be considered \ndeficient if his or her conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.  Id. \nat 688.  Further, a defendant must show that he or she was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s \nineffectiveness.  Id. at 694. \n When reviewing counsel\u2019s performance, this court must be highly \ndeferential and \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct [fell] \nwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d  Id. at 689.  To  \nestablish resulting prejudice, a \u201cdefendant must show that there is a reasonable \nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding \nwould have been different.\u201d  Id. at 694.  \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability \nsufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d  Id. \n Jordan contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failure to \nadequately investigate Ladson and the fact that Ladson had tattoos.  However, \nJordan\u2019s entire argument that his trial counsel was ineffective is based on his \nassertion is that the SANE nurse\u2019s notes \u201cstate clearly\u201d that the victim told her \n\u201cshortly after the attack that her fianc\u00e9 [Ladson] was home during the attack\u201d and \nthat her attacker had tattoos that \u201ccover his body.\u201d  Jordan further claims that the \nvictim \u201ctold the authorities the attacker had tattoos including neck/facial tattoos.\u201d   \nJordan claims that the exhibits attached to his petition establish that Ladson had \ntattoos all over his body and was a member of the Heartless Felons.  Jordan \nmaintains these exhibits would have changed the outcome of his case because he \ndoes not have tattoos on his neck or face, his DNA was not found on the victim\u2019s \nvaginal or anal swabs, and Ladson\u2019s DNA was found on both of the victim\u2019s swabs.  \nHe contends that this \u201ccase presents itself completely differently after the exhibits \nand facts contained in the exhibits submitted in postconviction are considered.\u201d  We \ndisagree.   \n Throughout his petition and appellate brief, Jordan repeats that the \nevidence presented at trial established that the victim told the SANE nurse that her \nfianc\u00e9 was home during the attack and that her attacker had tattoos all over his body.   \nThese claims are simply not true.  Nor is it true that the evidence presented at trial \nestablished that the victim told police that her attacker had tattoos on his face or \nneck.   \n In Jordan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, we \nstated that according to the SANE nurse\u2019s notes discussing the victim\u2019s narrative of \nwhat occurred, the victim told the SANE nurse that on the evening of December 23, \n2012, she and her fianc\u00e9 and children were \u201cchilling in [her] house watching TV and \n[her] fianc\u00e9 was getting ready to go to the bus for work and [she] was getting her \nkids ready for bed around 9 pm.\u201d  Id. at \u00b6 18.  The victim continued to describe what \noccurred after that without specifically stating that her fianc\u00e9 left to go to work at \nsome point before the attack.  But we explained that \u201c[a]ccording to [the SANE \nnurse], M.S. indicated to her that [her fianc\u00e9] left the house prior to the incident \noccurring.\u201d  Id. at \u00b6 20.  And we pointed out in Jordan\u2019s direct appeal that \u201c[t]here \nis nothing in the medical records, SANE nu rse\u2019s testimony, or the police officer\u2019s \ntestimony indicating that M.S. told anyone that her attacker * * * was bald, or that \nhe had tattoos.\u201d  Id. at \u00b6 38.  Finally, we stated that the SANE nurse\u2019s notes and \nM.S.\u2019s medical records were introduced into evidence, although we acknowledged \nthat no police reports were made part of the record.  Id. at \u00b6 37.   \n Even if we assume for the sake of argument now that Jordan\u2019s trial \ncounsel should have investigated Ladson further, Jordan has not established that he \nwas prejudiced by such a purported deficient performance.  As we found in Jordan\u2019s \ndirect appeal, the victim consistently maintained that she had consensual sex only  \nwith Ladson.  Moreover, Jordan fails to account for the fact that the victim\u2019s \ndaughter, who was five years old at the time of the rape and nine years old at the \ntime of trial, testified that she had never before seen the man whose pants were \n\u201cdown halfway\u201d and was \u201con top\u201d of her mother.  At the time of the rape, Ladson was \nthe victim\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and thus, the victim\u2019s daughter would have known him at the time \nof the attack (although she did not remember Ladson at the time of trial four years \nlater).  And most importantly, Jordan\u2019s theory that the victim told the nurse that her \nfianc\u00e9 was home at the time of the rape and that her attacker had tattoos, and that \nshe told police that her attacker had tattoos, is not supported by the evidence.  \nAlthough the victim did testify that she thought she told police that her attacker had \ntattoos, even Jordan acknowledges that what she told police and the SANE nurse \nimmediately following the attack (which was over four years earlier) would be more \ncredible, and she did not mention tattoos to the nurse or police.  Thus, the exhibits \nthat Jordan attached to his petition showing Ladson\u2019s tattoos and that he was a \nmember of the Heartless Felons, do not establish \u201ca reasonable probability that, but \nfor counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been \ndifferent.\u201d  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.   \n Accordingly, we overrule Jordan\u2019s third assignment of error.   \nV. Brady Violation \n In his fourth assignment of error, Jordan maintains that his due \nprocess rights were violated when the state failed to disclose Brady material to him.  \nSee Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).  In his  \ndirect appeal, Jordan argued that the prosecutors committed misconduct when they \n\u201cfailed to turn over to the defense information regarding Ladson\u2019s gang and criminal \nactivity.\u201d  Jordan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, \u00b6 46.  In his \npetition for postconviction relief, he argues that the state should have disclosed the \nphotos of Ladson evidencing his tattoos and the gang report showing that Ladson \nwas a member of the Heartless Felons.  According to Jordan, the same prosecutor \nwho tried his case also tried Ladson\u2019s murder case and admitted these exhibits in \nLadson\u2019s criminal cases.       \n The trial court found that Jordan\u2019s Brady claim was barred by res \njudicata and was meritless.  After review, we agree with the trial court that Jordan\u2019s \nclaim regarding Ladson\u2019s criminal activity is barred by res judicata.  Although the \ndocuments establishing Ladson\u2019s criminal gang activity were not before this court \nin Jordan\u2019s direct appeal, Jordan still argued that the prosecutor should have turned \nthem over to defense counsel.  We fully addressed this argument and therefore find \nthat Jordan cannot now raise it in his postconviction petition.  We will, however, \naddress Jordan\u2019s claim with respect to the photo exhibits attached to his petition \nshowing that Ladson has tattoos all over his body.     \n As we explained in Jordan, \u201cBrady stands for the proposition that \n\u2018the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon \nrequest violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or \npunishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u2019\u201d  Jordan, \n8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, \u00b6 46, quoting Brady at 87.  See  \nalso Crim.R. 16(B)(5).  We further stated in Jordan that \u201c\u2018Brady does not apply to \nmaterials that are not wholly within the control of the prosecution.  There is no need \nto require the state to \u201cdisclose\u201d material that is readily available to the defense.\u2019\u201d  \nId. at \u00b6 47, quoting State v. McGuire, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105732, 2018-Ohio-\n1390, \u00b6 24. \n Ladson was convicted of murder in June 2016.  Jordan\u2019s trial was not \nuntil January 2017.  The photo exhibits of Ladson\u2019s tattoos were not ones that were \nwholly within the state\u2019s control because they were part of the public record in \nLadson\u2019s criminal trial where the state proved that Ladson was a member of the \nHeartless Felons and had tattoos on his body indicative of membership in the gang.  \nTherefore, the state was not required to disclose these photos to Jordan.       \n Moreover, as we explained in the previous assignment of error, the \nexhibits that Jordan attached to his petition for postconviction relief showing \nLadson was \u201ccovered\u201d in tattoos, had been convicted of murder, and was a member \nof the Heartless Felons is not material or exculpatory.   \n Accordingly, Jordan\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled. \nVI. Actual Innocence \n In his fifth assignment of error, Jordan argues that he is \u201cactually \ninnocent\u201d of the acts against the victim and asks this court to recognize this as a \nfreestanding, cognizable claim.   \n The state contends that this claim fails under State v. Apanovitch, 155 \nOhio St.3d 358, 2018-Ohio-4744, 121 N.E.3d 351.  In his reply to this court, Jordan  \ncounters that Apanovitch held no such thing.  An in-depth review of Apanovitch is \nnecessary.       \n In Apanovitch, the defendant was convicted of one count each of \naggravated murder and aggravated burglary, and two counts of rape.  He was \nsentenced to death in January 1985.  The body of the victim was found in a bedroom \nof her home.  She had been strangled and severely beaten, and sperm was found in \nher mouth and vagina. \n Apanovitch\u2019s case before the Ohio Supreme Court involved his fourth \npostconviction petition based on newly discovered DNA evidence taken from the \nvictim\u2019s vagina.  After a hearing, the trial court found that because Apanovitch\u2019s \nDNA could not have contributed to the vaginal swab taken from the victim, that \nApanovitch \u201cpresented clear and convincing evidence of his actual innocence of \nvaginal rape, and acquitted him of same.\u201d  Id. at \u00b6 28.  This court upheld the trial \ncourt\u2019s findings.  State v. Apanovitch, 2016-Ohio-2831, 64 N.E.3d 429, \u00b6 46 (8th \nDist.).  \n Apanovitch brought his fourth postconviction petition under R.C. \n2953.23(A)(2), which states: \nThe petitioner was convicted of a felony, the petitioner is an offender \nfor whom DNA testing was performed under sections 2953.71 to \n2953.81 of the Revised Code or under former section 2953.82 of the \nRevised Code and analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of \nall available admissible evidence related to the inmate\u2019s case as \ndescribed in division (D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, and \nthe results of the DNA testing establish, by clear and convincing \nevidence, actual innocence of that felony offense or, if the person was \nsentenced to death, establish, by clear and convincing evidence, actual  \ninnocence of the aggravating circumstance or circumstances the person \nwas found guilty of committing and that is or are the basis of that \nsentence of death.   \nAs used in this division, \u201cactual innocence\u201d has the same meaning as in \ndivision (A)(1)(b) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code, and \u201cformer \nsection 2953.82 of the Revised Code has the same meaning as in \ndivision (A)(1)(c) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code. \n R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(b) defines \u201cactual innocence.\u201d  It states: \n\u201c[A]ctual innocence\u201d means that, had the results of the DNA testing \nconducted under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code or \nunder former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code been presented at \ntrial, and had those results been analyzed in the context of and upon \nconsideration of all available admissible evidence related to the \nperson\u2019s case as described in division (D) of section 2953.74 of the \nRevised Code, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner \nguilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted, or, if the \nperson was sentenced to death, no reasonable factfinder would have \nfound the petitioner guilty of the aggravating circumstance or \ncircumstances the petitioner was found guilty of committing and that \nis or are the basis of that sentence of death. \n Because Apanovitch\u2019s petition for postconviction relief was an \nuntimely and successive petition, it fell under R.C. 2953.23(A), which the Supreme \nCourt explained is jurisdictional and only permits an inmate to file a petition \u201cunder \nspecific, limited circumstances.\u201d  Apanovitch, 155 Ohio St.3d 358, 2018-Ohio-4744, \n121 N.E.3d 351, \u00b6 22.  Under this provision, a petitioner must meet the criteria in \neither R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) or (2) before a trial court can consider the petition.   \n R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) provides that petitioner must show both of the \nfollowing: (a) the petitioner was \u201cunavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts\u201d \nupon which the petitioner relies or the petitioner is asserting a claim based on a new, \nretroactively applicable federal or state right recognized by the United States  \nSupreme Court after the petition became untimely and after the petitioner had filed \nearlier petitions, and (b) the petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that \nno reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty or eligible for the \ndeath sentence but for \u201cconstitutional error at trial.\u201d  R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a) and (b).  \n The second exception under R.C. 2953.23(A)(2) applies when the \nresults of DNA testing establish by clear and convincing evidence the petitioner\u2019s \n\u201cactual innocence\u201d of a felony offense of which the petitioner was convicted or of an \naggravating circumstance that is the basis of a death sentence.  Because this \nsubsection is not relevant to our present analysis, we will not discuss the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s analysis of this subsection here, except to note that the Supreme Court held \nthat Apanovitch did not meet the requirements to file a petition for postconviction \nrelief under this section.  See id. at \u00b6 27-34. \n The Supreme Court further held that Apanovitch did not meet the \njurisdictional criteria under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1).  First, the Supreme Court \ndetermined that it did not need to de termine if Apanovitch satisfied R.C. \n2953.23(A)(1)(a), because he \u201cclearly [had] not satisfied R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b), \nwhich require[d] him to show that his conviction resulted from \u2018constitutional error \nat trial.\u2019\u201d  Id. at \u00b6 26.  In arguing that he satisfied R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b), Apanovitch \nasserted only that he was actually innocent of rape.  But the Supreme Court \nexplained that \u201cunder the United States Constitution, an actual-innocence claim \u2018is \nnot itself a constitutional claim,\u2019\u201d and \u201ctherefore does not involve a \u2018constitutional \nerror at trial\u2019 under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b).\u201d  Id., quoting Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S.  \n390, 404, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993).  Because Apanovitch did not raise \nany other argument relating to a \u201cconstitutional error at trial,\u201d the Supreme Court \nheld that his petition did not qualify under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1). \n The Ohio Supreme Court held in Apanovitch that a claim for \u201cactual \ninnocence\u201d does not amount to a \u201cconstitutional error at trial\u201d for purposes of \nestablishing R.C. 2953.23.(A)(1)(b).  In this case, however, we are not dealing with \nan untimely or successive petition under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b).  Rather, we are \naddressing a timely and first petition for postconviction relief under R.C. \n2953.21(A)(1)(a).       \n Nonetheless, Apanovitch is still instructive here.  And after reviewing \nthe relevant case law, we find that because a claim for actual innocence \u201c\u2018is not itself \na constitutional claim,\u2019\u201d it does not set forth a cognizable claim under R.C. \n2953.21(A)(1)(a) either.  Because Jordan\u2019s petition does not involve DNA testing or \na death sentence, the relevant portion of R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) permits a petitioner \nto file a petition asking a court to set aside or vacate his or conviction when the \npetitioner claims \u201cthat there was such a denial or infringement of the person\u2019s rights \nas to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the \nConstitution of the United States.\u201d  Thus, a claim for actual innocence cannot meet \nthe requirements of R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) because it \u201cis not itself\u201d a constitutional \nclaim.  Ohio courts have held as much.  See State v. Zich, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-15-\n1263, 2017-Ohio-414, \u00b6 23, discretionary appeal not accepted, 151 Ohio St.3d 1425, \n2017-Ohio-8371, 84 N.E.3d 1063 (\u201cIn light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s  \ndecision in Herrera, we find no merit to appellant\u2019s due process arguments \nregarding his claims of actual innocence.\u201d); State v. Watson, 126 Ohio App.3d 316, \n323, 710 N.E.2d 340 (12th Dist.1998) (\u201cSince the United States Supreme Court has \nnot recognized actual innocence as a constitutional right, we also refuse to judicially \ncreate such a constitutional right.\u201d); State v. Loza, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA96-10-\n214, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4574 (Oct. 13, 1997) (\u201cCourts have interpreted Herrera \nto stand for the proposition that a petitioner is not entitled to postconviction relief \nwithout a showing of a violation of rights that were constitutional in dimension, \nwhich occurred at the time that the petitioner was tried and convicted.\u201d); State v. \nHunter, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-090569, 2012-Ohio-2859, \u00b6 54 (an actual \ninnocence claim does not demonstrate \u201ca constitutional violation in the \nproceedings\u201d that led to the petitioner\u2019s conviction); State v. Davis, 5th Dist. Licking \nNo. 2008-CA-16, 2008-Ohio-6841 (\u201cThe trial court did not err in dismissing \nappellant\u2019s claim of actual innocence because his claim fails to raise \u2018a denial or \ninfringement of appellant\u2019s rights under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution \nof the United States\u2019 as required by R.C. 2953.21.\u201d); State v. Nash , 8th Dist. \nCuyahoga No. 87635, 2006-Ohio-5925, \u00b6 14 (\u201c[T]rial court did not err in failing to \nconsider the merits of this \u2018actual innocence\u2019 claim because the claim fails to raise \u2018a \ndenial or infringement of rights under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of \nthe United States\u2019 as required by R.C. 2953.21.\u201d); State v. Hines, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga \nNo. 89848, 2008-Ohio-1927, \u00b6 24, quoting State v. Williams, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga \nNo. 85180, 2005-Ohio-3023, \u00b6 31 (\u201c\u2018[A] claim of actual innocence is not itself a  \nconstitutional claim, nor does it constitute a substantive ground for postconviction \nrelief.\u2019\u201d). \n Moreover, R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23 address the phrase, \u201cactual \ninnocence,\u201d throughout the text of the statutes.  R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(b) defines \n\u201cactual innocence\u201d for purposes of postconviction petitions (which we previously set \nforth).  Indeed, throughout the entirety of R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23, the General \nAssembly discusses \u201cactual innocence,\u201d but only in terms of DNA testing.  Nowhere \nin R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23 do the statutes allow for a claim of \u201cactual innocence\u201d \nexcept with respect to DNA testing. \n Jordan contends that he has \u201csquarely raised a [d]ue[-][p]rocess \nclaim under both the Ohio and federal [c]onstitutions\u201d in his petition for \npostconvicton relief by asserting that he is actually innocent and maintaining that \nhe established as much through the documents he attached to his petition.  He asks \nthis court to recognize his \u201cfreestanding actual innocence claim\u201d that no other court \nin Ohio has previously recognized in a petition for postconviction relief.  Again, \u201cR.C. \n2953.21(A) requires a petitioner for postconviction relief to allege a \u2018denial or \ninfringement\u2019 of [the person\u2019s] rights under the Ohio or United States \nConstitutions.\u201d  Thus, this requires petitioners to show that a procedural error \noccurred at trial such that their constitutional rights were violated.  State v. \nWarmus, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99962, 2014-Ohio-928, \u00b6 8 (discussing the \npetitioner\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct denying him a fair trial, ineffective \nassistance of counsel violating his Sixth Amendment rights, and a denial of his Fifth  \nAmendment right against self-incrimination).  A claim of \u201cactual innocence, \nhowever, involves a claim of factual innocence.  As explained by the Iowa Supreme \nCourt in Dewberry v. State, 941 N.W.2d 1 (Iowa 2019), regarding a \u201cfreestanding \nclaim of actual innocence\u201d:  \nOur understanding of actual innocence is consistent with the United \nStates Supreme Court\u2019s approach to actual innocence.  The Supreme \nCourt has \u201cnot resolved whether a prisoner may be entitled to habeas \nrelief based on a freestanding claim of actual innocence.\u201d  McQuiggin \nv. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 392, 133 S.Ct . 1924, 1931, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 \n(2013); see Schmidt [ v. State], 909 N.W.2d [778,] 790 [Iowa 2018) \n(stating the Supreme Court has not yet recognized a freestanding claim \nof actual innocence).   Instead, the Supreme Court has recognized \u201ca \ngateway claim of actual innocence such that the petitioner may obtain \nreview of the underlying constitutional merits of his or her procedurally \ndefaulted claim.\u201d  Schmidt, 909 N.W.2d at 790 (citing Herrera, 506 \nU.S. at 404, 113 S.Ct. at 862 (majority opinion), and In re Davis, 557 \nU.S. 952, 955, 130 S.Ct . 1, 3, 174 L.Ed.2d 614 (2009) (Scalia, J., \ndissenting)).  In discussing the concept of actual innocence in this \ncontext, the Court has made clear it is referring to factual innocence: \n\u201cA prototypical example of \u2018actual innocence\u2019 in a colloquial sense is the \ncase where the State has convicted the wrong person of the crime.  Such \nclaims are of course regularly made on motions for new trial after \nconviction in both state and federal courts, and quite regularly denied \nbecause the evidence adduced in support of them fails to meet the \nrigorous standards for granting such motions.  But in rare instances it \nmay turn out later, for example, that another person has credibly \nconfessed to the crime, and it is evident that the law has made a \nmistake.  In the context of a noncapital case, the concept of \u2018actual \ninnocence\u2019 is easy to grasp.\u201d \nSawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.S. 333, 340-41, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 2519-20, 120 \nL.Ed.2d 269 (1992).  In Bousley v. United States , the Court stated \n\u201c\u2018actual innocence\u2019 means factual innocence, not mere legal \ninsufficiency.\u201d  523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 \n(1998).  This understanding of actual innocence is consistent with the \nCourt\u2019s pronouncement that \u201csubstantial claim[s] of actual innocence \nare extremely rare.\u201d  Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 32 1, 115 S.Ct. 851, \n864, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995); see also McQuiggin, 569 U.S. at 386, 133  \nS.Ct. at 1928 (cautioning that \u201ctenable actual-innocence gateway pleas \nare rare\u201d). \nDewberry at 6-7.  We note that in Dewberry, the court refers to cases cited by \nJordan in support of his argument, including Schmidt and Schlup. \n Thus, even assuming for the sake of argument that we could consider \nJordan\u2019s freestanding claim of actual innocence, he would not be entitled to a new \ntrial based upon the exhibits he attached to his petition.  \u201cTo establish actual \ninnocence, petitioners must demonstrate that, \u2018in light of all the evidence,\u2019 \u2018it is more \nlikely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted\u2019\u201d them.  Bousley at \n623, quoting Schlup at 327-328.  Although the Bousley court was discussing when a \nfederal habeas court may grant a writ even in the absence of a showing of cause for \nthe procedural default; i.e., where a constitutional violation \u201c\u2018has probably resulted \nin the conviction of one who is actually innocent,\u2019\u201d it is instructional here (because \nthat is what Jordan is attempting to claim).  Id., quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. \n478, 491-492, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986), superseded by statute on other \ngrounds, Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, Pub. L. 104-132, Apr. 24, \n1996, 110 Stat. 1214.  But as we previously explained, Jordan\u2019s exhibits showing \nLadson was \u201ccovered\u201d in tattoos, had been convicted of murder, and was a member \nof the Heartless Felons is not material or exculpatory to Jordan\u2019s claims, and \ncertainly do not demonstrate that it is \u201c\u2018more likely than not that no reasonable juror \nwould have convicted him.\u2019\u201d  Bousley at 623, quoting Schlup at 327-328.         \n After review, we conclude that Jordan\u2019s \u201cactual innocence\u201d claim fails \nto raise \u201ca denial or infringement of rights under the Ohio Constitution or the \nConstitution of the United States\u201d as required by R.C. 2953.21.  We therefore \noverrule his fifth assignment of error.  \nVII. Cumulative Error  \n In his six assignment of error, Jordan contends that \u201c[t]he cumulative \neffect of the errors in this case, * * * ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial \nmisconduct, and a biased judge, amounted to a denial of a fair trial.\u201d  Not having \nfound any error or prejudice, Jordan\u2019s argument has no merit.   \n Accordingly, we overrule Jordan\u2019s six assignments of error.    \n Judgment affirmed. \nIt is ordered that appellee recover from appellant the costs herein taxed. \nThe court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal. \nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the \nc o m m o n  p l e a s  c o u r t  t o  c a r r y  t h i s  j u d g m e n t  i n t o  e x e c u t i o n .

BOYLE, A.J.:\n\n{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Henry Jordan, appeals the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition for postconviction relief. He raises six assignments of error for our review.\n1. It was a violation of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution and the Ohio Revised Code for the trial court or his agent to communicate ex parte with the prosecutor concerning the findings of facts and conclusions of law and for the prosecutor to write verbatim the [findings of fact and conclusions of law].\n\n2. The trial Judge in [postconviction] was biased or \u201cprobably biased\u201d which violated appellant\u2019s right to a neutral and detached magistrate and Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n3. Defense counsel was ineffective under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution when he failed to conduct an adequate investigation that prejudiced his client\u2019s defense at trial.\n\n4. Mr. Jordan\u2019s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution and Article I section 10 of the Ohio Constitution were violated when Brady evidence was not disclosed to the defense as evidenced by the [postconviction] exhibits.\n\n5. Mr. Jordan is actually innocent and his convictions and sentence violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n6. The cumulative effect of the errors presented demonstrate Mr. Jordan was denied Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.\n\nFinding no merit to his arguments, we affirm.\n\nI. Procedural History and Factual Background\n\nIn January 2017, Jordan was convicted after a bench trial of two counts of rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), one count of aggravated burglary under R.C. 2911.11(A)(1), and one count of kidnapping under R.C. 2905.01(A)(4). The trial court sentenced Jordan to seven years in prison on each count and ordered them to be served concurrent to each other. The trial court notified Jordan that he would be\nsubject to a mandatory period of five years of postrelease control upon his release from prison and that he would be classified as a Tier II sex offender.\n\n\u00b6 4 Jordan appealed his convictions to this court, raising five assignments of error. We overruled his assigned errors, upheld his convictions, and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. See State v. Jordan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108.\n\n\u00b6 5 In Jordan, this court set forth the facts as follows at \u00b6 8-25:\n\n[T]he first witness to testify was M.S.\u2019s daughter C.M., who was five years old at the time of the incident and nine years old at the time of trial. C.M. testified that on the night of December 23, 2012, her mom M.S. was getting her and her younger brother ready for bed when someone knocked on their door. M.S. went to see who was at the door, and C.M. heard her mother scream and yell for help. C.M. went into the living room and saw \u201cstuff, broken stuff all over the floor.\u201d M.S. was naked and on the floor, and a man was there with \u201chis pants down halfway.\u201d *** He was on top of her and she was on the bottom.\u201d C.M. testified that she did not know who this man was and she had never seen him before. M.S. \u201chad scratches all over her body,\u201d and she was crying.\n\nM.S. told C.M. to get her phone. C.M. called her aunt and said that \u201ca bad guy was there.\u201d C.M.\u2019s aunt, who lived down the street, came to M.S.\u2019s house and called 911. The police arrived shortly after. C.M. could not make an in-court identification of the man she saw that day, testifying, \u201cI don\u2019t remember how his face looked.\u201d Asked if she had ever seen Jordan before, C.M. stated, \u201cNo.\u201d Asked if her mom had a boyfriend, C.M. replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Asked if she knew \u201ca guy named Marcus Ladson,\u201d C.M. answered, \u201cI don\u2019t remember him.\u201d\n\nM.S. testified that in 2012, she was living with her two children and her fianc\u00e9 Marcus Ladson. She had met Jordan that summer while walking down the street. M.S. and Jordan exchanged phone numbers and had a consensual sexual relationship. On December 23, 2012, when M.S. was putting her kids to bed, she heard a knock on the door. She opened the door but did not see anyone there, although she saw a silver car parked outside. All of a sudden, Jordan \u201crushed in\u201d to her house smelling of liquor. M.S. testified about what happened next:\nOnce he \u2014 once he came in, he had, like, my neck, and, you know, forced me, like, on the floor where \u2014 I had my son\u2019s bed, like a \u2014 toddler bed. I was, like, on the floor, like, towards the TV and he had me, like, towards my stomach, like I was down on my stomach, and, you know, forced me \u2014 * * * he rushed into the door, like, having \u2014 you know, from behind my neck and, you know, I was on the floor and all I remember is I was on my stomach and his pants was down. * * * My stomach was, like \u2014 I was, like, facing down on my stomach and he was on top of me.\n\nM.S. testified that Jordan \u201cshoved\u201d her to the floor \u201cand his pants was down and his penis was in my vagina.\u201d M.S. was crying and screaming. M.S. testified that she thought Jordan used a condom because she saw \u201ca wrapper on the floor.\u201d Jordan then turned her around and put his penis in her mouth. \u201cHis stuff, you know, was in. I guess he was \u2014 had used a condom, but his stuff was in my mouth. * * * He just had my neck and grabbed his penis and put it in my mouth[.] I was coughing. I was gagging. I was throwing up.\u201d\n\nM.S. testified that she could not physically get up and leave. M.S. tried to get Jordan to stop by throwing a lamp at him. M.S. does not remember Jordan leaving, but she recalls her daughter C.M. and her son standing in the doorway as she was crying and screaming.\n\nAll I know is my daughter was \u2014 my daughter and my son was, like, standing there. My daughter, she had got \u2014 somehow she got to my phone. She found my phone and she had called her auntie, whether \u2014 she didn\u2019t know \u2014 it was just whoever she called first and realized it was her auntie and her auntie came down because she lived down the street from me and her auntie came, which is Alexis, she had came. She called the police.\n\nM.S. testified that when the nurse at the hospital and the police interviewed her, she told them that she did not know who did this to her, although she \u201ctried to say his name, * * * Harry or Henry\u201d and allegedly described him as being bald. M.S. also testified that she told the police her attacker had tattoos. \u201cI was scared and I thought that, you know, nobody would believe me, you know, and that actually that he actually had done it and had hurt me, you know, but I admit that I do know him.\u201d M.S. testified that she never saw or talked to Jordan again after the night of the assault. However, on cross examination M.S. testified inconsistently about whether her relationship with Jordan continued after December 23, 2012.\nM.S. testified that in 2015, a detective contacted her about a \u201cDNA hit from a case from 2012.\u201d The police showed M.S. a photographic lineup, and she picked out Jordan as \u201cthe one that came into my house\u201d and raped her on December 23, 2012.\n\nFormer Cleveland police detective Andrew Harasimchuk testified that on December 27, 2012, he interviewed M.S. concerning her allegations of rape. M.S. indicated that she had a consensual sexual partner at the time, Marcus Ladson. Det. Harasimchuk had Ladson come to the station to give the police \u201can elimination standard swab\u201d of his DNA. This sample was sent to the DNA lab so Ladson\u2019s DNA \u201ccan be eliminated from the sexual assault kit.\u201d The results of M.S.\u2019s rape kit showed one swab from M.S.\u2019s neck that contained \u201cunknown DNA.\u201d\n\nThere was no testimony from Det. Harasimchuk about a condom, the name \u201cHarry or Henry,\u201d or M.S.\u2019s assailant being bald or having tattoos. By May 2013, the police were unable to develop a suspect from this information, and the case went cold.\n\nCleveland police officer Timothy McGinty testified that he responded to a sexual assault call at M.S.\u2019s house on December 23, 2012. Officer McGinty testified that the front door jamb was pushed out, indicating forced entry, and there was \u201csome kind of lamp globe that\u2019s broken on the floor.\u201d Officer McGinty testified that M.S. was \u201cvery upset,\u201d and he requested EMS transport her to the hospital. Furthermore, Officer McGinty testified that he went back to M.S.\u2019s house after accompanying her to the hospital to look for a fingernail that M.S. stated broke off during the attack.\n\nQ: Okay. And included in your work was a visit to Fairview Hospital and then a return visit to the house to look for a fingernail?\n\nA: Correct.\n\nQ: *** Did you look for a condom wrapper while you were at the scene of the house?\n\nA: We looked for any kind of evidence.\n\nQ: Were you ever told about a condom wrapper?\n\nA: No.\n\nMeredith Molnar testified that, in 2012, she was working as a sexual assault nurse examiner (\u201cSANE nurse\u201d) at Fairview Hospital. On\nDecember 23, 2012, she examined M.S. for a sexual assault. Molnar testified that she asked M.S. what happened and M.S. reported to her that the following occurred:\n\nMe and my fianc\u00e9 and my kids were chilling in my house watching TV and my fianc\u00e9 was getting ready to go to the bus for work and I was getting my kids ready for bed around 9 p.m. I went to the hallway to get clothes and into the kitchen to get food for dinner and into the bathroom to wash [C.M.] up. She was in the tub. I told her to give me a few minutes to get dinner ready and she said okay.\n\nThen I went into the hallway and I heard someone banging really loud on the front door. I waited in the hallway and someone was banging again on the front door, so I went to go see who it was through the curtain on the door and the man bum-rushed the door somehow. The door hit me on my head and I stumbled back and he got past me in the hallway in the house, and I heard my daughter yell out for me, and I think it scared him or something and he started choking me from behind with one of his arms and my mouth started foaming and I think I passed out. I woke up because my daughter was hitting my legs above my knees yelling at me to get up. I woke up and I didn\u2019t see him and my shorts were messed up and down to my thighs. My shirt was still on. I panicked and all I could do is cry.\n\nMy daughter called her auntie, who lived down the street, and she came over and called 911.\n\nMolnar testified that M.S. assumed she was penetrated vaginally, because her pants were down, \u201cbut she was unsure if a penis or fingers were penetrating her vagina.\u201d Furthermore, M.S. indicated \u201cthat she thinks she remembers performing oral sex\u201d on the offender. Based on these allegations, Molnar took swabs of M.S.\u2019s vaginal and oral cavities, as well as other areas of her body, including a \u201cdried stain\u201d of M.S.\u2019s neck \u201cbecause she stated [she] was being choked by the assailant with one arm.\u201d Molnar explained that for a dried stain, \u201cwe will dip sterile swabs in sterile water and swab that area for possible DNA.\u201d\n\nMolnar also took pictures of M.S.\u2019s neck, on which was a \u201clinear superficial laceration.\u201d M.S. had additional \u201cfresh\u201d bruising on her chin, upper back, left arm, wrist, and hand, and both knees. Molnar testified that M.S. was \u201cvery emotional, crying, shaking, talking very quickly.\u201d According to Molnar, M.S. indicated to her that Ladson left the house prior to the incident occurring. Nothing in Molnar\u2019s testimony or M.S.\u2019s medical records indicated a description of M.S.\u2019s\nattacker, including whether he was bald or had tattoos. There is also no mention of the name \u201cHarry or Henry\u201d; rather, M.S.\u2019s medical records indicated that the attacker was a \u201cstranger.\u201d Additionally, a checklist that is part of M.S.\u2019s medical records asked if a condom was used at the time of the assault, and the box checked is \u201cUnsure.\u201d\n\nHristina Lekova is a DNA analyst at the Cuyahoga County Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, and she processed M.S.\u2019s rape kit in January 2013. According to Lekova, \u201cMarcus Ladson\u2019s DNA is present in the sperm fraction of the anal swab and the cutting from the crotch area of the underpants. It\u2019s also in the sperm fraction of the vaginal swab ***. He\u2019s also part of the mixture in the dried stain on the neck *** as well as the fingernail scrapings.\u201d\n\nNo \u201cseminal fluid\u201d was found in M.S.\u2019s oral swab. An enzyme consistent with vaginal fluid or saliva was found in M.S.\u2019s oral swab, although Lekova did not reach a conclusion regarding the oral swab, other than the enzyme \u201cdid not come from the seminal material.\u201d The state asked Lekova, \u201cif somebody was wearing a condom and put a condom in a victim mouth and had vaginal fluid on that condom, would that be consistent with your findings?\u201d Lekova answered, \u201cYes, that\u2019s possible for that vaginal fluid to be transferred in the mouth cavity.\u201d\n\nOther than Ladson\u2019s and M.S.\u2019s DNA, an unknown DNA profile was found on the \u201cdried stain\u201d swab taken from M.S.\u2019s neck. This unknown DNA profile was uploaded to the CODIS database, and the case went cold.\n\nLekova\u2019s involvement in this case resumed in December 2015, when she was given a reference swab of Jordan\u2019s DNA that was submitted in another case. Lekova testified that \u201cJordan could not be excluded as a possible contributor to the DNA mixture obtained from *** the dried stain\u201d found on M.S.\u2019s neck. According to Lekova, the material of the dried stain, i.e., what kind of bodily fluid, was unknown. Asked if Jordan\u2019s DNA was found in M.S.\u2019s vaginal swab, Lekova replied, \u201cThere is no Mr. Jordan in the vaginal swab.\u201d Lekova further explained that if an offender uses a condom, she would not expect to find his DNA in the victim\u2019s vaginal swab.\n\nCleveland police detective Karl Lessman testified that he works in the CODIS Task Force of the Sex Crimes Unit. In October 2015, he received information from the coroner\u2019s office identifying Jordan as \u201ca hit\u201d in M.S.\u2019s cold case. Det. Lessman compiled a photo array and, along with former Det. Harasimchuk, went to M.S.\u2019s house to see if she could\nidentify her attacker. M.S. picked Jordan\u2019s photo out of the lineup. Det. Lessman located Jordan and took a bucal swab from him, which was sent to the DNA lab. Jordan\u2019s DNA was identified as a match with the DNA found on the dried stain on M.S.\u2019s neck.\n\n\u00b6 6 In January 2019, Jordan filed a petition for postconviction relief, which the trial court denied on March 22, 2019. While the trial court initially denied Jordan\u2019s requests for findings of fact and conclusions of law, it ultimately issued them in December 2019, after Jordan filed a writ of mandamus in the Ohio Supreme Court. It is from this judgment that Jordan now appeals.\n\nII. Petition for Postconviction Relief\n\n\u00b6 7 R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) permits a petitioner who claims \u201cthat there was such a denial or infringement of the person\u2019s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States\u201d to petition \u201cthe court to vacate or set aside the judgment or sentence or to grant other appropriate relief.\u201d Petitioners must state all grounds for relief on which they rely, and they waive all other grounds not set forth in the petition. R.C. 2953.21(A)(4). In determining whether substantive grounds for relief exist, the trial court must consider, among other things, the petition, the supporting affidavits, and the documentary evidence filed in support of the petition. R.C. 2953.21(C).\n\n\u00b6 8 A postconviction proceeding is not an appeal of a criminal conviction, but, rather, a collateral civil attack on the judgment. State v. Steffen, 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410, 639 N.E.2d 67 (1994). \u201cIt is a means to reach constitutional issues which would otherwise be impossible to reach because the evidence supporting those\nissues is not contained in the record.\u201d *State v. Murphy*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 00AP-233, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 6129, 5 (Dec. 26, 2000).\n\n\u00b6 9 A postconviction petition, however, does not provide a petitioner a second opportunity to litigate the conviction. *State v. Hessler*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 01 AP-1011, 2002-Ohio-3321, \u00b6 32. Therefore, a petition for postconviction relief is not the proper vehicle to raise issues that were or could have been determined on direct appeal. *State v. Perry*, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph seven of the syllabus.\n\n\u00b6 10 A criminal defendant seeking to challenge his conviction through a petition for postconviction relief is not automatically entitled to a hearing. R.C. 2953.21; *State v. Calhoun*, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 282, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999). According to R.C. 2953.21(C), a petitioner is entitled to a hearing when, upon review of the petition and the record, the trial court finds that there are \u201csubstantive grounds for relief.\u201d In making such a determination, the trial court must consider the petition and supporting affidavits as well as all of the files and records pertaining to the proceedings against the petitioner. R.C. 2953.21(C). A trial court\u2019s decision to deny a postconviction petition without a hearing is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. *State v. Gondor*, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 45; *State v. Abdussatar*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92439, 2009-Ohio-5232, \u00b6 15.\n\n\u00b6 11 The trial court does not abuse its discretion in dismissing a petition for postconviction relief without a hearing where (1) the petitioner fails to set out\nsufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, or (2) the operation of res judicata prohibits the claims advanced in the petition. *Id.* The evidence submitted with the petition must be competent, relevant, and material and not merely cumulative of or alternative to evidence presented at trial. *State v. Combs*, 100 Ohio App.3d 90, 97-98, 652 N.E.2d 205 (1st Dist.1994).\n\n**III. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law**\n\n12 In his first assignment of error, Jordan argues that his due process rights were violated when the trial court had an ex parte communication with the state \u201cconcerning the findings of fact[] and conclusions of law\u201d and because the trial court adopted the state\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions verbatim. In his second assignment of error, he argues that \u201c[t]he odor of bias\u201d against him was \u201coverwhelming\u201d because the trial court \u201cimproperly conduct[ed] ex parte communications with the prosecutor.\u201d We will address these assignments of error together because they are interrelated.\n\n13 When a trial court denies a postconviction relief petition, R.C. 2953.21(H) requires the trial court to make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law. The purpose of requiring findings of fact and conclusions of law is to apprise the petitioner of the basis for the court\u2019s disposition and to facilitate meaningful appellate review. *State ex rel. Carrion v. Harris*, 40 Ohio St.3d 19, 19, 530 N.E.2d 1330 (1988).\nIn *State v. Maxwell*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107758, 2020-Ohio-3027, a case involving a trial court\u2019s denial of a postconviction petition, this court recently explained:\n\nWhen a party\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law are accurate in law and in fact, nothing prohibits a trial court from adopting that party\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a postconviction proceeding. *State v. Williams*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 85180, 2005-Ohio-3023, \u00b6 35, citing *State v. Combs*, 100 Ohio App.3d 90, 652 N.E.2d 205 (1st Dist.1994). \u201cIn the absence of demonstrated prejudice, it is not erroneous for the trial court to adopt, in verbatim form, findings of fact and conclusions of law which are submitted by the state.\u201d *State v. Thomas*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87666, 2006-Ohio-6588, \u00b6 15, citing *State v. Powell*, 90 Ohio App.3d 260, 263, 629 N.E.2d 13 (1st Dist.1993). Moreover, a trial court may adopt verbatim a party\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law as its own if it has thoroughly read the document to ensure that it is completely accurate in fact and law. *State v. Jester*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 83520, 2004-Ohio-3611, \u00b6 16; see also *Thomas* at id.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 13.\n\nThere is nothing in the record in this case that establishes the trial court had an ex parte communication with the state at any point. Jordan makes assumptions based upon how quickly the state filed findings of fact and conclusions of law and how quickly the trial court adopted them verbatim. Jordan questions \u201chow * * * the [s]tate [knew] to file such proposed findings.\u201d Jordan makes an unsupported assumption that \u201c[e]vidently, the [j]udge or the [j]udge\u2019s counsel (his agent) told the prosecutor handling the [postconviction] [p]etition to prepare [findings of fact and conclusions of law] ex parte.\u201d In support of his assumption, he points out that \u201c[a] lot of activity took place on this [p]etition in the 48 hours\nbetween December 17 \u2013 19, 2019, after months of inactivity.\u201d But Jordan fails to acknowledge that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s docket is public for anyone to view.\n\n{\u00b6 16} Jordan further argues that a \u201ctrial court cannot delegate its deliberative process,\u201d and the trial court here did so when it used the state\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Jordan cites to State v. Roberts, 110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168, and State v. Pickens, 2016-Ohio-5257, 60 N.E.3d 20 (1st Dist.), claiming his case \u201cfits squarely in the analysis\u201d of these cases. However, both Roberts and Pickens involved the trial court\u2019s ex parte communications with the state in rendering its judicial opinions, and there is simply no evidence of that here.\n\n{\u00b6 17} Roberts is further distinguishable because it involved a trial court \u201cdirectly involv[ing] the prosecutor in preparing the sentencing opinion\u201d in a death-penalty case, which the Ohio Supreme Court stated is not permitted. Id. at \u00b6 159. Pickens is also distinguishable because the prosecutor in the case did not file the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and did not serve them on the defendant. Id. at \u00b6 9. Here, the prosecutor both filed her proposed findings and conclusions and served a copy on Jordan\u2019s counsel the same day that she filed them. Accordingly, we disagree with Jordan that this case falls \u201csquarely in the analysis\u201d of Roberts and Pickens.\n\n{\u00b6 18} Further, we find no merit to Jordan\u2019s second assignment of error that the trial court was biased against him due to ex parte communications occurring between the judge and the state. We further note that Jordan had every opportunity\nalong the way, from May until December, to file his own proposed findings and conclusions of law, and he did not do so.\n\n\u00b6 19 Thus, we overrule Jordan\u2019s first and second assignments of error.\n\nIV. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n\u00b6 20 In his third assignment of error, Jordan argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately investigate his case, violating his constitutional rights.\n\n\u00b6 21 The trial court found that Jordan\u2019s claim for ineffective assistance of counsel is barred by res judicata because he raised the same issue in his direct appeal. Additionally, the trial court addressed the merits of Jordan\u2019s claim and found it to be meritless.\n\nA. Res Judicata\n\n\u00b6 22 Under the doctrine of res judicata, \u201ca valid, final judgment rendered upon the merits bars all subsequent actions based upon any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the previous action.\u201d State v. Patrick, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99418, 2013-Ohio-5020, \u00b6 7, citing Grava v. Parkman Twp., 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 382, 653 N.E.2d 226 (1995). To overcome the res judicata bar, the petitioner must show, using extrinsic evidence, that he or she could not have appealed the original constitutional claim based on the information in the original trial record. Combs, 100 Ohio App.3d at 97-98, 652 N.E.2d 205. Said another way, issues properly raised in a petition for postconviction relief are only those that could not have been raised on direct appeal because the evidence\nsupporting such issues is outside the record. *State v. Milanovich*, 42 Ohio St.2d 46, 50, 325 N.E.2d 540 (1975). Thus, a trial court may dismiss a petition based on res judicata if an issue was or should have been raised on direct appeal. *State v. Dowell*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 86232, 2006-Ohio-110, \u00b6 10, citing *Perry*, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph seven of the syllabus.\n\nExtrinsic evidence attached to the petition, however, does not automatically defeat the res judicata bar. Rather, evidence outside the record must meet \u201csome threshold standard of cogency; otherwise it would be too easy to defeat the holding of *Perry* by simply attaching as exhibits evidence which is only marginally significant and does not advance the petitioner\u2019s claim[.]\u201d *State v. Lawson*, 103 Ohio App.3d 307, 315, 659 N.E.2d 362 (12th Dist.1995), quoting *State v. Coleman*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-900811, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 1485, 21 (Mar. 17, 1993). Moreover, the evidence dehors the record must not be evidence that was in existence and available for use at the time of trial and that could and should have been submitted at trial if the defendant wished to use it. *Dowell* at \u00b6 10.\n\nIn his direct appeal, Jordan argued that\n\nhis trial counsel was ineffective by failing to investigate and pursue the theory that Ladson was the man who raped M.S. Jordan alleges that counsel should have cross examined witnesses about Ladson and presented \u201cevidence in the public record concerning\u201d Ladson, including Ladson\u2019s 2015 and 2016 convictions for murder and other gang-related violent felonies, which resulted in a sentence of life in prison.\n\n*Jordan*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106272, 2018-Ohio-4108, at \u00b6 42.\nThe state argued that trial counsel was not ineffective because trial counsel\u2019s decision was a strategic decision and that Jordan was not prejudiced because it was only speculation that the outcome of trial would have been different had trial counsel investigated Ladson. *Id.* at \u00b6 42. We agreed. *Id.* at \u00b6 43-44. We pointed out that the victim had \u201cconsistently maintained that her sexual activity with Ladson was consensual.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 43. We rejected Jordan\u2019s argument, finding that Jordan failed to show that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that he was prejudiced. *Id.* at \u00b6 44.\n\nIn his direct appeal, Jordan had asked this court to take judicial notice of four exhibits that the state used in Ladson\u2019s murder trial, including three pictures of Ladson showing his tattoos and one expert report from a detective in the Cleveland Police Department\u2019s Gang Impact Unit concluding that Ladson was a member of the criminal gang the Heartless Felons. We declined to do so. *Id.* at \u00b6 7. Jordan attached those exhibits to his petition for postconviction relief as well as an affidavit from his trial counsel.\n\nJordan\u2019s trial counsel averred that he \u201cdid not employ an investigator and did not otherwise discover any photographs of the victim\u2019s [fianc\u00e9] or any reports about him being a Heartless Felon gang member.\u201d Trial counsel further stated that he \u201cwas aware that the [fianc\u00e9] was serving a prison sentence at the time\u201d of Jordan\u2019s trial and that if counsel had \u201chad the photographs of the [fianc\u00e9] and the report of him being a member of the Heartless Felons gang then [he] would have used them to [Jordan\u2019s] benefit at his trial.\u201d Thus, although the exhibits were\navailable at the time of Jordan\u2019s trial, his trial counsel stated in the affidavit attached to Jordan\u2019s petition for postconviction relief that he did not investigate the matter or discover the exhibits. That is the basis of Jordan\u2019s claim now.\n\n{\u00b6 28} When a postconviction claim depends for its resolution upon outside evidence, a common pleas court may not apply res judicata to dismiss the claim. Perry at paragraph nine of the syllabus. But a reviewing court may sustain the claim\u2019s dismissal on other grounds. State v. Peagler, 76 Ohio St.3d 496, 668 N.E.2d 489 (1996), paragraph one of the syllabus. After review, we do not agree with the trial court that Jordan\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was barred by res judicata. We will therefore address the merits of Jordan\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which the trial court did as well.\n\nB. Merits of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim\n\n{\u00b6 29} To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance, a defendant must establish that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the defendant was prejudiced by the deficient performance. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Counsel will only be considered deficient if his or her conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Id. at 688. Further, a defendant must show that he or she was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Id. at 694.\n\n{\u00b6 30} When reviewing counsel\u2019s performance, this court must be highly deferential and \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d Id. at 689. To\nestablish resulting prejudice, a \u201cdefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d *Id.* at 694. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d *Id.*\n\n\u00b6 31 Jordan contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failure to adequately investigate Ladson and the fact that Ladson had tattoos. However, Jordan\u2019s entire argument that his trial counsel was ineffective is based on his assertion is that the SANE nurse\u2019s notes \u201cstate clearly\u201d that the victim told her \u201cshortly after the attack that her fianc\u00e9 [Ladson] was home during the attack\u201d and that her attacker had tattoos that \u201ccover his body.\u201d Jordan further claims that the victim \u201ctold the authorities the attacker had tattoos including neck/facial tattoos.\u201d Jordan claims that the exhibits attached to his petition establish that Ladson had tattoos all over his body and was a member of the Heartless Felons. Jordan maintains these exhibits would have changed the outcome of his case because he does not have tattoos on his neck or face, his DNA was not found on the victim\u2019s vaginal or anal swabs, and Ladson\u2019s DNA was found on both of the victim\u2019s swabs. He contends that this \u201ccase presents itself completely differently after the exhibits and facts contained in the exhibits submitted in postconviction are considered.\u201d We disagree.\n\n\u00b6 32 Throughout his petition and appellate brief, Jordan repeats that the evidence presented at trial established that the victim told the SANE nurse that her fianc\u00e9 was home during the attack and that her attacker had tattoos all over his body.\nThese claims are simply not true. Nor is it true that the evidence presented at trial established that the victim told police that her attacker had tattoos on his face or neck.\n\n\u00b6 33 In Jordan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, we stated that according to the SANE nurse\u2019s notes discussing the victim\u2019s narrative of what occurred, the victim told the SANE nurse that on the evening of December 23, 2012, she and her fianc\u00e9 and children were \u201cchilling in [her] house watching TV and [her] fianc\u00e9 was getting ready to go to the bus for work and [she] was getting her kids ready for bed around 9 pm.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 18. The victim continued to describe what occurred after that without specifically stating that her fianc\u00e9 left to go to work at some point before the attack. But we explained that \u201c[a]ccording to [the SANE nurse], M.S. indicated to her that [her fianc\u00e9] left the house prior to the incident occurring.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 20. And we pointed out in Jordan\u2019s direct appeal that \u201c[t]here is nothing in the medical records, SANE nurse\u2019s testimony, or the police officer\u2019s testimony indicating that M.S. told anyone that her attacker * * * was bald, or that he had tattoos.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 38. Finally, we stated that the SANE nurse\u2019s notes and M.S.\u2019s medical records were introduced into evidence, although we acknowledged that no police reports were made part of the record. Id. at \u00b6 37.\n\n\u00b6 34 Even if we assume for the sake of argument now that Jordan\u2019s trial counsel should have investigated Ladson further, Jordan has not established that he was prejudiced by such a purported deficient performance. As we found in Jordan\u2019s direct appeal, the victim consistently maintained that she had consensual sex only\nwith Ladson. Moreover, Jordan fails to account for the fact that the victim\u2019s daughter, who was five years old at the time of the rape and nine years old at the time of trial, testified that she had never before seen the man whose pants were \u201cdown halfway\u201d and was \u201con top\u201d of her mother. At the time of the rape, Ladson was the victim\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and thus, the victim\u2019s daughter would have known him at the time of the attack (although she did not remember Ladson at the time of trial four years later). And most importantly, Jordan\u2019s theory that the victim told the nurse that her fianc\u00e9 was home at the time of the rape and that her attacker had tattoos, and that she told police that her attacker had tattoos, is not supported by the evidence. Although the victim did testify that she thought she told police that her attacker had tattoos, even Jordan acknowledges that what she told police and the SANE nurse immediately following the attack (which was over four years earlier) would be more credible, and she did not mention tattoos to the nurse or police. Thus, the exhibits that Jordan attached to his petition showing Ladson\u2019s tattoos and that he was a member of the Heartless Felons, do not establish \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule Jordan\u2019s third assignment of error.\n\nV. Brady Violation\n\nIn his fourth assignment of error, Jordan maintains that his due process rights were violated when the state failed to disclose Brady material to him. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). In his\ndirect appeal, Jordan argued that the prosecutors committed misconduct when they \u201cfailed to turn over to the defense information regarding Ladson\u2019s gang and criminal activity.\u201d *Jordan*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, \u00b6 46. In his petition for postconviction relief, he argues that the state should have disclosed the photos of Ladson evidencing his tattoos and the gang report showing that Ladson was a member of the Heartless Felons. According to Jordan, the same prosecutor who tried his case also tried Ladson\u2019s murder case and admitted these exhibits in Ladson\u2019s criminal cases.\n\n\u00b6 37 The trial court found that Jordan\u2019s *Brady* claim was barred by res judicata and was meritless. After review, we agree with the trial court that Jordan\u2019s claim regarding Ladson\u2019s criminal activity is barred by res judicata. Although the documents establishing Ladson\u2019s criminal gang activity were not before this court in Jordan\u2019s direct appeal, Jordan still argued that the prosecutor should have turned them over to defense counsel. We fully addressed this argument and therefore find that Jordan cannot now raise it in his postconviction petition. We will, however, address Jordan\u2019s claim with respect to the photo exhibits attached to his petition showing that Ladson has tattoos all over his body.\n\n\u00b6 38 As we explained in *Jordan*, \u201c*Brady* stands for the proposition that \u2018the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u2019\u201d *Jordan*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, \u00b6 46, quoting *Brady* at 87. See\nalso Crim.R. 16(B)(5). We further stated in Jordan that \u201cBrady does not apply to materials that are not wholly within the control of the prosecution. There is no need to require the state to \u201cdisclose\u201d material that is readily available to the defense.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 47, quoting State v. McGuire, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105732, 2018-Ohio-1390, \u00b6 24.\n\n\u00b6 39 Ladson was convicted of murder in June 2016. Jordan\u2019s trial was not until January 2017. The photo exhibits of Ladson\u2019s tattoos were not ones that were wholly within the state\u2019s control because they were part of the public record in Ladson\u2019s criminal trial where the state proved that Ladson was a member of the Heartless Felons and had tattoos on his body indicative of membership in the gang. Therefore, the state was not required to disclose these photos to Jordan.\n\n\u00b6 40 Moreover, as we explained in the previous assignment of error, the exhibits that Jordan attached to his petition for postconviction relief showing Ladson was \u201ccovered\u201d in tattoos, had been convicted of murder, and was a member of the Heartless Felons is not material or exculpatory.\n\n\u00b6 41 Accordingly, Jordan\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nVI. Actual Innocence\n\n\u00b6 42 In his fifth assignment of error, Jordan argues that he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the acts against the victim and asks this court to recognize this as a freestanding, cognizable claim.\n\n\u00b6 43 The state contends that this claim fails under State v. Apanovitch, 155 Ohio St.3d 358, 2018-Ohio-4744, 121 N.E.3d 351. In his reply to this court, Jordan\ncounters that *Apanovitch* held no such thing. An in-depth review of *Apanovitch* is necessary.\n\n\u00b6 44 In *Apanovitch*, the defendant was convicted of one count each of aggravated murder and aggravated burglary, and two counts of rape. He was sentenced to death in January 1985. The body of the victim was found in a bedroom of her home. She had been strangled and severely beaten, and sperm was found in her mouth and vagina.\n\n\u00b6 45 Apanovitch\u2019s case before the Ohio Supreme Court involved his fourth postconviction petition based on newly discovered DNA evidence taken from the victim\u2019s vagina. After a hearing, the trial court found that because Apanovitch\u2019s DNA could not have contributed to the vaginal swab taken from the victim, that Apanovitch \u201cpresented clear and convincing evidence of his actual innocence of vaginal rape, and acquitted him of same.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 28. This court upheld the trial court\u2019s findings. *State v. Apanovitch*, 2016-Ohio-2831, 64 N.E.3d 429, \u00b6 46 (8th Dist.).\n\n\u00b6 46 Apanovitch brought his fourth postconviction petition under R.C. 2953.23(A)(2), which states:\n\nThe petitioner was convicted of a felony, the petitioner is an offender for whom DNA testing was performed under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code or under former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code and analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence related to the inmate\u2019s case as described in division (D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, and the results of the DNA testing establish, by clear and convincing evidence, actual innocence of that felony offense or, if the person was sentenced to death, establish, by clear and convincing evidence, actual\ninnocence of the aggravating circumstance or circumstances the person was found guilty of committing and that is or are the basis of that sentence of death.\n\nAs used in this division, \u201cactual innocence\u201d has the same meaning as in division (A)(1)(b) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code, and \u201cformer section 2953.82 of the Revised Code has the same meaning as in division (A)(1)(c) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code.\n\n\u00b6 47 R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(b) defines \u201cactual innocence.\u201d It states:\n\n\u201c[A]ctual innocence\u201d means that, had the results of the DNA testing conducted under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code or under former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code been presented at trial, and had those results been analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence related to the person\u2019s case as described in division (D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted, or, if the person was sentenced to death, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the aggravating circumstance or circumstances the petitioner was found guilty of committing and that is or are the basis of that sentence of death.\n\n\u00b6 48 Because Apanovitch\u2019s petition for postconviction relief was an untimely and successive petition, it fell under R.C. 2953.23(A), which the Supreme Court explained is jurisdictional and only permits an inmate to file a petition \u201cunder specific, limited circumstances.\u201d Apanovitch, 155 Ohio St.3d 358, 2018-Ohio-4744, 121 N.E.3d 351, \u00b6 22. Under this provision, a petitioner must meet the criteria in either R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) or (2) before a trial court can consider the petition.\n\n\u00b6 49 R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) provides that petitioner must show both of the following: (a) the petitioner was \u201cunavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts\u201d upon which the petitioner relies or the petitioner is asserting a claim based on a new, retroactively applicable federal or state right recognized by the United States\nSupreme Court after the petition became untimely and after the petitioner had filed earlier petitions, and (b) the petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty or eligible for the death sentence but for \u201cconstitutional error at trial.\u201d R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a) and (b).\n\nThe second exception under R.C. 2953.23(A)(2) applies when the results of DNA testing establish by clear and convincing evidence the petitioner\u2019s \u201cactual innocence\u201d of a felony offense of which the petitioner was convicted or of an aggravating circumstance that is the basis of a death sentence. Because this subsection is not relevant to our present analysis, we will not discuss the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of this subsection here, except to note that the Supreme Court held that Apanovitch did not meet the requirements to file a petition for postconviction relief under this section. See id. at \u00b6 27-34.\n\nThe Supreme Court further held that Apanovitch did not meet the jurisdictional criteria under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1). First, the Supreme Court determined that it did not need to determine if Apanovitch satisfied R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a), because he \u201cclearly [had] not satisfied R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b), which require[d] him to show that his conviction resulted from \u2018constitutional error at trial.\u2019\u201d Id. at \u00b6 26. In arguing that he satisfied R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b), Apanovitch asserted only that he was actually innocent of rape. But the Supreme Court explained that \u201cunder the United States Constitution, an actual-innocence claim \u2018is not itself a constitutional claim,\u2019\u201d and \u201ctherefore does not involve a \u2018constitutional error at trial\u2019 under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b).\u201d Id., quoting Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S.\n390, 404, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993). Because Apanovitch did not raise any other argument relating to a \u201cconstitutional error at trial,\u201d the Supreme Court held that his petition did not qualify under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1).\n\n{\u00b6 52} The Ohio Supreme Court held in Apanovitch that a claim for \u201cactual innocence\u201d does not amount to a \u201cconstitutional error at trial\u201d for purposes of establishing R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b). In this case, however, we are not dealing with an untimely or successive petition under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b). Rather, we are addressing a timely and first petition for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a).\n\n{\u00b6 53} Nonetheless, Apanovitch is still instructive here. And after reviewing the relevant case law, we find that because a claim for actual innocence \u201cis not itself a constitutional claim,\u201d it does not set forth a cognizable claim under R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) either. Because Jordan\u2019s petition does not involve DNA testing or a death sentence, the relevant portion of R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) permits a petitioner to file a petition asking a court to set aside or vacate his or conviction when the petitioner claims \u201cthat there was such a denial or infringement of the person\u2019s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Thus, a claim for actual innocence cannot meet the requirements of R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) because it \u201cis not itself\u201d a constitutional claim. Ohio courts have held as much. See State v. Zich, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-15-1263, 2017-Ohio-414, \u00b623, discretionary appeal not accepted, 151 Ohio St.3d 1425, 2017-Ohio-8371, 84 N.E.3d 1063 (\u201cIn light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s\ndecision in *Herrera*, we find no merit to appellant\u2019s due process arguments regarding his claims of actual innocence.\u201d); *State v. Watson*, 126 Ohio App.3d 316, 323, 710 N.E.2d 340 (12th Dist.1998) (\u201cSince the United States Supreme Court has not recognized actual innocence as a constitutional right, we also refuse to judicially create such a constitutional right.\u201d); *State v. Loza*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA96-10-214, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4574 (Oct. 13, 1997) (\u201cCourts have interpreted *Herrera* to stand for the proposition that a petitioner is not entitled to postconviction relief without a showing of a violation of rights that were constitutional in dimension, which occurred at the time that the petitioner was tried and convicted.\u201d); *State v. Hunter*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-090569, 2012-Ohio-2859, \u00b6 54 (an actual innocence claim does not demonstrate \u201ca constitutional violation in the proceedings\u201d that led to the petitioner\u2019s conviction); *State v. Davis*, 5th Dist. Licking No. 2008-CA-16, 2008-Ohio-6841 (\u201cThe trial court did not err in dismissing appellant\u2019s claim of actual innocence because his claim fails to raise \u2018a denial or infringement of appellant\u2019s rights under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States\u2019 as required by R.C. 2953.21.\u201d); *State v. Nash*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87635, 2006-Ohio-5925, \u00b6 14 (\u201c[T]rial court did not err in failing to consider the merits of this \u2018actual innocence\u2019 claim because the claim fails to raise \u2018a denial or infringement of rights under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States\u2019 as required by R.C. 2953.21.\u201d); *State v. Hines*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 89848, 2008-Ohio-1927, \u00b6 24, quoting *State v. Williams*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 85180, 2005-Ohio-3023, \u00b6 31 (\u201c[A] claim of actual innocence is not itself a\nconstitutional claim, nor does it constitute a substantive ground for postconviction relief.\u201d\n\nMoreover, R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23 address the phrase, \u201cactual innocence,\u201d throughout the text of the statutes. R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(b) defines \u201cactual innocence\u201d for purposes of postconviction petitions (which we previously set forth). Indeed, throughout the entirety of R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23, the General Assembly discusses \u201cactual innocence,\u201d but only in terms of DNA testing. Nowhere in R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23 do the statutes allow for a claim of \u201cactual innocence\u201d except with respect to DNA testing.\n\nJordan contends that he has \u201csquarely raised a [d]ue-[p]rocess claim under both the Ohio and federal [c]onstitutions\u201d in his petition for postconviction relief by asserting that he is actually innocent and maintaining that he established as much through the documents he attached to his petition. He asks this court to recognize his \u201cfreestanding actual innocence claim\u201d that no other court in Ohio has previously recognized in a petition for postconviction relief. Again, \u201cR.C. 2953.21(A) requires a petitioner for postconviction relief to allege a \u2018denial or infringement\u2019 of [the person\u2019s] rights under the Ohio or United States Constitutions.\u201d Thus, this requires petitioners to show that a procedural error occurred at trial such that their constitutional rights were violated. State v. Warmus, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99962, 2014-Ohio-928, \u00b6 8 (discussing the petitioner\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct denying him a fair trial, ineffective assistance of counsel violating his Sixth Amendment rights, and a denial of his Fifth\nAmendment right against self-incrimination). A claim of \u201cactual innocence, however, involves a claim of factual innocence. As explained by the Iowa Supreme Court in *Dewberry v. State*, 941 N.W.2d 1 (Iowa 2019), regarding a \u201cfreestanding claim of actual innocence\u201d:\n\nOur understanding of actual innocence is consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s approach to actual innocence. The Supreme Court has \u201cnot resolved whether a prisoner may be entitled to habeas relief based on a freestanding claim of actual innocence.\u201d *McQuiggin v. Perkins*, 569 U.S. 383, 392, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 1931, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013); see *Schmidt v. State*, 909 N.W.2d [778,] 790 [Iowa 2018] (stating the Supreme Court has not yet recognized a freestanding claim of actual innocence). Instead, the Supreme Court has recognized \u201ca gateway claim of actual innocence such that the petitioner may obtain review of the underlying constitutional merits of his or her procedurally defaulted claim.\u201d *Schmidt*, 909 N.W.2d at 790 (citing *Herrera*, 506 U.S. at 404, 113 S.Ct. at 862 (majority opinion), and *In re Davis*, 557 U.S. 952, 955, 130 S.Ct. 1, 3, 174 L.Ed.2d 614 (2009) (Scalia, J., dissenting)). In discussing the concept of actual innocence in this context, the Court has made clear it is referring to factual innocence:\n\n\u201cA prototypical example of \u2018actual innocence\u2019 in a colloquial sense is the case where the State has convicted the wrong person of the crime. Such claims are of course regularly made on motions for new trial after conviction in both state and federal courts, and quite regularly denied because the evidence adduced in support of them fails to meet the rigorous standards for granting such motions. But in rare instances it may turn out later, for example, that another person has credibly confessed to the crime, and it is evident that the law has made a mistake. In the context of a noncapital case, the concept of \u2018actual innocence\u2019 is easy to grasp.\u201d\n\n*Sawyer v. Whitley*, 505 U.S. 333, 340-41, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 2519-20, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992). In *Bousley v. United States*, the Court stated \u201c\u2018actual innocence\u2019 means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.\u201d 523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). This understanding of actual innocence is consistent with the Court\u2019s pronouncement that \u201csubstantial claim[s] of actual innocence are extremely rare.\u201d *Schlup v. Delo*, 513 U.S. 298, 321, 115 S.Ct. 851, 864, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995); see also *McQuiggin*, 569 U.S. at 386, 133\nS.Ct. at 1928 (cautioning that \u201ctenable actual-innocence gateway pleas are rare\u201d).\n\nDewberry at 6-7. We note that in Dewberry, the court refers to cases cited by Jordan in support of his argument, including Schmidt and Schlup.\n\n\u00b6 56 Thus, even assuming for the sake of argument that we could consider Jordan\u2019s freestanding claim of actual innocence, he would not be entitled to a new trial based upon the exhibits he attached to his petition. \u201cTo establish actual innocence, petitioners must demonstrate that, \u2018in light of all the evidence,\u2019 \u2018it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted\u2019\u201d them. Bousley at 623, quoting Schlup at 327-328. Although the Bousley court was discussing when a federal habeas court may grant a writ even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default; i.e., where a constitutional violation \u201c\u2018has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,\u2019\u201d it is instructional here (because that is what Jordan is attempting to claim). Id., quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 491-492, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986), superseded by statute on other grounds, Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, Pub. L. 104-132, Apr. 24, 1996, 110 Stat. 1214. But as we previously explained, Jordan\u2019s exhibits showing Ladson was \u201ccovered\u201d in tattoos, had been convicted of murder, and was a member of the Heartless Felons is not material or exculpatory to Jordan\u2019s claims, and certainly do not demonstrate that it is \u201c\u2018more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.\u2019\u201d Bousley at 623, quoting Schlup at 327-328.\nAfter review, we conclude that Jordan\u2019s \u201cactual innocence\u201d claim fails to raise \u201ca denial or infringement of rights under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States\u201d as required by R.C. 2953.21. We therefore overrule his fifth assignment of error.\n\nVII. Cumulative Error\n\nIn his six assignment of error, Jordan contends that \u201c[t]he cumulative effect of the errors in this case, * * * ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and a biased judge, amounted to a denial of a fair trial.\u201d Not having found any error or prejudice, Jordan\u2019s argument has no merit.\n\nAccordingly, we overrule Jordan\u2019s six assignments of error.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nIt is ordered that appellee recover from appellant the costs herein taxed.\n\nThe court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the common pleas court to carry this judgment into execution. The defendant\u2019s conviction having been affirmed, any bail pending is terminated. Case remanded to the trial court for execution of sentence.\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\nMARY J.

Baxter, Erie County Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee. \n \n Steven W. Yee, pro se. \n \n* * * * * \n \nJENSEN, P.J. \nI.  Introduction \n{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Steven W. Yee, appeals the judgment of the Erie County Court of \nCommon Pleas, denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  We affirm. \n   2.\nA.  Facts and Procedural Background \n{\u00b6 2} Appellant has been before this court on several occasions.  Most recently, \nwe considered appellant\u2019s arguments concerning a petition for postconviction relief that \nwas filed by him and denied by the trial court.  State v. Yee, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-12-017, \n2013-Ohio-5184.  In that case, we summarized the background facts of this case as \nfollows: \nIn March 1989, the Erie County Grand Jury issued a six count \nindictment against appellant, Steven W. Yee, charging three counts of \naggravated murder, murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery.  The \nindictment included both capital and firearm specifications. \nYee entered into a plea agreement wherein the state promised to \nnolle four counts of the indictment and the capital specifications.  In \nexchange, Yee agreed to enter a plea of guilty to one count of aggravated \nmurder with a firearm specification and one count of aggravated robbery \nwith a firearm specification.  On August 30, 1993, Yee appeared in court, \nwithdrew his previous pleas of not guilty and entered pleas of guilty \npursuant to the agreement.  When entering his plea, Yee reserved the right \nto appeal the trial court\u2019s authority to sentence him to two consecutive \nterms of incarceration on the firearm specifications. \nA sentencing hearing was held in September 1993.  As to the charge \nof aggravated murder, Yee was sentenced to life in prison with eligibility of \nparole after 20 years.  As to the charge of aggravated robbery, Yee was  3.\nsentenced to 10-25 years in prison.  Yee was sentenced to three years each \nfor the two firearm specifications.  The trial court ordered that the sentences \nfor the aggravated murder and aggravated robbery be served concurrently.  \nThe sentences for the firearm specifications were ordered to be served \nconsecutive to each other and consecutive to the concurrent sentences for \naggravated murder and aggravated robbery. \nYee appealed.  Upon review, we vacated the portion of the sentence \nwhich imposed two consecutive three-year terms of incarceration for the \nfirearm specifications.  See State v. Yee, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-93-72, 1994 \nOhio App. LEXIS 5142 (Nov. 18, 1994).  * * * \nWe remanded the matter to the trial court. \nOn December 28, 1995, with consent of counsel, the trial judge \nissued a judgment entry nunc pro tunc merging the firearm specifications \nand imposing three years of actual incarceration for the specifications.  The \nstated purpose of the entry was to \u201creflect the correct language as to the \nsentence imposed on the firearm specifications.\u201d  The judgment entry was \nfiled with the clerk of courts on January 4, 1996. \nOn July 27, 2004, Yee filed a motion for leave to withdraw his guilty \npleas or, in the alternative, to vacate and set aside the judgment of \nconviction.  The trial court denied Yee\u2019s motion.  On April 8, 2011, Yee \nfiled a motion to vacate his conviction or withdraw his guilty plea.  Again, \nthe trial court denied Yee\u2019s motion.  4.\n \nOn February 29, 2012, Yee filed a motion for de novo resentencing \npursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in State v. Johnson, 128 \nOhio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061.  The trial court, \nconstruing the motion as a petition for postconviction relief under R.C. \n2953.21, denied the motion as untimely.  The trial court also found that \nYee\u2019s claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.  Yee, 6th Dist. Erie \nNo. E-12-017, 2013-Ohio-5184, at \u00b6 2-8. \n{\u00b6 3} Appellant subsequently appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition for \npostconviction relief.  We rejected appellant\u2019s arguments, and found that the trial court \ndid not abuse its discretion in denying the postconviction petition.  Id. at \u00b6 15.   \n{\u00b6 4} Thereafter, on October 11, 2016, appellant filed a \u201cmotion for leave to \nwithdraw his \u2018void\u2019 guilty plea based on actual innocence, prosecutorial misconduct and \nnewly discovered evidence\u201d pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1.  In his motion, appellant asserted \nthat his conviction was void because he was lured into pleading guilty despite his \ninnocence based upon the state\u2019s pledge to seek the death penalty \u201cwith a 100% chance \nof acquiring it\u201d based on \u201cbogus\u201d DNA evidence.  In support of his argument, appellant \nstated that he had recently received documents the FBI sent to the Innocence Project on \nAugust 1, 2013, allegedly revealing that the federal government utilized misleading \nevidence to secure his convictions in federal court.  Appellant insisted that, had he been \naware of the use of such evidence, he would not have entered a guilty plea.  Appellant  5.\nfurther indicated that the state threatened to use the same \u201cbogus\u201d evidence as the federal \nauthorities used to secure the convictions. \n{\u00b6 5} In response to appellant\u2019s motion, the state noted that the evidence referred \nto by the FBI in its letter to the Innocence Project pertained to hair analysis that was \nperformed by the government\u2019s experts.  The conclusions drawn from the hair analysis \nwere later found to have exceeded the limits of science.  However, the state argued that \nthis evidence was inconsequential in light of the overwhelming incriminatory evidence \nthat remained to establish appellant\u2019s guilt.   \n{\u00b6 6} The state pointed out that the FBI\u2019s letter included a disclaimer that the \nBureau took \u201cno position regarding the materiality of the error in this case.\u201d  Moreover, \nthe state cited the additional incriminating evidence to support its opposition to \nappellant\u2019s motion.  This evidence placed appellant in the vicinity of the murder on the \nday in question, and included, inter alia, shell casings that were discovered in appellant\u2019s \nvehicle matching those found in the victim\u2019s vehicle as well as a coconspirator\u2019s blood \nfound in both the victim\u2019s vehicle and appellant\u2019s vehicle. \n{\u00b6 7} The state also emphasized the fact that appellant\u2019s guilty plea, which \nfollowed the state\u2019s disclosure of all incriminating evidence including the hair analysis, \nconstituted an absolute admission of guilt belying his claim of actual innocence. \n{\u00b6 8} Upon consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, the trial court issued its \ndecision summarily denying appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea on March 30, \n2017.  Appellant\u2019s timely notice of appeal followed. \n   6.\nB.  Assignments of Error \n{\u00b6 9} On appeal, appellant assigns the following errors for our review: \nAssignment of Error One: The trial court retains jurisdiction over \ndeciding a post sentencing motion to withdraw guilty plea, Crim.R. 32.1, \nand committed plain error, Crim.R. 52(B), and/or abused its discretion by \nthe denial of the appellant\u2019s motion. \nAssignment of Error Two: The trial court committed plain error, \nCrim.R. 52(B), and/or abused its discretion by the denial of Mr. Yee\u2019s \nmotion to withdraw his guilty plea that was improperly motivated and/or \ncoerced by the government that was utilizing bogus evidence to create a \nwindfall conviction, rendering the guilty plea void and open to collateral \nattack at any time. \nII.  Analysis \n{\u00b6 10} In his assignments of error, appellant argues that the trial court committed \nplain error in denying his Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty plea. \n{\u00b6 11} Under Crim.R. 32.1, \u201c[a] motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest \nmay be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court \nafter sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to \nwithdraw his or her plea.\u201d  A motion to withdraw a guilty plea made subsequent to \nsentencing will be granted only in \u201cextraordinary cases\u201d upon the demonstration of \nmanifest injustice.  State v. Smith, 49 Ohio St.2d 261, 264, 361 N.E.2d 1324 (1977).    7.\n{\u00b6 12} A motion made pursuant to Crim. R. 32.1 is left to the sound discretion of \nthe trial court.  Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.  Thus, we review the trial court\u2019s \ndecision denying appellant\u2019s motion under an abuse of discretion standard.  State v. \nFrancis, 104 Ohio St.3d 490, 2004-Ohio-6894, 820 N.E.2d 355, \u00b6 32.  Abuse of \ndiscretion suggests that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary or \nunconscionable.  Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 \n(1983). \n{\u00b6 13} In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court retained \njurisdiction to consider his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  In his second assignment \nof error, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion \nto withdraw his guilty plea.   \n{\u00b6 14} In making his arguments, appellant relies upon the FBI\u2019s letter to the \nInnocence Project as evidence that he was actually innocent of the crimes for which he \nwas convicted.  However, the statements made in the letter, as represented to this court by \nappellant, only call into question the veracity of a small fraction of the state\u2019s evidence \u2013 \nnamely the scientific reliability of the hair analysis that was performed in this case.  As \nnoted by the state, the incriminating evidence implicating appellant in this case was not \nlimited to the hair evidence.  Moreover, it is axiomatic that a guilty plea operates as a \ncomplete admission of guilt.  State v. Stumpf, 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 104, 512 N.E.2d 598 \n(1987).  Appellant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s plea colloquy or assert that his plea \nwas not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.    8.\n{\u00b6 15} In sum, we find that the newly discovered unreliability of the hair analysis \nevidence in this case, standing alone, does not justify a finding a manifest injustice \nnecessary to warrant the granting of appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea under \nCrim.R. 32.1.  Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in \ndenying the motion.  Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignments of error are not well-taken. \nIII.  Conclusion \n{\u00b6 16} In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the Erie County Court of \nCommon Pleas is affirmed.  Appellant is ordered to pay costs of this appeal pursuant to \nApp.R. 24. \nJudgment affirmed.  \nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to App.R. 27.   \nSee also 6th Dist.Loc.App.R. 4. \n \n \n \nMark L.

Yee, pro se.\n\nJENSEN, P.J.\n\nI. Introduction\n\n\u00b6 1 Appellant, Steven W. Yee, appeals the judgment of the Erie County Court of\nCommon Pleas, denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We affirm.\nA. Facts and Procedural Background\n\n\u00b6 2 Appellant has been before this court on several occasions. Most recently, we considered appellant\u2019s arguments concerning a petition for postconviction relief that was filed by him and denied by the trial court. State v. Yee, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-12-017, 2013-Ohio-5184. In that case, we summarized the background facts of this case as follows:\n\nIn March 1989, the Erie County Grand Jury issued a six count indictment against appellant, Steven W. Yee, charging three counts of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery. The indictment included both capital and firearm specifications.\n\nYee entered into a plea agreement wherein the state promised to nolle four counts of the indictment and the capital specifications. In exchange, Yee agreed to enter a plea of guilty to one count of aggravated murder with a firearm specification and one count of aggravated robbery with a firearm specification. On August 30, 1993, Yee appeared in court, withdrew his previous pleas of not guilty and entered pleas of guilty pursuant to the agreement. When entering his plea, Yee reserved the right to appeal the trial court\u2019s authority to sentence him to two consecutive terms of incarceration on the firearm specifications.\n\nA sentencing hearing was held in September 1993. As to the charge of aggravated murder, Yee was sentenced to life in prison with eligibility of parole after 20 years. As to the charge of aggravated robbery, Yee was 2.\nsentenced to 10-25 years in prison. Yee was sentenced to three years each for the two firearm specifications. The trial court ordered that the sentences for the aggravated murder and aggravated robbery be served concurrently. The sentences for the firearm specifications were ordered to be served consecutive to each other and consecutive to the concurrent sentences for aggravated murder and aggravated robbery.\n\nYee appealed. Upon review, we vacated the portion of the sentence which imposed two consecutive three-year terms of incarceration for the firearm specifications. See State v. Yee, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-93-72, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 5142 (Nov. 18, 1994). * * *\n\nWe remanded the matter to the trial court.\n\nOn December 28, 1995, with consent of counsel, the trial judge issued a judgment entry nunc pro tunc merging the firearm specifications and imposing three years of actual incarceration for the specifications. The stated purpose of the entry was to \u201creflect the correct language as to the sentence imposed on the firearm specifications.\u201d The judgment entry was filed with the clerk of courts on January 4, 1996.\n\nOn July 27, 2004, Yee filed a motion for leave to withdraw his guilty pleas or, in the alternative, to vacate and set aside the judgment of conviction. The trial court denied Yee\u2019s motion. On April 8, 2011, Yee filed a motion to vacate his conviction or withdraw his guilty plea. Again, the trial court denied Yee\u2019s motion.\nOn February 29, 2012, Yee filed a motion for de novo resentencing pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in State v. Johnson, 128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061. The trial court, construing the motion as a petition for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21, denied the motion as untimely. The trial court also found that Yee\u2019s claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Yee, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-12-017, 2013-Ohio-5184, at \u00b6 2-8.\n\n\u00b6 3 Appellant subsequently appealed the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition for postconviction relief. We rejected appellant\u2019s arguments, and found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the postconviction petition. Id. at \u00b6 15.\n\n\u00b6 4 Thereafter, on October 11, 2016, appellant filed a \u201cmotion for leave to withdraw his \u2018void\u2019 guilty plea based on actual innocence, prosecutorial misconduct and newly discovered evidence\u201d pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1. In his motion, appellant asserted that his conviction was void because he was lured into pleading guilty despite his innocence based upon the state\u2019s pledge to seek the death penalty \u201cwith a 100% chance of acquiring it\u201d based on \u201cbogus\u201d DNA evidence. In support of his argument, appellant stated that he had recently received documents the FBI sent to the Innocence Project on August 1, 2013, allegedly revealing that the federal government utilized misleading evidence to secure his convictions in federal court. Appellant insisted that, had he been aware of the use of such evidence, he would not have entered a guilty plea. Appellant\nfurther indicated that the state threatened to use the same \u201cbogus\u201d evidence as the federal authorities used to secure the convictions.\n\n{\u00b6 5} In response to appellant\u2019s motion, the state noted that the evidence referred to by the FBI in its letter to the Innocence Project pertained to hair analysis that was performed by the government\u2019s experts. The conclusions drawn from the hair analysis were later found to have exceeded the limits of science. However, the state argued that this evidence was inconsequential in light of the overwhelming incriminatory evidence that remained to establish appellant\u2019s guilt.\n\n{\u00b6 6} The state pointed out that the FBI\u2019s letter included a disclaimer that the Bureau took \u201cno position regarding the materiality of the error in this case.\u201d Moreover, the state cited the additional incriminating evidence to support its opposition to appellant\u2019s motion. This evidence placed appellant in the vicinity of the murder on the day in question, and included, inter alia, shell casings that were discovered in appellant\u2019s vehicle matching those found in the victim\u2019s vehicle as well as a coconspirator\u2019s blood found in both the victim\u2019s vehicle and appellant\u2019s vehicle.\n\n{\u00b6 7} The state also emphasized the fact that appellant\u2019s guilty plea, which followed the state\u2019s disclosure of all incriminating evidence including the hair analysis, constituted an absolute admission of guilt belying his claim of actual innocence.\n\n{\u00b6 8} Upon consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, the trial court issued its decision summarily denying appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea on March 30, 2017. Appellant\u2019s timely notice of appeal followed.\nB. Assignments of Error\n\n\u00b6 9 On appeal, appellant assigns the following errors for our review:\n\nAssignment of Error One: The trial court retains jurisdiction over deciding a post sentencing motion to withdraw guilty plea, Crim.R. 32.1, and committed plain error, Crim.R. 52(B), and/or abused its discretion by the denial of the appellant\u2019s motion.\n\nAssignment of Error Two: The trial court committed plain error, Crim.R. 52(B), and/or abused its discretion by the denial of Mr. Yee\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea that was improperly motivated and/or coerced by the government that was utilizing bogus evidence to create a windfall conviction, rendering the guilty plea void and open to collateral attack at any time.\n\nII. Analysis\n\n\u00b6 10 In his assignments of error, appellant argues that the trial court committed plain error in denying his Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\n\u00b6 11 Under Crim.R. 32.1, \u201c[a] motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\u201d A motion to withdraw a guilty plea made subsequent to sentencing will be granted only in \u201cextraordinary cases\u201d upon the demonstration of manifest injustice. State v. Smith, 49 Ohio St.2d 261, 264, 361 N.E.2d 1324 (1977).\nA motion made pursuant to Crim. R. 32.1 is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. *Id.* at paragraph two of the syllabus. Thus, we review the trial court\u2019s decision denying appellant\u2019s motion under an abuse of discretion standard. *State v. Francis*, 104 Ohio St.3d 490, 2004-Ohio-6894, 820 N.E.2d 355, \u00b6 32. Abuse of discretion suggests that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. *Blakemore v. Blakemore*, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983).\n\nIn his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court retained jurisdiction to consider his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In his second assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\nIn making his arguments, appellant relies upon the FBI\u2019s letter to the Innocence Project as evidence that he was actually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted. However, the statements made in the letter, as represented to this court by appellant, only call into question the veracity of a small fraction of the state\u2019s evidence \u2013 namely the scientific reliability of the hair analysis that was performed in this case. As noted by the state, the incriminating evidence implicating appellant in this case was not limited to the hair evidence. Moreover, it is axiomatic that a guilty plea operates as a complete admission of guilt. *State v. Stumpf*, 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 104, 512 N.E.2d 598 (1987). Appellant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s plea colloquy or assert that his plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.\n\u00b6 15 In sum, we find that the newly discovered unreliability of the hair analysis evidence in this case, standing alone, does not justify a finding a manifest injustice necessary to warrant the granting of appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea under Crim.R. 32.1. Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignments of error are not well-taken.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n\u00b6 16 In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to App.R. 27.

Lewis Vance, defe ndant below and appellant  herein, assigns the following errors for \nreview: \n \nFIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR: \n \n\u201cTHE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT \nREFUSED TO HOLD A HEARING OR REVIEW APPELLANT \nVANCE\u2019S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL.  FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH \n                                                 \n1Different counsel represented appellant during the trial court proceedings. JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n2\nAMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED  STATES CONSTITUTION; \nARTICLE I, SECTION 10 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION; CRIM.R. \n33.\u201d   \n \nSECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR: \n \n\u201cTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY FAILING TO PROPERLY NOTIFY \nAPPELLANT VANCE THAT HE WAS SUBJECT TO A \nDISCRETIONARY TERM OF UP TO THREE YEARS OF \nPOST-RELEASE CONTROL AT THE SENTENCING HEARING.  \nADDITIONALLY, ANY NOTIFICATION REGARDING \nPOST-RELEASE CONTROL WAS OMITTED FROM THE \nSENTENCING ENTRY.  THESE FAILURES VIOLATED VANCE\u2019S \nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AS GUARANTEED BY THE FIFTH \nAND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES \nCONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE I, SECTION 10 OF THE OHIO \nCONSTITUTION.\u201d \n \nTHIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR: \n \n\u201cTHE SENTENCE IMPOSED BY THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD BE \nREVERSED AND REMANDED AS IT DOES NOT COMPORT WITH \nTHE PURPOSES OF FELONY SENTENCING.  FIFTH AND \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES \nCONSTITUTION; ARTICLE I, SECTION 10 OF THE OHIO \nCONSTITUTION; R.C. 2929.11.\u201d \n \nFOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR: \n \n\u201cTHE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO SPECIFY ITS CONSECUTIVE \nSENTENCING FINDINGS IN ITS JUDGMENT ENTRY.  R.C. \n2929.14(C)(4).\u201d \n \n{\u00b6 2} On June 23, 2014, a Jackson County Grand Jury returned an indictment that charged \nappellant with crimes alleged to have been committed against Patrick Morgan, including aggravated \nmurder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(D), murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A), murder in violation \nof R.C. 2903.02(B), felonious assau lt in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1 ), and felonious assault in \nviolation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2).  The indictment  also included crimes a lleged to have been JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n3\ncommitted against Rachel Canode and her daughter M.C., including ki dnapping in violation of R.C. \n2905.01(A)(4), abduction in violation of R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), attempted rape in violation of R.C. \n2923.02(A)/2907.02(A)(2), tampering with evidence in  violation of R.C.  29021.12(A), abduction in \nviolation of R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), and kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(B)(2).  The trial court \nappointed counsel and appellant entered not guilty pleas to all charges. \n{\u00b6 3} Counsel filed various motions and, inter a lia, requested a competency evaluation.  \nThe trial court granted the request.  At the N ovember 21, 2014 competency hearing, both parties \nstipulated to the forensic report and the court later determined appellant to be competent to stand \ntrial.   \n{\u00b6 4} On March 30, 2015, appellant's tr ial counsel requested leav e to change appellant's \nplea to not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) and an evaluation, along with a third competency \nevaluation.  The trial court grante d appellant\u2019s request for leave to  change his plea and ordered an \nevaluation at Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare.  However, on June 16, 2015, the court ordered the \nevaluation to occur at Twin Valley Behavioral Healthcare.  The court also denied the request for the \nthird competency evaluation.  \n{\u00b6 5} On February 19, 2016, appellant sent a pro se letter to the tr ial court judge and \nindicated that he wished to have  different counsel.  At this junc ture, counsel also requested yet \nanother competency evaluation, but the trial court indicated that both prior evaluations determined \nappellant's competency, as set forth in R.C. 2945.37( G), and that appellant ra ised no additional facts \nor argument as to why a third competency evaluation was necessary.  Thus, the court denied the \nmotion.  \n{\u00b6 6} On July 14, 2016, the trial court issued a pr etrial order and i ndicated that it had JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n4\nreceived additional unsolicited co rrespondence from appellant, including: (1) a June 27, 2016 letter, \n(2) a June 27, 2016 voluntary statement, (3) a June  24, 2016 voluntary statement, and (4) a June 19, \n2016 motion for dismissal and a list of  witnesses.  Because appellant  had counsel, the court did not \nfile any of the documents, but instructed counsel  to file, within 14 days, any necessary motion \nregarding the issues that appellant raised in the documents.  In a separate order, the court indicated \nthat it had received defendant\u2019s pro se motion for acquittal, but again stated that it would not \nconsider appellant\u2019s pro se motion because counsel represented appellant.   \n{\u00b6 7} The trial court held a four  day trial beginning Octobe r 20, 2016.  The first witness, \nWilliam Ghearing, stated that he was driving toward Wellston, Ohio at 7:00 or 8:00 p.m. on \nNovember 29, 2013 when appellant's pick-up tr uck struck him head-on.  When Ghearing \napproached appellant, appellant told him \u201cYou never seen me. Y ou never seen me at all, and don\u2019t \nknow who I am.\u201d  Shortly thereaf ter, appellant disappeared.   \n{\u00b6 8} Chillicothe Police Officer Morgan Music testif ied that at the time of the accident, he \nworked for the Coalton Police Department.  After Officer Music arrived at the crash site, he noticed \na body in the truck bed.  Once he secured the scene, Officer Music also learned that a man had been \nobserved walking about a quarter mile away.  O fficer Music assisted in detaining that man \n(appellant), who displayed blood on his face, pants and jacket.  Jackson County Sheriff's Deputy \nUrias Hall later visite d the hospital to see appella nt and testified that he  smelled of alcohol, but \nappeared to be oriented.     \n{\u00b6 9} Officers eventually learned that appellant's truck actually belonged to Patrick Morgan. \n Also, Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) Special Agent Bryan White testified about \nprocessing the vehicle crash site , and stated that the victim\u2019s (M organ's) pants and underwear were JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n5\nfound around his knees, and that the victim had only one shoe.  \n{\u00b6 10} Nineteen-year-old Dustin Jones testified that on the night in question, appellant came \nto his parents\u2019 neighboring home and asked him to help load a deer in to a truck.  Jones assisted, but \nobserved that the object was not a deer but rather a human body that he recognized as the person who \nhad been staying with appellant.  Appellant then threatened Jones and his family with harm if he did \nnot help.  Jones helped appellant, then returned to his parents\u2019  home.  The following morning, he \ntold his father about the incident. \n{\u00b6 11} Rachel Canode testified that, as a friend of  appellant's sister, she knew appellant.  \nCanode explained that she was at her mothe r\u2019s house on November 29, 2013 when appellant came \nby to look for her mother to sell some rings.  Canode  told appellant that her mother was at a friend\u2019s \nhouse, and that she and her twelve-year-old daughter (M.C.) were also getting ready to walk to that \nhouse.  Canode stated that while appellant walked with them, he  kept putting his arms around her \nand grabbing her breasts and legs .  Canode testified that the sec ond or third time a ppellant put his \narms around her, a knife fell from a ppellant\u2019s coat.  When they arri ved at appellant\u2019s sister\u2019s house \n(the house where appellant was living), he started to walk up the sidewalk to the home while Canode \nattempted to escape his grasp.  Ultimately, Canode\u2019s daughter (M.C.) grabbed appellant\u2019s arm and \nappellant put the knife to her thro at.  Canode stated that she and her daughter then fled to her \nmother\u2019s house.   \n{\u00b6 12} Wellston Police Department Officer Steve Wilbur testified that he was at the fire \nstation when he heard the radio call about the cras h and the body in the truck bed.  Officer Wilbur \nalso explained that he later received a call from R achel Canode who stated th at appellant attempted \nto force her and her daughter into a house.  Officer  Wilbur testified that he met with Canode, then JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n6\nwalked to the home where appellant had been liv ing.  When no one answered the door, Officer \nWilbur looked in the windows.  Blood could be s een on the porch and inside the house on a couch \nand a knife.  Officer Wilbur also found a single shoe in the driveway.   \n{\u00b6 13} BCI Agent Todd Fortner testified that he processed the crime scene at the home and \nfound no signs of struggle.  Fortner observed two c ouches, one with and one  without bloodstains, a \nwooden chair, a lamp, a table and a small radio.  None of the furniture had been overturned or \nbroken.  Because one couch and the door area contained all of the bloodstains, Fortner testified that, \nbased on his experience, he believed that at the time of the attack the victim was either lying or \nsitting on the couch. \n{\u00b6 14} BCI Forensic Scientist (DNA Section) Andrea Weisenburge r testified that (1) the \nknife blade recovered from appellant\u2019s home contained Patrick Morgan\u2019s blood, (2) the knife handle \nhad mostly Morgan\u2019s blood, but also some of appellant\u2019s blood, (3) Morgan\u2019s blood appeared on \nappellant's jeans, and (4) the truck's air bag had mostly Morgan\u2019s blood, but also some of appellant\u2019s \nblood.   \n{\u00b6 15} Franklin County forensic pathologist John Da niels testified that he performed Patrick \nMorgan's autopsy.  The autopsy revealed multiple  stab wounds to Morgan's face, eye and neck, \nincluding a wound through his eye and one inch in to his brain.  In total, Morgan had 24 wounds, \nincluding defensive wrist wounds.  Daniels testif ied that the manner of death was homicide.   \n{\u00b6 16} Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections Parole Officer Brett McRoberts \ntestified that on November 29, 2013, appellant was under his s upervision while on community \ncontrol after his judicial releas e.  McRoberts noted that appella nt had been living at a homeless \nshelter in Athens, but McRoberts did not know that appellant had moved to Wellston.   JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n7\n{\u00b6 17} At the close of the state\u2019 s evidence, appellant's couns el requested a Crim.R. 29 \nmotion for dismissal of Count 8 of the indictment (rape).  The trial cour t denied the motion.   \n{\u00b6 18} Michelle Vance, appellant\u2019s sister, tes tified that her brothe r and his roommate, \nMorgan, were living at her home.  She explained that she offered the two a place to stay after they \nhad been removed from Timothy House, an Athens shelter.   \n{\u00b6 19} Phillip Lemaster testified that Jay Poe to ld him that Brian Canode, Rachel Canode\u2019s \nbrother, wanted to talk with him.   Lemaster stated that Brian Ca node asked him to assault appellant \nin exchange for heroin, and that he agreed to do so.  Brian Canode and Le master parked at Brian \nCanode\u2019s mother\u2019s house, then Lemaster, Canode and Jay Poe, who had been waiting at the Canode \nhome, walked to appellant\u2019s house.  Lemaster stat ed that appellant's truc k was not at the house and \nwhen no one answered their knock, Brian Canode took Lemaster home.   \n{\u00b6 20} Brian Canode, however, denied any agreement with Lemaster to attack appellant.  \nCanode also testified that he, Rach el Canode\u2019s brother, went to a ppellant\u2019s home that evening, but \nbecause he did not see the truck that his sister described, he left the residence.   Against the advice \nof counsel, appellant chose to exer cise his right to testify.  On the night in question, appellant and \nMorgan were abusing drugs and alcohol.  Appellant claimed that  Rachel Canode\u2019s brother and \nserveral other men came to the house with bats  and a knife and attacked him and Morgan.  \nAppellant testified that the men beat him with a bat and raped him with a stick, but appellant \nmanaged to drag Morgan from the house and screamed for help.  Appellant left the home to get \nhelp, but because he was unsuccessful  in that endeavor, he returned  to the house to save Morgan.  \nAfter the men overwhelmed appellant, the men forced  appellant into the truck and threw Morgan \ninto the truck bed.  Appellant testified that he did not kill Morgan, that he did not grab Rachel JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n8\nCanode and that he did not atte mpt to restrain Canode or her daughter.  Appellant, however, \nadmitted that officers found his knife at the scene and that his knife contained Morgan\u2019s blood. \n{\u00b6 21} After the four-day trial, the jury found appellant guilty of: Count 1 aggravated murder \nR.C. 2903.01(D), Count 2 murder R.C. 2903.02(A), Count 3 murder R.C. 2903.02(B)), Count 4 \nfelonious assault R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), Count 5 fe lonious assault R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), and Count 9 \ntampering with evidence R.C. 2921.12(A).  The jury  also found appellant not guilty of: Count 6 \nkidnapping R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), Count 7 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), Count  8 attempted rape \nR.C. 2923.02(A)/2907.02(A)(2), Count 10 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), and Count 11 kidnapping \nR.C. 2905.01(B)(2). \n{\u00b6 22} The trial court sentenced appellant to serve life in prison without parole on count one \n(aggravated murder) and thirty-six months on count 9 (tampering with evidence), with the sentences \nto be served consecutively to one another.  At that point, appellant file d a pro se (1) Crim.R. 33 \nmotion for new trial and argued that irregularities existed in the court proceedings, including jury and \nprosecutorial misconduct, and that new evidence suppor ted his self-defense claim, and (2) a Crim.R. \n29 motion for judgment of acquittal.  This appeal followed. 2 \nI. \n                                                 \n2The Appellate Rules require us to determine the appeal on the assignments of error set forth in the briefs.  \nApp.R. 16 provides for a brief for the appellant, a brief for the appellee, and a reply brief, stating that \u201c[n]o further \nbriefs may be filed except with leave of court.\u201d  As provided by App.R. 16, appellant\u2019s counsel filed an appellate \nbrief and raised four assignments of error.  The appellee also filed a brief and appellate counsel filed a reply brief.  \nIt also appears that appellant filed a pro se brief and raised  four additional assignments of error.  Neither the United \nStates nor Ohio Constitution mandates a hybrid representation to allow a pro se appellant with appointed counsel to \nfile briefs in addition to those that his attorney filed.  State v. Thompson , 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 6-7, 514 N.E.2d 407 \n(1987); State v. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, paragraph one of the syllabus; State \nv. White, 71 Ohio App.3d 550, fn. 1, 594 N.E.2d 1087 (4th Dist.1991).  Nevertheless, we may choose later in this \nopinion to briefly address appellant's arguments in his pro se brief.  \n JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n9\n{\u00b6 23} In his first assignment of erro r, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by refusing \nto hold a hearing or to conduct a review of appellant\u2019s motion for new trial.   \n{\u00b6 24} Generally, the decision to grant a new trial is within a trial c ourt\u2019s discretion, and a \nruling on a motion for a new trial will not be disturbe d on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.  \nState v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 564 N.E.2d 54 (1990); State v. Williams, 43 Ohio St.2d 88, 330 \nN.E.2d 891 (1975).  An abuse of di scretion \u201cimplies that the cour t\u2019s attitude [was] unreasonable, \narbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d  State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 404 N.E.2d 144 (1980).  \u201cA \ndecision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoni ng process that would support that decision.\u201d  \nAAAA Enterprises, Inc. v. River  Place Community Redevelopment , 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 \nN.E.2d 597 (1990).   \n{\u00b6 25} Appellant filed a pro se motion for new trial, but the trial court refused to rule on \nappellant\u2019s pro se motion.  Appellant contends that no sound r easoning process supported the court's \ndecision, and, thus, the trial court's refusal to consider the motion c onstitutes an abuse of discretion.  \nThe state points out that the trial court refused to  rule on the pro se motion because appellant had \nlegal representation and that neither the United States Constitution nor the Ohio Constitution or case \nauthority permits hybrid representation.   \n{\u00b6 26} \u201cAlthough appellant has the right either to appear pro se or to have counsel, he has no \ncorresponding right to act as co -counsel on his own behalf.\u201d  State v. Thompson , 33 Ohio St.3d 1, \n6-7, 514 N.E.2d 407 (1987).  The Supreme Court of Ohio has reaffirmed that principle and held that \n\u201cin Ohio, a criminal defendant has the right to representation by counsel or to proceed pro se with the \nassistance of standby counsel.  However, these two rights are independent of each other and may not \nbe asserted s imultaneously.\u201d  State v. Martin , 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n10\n227, paragraph one of the syllabus.   \n{\u00b6 27} In the case sub judice, appellant attempted to make multiple pro se filings while he \nhad legal representation.  The tria l court aptly noted that appella nt had legal representation and \nadvised counsel to review the pro se filings and file any necessary motion within 14 days with regard \nto any relevant issues raised in the pro se documents.  Once again, Ohio courts need not address pro \nse motions when the defendant enjoys the benefit of counsel.  See State v. Smith, 4th Dist. Highland \nNo. 09CA29, 2010-Ohio-4507, \u00b6 100 [\u201cThe trial court indicated that it would refuse to consider \nmotions filed by Smith because the court was appointing counsel to represent him.  We are satisfied \nthat the trial court did not err as, although a defendant \u2018has the right either to appear pro se or to have \ncounsel, he has no corresponding right to act as co-counsel on his own behalf.\u2019\u201d]; State v. Smith, 1st \nDist. Hamilton Nos. C-160836 and C-160837, 2017-Ohio-8558; State v. Greenleaf, 11th Dist. \nPortage No. 2005-P-0017, 2006-Ohio-4317.  \u201cWhen a crimin al defendant is represented by counsel \nand counsel does not join the defe ndant\u2019s pro se motion or otherwis e indicate a need for the relief \nsought by the defendant pro se, the trial court cannot properly c onsider the defendant\u2019s pro se \nmotion.\u201d  Smith at \u00b6 32, citing State v. Davis, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 05AP-193, 2006-Ohio-5039, \u00b6 \n12; State v. Pizzaro, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94849, 2011-Ohio-611, \u00b6 7 [\u201cOne who is represented by \ncounsel and who does not move the court to proceed pro se, may not  \u2018act as co-counsel on his own \nbehalf.\u2019\u201d, quoting Greenleaf at \u00b6 70]. \n{\u00b6 28} Appellant, however, argues that State v. Keene , 4th Dist. Washington No. 16CA10, \n2017-Ohio-7058, mandates a di fferent result.  In Keene, the defendant, prior to the scheduled \nsentencing hearing, sent two lette rs to the trial court, without c ounsel's assistance, and sought to \nwithdraw his guilty pleas.   Although the trial cour t held a hearing and rule d on the defendant\u2019s pro JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n11\nse motion in spite of counsel's representation, the court was not re quired to do so.  Once again, the \nSupreme Court of Ohio has established that a defe ndant has either the righ t to representation by \ncounsel or the right to proceed pro se, but  has no right to hybrid representation.  Martin, paragraph \none of the syllabus. \n{\u00b6 29} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing r easons we overrule appellant\u2019s first \nassignment of error. \nII. \n{\u00b6 30} In his second assignment of e rror, appellant asserts that the trial court: (1) failed to \nproperly notify him at the sentencing hearing that he is subject to a discretiona ry term of up to three \nyears of post-release control, and (2) omitted from the sentencing entry the notification regarding \npost-release control.  Appellant asserts that these failures violate his constitutional rights as \nguaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, \nSection 10 of the Ohio Constitution.  \n{\u00b6 31} In the case sub judice, appellant was convict ed of aggravated murder and tampering \nwith evidence.  The tampering with evidence char ge carries an additional three-year term of \npost-release control.  At sentencing, the trial court stated: \u201cIf you are placed on Post-Release Control \nunder the Authority of the Adult Parole, you could be returned to Prison for up to nine months for \neach violation of rule if your stated Prison term equals or exceeds eighteen months.  Otherwise, the \nlongest single Prison sanction, you (unintelligible) half of your stated Prison term.  You can be \nreturned to Prison for up to fifty percent of your Prison Sentence for all violations committed.  If \nconvicted of a new Felony while on Post-Release Control, in additi on to being punished for the new \noffense, the Court can add an additional consecutive Prison term of one year, however, whatever part JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n12\nremains of the Post-Release Control term; whichever is greater.\u201d   \n{\u00b6 32} The state concedes that the post-release control language did not state that the term \nwould be three years.  The Supreme Court of Oh io has held that the failure to properly impose \npost-release control renders the post-release control por tion of the sentence void.  State v. Fischer , \n128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, 942 N.E.2d 332, \u00b6 26.  The remedy for this error is a new \nsentencing hearing, limited to the proper imposition of the post release control sanction.  Id. at \u00b6 29. \n As we previously mentioned, the state concedes th is issue and we hereby sustain appellant's second \nassignment of error. \n{\u00b6 33} Accordingly, we find merit to appellant's argument and we remand this matter to the \ntrial court for proceedings consistent with R.C. 2929.191 to properly impose the term of post-release \ncontrol.  \nIII.  \n{\u00b6 34} In his third assignment of error, appellant, citing the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution, Artic le I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution and \nR.C. 2929.11,   asserts that the tria l court\u2019s sentence does not compor t with the purposes of felony \nsentencing.  In particular, appellant argues that the trial court's refusal to consider appellant\u2019s mental \nhealth issues and impose a term of life without parole, which will not provi de appellant with an \nopportunity for parole or future me ntal health services, fails to comply with the requirements and \npurpose of R.C. 2929.11.   \n{\u00b6 35} Appellant cites State v. Marcum , 146 Ohio St.3d 516, 2016-Ohio-1002, 59 N.E.3d \n1231, for the proposition that an appellate court may vacate or modify any sentence that is not clearly \nand convincingly contrary to law only if the appellate court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n13\nthat the record does not support the sentence.  Couns el argues that appellant  self-medicated with \nalcohol and drugs and had no access to  professional mental health services.  Th e state counters that \nMarcum dealt with sentencing for a classified felony, not for aggravated murder.  Id. at \u00b6 22-23.  \nThe state points out that Marcum relied on R.C. 2953.08 for the statutory authority to review a felony \nsentence, however, R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) makes clear, \u201c[a] sentence imposed for aggravated murder or \nmurder pursuant to sections 2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code is not subject to review under \nthis section.\u201d  (Emphasis added.)   \n{\u00b6 36} The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that \u201cR.C. 2953.08(D) is unambiguous.  \u2018A \nsentence imposed for aggravated  murder or murder pursuant to section 2929.02 to 2929.06 of the \nRevised Code is not subject to review under this s ection\u2019 clearly means what it says: such a sentence \ncannot be reviewed.\u201d  State v. Porterfield , 106 Ohio St.3d 5, 2005-Ohio-3095, 829 N.E.2d 690, \u00b6 \n17.  Moreover, this court has held \u201c[i]t is evident that the General Assembly intended to treat \nsentencing on aggravated murder and murder convictions differently  from other felony sentences.\u201d  \nState v. Hawkins, 4th Dist. No. 13CA3, 2014-Ohio-1224, \u00b6 15., citing State v. Porterfield at \u00b6 17-18. \n We wrote: \u201cwe find pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(D)(3), we lack statutory authority to review Hawkins\u2019 \nsentence on an evidentiary basis.\u201d  Id.    \n{\u00b6 37} Appellant also contends that the trial court\u2019s sentence did not comport with due \nprocess and is excessive.  However,  our review of the record rev eals that, although the trial court \nexpressed concern and acknowledged  appellant\u2019s mental health i ssues, and allowed competency \nevaluations and forensic revi ews and pondered how be tter treatment earlier in life might have \naffected appellant, the court c oncluded that the aggravating factors neverthe less outweighed \nappellant\u2019s mental health concerns: \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve talked about the failures of the mental health JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n14\nsystem.  We\u2019ve talked about the dramatic cuts to that system.  Maybe if we had a system that was \nproperly funded, Mr. Vance may have received appropriate treatment.  But, those are all \u2018what ifs.\u2019  \nI don\u2019t know.  The reality that I have to deal with is that Mr. Vance is a dangerous individual.  He \nhas committed a savage crime.\u201d  The court further noted the injury to the victim, his family, and \nappellant\u2019s criminal history, including a prior violent offense.   \n{\u00b6 38} Consequently, after our review , we conclude that (1) appe llant\u2019s aggravated murder \nsentence is not subject to appellate review, and (2) appellant's sentence for tampering with evidence \ncomported with due process and is not excessive.  Accordingly,  we overrule a ppellant\u2019s third \nassignment of error. \nIV. \n{\u00b6 39} In his final assignment of e rror, appellant asserts that at the sentencing hearing the \ntrial court sentenced him to serve (1) life in pr ison without parole for the aggravated murder \nconviction, and (2) thirty-six months on the tamp ering with evidence charge.  Appellant argues, \nhowever, that the court failed to specify its consecutive sentencing findings in its entry as R.C. \n2929.14(C)(4) requires.  The court stated: \u201c[t]hat will be consecutive punishment as necessary to \nprotect the public.  The punishment is not dispropor tionate to the crime, a nd your criminal history \ndemonstrates that consecutive se ntences are necessary.\u201d  The c ourt's December 6, 2016 sentencing \nentry recited the statutory langua ge of R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) - including the subsections (a), (b), and \n(c).  However, the entry provides lines next to th e restatements of these subsections, presumably, as \nthe state contends, as a check-off.  Based on the tr ial court\u2019s remarks at sentencing, subsection (c) - \n\u201cthe offender\u2019s history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecu tive sentences are necessary to \nprotect the public from future crime by the offende r\u201d should have been initia led or checked, but it JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n15\ndoes not appear that the court did so.   \n{\u00b6 40} The state maintains that this error may be  corrected with a nunc pro tunc entry.  \nHowever, in view of our resoluti on of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error,  the trial court may \naddress this issue when, on remand, it addresses the imposition of post -release control as referenced \nin appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.   \n{\u00b6 41} Accordingly, we sustain appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error and remand the matter \nto the trial court to include the findings to support consecutive sentencing. \nV.  \n{\u00b6 42} In conclusion, we (1) overrule appellant\u2019s first and third assignments of error, (2) find \nappellant\u2019s second and fourth assignments of error to be well-taken, and (3) remand this cause to the \ntrial court to address the post-release control term for tampering with evidence the and the findings \nfor consecutive sentences.3 \nJUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN \nPART, AND CAUSE REMANDED FOR FURTHER \n                                                 \n3Appellant's pro se brief contends that the trial cour t abused appellant\u2019s First Amendment rights when it \nreferred to appellant as Muslim.  However, our review finds no such reference.  Appellant also asserts that he \nconsistently stated that he had been attacked on November 29, 2013.  Thus, he appears to attack the weight and \nsufficiency of the evidence.  However, the state presented ample competent, credible evidence so that any rational \ntrier of fact could have found the essential elements of  aggravated murder and tampering with evidence proven \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.  The jury heard appellant\u2019s version of the events and did not find his testimony credible. \n Appellant also asserts that the trial court erred by failing to replace the jury after (1) one juror revealed she \nparticipated in an event in support of the county prosecutor, and (2) another juror shared outside information to the \njury.  However, the trial court properly questioned the first juror and concluded that she could be impartial.  Later, \nduring deliberations, the second juror revealed to several jurors that she disputed the victim's daughter's (M.C.) age.  \nAfter the trial court conducted a hearing and questioned the jurors, the court dismissed the second juror, brought in \nan alternate, and retained the other jurors who stated that the comments did not influence their deliberations.  \nAppellant also asserts that his trial counsel failed to (1) use certain evidence, (2) investigate and subpoena witnesses, \n(3) remove jury members, (4) defend appellant, and (5) that he should have been granted new counsel.  However, \nappellant's claims are undermined by the fact that the jury found appellant not guilty of five of the eleven charges.  \nAdditionally, after the trial court discussed appellant\u2019s representation, the court asked appellant if he was satisfied \nwith defense counsel, and appellant agreed.  Here, counsel\u2019s  representation did not fall below an objective standard \nof reasonableness.   JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n16\nPROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS \nOPINION. JACKSON, 16CA11 \n \n17\n \nJUDGMENT ENTRY \nIt is ordered that the judgment be affirmed in part, reversed in part, and cause remanded for \nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Appellant and Appellee shall split the costs.  \n \nThe Court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal. \n \nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this Court directing the Jackson County \nCommon Pleas Court to carry this judgment into execution. \n \nIf a stay of execution of sentence and release upon bail has been previously granted, it is \ncontinued for a period of sixty days upon the bail previously posted.  The purpose of said stay is to \nallow appellant to file with the Supreme Court of Ohio an application for a stay during the pendency \nof the proceedings in that court.  The stay as he rein continued will terminate at the expiration of the \nsixty-day period. \n \nThe stay will also terminate if appellant fails to file a notice of appeal with the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio in the forty-five day period pursuant to Rule II, Sec. 2 of the Rules of Practice of the \nSupreme Court of Ohio.  Additionally, if the Suprem e Court of Ohio dismisses the appeal prior to \nthe expiration of said sixty days, the stay will terminate as of the date of such dismissal. \n \nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute that mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of \nAppellate Procedure. \n \nHarsha, J. & McFarland, J.: Concur in Judgment & Opinion \n \n  For the Court \n \n \n \n \n \nB Y :                                              \n                           P e t e r  B .

R.C. 2929.14(C)(4).\u201d\n\n\u00b6 2 On June 23, 2014, a Jackson County Grand Jury returned an indictment that charged appellant with crimes alleged to have been committed against Patrick Morgan, including aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(D), murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A), murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B), felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), and felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2). The indictment also included crimes alleged to have been\ncommitted against Rachel Canode and her daughter M.C., including kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), abduction in violation of R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), attempted rape in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A)/2907.02(A)(2), tampering with evidence in violation of R.C. 29021.12(A), abduction in violation of R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), and kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(B)(2). The trial court appointed counsel and appellant entered not guilty pleas to all charges.\n\n\u00b6 3 Counsel filed various motions and, inter alia, requested a competency evaluation. The trial court granted the request. At the November 21, 2014 competency hearing, both parties stipulated to the forensic report and the court later determined appellant to be competent to stand trial.\n\n\u00b6 4 On March 30, 2015, appellant's trial counsel requested leave to change appellant's plea to not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) and an evaluation, along with a third competency evaluation. The trial court granted appellant\u2019s request for leave to change his plea and ordered an evaluation at Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare. However, on June 16, 2015, the court ordered the evaluation to occur at Twin Valley Behavioral Healthcare. The court also denied the request for the third competency evaluation.\n\n\u00b6 5 On February 19, 2016, appellant sent a pro se letter to the trial court judge and indicated that he wished to have different counsel. At this juncture, counsel also requested yet another competency evaluation, but the trial court indicated that both prior evaluations determined appellant's competency, as set forth in R.C. 2945.37(G), and that appellant raised no additional facts or argument as to why a third competency evaluation was necessary. Thus, the court denied the motion.\n\n\u00b6 6 On July 14, 2016, the trial court issued a pretrial order and indicated that it had\nreceived additional unsolicited correspondence from appellant, including: (1) a June 27, 2016 letter, (2) a June 27, 2016 voluntary statement, (3) a June 24, 2016 voluntary statement, and (4) a June 19, 2016 motion for dismissal and a list of witnesses. Because appellant had counsel, the court did not file any of the documents, but instructed counsel to file, within 14 days, any necessary motion regarding the issues that appellant raised in the documents. In a separate order, the court indicated that it had received defendant\u2019s pro se motion for acquittal, but again stated that it would not consider appellant\u2019s pro se motion because counsel represented appellant.\n\n\u00b6 7 The trial court held a four day trial beginning October 20, 2016. The first witness, William Ghearing, stated that he was driving toward Wellston, Ohio at 7:00 or 8:00 p.m. on November 29, 2013 when appellant's pick-up truck struck him head-on. When Ghearing approached appellant, appellant told him \u201cYou never seen me. You never seen me at all, and don\u2019t know who I am.\u201d Shortly thereafter, appellant disappeared.\n\n\u00b6 8 Chillicothe Police Officer Morgan Music testified that at the time of the accident, he worked for the Coalton Police Department. After Officer Music arrived at the crash site, he noticed a body in the truck bed. Once he secured the scene, Officer Music also learned that a man had been observed walking about a quarter mile away. Officer Music assisted in detaining that man (appellant), who displayed blood on his face, pants and jacket. Jackson County Sheriff's Deputy Urias Hall later visited the hospital to see appellant and testified that he smelled of alcohol, but appeared to be oriented.\n\n\u00b6 9 Officers eventually learned that appellant's truck actually belonged to Patrick Morgan. Also, Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) Special Agent Bryan White testified about processing the vehicle crash site, and stated that the victim\u2019s (Morgan's) pants and underwear were\nfound around his knees, and that the victim had only one shoe.\n\n\u00b6 10 Nineteen-year-old Dustin Jones testified that on the night in question, appellant came to his parents\u2019 neighboring home and asked him to help load a deer into a truck. Jones assisted, but observed that the object was not a deer but rather a human body that he recognized as the person who had been staying with appellant. Appellant then threatened Jones and his family with harm if he did not help. Jones helped appellant, then returned to his parents\u2019 home. The following morning, he told his father about the incident.\n\n\u00b6 11 Rachel Canode testified that, as a friend of appellant\u2019s sister, she knew appellant. Canode explained that she was at her mother\u2019s house on November 29, 2013 when appellant came by to look for her mother to sell some rings. Canode told appellant that her mother was at a friend\u2019s house, and that she and her twelve-year-old daughter (M.C.) were also getting ready to walk to that house. Canode stated that while appellant walked with them, he kept putting his arms around her and grabbing her breasts and legs. Canode testified that the second or third time appellant put his arms around her, a knife fell from appellant\u2019s coat. When they arrived at appellant\u2019s sister\u2019s house (the house where appellant was living), he started to walk up the sidewalk to the home while Canode attempted to escape his grasp. Ultimately, Canode\u2019s daughter (M.C.) grabbed appellant\u2019s arm and appellant put the knife to her throat. Canode stated that she and her daughter then fled to her mother\u2019s house.\n\n\u00b6 12 Wellston Police Department Officer Steve Wilbur testified that he was at the fire station when he heard the radio call about the crash and the body in the truck bed. Officer Wilbur also explained that he later received a call from Rachel Canode who stated that appellant attempted to force her and her daughter into a house. Officer Wilbur testified that he met with Canode, then\nwalked to the home where appellant had been living. When no one answered the door, Officer Wilbur looked in the windows. Blood could be seen on the porch and inside the house on a couch and a knife. Officer Wilbur also found a single shoe in the driveway.\n\n\u00b6 13 BCI Agent Todd Fortner testified that he processed the crime scene at the home and found no signs of struggle. Fortner observed two couches, one with and one without bloodstains, a wooden chair, a lamp, a table and a small radio. None of the furniture had been overturned or broken. Because one couch and the door area contained all of the bloodstains, Fortner testified that, based on his experience, he believed that at the time of the attack the victim was either lying or sitting on the couch.\n\n\u00b6 14 BCI Forensic Scientist (DNA Section) Andrea Weisenburger testified that (1) the knife blade recovered from appellant\u2019s home contained Patrick Morgan\u2019s blood, (2) the knife handle had mostly Morgan\u2019s blood, but also some of appellant\u2019s blood, (3) Morgan\u2019s blood appeared on appellant's jeans, and (4) the truck's air bag had mostly Morgan\u2019s blood, but also some of appellant\u2019s blood.\n\n\u00b6 15 Franklin County forensic pathologist John Daniels testified that he performed Patrick Morgan's autopsy. The autopsy revealed multiple stab wounds to Morgan's face, eye and neck, including a wound through his eye and one inch into his brain. In total, Morgan had 24 wounds, including defensive wrist wounds. Daniels testified that the manner of death was homicide.\n\n\u00b6 16 Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections Parole Officer Brett McRoberts testified that on November 29, 2013, appellant was under his supervision while on community control after his judicial release. McRoberts noted that appellant had been living at a homeless shelter in Athens, but McRoberts did not know that appellant had moved to Wellston.\n\u00b6 17 At the close of the state\u2019s evidence, appellant's counsel requested a Crim.R. 29 motion for dismissal of Count 8 of the indictment (rape). The trial court denied the motion.\n\n\u00b6 18 Michelle Vance, appellant\u2019s sister, testified that her brother and his roommate, Morgan, were living at her home. She explained that she offered the two a place to stay after they had been removed from Timothy House, an Athens shelter.\n\n\u00b6 19 Phillip Lemaster testified that Jay Poe told him that Brian Canode, Rachel Canode\u2019s brother, wanted to talk with him. Lemaster stated that Brian Canode asked him to assault appellant in exchange for heroin, and that he agreed to do so. Brian Canode and Lemaster parked at Brian Canode\u2019s mother\u2019s house, then Lemaster, Canode and Jay Poe, who had been waiting at the Canode home, walked to appellant\u2019s house. Lemaster stated that appellant's truck was not at the house and when no one answered their knock, Brian Canode took Lemaster home.\n\n\u00b6 20 Brian Canode, however, denied any agreement with Lemaster to attack appellant. Canode also testified that he, Rachel Canode\u2019s brother, went to appellant\u2019s home that evening, but because he did not see the truck that his sister described, he left the residence. Against the advice of counsel, appellant chose to exercise his right to testify. On the night in question, appellant and Morgan were abusing drugs and alcohol. Appellant claimed that Rachel Canode\u2019s brother and several other men came to the house with bats and a knife and attacked him and Morgan. Appellant testified that the men beat him with a bat and raped him with a stick, but appellant managed to drag Morgan from the house and screamed for help. Appellant left the home to get help, but because he was unsuccessful in that endeavor, he returned to the house to save Morgan. After the men overwhelmed appellant, the men forced appellant into the truck and threw Morgan into the truck bed. Appellant testified that he did not kill Morgan, that he did not grab Rachel\nCanode and that he did not attempt to restrain Canode or her daughter. Appellant, however, admitted that officers found his knife at the scene and that his knife contained Morgan\u2019s blood.\n\n\u00b6 21 After the four-day trial, the jury found appellant guilty of: Count 1 aggravated murder R.C. 2903.01(D), Count 2 murder R.C. 2903.02(A), Count 3 murder R.C. 2903.02(B)), Count 4 felonious assault R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), Count 5 felonious assault R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), and Count 9 tampering with evidence R.C. 2921.12(A). The jury also found appellant not guilty of: Count 6 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), Count 7 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), Count 8 attempted rape R.C. 2923.02(A)/2907.02(A)(2), Count 10 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), and Count 11 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(B)(2).\n\n\u00b6 22 The trial court sentenced appellant to serve life in prison without parole on count one (aggravated murder) and thirty-six months on count 9 (tampering with evidence), with the sentences to be served consecutively to one another. At that point, appellant filed a pro se (1) Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial and argued that irregularities existed in the court proceedings, including jury and prosecutorial misconduct, and that new evidence supported his self-defense claim, and (2) a Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. This appeal followed.2\n\nI.\n\n2The Appellate Rules require us to determine the appeal on the assignments of error set forth in the briefs. App.R. 16 provides for a brief for the appellant, a brief for the appellee, and a reply brief, stating that \u201c[n]o further briefs may be filed except with leave of court.\u201d As provided by App.R. 16, appellant\u2019s counsel filed an appellate brief and raised four assignments of error. The appellee also filed a brief and appellate counsel filed a reply brief. It also appears that appellant filed a pro se brief and raised four additional assignments of error. Neither the United States nor Ohio Constitution mandates a hybrid representation to allow a pro se appellant with appointed counsel to file briefs in addition to those that his attorney filed. State v. Thompson, 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 6-7, 514 N.E.2d 407 (1987); State v. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, paragraph one of the syllabus; State v. White, 71 Ohio App.3d 550, fn. 1, 594 N.E.2d 1087 (4th Dist.1991). Nevertheless, we may choose later in this opinion to briefly address appellant\u2019s arguments in his pro se brief.\n\u00b6 23 In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by refusing to hold a hearing or to conduct a review of appellant\u2019s motion for new trial.\n\n\u00b6 24 Generally, the decision to grant a new trial is within a trial court\u2019s discretion, and a ruling on a motion for a new trial will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 564 N.E.2d 54 (1990); State v. Williams, 43 Ohio St.2d 88, 330 N.E.2d 891 (1975). An abuse of discretion \u201cimplies that the court\u2019s attitude [was] unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 404 N.E.2d 144 (1980). \u201cA decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process that would support that decision.\u201d AAAA Enterprises, Inc. v. River Place Community Redevelopment, 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597 (1990).\n\n\u00b6 25 Appellant filed a pro se motion for new trial, but the trial court refused to rule on appellant\u2019s pro se motion. Appellant contends that no sound reasoning process supported the court's decision, and, thus, the trial court's refusal to consider the motion constitutes an abuse of discretion. The state points out that the trial court refused to rule on the pro se motion because appellant had legal representation and that neither the United States Constitution nor the Ohio Constitution or case authority permits hybrid representation.\n\n\u00b6 26 \u201cAlthough appellant has the right either to appear pro se or to have counsel, he has no corresponding right to act as co-counsel on his own behalf.\u201d State v. Thompson, 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 6-7, 514 N.E.2d 407 (1987). The Supreme Court of Ohio has reaffirmed that principle and held that \u201cin Ohio, a criminal defendant has the right to representation by counsel or to proceed pro se with the assistance of standby counsel. However, these two rights are independent of each other and may not be asserted simultaneously.\u201d State v. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d\n227, paragraph one of the syllabus.\n\n{\u00b6 27} In the case sub judice, appellant attempted to make multiple pro se filings while he had legal representation. The trial court aptly noted that appellant had legal representation and advised counsel to review the pro se filings and file any necessary motion within 14 days with regard to any relevant issues raised in the pro se documents. Once again, Ohio courts need not address pro se motions when the defendant enjoys the benefit of counsel. See State v. Smith, 4th Dist. Highland No. 09CA29, 2010-Ohio-4507, \u00b6 100 [\u201cThe trial court indicated that it would refuse to consider motions filed by Smith because the court was appointing counsel to represent him. We are satisfied that the trial court did not err as, although a defendant \u2018has the right either to appear pro se or to have counsel, he has no corresponding right to act as co-counsel on his own behalf.\u2019\u201d]; State v. Smith, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-160836 and C-160837, 2017-Ohio-8558; State v. Greenleaf, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2005-P-0017, 2006-Ohio-4317. \u201cWhen a criminal defendant is represented by counsel and counsel does not join the defendant\u2019s pro se motion or otherwise indicate a need for the relief sought by the defendant pro se, the trial court cannot properly consider the defendant\u2019s pro se motion.\u201d Smith at \u00b6 32, citing State v. Davis, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 05AP-193, 2006-Ohio-5039, \u00b6 12; State v. Pizzaro, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94849, 2011-Ohio-611, \u00b6 7 [\u201cOne who is represented by counsel and who does not move the court to proceed pro se, may not \u2018act as co-counsel on his own behalf.\u2019\u201d, quoting Greenleaf at \u00b6 70].\n\n{\u00b6 28} Appellant, however, argues that State v. Keene, 4th Dist. Washington No. 16CA10, 2017-Ohio-7058, mandates a different result. In Keene, the defendant, prior to the scheduled sentencing hearing, sent two letters to the trial court, without counsel\u2019s assistance, and sought to withdraw his guilty pleas. Although the trial court held a hearing and ruled on the defendant\u2019s pro\nse motion in spite of counsel's representation, the court was not required to do so. Once again, the Supreme Court of Ohio has established that a defendant has either the right to representation by counsel or the right to proceed pro se, but has no right to hybrid representation. *Martin*, paragraph one of the syllabus.\n\n{\u00b6 29} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons we overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.\n\nII.\n\n{\u00b6 30} In his second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court: (1) failed to properly notify him at the sentencing hearing that he is subject to a discretionary term of up to three years of post-release control, and (2) omitted from the sentencing entry the notification regarding post-release control. Appellant asserts that these failures violate his constitutional rights as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n{\u00b6 31} In the case sub judice, appellant was convicted of aggravated murder and tampering with evidence. The tampering with evidence charge carries an additional three-year term of post-release control. At sentencing, the trial court stated: \u201cIf you are placed on Post-Release Control under the Authority of the Adult Parole, you could be returned to Prison for up to nine months for each violation of rule if your stated Prison term equals or exceeds eighteen months. Otherwise, the longest single Prison sanction, you (unintelligible) half of your stated Prison term. You can be returned to Prison for up to fifty percent of your Prison Sentence for all violations committed. If convicted of a new Felony while on Post-Release Control, in addition to being punished for the new offense, the Court can add an additional consecutive Prison term of one year, however, whatever part\nremains of the Post-Release Control term; whichever is greater.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6 32} The state concedes that the post-release control language did not state that the term would be three years. The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that the failure to properly impose post-release control renders the post-release control portion of the sentence void. State v. Fischer, 128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, 942 N.E.2d 332, \u00b6 26. The remedy for this error is a new sentencing hearing, limited to the proper imposition of the post release control sanction. Id. at \u00b6 29.\n\nAs we previously mentioned, the state concedes this issue and we hereby sustain appellant's second assignment of error.\n\n{\u00b6 33} Accordingly, we find merit to appellant's argument and we remand this matter to the trial court for proceedings consistent with R.C. 2929.191 to properly impose the term of post-release control.\n\nIII.\n\n{\u00b6 34} In his third assignment of error, appellant, citing the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. 2929.11, asserts that the trial court\u2019s sentence does not comport with the purposes of felony sentencing. In particular, appellant argues that the trial court's refusal to consider appellant\u2019s mental health issues and impose a term of life without parole, which will not provide appellant with an opportunity for parole or future mental health services, fails to comply with the requirements and purpose of R.C. 2929.11.\n\n{\u00b6 35} Appellant cites State v. Marcum, 146 Ohio St.3d 516, 2016-Ohio-1002, 59 N.E.3d 1231, for the proposition that an appellate court may vacate or modify any sentence that is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law only if the appellate court finds, by clear and convincing evidence,\nthat the record does not support the sentence. Counsel argues that appellant self-medicated with alcohol and drugs and had no access to professional mental health services. The state counters that *Marcum* dealt with sentencing for a classified felony, not for aggravated murder. *Id.* at \u00b6 22-23. The state points out that *Marcum* relied on R.C. 2953.08 for the statutory authority to review a felony sentence, however, R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) makes clear, \u201c[a] sentence imposed for aggravated murder or murder pursuant to sections 2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code is not subject to review under this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\n{\u00b6 36} The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that \u201cR.C. 2953.08(D) is unambiguous. \u2018A sentence imposed for aggravated murder or murder pursuant to section 2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code is not subject to review under this section\u2019 clearly means what it says: such a sentence cannot be reviewed.\u201d *State v. Porterfield*, 106 Ohio St.3d 5, 2005-Ohio-3095, 829 N.E.2d 690, \u00b6 17. Moreover, this court has held \u201c[i]t is evident that the General Assembly intended to treat sentencing on aggravated murder and murder convictions differently from other felony sentences.\u201d *State v. Hawkins*, 4th Dist. No. 13CA3, 2014-Ohio-1224, \u00b6 15., citing *State v. Porterfield* at \u00b6 17-18.\n\nWe wrote: \u201cwe find pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(D)(3), we lack statutory authority to review Hawkins\u2019 sentence on an evidentiary basis.\u201d *Id.*\n\n{\u00b6 37} Appellant also contends that the trial court\u2019s sentence did not comport with due process and is excessive. However, our review of the record reveals that, although the trial court expressed concern and acknowledged appellant\u2019s mental health issues, and allowed competency evaluations and forensic reviews and pondered how better treatment earlier in life might have affected appellant, the court concluded that the aggravating factors nevertheless outweighed appellant\u2019s mental health concerns: \u201cYou know, we\u2019ve talked about the failures of the mental health\nsystem. We\u2019ve talked about the dramatic cuts to that system. Maybe if we had a system that was properly funded, Mr. Vance may have received appropriate treatment. But, those are all \u2018what ifs.\u2019 I don\u2019t know. The reality that I have to deal with is that Mr. Vance is a dangerous individual. He has committed a savage crime.\u201d The court further noted the injury to the victim, his family, and appellant\u2019s criminal history, including a prior violent offense.\n\n\u00b6 38 Consequently, after our review, we conclude that (1) appellant\u2019s aggravated murder sentence is not subject to appellate review, and (2) appellant's sentence for tampering with evidence comported with due process and is not excessive. Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.\n\nIV.\n\n\u00b6 39 In his final assignment of error, appellant asserts that at the sentencing hearing the trial court sentenced him to serve (1) life in prison without parole for the aggravated murder conviction, and (2) thirty-six months on the tampering with evidence charge. Appellant argues, however, that the court failed to specify its consecutive sentencing findings in its entry as R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) requires. The court stated: \u201c[t]hat will be consecutive punishment as necessary to protect the public. The punishment is not disproportionate to the crime, and your criminal history demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary.\u201d The court's December 6, 2016 sentencing entry recited the statutory language of R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) - including the subsections (a), (b), and (c). However, the entry provides lines next to the restatements of these subsections, presumably, as the state contends, as a check-off. Based on the trial court\u2019s remarks at sentencing, subsection (c) - \u201cthe offender\u2019s history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender\u201d should have been initialed or checked, but it\ndoes not appear that the court did so.\n\n\u00b6 40 The state maintains that this error may be corrected with a nunc pro tunc entry. However, in view of our resolution of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, the trial court may address this issue when, on remand, it addresses the imposition of post-release control as referenced in appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n\u00b6 41 Accordingly, we sustain appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error and remand the matter to the trial court to include the findings to support consecutive sentencing.\n\nV.\n\n\u00b6 42 In conclusion, we (1) overrule appellant\u2019s first and third assignments of error, (2) find appellant\u2019s second and fourth assignments of error to be well-taken, and (3) remand this cause to the trial court to address the post-release control term for tampering with evidence the and the findings for consecutive sentences.3\n\nJUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND CAUSE REMANDED FOR FURTHER\n\n3Appellant\u2019s pro se brief contends that the trial court abused appellant\u2019s First Amendment rights when it referred to appellant as Muslim. However, our review finds no such reference. Appellant also asserts that he consistently stated that he had been attacked on November 29, 2013. Thus, he appears to attack the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. However, the state presented ample competent, credible evidence so that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of aggravated murder and tampering with evidence proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury heard appellant\u2019s version of the events and did not find his testimony credible. Appellant also asserts that the trial court erred by failing to replace the jury after (1) one juror revealed she participated in an event in support of the county prosecutor, and (2) another juror shared outside information to the jury. However, the trial court properly questioned the first juror and concluded that she could be impartial. Later, during deliberations, the second juror revealed to several jurors that she disputed the victim\u2019s daughter\u2019s (M.C.) age. After the trial court conducted a hearing and questioned the jurors, the court dismissed the second juror, brought in an alternate, and retained the other jurors who stated that the comments did not influence their deliberations. Appellant also asserts that his trial counsel failed to (1) use certain evidence, (2) investigate and subpoena witnesses, (3) remove jury members, (4) defend appellant, and (5) that he should have been granted new counsel. However, appellant\u2019s claims are undermined by the fact that the jury found appellant not guilty of five of the eleven charges. Additionally, after the trial court discussed appellant\u2019s representation, the court asked appellant if he was satisfied with defense counsel, and appellant agreed. Here, counsel\u2019s representation did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.\nPROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.\nJUDGMENT ENTRY\n\nIt is ordered that the judgment be affirmed in part, reversed in part, and cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Appellant and Appellee shall split the costs.\n\nThe Court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this Court directing the Jackson County Common Pleas Court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\nIf a stay of execution of sentence and release upon bail has been previously granted, it is continued for a period of sixty days upon the bail previously posted.

Johnson,  8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105612, \n2018-Ohio-1389, in which this court affirmed his convictions for aggravated murder, murder, \nattempted murder, discharging a firearm at or near a prohibited pr emises, two counts of having a \nweapon while under disability, and f our counts of felonious assau lt.  Johnson now argues that \nhis appellate counsel should have argued: (1) there was insu fficient evidence of prior calculation \nand design to support the convic tion of aggravated murder, (2) the indictments failed to give \nsufficient notice of the charges, and (3) trial couns el was ineffective for failing to argue that the \ncell-phone evidence violated his F ourth Amendment Rights, based upon Carpenter v. United \nStates, 585 U.S. _____, 138 S.Ct. 2206, 201 L.Ed.2d 507 ( 2018), which was decided on June 22, 2018.  On July 30, 2018, the state of Ohio filed its brief in opposition.  For the following \nreasons, this court denies the application.  \n{\u00b62} App.R. 26(B)(1) and (2)(b) require applica tions claiming ineffective assistance of \nappellate counsel to be  filed within 90 days from journa lization of the decision unless the \napplicant shows good cause for filing at a later time.  This court issued its decision on April 12, \n2018, and Johnson filed his appli cation one day late on July 12, 2018 (18 (remaining days in \nApril) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 12 (July) = 91).  Thus, this application is untimely.  Johnson \ndid not proffer any explanation to show good cause. \n{\u00b63} The Supreme Court of Ohio in State v.

In those \ncases the applicants argued that after the cour t of appeals decided their cases, their appellate \ncounsel continued to represent them, and their a ppellate counsel could not be expected to raise \ntheir own incompetence.  Althoug h the Supreme Court agreed with this latter principle, it \nrejected the argument that c ontinued representation provided good cause.  In both cases, the \ncourt ruled that the applicants could not ignore the ninety-day deadline, even if it meant retaining \nnew counsel or filing the applications themselves.

FILED JANUARY 31, 2018\u201d \n \nTHIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR: \n \n\u201cTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT APPOINT \nEFFECTIVE TRIAL COUNSEL OR COUNSEL FOR HIS \nPOSTCONVICTION TO PROPERLY DEFEND \nDEFENDANT-APPELLANT LEWIS VANCE IN PROCEEDINGS OF \nTHE COURT TO SUPPORT HIS SELF-DEFENSE WITHIN THE \nHOME AND PROPERTY IN TRIAL COURT CASE NO. 14-CR-0118.\u201d \n \nFOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR: \n \n\u201cTHE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY NOT \nGRANTING APPELLANT VANCE HIS MOTION FOR DISCOVERY \nTO ALLOW HIM EVIDENCE NEEDED FOR THE \nPOSTCONVICTION EVIDENTIARY HEARING HE REQUESTED AS \nOF JANUARY 31, 2018.\u201d \n \nFIFTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR: \n \n\u201cTHE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT \nCONTINUED TO RULE WITH ADVERSE RULINGS, EVEN \nERRONEOUS ONES.\u201d \n \n{\u00b6 2} In 2016, a jury found appellant guilty of: (1) Count 1 aggravated murder R.C. \n2903.01(D), (2) Count 2 murder R.C. 2903.02(A), (3) Count 3 murder R.C. 2903.02(B), (4) Count 4 JACKSON, 17CA9 \n \n3\nfelonious assault R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), (5) Count 5 felonious assault R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), and (6) \nCount 9 tampering with evidence R.C. 2921.12(A).  Th e jury also found appellant not guilty of: (1) \nCount 6 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), (2) Count  7 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), (3) Count 8 \nattempted rape R.C. 2923.02(A)/2907.02(A)(2), (4) Count 10 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), and (5) \nCount 11 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(B)(2).  The trial c ourt sentenced appellant to serve life in prison \nwithout parole on count one (aggravated murder), a nd thirty-six months on count 9 (tampering with \nevidence).  The court further ordered that the senten ces be served consecutively to one another.  At \nthat point, appellant filed a pro se Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial and argued that (1) irregularities \nexisted in the court proceedings, including jury and prosecutorial misconduct, and (2) new evidence \nsupported his self-defense claim.   Appellant also filed a Crim. R. 29 motion for judgment of \nacquittal.  On direct appeal, this court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the cause to \nthe trial court to include findings, if appropriate, to support consecutive sentences. 1  While his \nappeal was pending, appellant also filed various pro se motions, including his March 18, 2017 pro se \npetition for postconviction relief a nd his June 30, 2017 pro se petition to vacate or set aside the \njudgment of conviction and motion for expert assistance (a forensic  scientist).  The trial court \ndenied the postconviction relief pe tition and indicated that appellant  did not attach materials to \nsupport his petition and that no substantive grounds for relief exists.  In addition, on November 1, \n2017, the trial court issued an entry that chronicled  and denied all 21 of a ppellant\u2019s motions.  The \ncourt determined that it either lacked jurisdiction to consider certain motions, certain motions did not \nset forth a request that the court could grant, or certain motions are nonsensical.  Thus, the trial court \ndenied the postconviction relief re quest and concluded th at appellant is not entitled to relief as \n                                                 \n1 More extensive facts are set forth in State v. Vance, 4th Dist. Jackson No. 16CA11, 2018-Ohio-1313, \u00b6 2-20.  JACKSON, 17CA9 \n \n4\nprovided in R.C. 2953.21.  This appeal followed.    \n{\u00b6 3} The postconviction relief proce ss is a collateral civil att ack on a criminal judgment \nrather than an appeal of the judgment.  State v. Calhoun , 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 714 N.E.2d 905 \n(1999).  Postconviction relief is not  a constitutional right; instead, it is a narrow remedy that gives \nthe petitioner no more rights than those granted by statute.  Id.; State v. Betts, 4th Dist. Vinton No. \n18CA710, 2018-Ohio-2720, \u00b6 11.  This process is a m eans to resolve constitutional claims that \ncannot be addressed on dir ect appeal because the evidence supportin g the claims is not contained in \nthe record.  State v. McDougald,  4th Dist. Scioto No. 16C A3736, 2016-Ohio-5080, \u00b6 19-20, citing \nState v. Knauff , 4th Dist. Adams No. 13CA976, 2014-Ohio-308, \u00b6 18; Betts, supra.  \u201c[A] trial \ncourt\u2019s decision granting or denying a postconviction petition filed pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 should \nbe upheld absent an abuse of di scretion; a reviewing court shoul d not overrule th e trial court\u2019s \nfinding on a petition for postconviction relief that is  supported by competent and credible evidence.\u201d \n State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 390, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 58; State v. Black, 4th \nDist. Ross No. 15CA3509, 2016-Ohio-3104, \u00b6 7.  \u201cA tr ial court abuses its discretion when its \ndecision is unreasonable, arb itrary, or unconscionable.\u201d  State v. Rinehart , 4th Dist. Ross No. \n17CA3606, 2018-Ohio-1261, \u00b6 10, citing State v. Knauff at \u00b6 19.  \nI.  \n{\u00b6 4} In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion \nby failing to hold a hearing to c onsider appellant\u2019s postconviction relief request.  A ppellant appears \nto refer to his motion titled \u201cMotion for Evidentia ry Hearing Request; Suppl emental of Record.\u201d  \nThe trial court denied this motion, inter alia, without a hearing by entry dated November 1, 2017.   \n{\u00b6 5} R.C. 2953.21(D) provides: \u201cBefore granting a hearing on a petition filed under division JACKSON, 17CA9 \n \n5\n(A) of this section, the court sh all determine whether there are s ubstantive grounds for relief.  In \nmaking such a determination, th e court shall consider, in add ition to the petition, the supporting \naffidavits, and the documentary evidence, all the files and records pertaining to the proceedings \nagainst the petitioner, including, but not limited to, the indictment, the court's journal entries, the \njournalized records of the clerk of the court, and the court reporter's transcript.\u201d \n{\u00b6 6} Because a motion for postconviction relief is not  an appeal, but rather a collateral civil \nattack on a judgment, a criminal defendant who seeks to challenge a conviction through a petition for \npostconviction relief is not automatically entitled to a hearing.  State v. Cole, 2 Ohio St.3d 112, 443 \nN.E.2d 169 (1982); Black at \u00b6 9, citing Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d at 282.  Rather, before granting an \nevidentiary hearing on the petition, R.C. 2951.21(C) requires that a trial court find substantive \ngrounds for relief.  \u201cSubstantive grounds for relief ex ist and a hearing is warranted if the petitioner \nproduces sufficient credible evidence that demonstrates the petitioner suffered a violation of the \npetitioner\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d  In re B.C.S. , 4th Dist. Washington No. 07CA60, \n2008-Ohio-5771, \u00b6 11.  Furthermore, in order to mer it a hearing, the petitioner must show that the \nclaimed \u201cerrors resulted in prejudice.\u201d  Id., quoting Calhoun at 283; Betts, supra. \n{\u00b6 7} In the case sub judice, the trial court denied  all 21 pending pro se  motions and denied \nappellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.  The court wrote:  \u201cR.C. 2953.21(C) provides that prior \nto granting a hearing the Court shall determine if  there are substantive grounds for relief.  The \nDefendant has not attached materi als in support of his petition.  Th e Court has reviewed the entire \nfile concerning this case.  Based upon the review of the record, the Court finds that there are no \nsubstantive grounds for relief as set forth in the petition.  The Defendant is not entitled to relief as \nprovided in R.C. 2953.21.  Therefore, the Court denies the petition.\u201d   JACKSON, 17CA9 \n \n6\n{\u00b6 8} \u201c[A} petitioner who does not submit any evidence will have n ecessarily failed to \nsubmit enough evidence to demonstrat e substantive grounds for relief.\u201d  State v. Hicks , 4th Dist. \nHighland No. 09CA15, 2010-Ohio-89, \u00b6 17.  Thus, in the case sub judice, the trial court did not \nabuse its discretion by dismissi ng appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief without conducting a \nhearing.  Appellant did not submit evidence to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief. \n II.    \n{\u00b6 9} In his second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by failing to \nappoint counsel for his postconviction proceedings.  However, \u201c[A]n indige nt petitioner has neither \na state nor a federal constitutiona l right to be represented by an attorney in a postconviction \nproceeding.\u201d  State v. Crowder , 60 Ohio St.3d 151, 152, 573 N.E.2d 652 (1982), citing \nPennsylvania v. Finley , 481 U.S. 551, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987).  Moreover, \n\u201cappointed counsel is not required for the initial burden of preparing and presenting petitions for \npostconviction relief.\u201d  State v. Barnes , 7 Ohio App.3d 83, 86, 454 N.E.2d 572 (1982).  If a court \nfinds that a petitioner\u2019s allegations do not merit an evidentiary hearing, that petitioner is not entitled \nto the appointment of counsel.  State v. Slagle, 4th Dist. Highland No. 11CA22, 2012-Ohio-1936, \u00b6 \n22.   \n{\u00b6 10} Consequently, because the trial court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing \nappellant\u2019s petition without a hearing, appellant was not entitled to counsel.  We therefore overrule \nappellant\u2019s second assignment of error.    \n III. \n{\u00b6 11} In his third assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred when it \u201cdid \nnot appoint effective trial counsel or counsel for his postconviction to properly defend\u201d appellant \u201cin JACKSON, 17CA9 \n \n7\nproceedings of the court to support his self-defense within the home and property in trial court.\u201d  As \nwe held above, however, a ppellant is not, at this juncture, entitle d to the appointment of counsel for \nhis postconviction proceedings.  With regard to his claim that he did not receive effective assistance \nof trial counsel, the doctrine of re s judicata bars this issue from c onsideration.  Res judicata applies \nto proceedings involving postconviction relief.  Black at \u00b6 10, citing State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d \n93, 95, 671 N.E.2d 233 (1996).  \u201cUnder the doctrine of re s judicata, a final j udgment of conviction \nbars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel fro m raising and litigating in any \nproceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that \nwas raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment of \nconviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.\u201d  State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 \n(1967).  \u201cTherefore, \u2018any issue th at could have been raised on di rect appeal and was not is res \njudicata and not subject to review in subsequent proceedings.\u2019\u201d  Black at \u00b6 10, citing State v. \nSegines, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99789, 2013-Ohio-5259, \u00b6 8, quoting State v. Saxon , 109 Ohio \nSt.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, 846 N.E.2d 824, \u00b6 16.   \n{\u00b6 12} Although appellant pursued his postconvic tion petition pro se, c ounsel represented \nhim at trial.  Moreover, appellant had a different counsel for hi s direct appeal.  Thus, appellant\u2019s \ndirect appeal should have a ddressed the issue of ineffec tive assistance of counsel.  S ee State v. \nVance, 4th Dist. Jackson No. 16CA11, 2018-Ohio-1313.   \n{\u00b6 13} Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.  \n IV.  \n{\u00b6 14} In his fourth assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its \ndiscretion by not granting his \u201cmotion for discovery, Crim.R. 16, Discovery and Inspection.\u201d   JACKSON, 17CA9 \n \n8\n{\u00b6 15} This court has held that \u201c[a] postconviction relief petitioner is not entitled to discovery \nto help the petitioner establish substantive grounds for relief.\u201d  State v.

More  recently, the Tenth District addressed \nthis issue with respect to other appellate districts:   \u201cOhio appellate courts, including this district, \nhave routinely rejected granting postconviction relief petitioners the right to obtain discovery to help \nhim or her establish substantive grounds for relief.  State v. Gulertekin , 10th Dist. No. 99AP\u2013900 \n(June 8, 2000).  \u2018Ohio law is clear that discovery  is not available in the initial stages of a \npostconviction proceeding.\u2019  State v.

Summit No. \n25874, 2012-Ohio-4495, \u00b6 111.   \n{\u00b6 16} Accordingly, in the case sub judice appellant is not entitled to discovery during the \ninitial stage of postconviction relief.  Therefore, we overrule appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error. \n V. \n{\u00b6 17} In his final assignment of e rror, appellant contends that  the trial court abused its \ndiscretion \u201cwhen it continued to rule with adverse rulings, even  erroneous ones.\u201d  Our review \nreveals that appellant ha s filed multiple pro se mo tions and, as the state observes, has failed to \nexplicitly state which motion or motions he is addr essing in his assignment of error.  App. R. \n12(A)(2) provides: \u201cThe court may disregard an assignment of error presented for review if the party \nraising it fails to identify in the record the error on which the assignment of error is based or fails to \nargue the assignment separately in the brief, as required unde r App. R. 16(A).\u201d  App.R. 16(A) \noutlines the requirements for the appellant\u2019s brief, stating that it shall include:  JACKSON, 17CA9 \n \n9\n* * * \n(3) A statement of the assignments of error presented for review, with reference to the \nplace in the record where each error is reflected.\u201d  \n* * * \n(7) An argument containing the contentions of the appellant with respect to each \nassignment of error presented for review and the reasons in support of the \ncontentions, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and parts of the record on \nwhich appellant relies . The argument may be preceded by a summary. (Emphasis \nadded) \n \n{\u00b6 18} Here, appellant asserts that the trial court would not rule on appellant\u2019s pro se motions \n\u201cbecause he authored them.\u201d  However, our review reveals that the trial court did, in fact, rule on \nappellant\u2019s motions and, as the state highlights, ma ny of the filings are apparently questions for \npotential witnesses rather than actual motions.  Thus , because appellant fails to adequately set forth \na plausible argument, we overrule his final assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment. \nJUDGMENT AFFIRMED. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n JACKSON, 17CA9 \n \n10\n \n \nJUDGMENT ENTRY \nIt is ordered that the judgment be affirmed and that appellee recover of appellant the costs \nherein taxed.  \n \nThe Court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal. \n \nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this Court directing the Jackson County \nCommon Pleas Court to carry this judgment into execution. \n \nIf a stay of execution of sentence and release upon bail has been previously granted by the \ntrial court or this court, it is temporarily continued for a period not to exceed sixty days upon the bail \npreviously posted.  The purpose of a continued stay is to allow appellant to file with the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio an application for a stay during the pendency of proceedings in that court.  If a stay is \ncontinued by this entry, it will terminate at the earlier of the expiration of the sixty day period, or the \nfailure of the appellant fo file a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio in the forty-five day \nappeal period pursuant to Rule II, Sec. 1 of the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio.  \nAdditionally, if the Supreme Court of Ohio dismisses the appeal prior to expiration of sixty days, the \nstay will terminate as of the date of such dismissal. \n \nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute that mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of \nAppellate Procedure. \n \nHarsha, J. & McFarland, J.: Concur in Judgment & Opinion \n \n  For the Court \n \n \n \nB Y :                                              \n                        P e t e r  B .

The jury also found appellant not guilty of: (1) Count 6 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), (2) Count 7 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), (3) Count 8 attempted rape R.C. 2923.02(A)/2907.02(A)(2), (4) Count 10 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), and (5) Count 11 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(B)(2). The trial court sentenced appellant to serve life in prison without parole on count one (aggravated murder), and thirty-six months on count 9 (tampering with evidence). The court further ordered that the sentences be served consecutively to one another. At that point, appellant filed a pro se Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial and argued that (1) irregularities existed in the court proceedings, including jury and prosecutorial misconduct, and (2) new evidence supported his self-defense claim. Appellant also filed a Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. On direct appeal, this court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the cause to the trial court to include findings, if appropriate, to support consecutive sentences.\\(^1\\) While his appeal was pending, appellant also filed various pro se motions, including his March 18, 2017 pro se petition for postconviction relief and his June 30, 2017 pro se petition to vacate or set aside the judgment of conviction and motion for expert assistance (a forensic scientist). The trial court denied the postconviction relief petition and indicated that appellant did not attach materials to support his petition and that no substantive grounds for relief exists. In addition, on November 1, 2017, the trial court issued an entry that chronicled and denied all 21 of appellant\u2019s motions. The court determined that it either lacked jurisdiction to consider certain motions, certain motions did not set forth a request that the court could grant, or certain motions are nonsensical. Thus, the trial court denied the postconviction relief request and concluded that appellant is not entitled to relief as\n\n\\(^1\\) More extensive facts are set forth in *State v. Vance*, 4th Dist. Jackson No. 16CA11, 2018-Ohio-1313, \u00b6 2-20.\nprovided in R.C. 2953.21. This appeal followed.\n\n\u00b6 3 The postconviction relief process is a collateral civil attack on a criminal judgment rather than an appeal of the judgment. State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999). Postconviction relief is not a constitutional right; instead, it is a narrow remedy that gives the petitioner no more rights than those granted by statute. Id.; State v. Betts, 4th Dist. Vinton No. 18CA710, 2018-Ohio-2720, \u00b6 11. This process is a means to resolve constitutional claims that cannot be addressed on direct appeal because the evidence supporting the claims is not contained in the record. State v. McDougald, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 16CA3736, 2016-Ohio-5080, \u00b6 19-20, citing State v. Knauff, 4th Dist. Adams No. 13CA976, 2014-Ohio-308, \u00b6 18; Betts, supra. \u201c[A] trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a postconviction petition filed pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 should be upheld absent an abuse of discretion; a reviewing court should not overrule the trial court\u2019s finding on a petition for postconviction relief that is supported by competent and credible evidence.\u201d State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 390, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 58; State v. Black, 4th Dist. Ross No. 15CA3509, 2016-Ohio-3104, \u00b6 7. \u201cA trial court abuses its discretion when its decision is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\u201d State v. Rinehart, 4th Dist. Ross No. 17CA3606, 2018-Ohio-1261, \u00b6 10, citing State v. Knauff at \u00b6 19.\n\nI.\n\n\u00b6 4 In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to hold a hearing to consider appellant\u2019s postconviction relief request. Appellant appears to refer to his motion titled \u201cMotion for Evidentiary Hearing Request; Supplemental of Record.\u201d The trial court denied this motion, inter alia, without a hearing by entry dated November 1, 2017.\n\n\u00b6 5 R.C. 2953.21(D) provides: \u201cBefore granting a hearing on a petition filed under division\n(A) of this section, the court shall determine whether there are substantive grounds for relief. In making such a determination, the court shall consider, in addition to the petition, the supporting affidavits, and the documentary evidence, all the files and records pertaining to the proceedings against the petitioner, including, but not limited to, the indictment, the court's journal entries, the journalized records of the clerk of the court, and the court reporter's transcript.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 6 Because a motion for postconviction relief is not an appeal, but rather a collateral civil attack on a judgment, a criminal defendant who seeks to challenge a conviction through a petition for postconviction relief is not automatically entitled to a hearing. State v. Cole, 2 Ohio St.3d 112, 443 N.E.2d 169 (1982); Black at \u00b6 9, citing Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d at 282. Rather, before granting an evidentiary hearing on the petition, R.C. 2951.21(C) requires that a trial court find substantive grounds for relief. \u201cSubstantive grounds for relief exist and a hearing is warranted if the petitioner produces sufficient credible evidence that demonstrates the petitioner suffered a violation of the petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d In re B.C.S., 4th Dist. Washington No. 07CA60, 2008-Ohio-5771, \u00b6 11. Furthermore, in order to merit a hearing, the petitioner must show that the claimed \u201cerrors resulted in prejudice.\u201d Id., quoting Calhoun at 283; Betts, supra.\n\n\u00b6 7 In the case sub judice, the trial court denied all 21 pending pro se motions and denied appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. The court wrote: \u201cR.C. 2953.21(C) provides that prior to granting a hearing the Court shall determine if there are substantive grounds for relief. The Defendant has not attached materials in support of his petition. The Court has reviewed the entire file concerning this case. Based upon the review of the record, the Court finds that there are no substantive grounds for relief as set forth in the petition. The Defendant is not entitled to relief as provided in R.C. 2953.21. Therefore, the Court denies the petition.\u201d\n\u201c[A] petitioner who does not submit any evidence will have necessarily failed to submit enough evidence to demonstrate substantive grounds for relief.\u201d State v. Hicks, 4th Dist. Highland No. 09CA15, 2010-Ohio-89, \u00b6 17. Thus, in the case sub judice, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief without conducting a hearing. Appellant did not submit evidence to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief.\n\nII.\n\nIn his second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by failing to appoint counsel for his postconviction proceedings. However, \u201c[A]n indigent petitioner has neither a state nor a federal constitutional right to be represented by an attorney in a postconviction proceeding.\u201d State v. Crowder, 60 Ohio St.3d 151, 152, 573 N.E.2d 652 (1982), citing Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987). Moreover, \u201cappointed counsel is not required for the initial burden of preparing and presenting petitions for postconviction relief.\u201d State v. Barnes, 7 Ohio App.3d 83, 86, 454 N.E.2d 572 (1982). If a court finds that a petitioner\u2019s allegations do not merit an evidentiary hearing, that petitioner is not entitled to the appointment of counsel. State v. Slagle, 4th Dist. Highland No. 11CA22, 2012-Ohio-1936, \u00b6 22.\n\nConsequently, because the trial court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing appellant\u2019s petition without a hearing, appellant was not entitled to counsel. We therefore overrule appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\nIII.\n\nIn his third assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred when it \u201cdid not appoint effective trial counsel or counsel for his postconviction to properly defend\u201d appellant \u201cin\nproceedings of the court to support his self-defense within the home and property in trial court.\u201d As we held above, however, appellant is not, at this juncture, entitled to the appointment of counsel for his postconviction proceedings. With regard to his claim that he did not receive effective assistance of trial counsel, the doctrine of res judicata bars this issue from consideration. Res judicata applies to proceedings involving postconviction relief. Black at \u00b6 10, citing State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 95, 671 N.E.2d 233 (1996). \u201cUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.\u201d State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967). \u201cTherefore, \u2018any issue that could have been raised on direct appeal and was not is res judicata and not subject to review in subsequent proceedings.\u2019\u201d Black at \u00b6 10, citing State v. Segines, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99789, 2013-Ohio-5259, \u00b6 8, quoting State v. Saxon, 109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, 846 N.E.2d 824, \u00b6 16.\n\n{\u00b6 12} Although appellant pursued his postconviction petition pro se, counsel represented him at trial. Moreover, appellant had a different counsel for his direct appeal. Thus, appellant\u2019s direct appeal should have addressed the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. See State v. Vance, 4th Dist. Jackson No. 16CA11, 2018-Ohio-1313.\n\n{\u00b6 13} Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.\n\nIV.\n\n{\u00b6 14} In his fourth assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by not granting his \u201cmotion for discovery, Crim.R. 16, Discovery and Inspection.\u201d\nThis court has held that \u201c[a] postconviction relief petitioner is not entitled to discovery to help the petitioner establish substantive grounds for relief.\u201d State v. LaMar, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 98CA23, 2000 WL 297413 (March 17, 2003), *7. More recently, the Tenth District addressed this issue with respect to other appellate districts: \u201cOhio appellate courts, including this district, have routinely rejected granting postconviction relief petitioners the right to obtain discovery to help him or her establish substantive grounds for relief. State v. Gulertekin, 10th Dist. No. 99AP\u2013900 (June 8, 2000). \u2018Ohio law is clear that discovery is not available in the initial stages of a postconviction proceeding.\u2019 State v. Cunningham, 3d Dist. No. 1\u201304\u201319, 2004\u2013Ohio\u20135892, \u00b6 69, citing State v. Byrd, 145 Ohio App.3d 318, 332 (1st Dist.2001).\u201d State v. Montgomery, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-1091, 2015-Ohio-500 at \u00b6 8. Accord State v. Wesson, 9t Dist. Summit No. 25874, 2012-Ohio-4495, \u00b6 111.\n\nAccordingly, in the case sub judice appellant is not entitled to discovery during the initial stage of postconviction relief. Therefore, we overrule appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error.\n\nV.\n\nIn his final assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion \u201cwhen it continued to rule with adverse rulings, even erroneous ones.\u201d Our review reveals that appellant has filed multiple pro se motions and, as the state observes, has failed to explicitly state which motion or motions he is addressing in his assignment of error. App. R. 12(A)(2) provides: \u201cThe court may disregard an assignment of error presented for review if the party raising it fails to identify in the record the error on which the assignment of error is based or fails to argue the assignment separately in the brief, as required under App. R. 16(A).\u201d App.R. 16(A) outlines the requirements for the appellant\u2019s brief, stating that it shall include:\n(3) A statement of the assignments of error presented for review, with reference to the place in the record where each error is reflected.\u201d\n\n(7) An argument containing the contentions of the appellant with respect to each assignment of error presented for review and the reasons in support of the contentions, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and parts of the record on which appellant relies. The argument may be preceded by a summary. (Emphasis added)\n\n\u00b6 18 Here, appellant asserts that the trial court would not rule on appellant\u2019s pro se motions \u201cbecause he authored them.\u201d However, our review reveals that the trial court did, in fact, rule on appellant\u2019s motions and, as the state highlights, many of the filings are apparently questions for potential witnesses rather than actual motions. Thus, because appellant fails to adequately set forth a plausible argument, we overrule his final assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\nJUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\nJUDGMENT ENTRY\n\nIt is ordered that the judgment be affirmed and that appellee recover of appellant the costs herein taxed.\n\nThe Court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this Court directing the Jackson County Common Pleas Court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\nIf a stay of execution of sentence and release upon bail has been previously granted by the trial court or this court, it is temporarily continued for a period not to exceed sixty days upon the bail previously posted. The purpose of a continued stay is to allow appellant to file with the Supreme Court of Ohio an application for a stay during the pendency of proceedings in that court. If a stay is continued by this entry, it will terminate at the earlier of the expiration of the sixty day period, or the failure of the appellant to file a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio in the forty-five day appeal period pursuant to Rule II, Sec. 1 of the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Additionally, if the Supreme Court of Ohio dismisses the appeal prior to expiration of sixty days, the stay will terminate as of the date of such dismissal.\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute that mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\nHarsha, J. & McFarland, J.: Concur in Judgment & Opinion\n\nFor the Court\n\nBY: ______________________\n\nPeter B.

The trial court sentenced \nappellant by judgment entries filed October 31, 2014.  \n{\u00b6 4} On November 25, 2014, appellant filed a notice of appeal in case No. 12CR-\n5963, and on June 17, 2015, he filed a motion for leave to file a delayed appeal in case No. \n13CR-4174.  This court subsequently granted appellant's motion for leave to appeal, and \nconsolidated the two cases for appeal.  In Neil I, this court affirmed the convictions in case \nNos. 12CR-5963 and 13CR-4174.   \n{\u00b6 5} On February 3, 2016, appellant filed a pro se petition for post-conviction \nrelief in case No. 12CR-5963.  The state subsequently filed an answer and a motion to \ndismiss the petition.  By decision and entry filed October 31, 2016, the trial court denied \nappellant's request for post-conviction relief and granted the state's motion to dismiss.  \nThe trial court, while treating appellant's petition for post-conviction relief \"as having \nbeen filed under both case Nos. 12CR-5963 and 13CR-4174, found the petition untimely, \nand further found appellant failed to invoke an applicable exception under R.C. \n2953.23(A) in order for the court to entertain an untimely petition.\"  Neil II at \u00b6 7.   \n{\u00b6 6} Appellant filed a pro se appeal from the trial court's denial of his petition, \nraising four assignments of error in which he asserted: (1) the trial court erred in failing to \nserve notice of service of the judgment entry, (2) the trial court erred in dismissing his \npost-conviction petition as untimely, (3) the trial court erred in denying his claims of \nineffective assistance of counsel, fair trial and due process of law, and (4) the cumulative \neffect of those errors deprived him of his right to a fair trial. Nos. 18AP-1001, 18AP-1003, and 18AP-1004   3 \n \n \n{\u00b6 7} In Neil II, this court found \"no abuse of discretion by the trial court in its \ndetermination the petition was untimely and that appellant failed to establish the \napplicability of a statutory exception that would permit the court to consider an untimely \npetition.\"  Id. at \u00b6 23.  This court thus concluded \"the trial court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the petition for post-conviction relief and properly dismissed it.\"  Id.  \n{\u00b6 8} On August 1, 2018, appellant filed a successive petition for post-conviction \nrelief.  On August 28, 2018, the state filed an answer and motion to dismiss the petition.   \n{\u00b6 9} By decision and entry filed December 7, 2018, the trial court denied \nappellant's petition to vacate or set aside his judgment of conviction or sentence.  In its \ndecision, the trial court found appellant's second petition for post-conviction relief to be \nuntimely as to both case Nos. 12CR-5963 and 13CR-4174, and further found none of the \nexceptions for an untimely petition to be applicable.   \n{\u00b6 10} On appeal, appellant, pro se, sets forth the following five assignments of \nerror for this court's review: \nAssignment of error one: Appellant was deprived of his \nfundamental right to be free from illegal search and seizure in \nviolation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States and \nOhio Constitution, where police officers did not obtain a \nsearch warrant supported by probable cause for appellant's \ncell-site location information, then misleadingly and falsely \npresented the CSLI in two other search warrants which also \ncontained multiple omissions, misleading, and false \nstatements, then presented at trial prejudicing and depriving \nappellant of a fair trial. \n \nAssignment of error two: Appellant was deprived of his \nfundamental right to due process and a fair trial in violation of \nthe Sixth Amendment to the United States and Ohio \nConstitution, due to prosecutorial misconduct where the \nprosecutor submitted false testimony that he knew was false \nwhich clearly affected the judgment of the jury to convict \nappellant.  \n \nAssignment of error three: Appellant was deprived of his \nfundamental right to a fair trial in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States and Ohio \nConstitution when trial counsel ineffectively deprived \nappellant from presenting evidence and subpoenaing \nwitnesses in his favor. \n Nos. 18AP-1001, 18AP-1003, and 18AP-1004   4 \n \n \nAssignment of error four:  The cumulative effect of these \nerrors deprived appellant of his fundamental right to fair trial \nin violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States and \nOhio Constitution. \n \nAssignment of error five: The trial court erred and abused \nits discretion when it denied appellant's 2953.23 petition \ndenying appellant due process and a fair trial free from false \nstatements from law enforcement and the prosecutor that \nwent directly towards guilt. \n \n{\u00b6 11} W e  i n i t i a l l y  a d d r e s s  a p p e l l a n t ' s  f i f t h  a s s i g n m e n t  o f  e r r o r ,  i n  w h i c h  h e  \ncontends the trial court erred in finding inapplicable any of the exceptions to filing an \nuntimely petition for post-conviction relief under R.C. 2953.23.  More specifically, \nappellant argues the trial court erred in its determination that a recent decision of the \nUnited States Supreme Court, Carpenter v. United States, ___ U.S. ___, 138 S.Ct. 2206 \n(2018), did not apply retroactively to his case on collateral review.   \n{\u00b6 12} Under Ohio law, \"[a] postconviction proceeding is not an appeal of a \ncriminal conviction, but, rather, a collateral civil attack on the judgment.\"  State v. Steffen, \n70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410 (1994).  An appellate court applies an abuse of discretion standard \nin reviewing a trial court's denial of a petition for post-conviction relief.  State v. Sowell, \n10th Dist. No. 07AP-809, 2008-Ohio-1518, \u00b6 12, citing State v. Campbell, 10th Dist. No. \n03AP-147, 2003-Ohio-6305.   \n{\u00b6 13} In accordance with R.C. 2953.21(A)(2), a petition for post-conviction relief \n\"shall be filed no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the date on which the trial \ntranscript is filed in the court of appeals in the direct appeal of the judgment of conviction \nor adjudication.\"  In the event no appeal is taken, \"except as otherwise provided in section \n2953.23 of the Revised Code, the petition shall be filed no later than three hundred sixty-\nfive days after the expiration of the time for filing the appeal.\"  R.C. 2953.21(A)(2).   \n{\u00b6 14} Under Ohio law, \"a court may not entertain an untimely petition unless \ndefendant initially demonstrates either (1) he was unavoidably prevented from \ndiscovering facts necessary for the claim for relief, or (2) the United States Supreme Court \nrecognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons in defendant's \nsituation.\"  State v. Sidibeh, 10th Dist. No. 12AP-498, 2013-Ohio-2309, \u00b6 11, citing R.C. \n2953.23(A)(1)(a).  Further, if a defendant satisfies \"one of those two conditions, R.C. Nos. 18AP-1001, 18AP-1003, and 18AP-1004   5 \n \n \n2953.23(A) requires he also must demonstrate that, but for the constitutional error at \ntrial, no reasonable fact finder would have found him guilty of the offenses of which he \nwas convicted.\"  Id., citing R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b). \n{\u00b6 15} On appeal, appellant does not contend his successive petition was timely \nunder R.C. 2953.21(A)(2).  In addressing the issue of timeliness, the trial court noted the \ntrial transcripts in appellant's direct appeal in case No. 12CR-5963 were filed February 2, \n2015 and, therefore, appellant's petition \"should have been filed no later than three \nhundred sixty-five days after the filing of the trial transcript in the Court of Appeals, \nwhich is February 2, 2016.\"  (Dec. 7, 2018 Dec. & Entry at 4.)  Because the petition was \nnot filed until August 1, 2018, the court found the petition to be untimely.  We agree. \n{\u00b6 16} With respect to case No. 13CR-4174, the court found the petition \"should \nhave been filed no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the expiration of his time \nfor filing his appeal, which was December 1, 2015.\"  (Dec. 7, 2018 Dec. & Entry at 5.)  As \nsuch, the court found the petition filed on August 1, 2018 to be untimely.  Again, we agree \nwith the trial court's determination. \n{\u00b6 17} As noted, appellant does not challenge the trial court's finding that his \npetition was untimely.  He argues, however, the United States Supreme Court has \nrecognized a new federal and state right that applies to persons in his situation.  \nSpecifically, appellant relies on the United States Supreme Court's recent decision in \nCarpenter, in which the Supreme Court held the government's acquisition of cell-site \nlocation information (\"CSLI\") records constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment, \nthereby requiring a warrant in the absence of an exception such as exigent circumstances.   \n{\u00b6 18} Appellant similarly argued before the trial court that the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Carpenter was applicable to his case and, therefore, constituted a timeliness \nexception under R.C. 2953.23.  In addressing this issue, the trial court held that, because \nappellant's case \"was not on direct appeal when the Supreme Court issued its decision, the \nCarpenter case is not applicable to Defendant's case and may not be considered an \nexception for an untimely or successive petition.\"  (Dec. 7, 2018 Dec. & Entry at 6.)   \n{\u00b6 19} In general, \"[a] new rule issued by the United States Supreme Court is not \nretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review unless the United States Supreme \nCourt expressly holds it to be retroactive.\"  State v. Jackson, 8th Dist. No. 2017-T-0041, Nos. 18AP-1001, 18AP-1003, and 18AP-1004   6 \n \n \n2018-Ohio-2146, \u00b6 33, citing Tyler v. Cain, 533 U.S. 656, 663 (2001).  As recently noted \nby one federal court, the Supreme Court \"did not explicitly state\" that  Carpenter was \nretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.   In re Baker, 11th Cir. No. 18-15095-\nC (Jan. 9, 2019). \n{\u00b6 20} In accordance with its decision in Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), the \nUnited States Supreme Court has held that \"the retroactivity of our criminal procedure \ndecisions turn on whether they are novel.  When we announce a 'new rule,' a person \nwhose conviction is already final may not benefit from the decision in a habeas or similar \nproceeding.\"  Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. 342, 347 (2013) .  Rather, \"[o]nly when \nwe apply a settled rule may a person avail herself of the decision on collateral review.\"  Id.  \nThere are, however, \"two narrow exceptions\" to the rule in Teague.  Saffle v. Parks, 494 \nU.S. 484,  486 (1990).  Specifically, \"[a] new rule applies retroactively in a collateral \nproceeding only if (1) the rule is substantive or (2) the rule is a ' \"watershed rul[e] of \ncriminal procedure\" implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal \nproceeding.' \" Whorton v. Bockting , 549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007), quoting Saffle at 495, \nquoting Teague at 311.   \n{\u00b6 21} Courts addressing the holding in Carpenter have held that the Supreme \nCourt's decision \"states a new rule.\"  United States v. Davis, D.C.M.D.Pa., No. 1:13-cr-28 \n(Apr. 12, 2019) (holding that \"[t]he Carpenter decision clearly carves out a new \nunderstanding of the Fourth Amendment, as it applies to wireless data,\" and that the \nSupreme Court \"did not merely apply prior case law to the facts before it,\" but rather \n\"stated a new principle on the type of conduct that constitutes a search\"); United States v. \nWilliams, D.C.E.D.Mich. No. 2:17-cr-20758-VAR-DRG (Aug. 2, 2018) (holding that the \nSupreme Court in Carpenter \"announced a new rule that the Government obtaining CSLI \nconstituted a search and can only be legally obtained with a search warrant,\" and \ntherefore \"[g]oing forward, law enforcement * * * will need to demonstrate probable \ncause\").   \n{\u00b6 22} Courts have further held that \"[a]lthough Carpenter announced a new rule \nof law, the Supreme Court did not make the case retroactively applicable to cases on \ncollateral review.\"  United States v. Marquez , D.C.W.D.Ok., No. CR-12-233-R (Aug. 13, \n2018).  See also  Davis (new rule stated in Carpenter does not apply retroactively on Nos. 18AP-1001, 18AP-1003, and 18AP-1004   7 \n \n \ncollateral review; exceptions in Teague do not apply as \"the new rule is plainly \nprocedural\" and \"simply does not rise\" to the level of a watershed rule of criminal \nprocedure); In re Symonett, 11th Cir. No. 19-12232-F (July 9, 2019) (\"The Supreme Court \n* * * has not held that Carpenter is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, \nnor does any combination of cases necessarily dictate its retroactivity.\"); People v. Cutts, \n62 Misc.3d 411, 414 (N.Y.2018) (analyzing Carpenter under retroactivity principles of \nTeague and holding that \"defendants whose convictions became final prior to Carpenter \ncannot benefit from its holding\"). \n{\u00b6 23} Based on the above authorities, which we find persuasive, we agree with the \ntrial court's determination in this case that Carpenter does not apply retroactively to cases \non collateral review.  Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding \nappellant did not meet the requirements of R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a) to bring an untimely \npetition for post-conviction relief.  Because appellant did not meet the requirements of \nR.C. 2953.23, the trial court was without jurisdiction to consider the petition.  State v. \nSimms, 8th Dist. No. 83583, 2004-Ohio-3955, \u00b6 22.   \n{\u00b6 24} Appellant's fifth assignment of error is not well-taken and is overruled. \n{\u00b6 25} In light of our disposition of the jurisdictional issue under the fifth \nassignment of error, the issues raised under appellant's first, second, third, and fourth \nassignments of error, all addressing the merits of the petition, are moot. See State v. \nDugger, 10th Dist. No. 06AP-887, 2007-Ohio-1243, \u00b6 10.   \n{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, appellant's fifth assignment  of error is overruled, his first, \nsecond, third, and fourth assignments of error are rendered moot, and the judgment of \nthe Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed. \nJudgment affirmed. \nLUPER SCHUSTER and BRUNNER, JJ., concur. \n_____________________ ", "case_juv": "0", "case_crim": "0", "case_2001": "0", "case_app": "0", "case_pros": "0", "aoe_none": "0", "aoe_grandjury": "0", "aoe_court": "0", "aoe_defense": "0", "aoe_procbar": "1", "aoe_prochist": "0", "case_timeframe": "0", "other": "147    0\nName: other, dtype: int64", "olmocr_text": "IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\nTENTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\nState of Ohio, : Nos. 18AP-1001\nPlaintiff-Appellee, : (C.P.C.

Neil, pro se.\n\nAPPEALS from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas\n\nBROWN, J.\n\n\u00b6 1 In these consolidated appeals, defendant-appellant, Miguel E. Neil, appeals from a decision and entry of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas denying his successive petition for post-conviction relief. By way of background, the following facts are taken from this court\u2019s decisions in State v. Neil, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-981, 2016-Ohio-4762 (\"Neil I\"), following appellant\u2019s direct appeal of his convictions for 30 counts of robbery and 6 counts of kidnapping in Franklin C.P. Nos. 12CR-5963 and 13CR-4174, and State v. Neil, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-609, 2019-Ohio-2529 (\"Neil II\"), following appellant\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s denial of his first petition for post-conviction relief.\nThe charges against appellant \"arose from a series of robberies that occurred in 2011 and two robberies that occurred in 2012.\" Neil I at \u00b6 2. Appellant was indicted in case No. 12CR-5963 on \"4 counts of robbery and 6 counts of kidnapping arising out of the 2012 robberies,\" and he was indicted in case No. 13CR-4174 \"on 26 counts of robbery and 1 count of kidnapping, arising from 13 separate robberies committed in 2011.\" Neil II at \u00b6 3.\n\nThe trial court joined the indictments for a single trial and, following a jury trial beginning September 24, 2014, the jury returned verdicts finding appellant guilty of 4 counts of robbery and 5 counts of kidnapping in case No. 12CR-5963, and 26 counts of robbery and 1 count of kidnapping in case No. 13CR-4174. The trial court sentenced appellant by judgment entries filed October 31, 2014.\n\nOn November 25, 2014, appellant filed a notice of appeal in case No. 12CR-5963, and on June 17, 2015, he filed a motion for leave to file a delayed appeal in case No. 13CR-4174. This court subsequently granted appellant's motion for leave to appeal, and consolidated the two cases for appeal. In Neil I, this court affirmed the convictions in case Nos. 12CR-5963 and 13CR-4174.\n\nOn February 3, 2016, appellant filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief in case No. 12CR-5963. The state subsequently filed an answer and a motion to dismiss the petition. By decision and entry filed October 31, 2016, the trial court denied appellant's request for post-conviction relief and granted the state's motion to dismiss. The trial court, while treating appellant's petition for post-conviction relief \"as having been filed under both case Nos. 12CR-5963 and 13CR-4174, found the petition untimely, and further found appellant failed to invoke an applicable exception under R.C. 2953.23(A) in order for the court to entertain an untimely petition.\" Neil II at \u00b6 7.\n\nAppellant filed a pro se appeal from the trial court's denial of his petition, raising four assignments of error in which he asserted: (1) the trial court erred in failing to serve notice of service of the judgment entry, (2) the trial court erred in dismissing his post-conviction petition as untimely, (3) the trial court erred in denying his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, fair trial and due process of law, and (4) the cumulative effect of those errors deprived him of his right to a fair trial.\nIn Neil II, this court found \"no abuse of discretion by the trial court in its determination the petition was untimely and that appellant failed to establish the applicability of a statutory exception that would permit the court to consider an untimely petition.\" Id. at \u00b6 23. This court thus concluded \"the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition for post-conviction relief and properly dismissed it.\" Id.\n\nOn August 1, 2018, appellant filed a successive petition for post-conviction relief. On August 28, 2018, the state filed an answer and motion to dismiss the petition.\n\nBy decision and entry filed December 7, 2018, the trial court denied appellant's petition to vacate or set aside his judgment of conviction or sentence. In its decision, the trial court found appellant's second petition for post-conviction relief to be untimely as to both case Nos. 12CR-5963 and 13CR-4174, and further found none of the exceptions for an untimely petition to be applicable.\n\nOn appeal, appellant, pro se, sets forth the following five assignments of error for this court's review:\n\n**Assignment of error one:** Appellant was deprived of his fundamental right to be free from illegal search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States and Ohio Constitution, where police officers did not obtain a search warrant supported by probable cause for appellant's cell-site location information, then misleadingly and falsely presented the CSLI in two other search warrants which also contained multiple omissions, misleading, and false statements, then presented at trial prejudicing and depriving appellant of a fair trial.\n\n**Assignment of error two:** Appellant was deprived of his fundamental right to due process and a fair trial in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States and Ohio Constitution, due to prosecutorial misconduct where the prosecutor submitted false testimony that he knew was false which clearly affected the judgment of the jury to convict appellant.\n\n**Assignment of error three:** Appellant was deprived of his fundamental right to a fair trial in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States and Ohio Constitution when trial counsel ineffectively deprived appellant from presenting evidence and subpoenaing witnesses in his favor.\nAssignment of error four: The cumulative effect of these errors deprived appellant of his fundamental right to fair trial in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States and Ohio Constitution.\n\nAssignment of error five: The trial court erred and abused its discretion when it denied appellant's 2953.23 petition denying appellant due process and a fair trial free from false statements from law enforcement and the prosecutor that went directly towards guilt.\n\n\u00b6 11 We initially address appellant's fifth assignment of error, in which he contends the trial court erred in finding inapplicable any of the exceptions to filing an untimely petition for post-conviction relief under R.C. 2953.23. More specifically, appellant argues the trial court erred in its determination that a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court, Carpenter v. United States, ___ U.S. ___, 138 S.Ct. 2206 (2018), did not apply retroactively to his case on collateral review.\n\n\u00b6 12 Under Ohio law, \"[a] postconviction proceeding is not an appeal of a criminal conviction, but, rather, a collateral civil attack on the judgment.\" State v. Steffen, 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410 (1994). An appellate court applies an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a trial court's denial of a petition for post-conviction relief. State v. Sowell, 10th Dist. No. 07AP-809, 2008-Ohio-1518, \u00b6 12, citing State v. Campbell, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-147, 2003-Ohio-6305.\n\n\u00b6 13 In accordance with R.C. 2953.21(A)(2), a petition for post-conviction relief \"shall be filed no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the date on which the trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals in the direct appeal of the judgment of conviction or adjudication.\" In the event no appeal is taken, \"except as otherwise provided in section 2953.23 of the Revised Code, the petition shall be filed no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the expiration of the time for filing the appeal.\" R.C. 2953.21(A)(2).\n\n\u00b6 14 Under Ohio law, \"a court may not entertain an untimely petition unless defendant initially demonstrates either (1) he was unavoidably prevented from discovering facts necessary for the claim for relief, or (2) the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons in defendant's situation.\" State v. Sidibeh, 10th Dist. No. 12AP-498, 2013-Ohio-2309, \u00b6 11, citing R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a). Further, if a defendant satisfies \"one of those two conditions, R.C.\n2953.23(A) requires he also must demonstrate that, but for the constitutional error at trial, no reasonable fact finder would have found him guilty of the offenses of which he was convicted.\" *Id.*, citing R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b).\n\n\u00b6 15 On appeal, appellant does not contend his successive petition was timely under R.C. 2953.21(A)(2). In addressing the issue of timeliness, the trial court noted the trial transcripts in appellant's direct appeal in case No. 12CR-5963 were filed February 2, 2015 and, therefore, appellant's petition \"should have been filed no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the filing of the trial transcript in the Court of Appeals, which is February 2, 2016.\" (Dec. 7, 2018 Dec. & Entry at 4.) Because the petition was not filed until August 1, 2018, the court found the petition to be untimely. We agree.\n\n\u00b6 16 With respect to case No. 13CR-4174, the court found the petition \"should have been filed no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the expiration of his time for filing his appeal, which was December 1, 2015.\" (Dec. 7, 2018 Dec. & Entry at 5.) As such, the court found the petition filed on August 1, 2018 to be untimely. Again, we agree with the trial court's determination.\n\n\u00b6 17 As noted, appellant does not challenge the trial court's finding that his petition was untimely. He argues, however, the United States Supreme Court has recognized a new federal and state right that applies to persons in his situation. Specifically, appellant relies on the United States Supreme Court's recent decision in *Carpenter*, in which the Supreme Court held the government's acquisition of cell-site location information (\"CSLI\") records constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment, thereby requiring a warrant in the absence of an exception such as exigent circumstances.\n\n\u00b6 18 Appellant similarly argued before the trial court that the Supreme Court's decision in *Carpenter* was applicable to his case and, therefore, constituted a timeliness exception under R.C. 2953.23. In addressing this issue, the trial court held that, because appellant's case \"was not on direct appeal when the Supreme Court issued its decision, the *Carpenter* case is not applicable to Defendant's case and may not be considered an exception for an untimely or successive petition.\" (Dec. 7, 2018 Dec. & Entry at 6.)\n\n\u00b6 19 In general, \"[a] new rule issued by the United States Supreme Court is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review unless the United States Supreme Court expressly holds it to be retroactive.\" *State v. Jackson*, 8th Dist. No. 2017-T-0041,\n2018-Ohio-2146, \u00b6 33, citing Tyler v. Cain, 533 U.S. 656, 663 (2001). As recently noted by one federal court, the Supreme Court \"did not explicitly state\" that Carpenter was retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. In re Baker, 11th Cir. No. 18-15095-C (Jan. 9, 2019).\n\n\u00b6 20 In accordance with its decision in Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), the United States Supreme Court has held that \"the retroactivity of our criminal procedure decisions turn on whether they are novel. When we announce a 'new rule,' a person whose conviction is already final may not benefit from the decision in a habeas or similar proceeding.\" Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. 342, 347 (2013). Rather, \"[o]nly when we apply a settled rule may a person avail herself of the decision on collateral review.\" Id. There are, however, \"two narrow exceptions\" to the rule in Teague. Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 486 (1990). Specifically, \"[a] new rule applies retroactively in a collateral proceeding only if (1) the rule is substantive or (2) the rule is a 'watershed rule of criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\" Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007), quoting Saffle at 495, quoting Teague at 311.\n\n\u00b6 21 Courts addressing the holding in Carpenter have held that the Supreme Court's decision \"states a new rule.\" United States v. Davis, D.C.M.D.Pa., No. 1:13-cr-28 (Apr. 12, 2019) (holding that \"[t]he Carpenter decision clearly carves out a new understanding of the Fourth Amendment, as it applies to wireless data,\" and that the Supreme Court \"did not merely apply prior case law to the facts before it,\" but rather \"stated a new principle on the type of conduct that constitutes a search\"); United States v. Williams, D.C.E.D.Mich. No. 2:17-cr-20758-VAR-DRG (Aug. 2, 2018) (holding that the Supreme Court in Carpenter \"announced a new rule that the Government obtaining CSLI constituted a search and can only be legally obtained with a search warrant,\" and therefore \"[g]oing forward, law enforcement * * * will need to demonstrate probable cause\").\n\n\u00b6 22 Courts have further held that \"[a]lthough Carpenter announced a new rule of law, the Supreme Court did not make the case retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\" United States v. Marquez, D.C.W.D.Ok., No. CR-12-233-R (Aug. 13, 2018). See also Davis (new rule stated in Carpenter does not apply retroactively on\ncollateral review; exceptions in *Teague* do not apply as \"the new rule is plainly procedural\" and \"simply does not rise\" to the level of a watershed rule of criminal procedure); *In re Symonett*, 11th Cir. No. 19-12232-F (July 9, 2019) (\"The Supreme Court *** has not held that *Carpenter* is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, nor does any combination of cases necessarily dictate its retroactivity.\"); *People v. Cutts*, 62 Misc.3d 411, 414 (N.Y.2018) (analyzing *Carpenter* under retroactivity principles of *Teague* and holding that \"defendants whose convictions became final prior to *Carpenter* cannot benefit from its holding\").\n\n{\u00b6 23} Based on the above authorities, which we find persuasive, we agree with the trial court\u2019s determination in this case that *Carpenter* does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding appellant did not meet the requirements of R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a) to bring an untimely petition for post-conviction relief. Because appellant did not meet the requirements of R.C. 2953.23, the trial court was without jurisdiction to consider the petition. *State v. Simms*, 8th Dist. No. 83583, 2004-Ohio-3955, \u00b6 22.\n\n{\u00b6 24} Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is not well-taken and is overruled.\n\n{\u00b6 25} In light of our disposition of the jurisdictional issue under the fifth assignment of error, the issues raised under appellant\u2019s first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error, all addressing the merits of the petition, are moot. See *State v. Dugger*, 10th Dist. No. 06AP-887, 2007-Ohio-1243, \u00b6 10.\n\n{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error is overruled, his first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error are rendered moot, and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed.\n\n*Judgment affirmed.*\n\nLUPER SCHUSTER and BRUNNER, JJ., concur."}

Ayinde Khamisi, Jelani \nKhamisi, Kimberly Khamisi, and Kaia Khamisi (collectivel y \u201cthe Khamisis\u201d) appeal \nconvictions for theft under former R.C. 2913.02(A)(3) and tampering with records \nunder R.C. 2913.42(A)(1).  Because they were tried toge ther and have filed nearly \nidentical briefs, we have su a sponte consolidated their a ppeals.  We affirm their \nconvictions. \nI.  Factual Background \n{\u00b62} Evidence presented at a jury trial showed that the Khamisis had \nengaged in schemes to steal real property from its rightful owners by filing \nfraudulent documents.  The Khamisis just ified their actions by claiming that the \nproperties were abandoned and that they were in the process of establishing \nownership through adverse possession. \nA.  3610 Washington Avenue \n{\u00b63} Property located at 3610 Washington Avenue was the former site of \nthe Zion Nursing Care Center.  Dr. William  Poole was the last remaining member of \nthe board of directors of th e nursing home and was attemp ting to sell the property.  \nDr. Poole had been devoted to the nursing home and had taken numerous actions to \nkeep it open.  He had taken a mortgage on the property in 2008, which was still valid \nat the time of trial.   \n{\u00b64} When Dr. Poole discovered \u201csquatters\u201d on the property, he called an \nattorney, Michael Gray.  According to Gray, Dr. Poole \u201cforgot to file a statement of \ncontinuation with the secretary of state\u201d which caused the organization, Zion OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 3 \nNursing Care Center, to go \u201cinactive.\u201d  Gray discovered that the Hamilton County \nauditor showed an entity that Dr. Poole did not recognize as the owner of the \nproperty.  Prior to trial, Dr . Poole passed away.  But both his son and Gray testified \nthat although the nursing home was closed and the building was vacant, the property \nhad never been abandoned. \n{\u00b65} The Khamisis created an entity with  a name similar to and using the \nsame address as the Zion Nursing Care Center by filing paperwork with the secretary \nof state.  Those documents were signed by Kimberly, Ayinde, and Jelani.  Jelani was \nnamed as the statutory agent.  They filed additional documents, including a quit-\nclaim deed, in the Hamilton County recorder\u2019s office that purported to transfer \nownership of the property to other entities they had created.  They also filed liens on \nthe property.  A representative of the Ohio attorney general\u2019s office testified that the \nKhamisis never registered these alleged charitable entities with the attorney general\u2019s \noffice.  \n{\u00b66} Detective Cynthia Alexander of the Cincinnati Police Department \nbegan investigating the Khamisis.  She dis covered several organizations that the \nKhamisis used in an attempt to gain cont rol of the property at 3610 Washington \nAvenue.  \n{\u00b67} Kimberly filed a quiet-title action against \u201cZion Nursing Home, Inc.\u201d \nand \u201cZion Care Center, Inc.\u201d alleging that she had rightful possession of the property.  \nThe trial court in that case determined that Kimberly and her associated entities had \nno interest in the property and ordered th e Hamilton County recorder\u2019s office to \nstrike the quit-claim deed. OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 4\nB.  215 Mitchell Avenue \n{\u00b68} Property at 215 Mitchell Avenue was owned by Ruby Red Services, \nLLC, a business incorporated by Melissa Meade.  Meade later died in a car accident, \nand the house was vacant.  Visio Mortgage Services held a mortgage on the property \nand began foreclosure proceedings. Claiming the property was abandoned, Jelani \noccupied the property.  Subsequently, he and Kimberly filed multiple documents \nasserting an interest in the property, including a quit-claim deed.  Several of the \ndocuments were filed after a court had refused to let them  intervene in the \nforeclosure proceedings. \nC.  453 Sheffield Road \n{\u00b69} The Anderson family owned property located at 453 Sheffield Road.  \nMarsha Anderson testified that it was her parents\u2019 house, in which she had been \nraised.  When her mother passed away, she left the property to Marsha and her \nsiblings.  Marsha moved out of the home in  2010, leaving it vacant, but continued to \nmake mortgage payments on the home.   \n{\u00b610} Claiming the property was abandoned, Jelani occupied the property.  \nIn 2017, he filed a quiet-title action na ming all the Anderson siblings as the \ndefendants.  A notice about the lawsuit was sent to Marsha\u2019s brother, Michael, who \nwas deceased, at the Sheffield Avenue address.  Jelani\u2019s complaint was dismissed \nwhen he failed to appear for trial. \n{\u00b611}  Marsha did not know about the action until Dete ctive Alexander \nnotified her about it.  She testified that the property was not abandoned and that the \nquiet-title action was hurtful because the pr operty had belonged to her parents, and \nshe and her sister had taken care of their parents there. OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 5\n{\u00b612} When he filed the quiet-title action, Jelani also filed an affidavit of \nindigency, in which he claimed had no inco me.  In reality, he was employed by \nStepping Stones, a nonprofit agency.   He earned $18,979 in 2015, $22,591 in 2016, \nand $22,574 in 2017. \nD.  533 Glenwood Avenue \n{\u00b613} Melissa Sherrod owned the property located at 533 Glenwood Avenue.  \nMelissa\u2019s husband, Shareef Sherrod, testified that he was a real estate broker and \ninvestor who bought and rehabbed vacant properties, mostly single-family homes.  \nThe properties were put in his wife\u2019s name because it was easier for her to get \nfinancing, but he was the one who operated the business.  He and his wife purchased \nthe property in 2011 with th e intent to renovate it an d  t h e n  r e n t  i t .   H e  h a d  \ncontractors come out to look at the proper ty for bids.  Shereef made sure that the \ngrass was cut every two to three weeks.  He secured the property with a lockbox, \nsealed the windows, and had a neighbor watch out for trespassers.   \n{\u00b614} Ayinde occupied the property, and filed a quiet-title action naming \nMelissa as a defendant, in which he contended that he had an interest in the \nproperty.  He also filed an affidavit of in digency.  Ayinde\u2019s complaint was eventually \ndismissed for want of prosecution. \n{\u00b615}  The Sherrods had no notice of the action.  They only learned of it \nwhen Detective Alexander contacted them.  Shareef hired an attorney and paid her \n$500.  He testified that he never gave anyone permission to take the property, and he \nhad not abandoned it.   He eventually sold the property and received the proceeds. OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 6\nE.  4945 Paddock Road  \n{\u00b616} Terrence Davis owned property located at 4945 Paddock Road.  Davis \nowned a construction company and bought the property to remodel either as a \ndaycare or \u201cliving units.\u201d  Th e property was vacant when he bought it.  He sealed it \nwith a steel door that could not be entered. \n{\u00b617} Davis had not yet started workin g on the property, but roofing \nmaterial had been delivered and was sitting on the roof, when he saw one man and \ntwo women walking about the property and looking in the windows.  Subsequently, \nhe began the process of cleaning out the property and putting on a new roof.   \n{\u00b618} Kaia filed a quiet-title action, naming  Davis as a defendant, along with \nan affidavit of indigency.  He  r e c e i v e d  n o t i c e  o f  t h e  a c t i o n  i n  h i s  p o s t - o f f i c e  b o x .   \nDavis hired an attorney and filed an answer.  His attorney made some phone calls \nand learned of the police\u2019s investigation into similar transa ctions.  He testified that \nno one had his consent to come onto the pr operty and that it was not abandoned.  \nKaia\u2019s complaint was eventually dismissed for want of prosecution. \nF.  200 Clinton Springs \n{\u00b619} Brenda Willis owned property locate d at 200 Clinton Springs, which \nused to be her parents\u2019 house.  On January 6, 2017, Kimberly filed a quiet-title action \nnaming as defendants Brenda and her husband, Charles Willis, although only \nBrenda\u2019s name was on the deed.  Kimberly also filed an affidavit of indigency.   \n{\u00b620} Brenda stated that her siblings were living in the house until January \n2018, and that none of the claims in Kimberly\u2019s complaint were true.  She and her \nhusband both filed answers, after which Kimberly dismissed her complaint.  Brenda OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 7\nalso stated that the property was not abandoned, and she had never given anyone \npermission to enter the property. \nG. 3944 Vine Street \n{\u00b621} Kimberly filed a quiet-title action for property located at 3944 Vine \nStreet, along with an affidavit of indige ncy. She claimed that the property was \nabandoned, and she was the possessor of the property.  Anchor Holdings, LLC, was \nthe property\u2019s owner.  The quiet-title action was dismissed because Kimberly never \nobtained service on Anchor Holdings.  Detective Alexander was unable to locate a \nrepresentative for the company. \nH.  1595 Summit Avenue \n{\u00b622} Michael West incorporated 4 Kennedy, LLC, a real estate business, to \nm a k e  m o n e y  t o  p a y  f o r  h i s  d a u g h t e r \u2019 s  c o l l e g e  t u i t i o n .   H e  b o u g h t  p r o p e r t y  a t  1 5 9 5  \nSummit Road in 2015 and began renovations.  Kimberly filed a quiet-title action \nalleging that the property was abandoned and that she had entered the property and \nclaimed title to it.   \n{\u00b623} West did not find out about the action until Dete ctive Alexander \ncontacted his wife.  He stated that he ha d not abandoned the pr operty and that he \nbelieved that \u201csomebody was trying to stea l [his] property.\u201d  The quiet-title action \nwas dismissed when Kimberly failed to show up for court.  Detective Alexander \nstated that at that time, Kimberly was aw are that the Cincinnati Police Department \nwas investigating the Khamisis. OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 8 \nI.  10508 Toulon Drive \n{\u00b624} James and Imogene Bronson had owned property at 10508 Toulon \nDrive.  The Bronsons passed away, and the survivor identified in the deed was \nMichelle Reed.  Wells Fargo Bank had initiated a foreclosure proceeding.  Kimberly \nfiled a quiet-title action against the Bronso ns, Reed, and Wells Fargo, along with an \naffidavit of indigency.  She claimed that the property was abandoned and that she \nwas in possession.  She also claimed that Wells Fargo did not have a valid mortgage.  \nThe case was dismissed for want of prosecution. \nJ.  The Convictions \n{\u00b625} Kimberly was convicted of three coun ts of tampering with records and \nthree counts of theft. She was sentenced to three years in prison.  Jelani was \nconvicted of three counts of tampering with  records and three coun ts of theft.  He \nwas sentenced to one year in prison.  Ayinde was convicted of two counts of \ntampering with records and tw o counts of theft.  He wa s sentenced to two years in \nprison.  Kaia was convicted of one count of tampering with records and one count of \ntheft.  She was sentenced to one year in prison.  These appeals followed. \nII.  Structural Error  \n{\u00b626} The Khamisis each present four identical assignments of error for \nreview.  In all of these assignments of error, they contend that the trial court \ncommitted structural error.  A structural error is a constitutional defect that affects \nthe framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than being an error in the trial \nprocess itself.  State v. Clinton, 153 Ohio St.3d 422, 2017-Ohio-9423, 108 N.E.3d 1, \u00b6 \n198; State v. Jones , 2018-Ohio-4754, 124 N.E.3d 439, \u00b6 19 (1st Dist.).  Because a OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 9\nstructural error is deemed prejudicial per se, it requires an automatic reversal.  State \nv. Davis, 127 Ohio St.3d 268, 2010-Ohio-5706, 939 N.E.2d 147, \u00b6 22; State v. Furr , \n1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170046, 2018-Ohio-2205, \u00b6 3.  Most constitutional errors \nare not structural, and structural errors have been recognized only in limited classes \nof cases.  State v. Perry , 101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, \u00b6 18; \nFurr at \u00b6 4; Jones at \u00b6 20.  \n{\u00b627} In determining whether an error is structural, the threshold inquiry is \nwhether the error involves deprivat ion of a constitutional right.  State v. Fisher , 99 \nOhio St.3d 127, 2003-Ohio-2761, 789 N.E.2d 222, \u00b6 18; Jones at \u00b6 21.  \u201c[T]he trial-\nerror/structural-error distinction is irreleva nt unless it is first established that \nconstitutional error has occurred.\u201d  Jones at \u00b6 21, quoting State v. Esparza, 74 Ohio \nSt.3d 660, 662, 660 N.E.2d 1194 (1996). \nIII.  Indictment \n{\u00b628}  In their first assignments of error,  the Khamisis contend that the trial \ncourt committed structural error \u201cby Crea ting a Fatal Variance  Between the Grand \nJury\u2019s Indictment and the Bill of Particulars and Evidence * * *.\u201d  They argue that the \nindictments failed to give them adequate no tice of the alleged criminal conduct with \nwhich they were charged, that they were not supported by sufficient facts, and that \nthey were falsely procured by the prosecutor.  These assignments of error are not \nwell taken.   \n{\u00b629} Under the United States and Ohio Constitutions, an individual accused \nof a felony is entitled to an indictment  setting forth the \u201cnature and cause of the \naccusation.\u201d  State v. Sellards, 17 Ohio St.3d 169, 170, 478 N.E.2d 781 (1985); State \nv. Lukacs, 188 Ohio App.3d 597, 2010-Ohio-2364, 936 N.E.2d 506, \u00b6 41 (1st Dist.).  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 10\nThe government must aver all material fact s constituting the essential elements of \nthe offense so that the accused has adequate  notice and an opportunity to defend.  \nSellards at 170; Lukacs at 41.  But the indictment need not contain a recitation of the \nevidence supporting the various facts.  Lukacs at \u00b6 41; State v. Gingell , 7 Ohio \nApp.3d 364, 366, 455 N.E.2d 1066 (1st Dist.1982).  Generally, the requirements of an \nindictment may be met by reciting the language of the criminal statute.  State v. \nChilds, 88 Ohio St.3d 194, 199, 724 N.E.2d 781 (2000). \n{\u00b630} In this case, the indictments tracke d the language of the applicable \nstatutes.  Therefore, the Khamisis can demonstrate no error.  See State v. Skatzes , \n104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio- 6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 26; State v. Murphy , 65 \nOhio St.3d 554, 583, 605 N.E2d 884 (1992).     \n{\u00b631} Fu r the r , e a ch of  the Kha mis is  wa s s u ppl ie d with a  bil l of  par ticu l a rs .  \nThe accused can obtain more specific detail s by requesting a bill of particulars as \nprovided in Crim.R. 7(E).  But the bill of  particulars need not provide the accused \nwith specifications of the evidence or serve as a substitute for discovery.  Sellards at \n171; Lukacs at \u00b6 43; Gingell at 367.  The indictments and the bills of particulars \ntogether were sufficient to  apprise the Khamisis of the charges against them.  \nTherefore, they did not give rise to any error, much less structural error.  See State v. \nRoberts, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-040575 and C-050005, 2005-Ohio-4848, \u00b6 9, \nreversed on other grounds , I n  r e  C r i m i n a l  S e n t e n c i n g  S t a t u t e s  C a s e s, 109 Ohio \nSt.3d 313, 2006-Ohio-2109, 817 N.E.2d 1174.   \n{\u00b632} The Khamisis claimed throughout tria l that they had no notice of the \noffenses with which they were charged.  The record shows that they were provided \nwith discovery, and that their claims that they  had no notice were trial tactics.  They \nwere well aware of the factual basis of the charges against them.  They took great OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 11\noffense that the bill of particulars described them as \u201csquatters,\u201d and they argue that \nsquatting is not necessarily illegal.  The purpose of the bill of particulars is to provide \nnotice.   The use of the word is not improper, but even if it were, its use did not affect \nthe validity of the notice. \n{\u00b633} The Khamisis also argue that the indictments were not supported by \nsufficient and credible evidence.  The grand jury, in inquiring into crimes and \noffenses returning indictments, does not exercise a judic ial function.  An indictment \nand subsequent proceedings based on that indictment are not rendered invalid on \nthe ground that illegal and incompetent testimony was heard by the grand jury.  \nVillasino v. Maxwell , 174 Ohio St. 483, 484-485, 190 N.E.2d 265 (1963); State v. \nCunningham, 1st Dist. Warren No. 54, 1975 WL 181079, *4 (Dec. 29, 1975); Wickline \nv. Alvis, 103 Ohio App. 1, 9-10, 144 N.E.2d 207 (10th Dist.1957).   \n{\u00b634} Thus, an indictment valid on its face  is not subject to challenge on the \nground that the grand jury acted on the basis of inadequate or incompetent evidence.  \nUnited States v. Calandra , 414 U.S. 338, 344-345, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 \n(1974); State v. Blalock , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 80419 and 80420, 2002-Ohio-\n4580, \u00b6 24.  \u201cAn indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand \njury, like an information drawn by a prosecut or, if valid on its face, is enough to call \nfor the trial of the charge on the merits.\u201d  Villasino at 485; Blalock at \u00b6 24.   \n{\u00b635} In this case, the indictments were valid on their faces.  Therefore, the \nKhamisis cannot challenge the evidence supporting the indictments.  It appears they \nare actually trying to challenge the weight and sufficiency of the evidence at trial, but \nthey have not raised assignments of error to that effect.  Because they failed to raise \nassignments of error challenging the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, we need OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 12\nnot address those issues.  See State v. Harris, 2017-Ohio-5594, 92 N.E.3d 1283, \u00b6 43 \n(1st Dist.). \n{\u00b636} Finally, under these assignments of error, the Khamisis argue that \ntheir not-guilty pleas were entered against their wishes.  Crim.R. 11(A) provides that \nif a defendant refuses to plead, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty on behalf of \nthe defendant.  A not-guilty plea does not admit any facts and does not waive any of \nthe defendant\u2019s rights, inclu ding the right to have the prosecution prove its case \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.  State v. Schaeffer, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA92-04-038, \n1993 WL 106146, *1 (Apr. 12, 1993).  Because the Khamisis refused to enter pleas, the \ncourt could do so on their behalf and they were not prejudiced by the application of \nthis rule.  See Cleveland Metroparks v. Sferra, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106341, 2018-\nOhio-3169, \u00b6 22.  Consequently, we overrule the Khamisis\u2019 first assignments of error. \nIV.  Self-Representation \n{\u00b637} In their second assignments of error, the Khamisis argue that the court \ncommitted structural error by denying them the right to represent themselves.  Both \nthe United States Supreme Court and the Ohio Supreme Court have recognized a \ncriminal defendant\u2019s right to  represent himself or herself at trial without counsel \nwhen the defendant knowingl y, intelligently, and voluntarily chooses to waive \ncounsel.  See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 819-820, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d \n562 (1975); State v. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-O hio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, \u00b6 \n23-24; Furr, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170046, 2018-Ohio-2205, at \u00b6 6.  The right to \nrepresent oneself is \u201cthwarted when counsel is forced upon an unwilling defendant, \nwho alone bears the risks of a potential conviction.\u201d  State v. Obermiller , 147 Ohio OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 13\nSt.3d 175, 2016-Ohio-1594, 63 N.E.3d 93, \u00b6 26.  The denial of the right to self-\nrepresentation has been found to be structural error.  Furr at \u00b6 4. \n{\u00b638} The record does not show that the Khamisis were denied their rights to \nrepresent themselves.  Originally, the trial court had recognized their rights to \nrepresent themselves and had advised them it was bad idea.  Subsequently, the \nKhamisis refused to sign written waivers of counsel, although they had indicated that \nthey wished to represent themselves.  The trial court, believing that a written waiver \nwas required, told them they would be appointed lawyers. \n{\u00b639} Crim.R. 44 governs the procedure for waiver of counsel in \u201cserious \noffense\u201d cases.  A \u201cserious offense\u201d in cludes any felony.  Crim.R. 2(C).  Under \nCrim.R. 44(A), when a defendant is unable  to obtain counsel, counsel must be \nassigned to represent the defendant in all stages of the proceedings, unless the \ndefendant, after being fully advised of his right to counsel, knowingly, intelligently, \nand voluntarily waives his right to counsel.  Furr at \u00b6 7.  The waiver must be made in \nopen court and must be in writing.  Crim.R. 44(C).   \n{\u00b640} But, the written waiver is  not constitutionally required, so a trial court \nneeds only to substantially comply with Crim.R. 44.   Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, \n2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, at \u00b6 38; Furr, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170046, \n2018-Ohio-2205, at \u00b6 8.  A court substant ially complies with Crim.R. 44 when it \nmakes a sufficient inquiry to determine whether the defendant fully understands and \nintelligently relinquishes the right to counsel.  Martin at \u00b6 39; Furr at \u00b6 8. \n{\u00b641} At the next hearing, the trial court stated that it had made a mistake \nbecause only substantial compliance with Crim.R. 44 was required.  It then informed \nthe Khamisis of the nature of the charges, the range of allowable punishments, \npossible defenses to the charges and \u201cthe other facts essential to a broad OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 14 \nunderstanding of the whole matter.\u201d  See State v. Gibson , 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 377, \n345 N.E.2d 399 (1976); Furr at \u00b6 9.  It also explained the disadvantages of self-\nrepresentation and that th ey would be required to follow the same rules and \nprocedures that normally govern the conduct of a trial.  See Furr  at \u00b6 9; State v. \nMurphy, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170390, 2018-Ohio-1063, \u00b6 6.  The court then \ndetermined that they knowingl y, intelligently and voluntar ily waived their rights to \ncounsel.   \n{\u00b642} The Khamisis then represented themselves throughout the trial.  Many \nof the issues of which they now complain were the result of their inexperience and \nlack of counsel.  A defendant who elects to represent himself cannot complain about \nthe quality of his own defense.  Faretta, 422 U.S. at 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d \n562, fn. 46.  \n{\u00b643} One of the Khamisis\u2019 complaints in volves an order the trial court \njournalized early in the proceedings.  The court ordered the clerk of courts to remove \nthe case completely from display on the clerk\u2019s website.  It also stated that all parties \nhad to seek leave of court before obtaining copies of an y filings in the case.  The \nrecord shows that the court made that or der because the Khamisis had attempted to \nevade arrest, and they were not all arrested at the same time.   \n{\u00b644} The case was later assigned to a visiting judge.  When the Khamisis \nargued that the order prevented them from defending themselves, the court said that \n\u201cmy interpretation was that some documents were being attempted to be filed in this \ncase while one or more of you had an ou tstanding warrant; that was the rationale \nthat I thought for the issuance  of that order.\u201d The court ag reed to rescind the order, \nwhich was vacated less than four months after it was journalized.   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 15\n{\u00b645} The court also offered to grant a co ntinuance.  The Khamisis initially \nrefused and argued about the alleged lack of  notice and jurisdiction.  After a lot of \nback-and-forth, the court granted a continua nce.  In fact, the court went to great \nlengths to ensure that the Kh amisis received transcripts of the various hearings and \nhad access to the internet at the jail.  Thus, they were not prevented from preparing a \ndefense. \n{\u00b646} Next, the Khamisis argue that because they represented themselves \nthey were forced to appear in front of the jury in jail garb.  Courts have recognized \nthat a defendant may be prejudiced by appearing in jail clothing, but a defendant \nmay purposefully elect, as a matter of trial strategy, to stand trial in that attire.  See \nEstelle v. Williams , 425 U.S. 501, 504-505, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976); \nState v. Gandy, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-050804, 2006-Ohio-6282, \u00b6 4.  There is no \nrule requiring all convictions in which th e defendant has worn jail clothing be \noverturned.  Instead, the inquiry focuses on whether the accused\u2019s appearance before \nthe jury was compelled.  Gandy at \u00b6 4. \n{\u00b647} The Khamisis raised the issue about the same time that they were \narguing about the order removing the case from the clerk of court\u2019s website, which \ndid not allow the parties to fi le any documents at that time without leave of court.  \nKaia said that she had asked her caseworker  about wearing regular clothing, and the \ncaseworker had said they could not \u201cdo an ything\u201d without an order from the trial \ncourt.  The trial court stated, \u201cSee, this is one of the major disadvantages you have by \nnot having an attorney, because the atto rney would immediately ask that you be \npermitted to wear civilian clothes.\u201d  Then a public defender who was involved in the \ncase said that his office had a bank of clothes and \u201cwe can try to get them in civilian \nclothes if they are interested.\u201d  They all said they were not interested.   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 16 \n{\u00b648} Thus, they were not compelled to appear before the jury in jail \nclothing.  They chose to do so.  Further, the court said that it would instruct the jury \nthat it should not hold the fact that they were wearing prison garb against them.  The \nKhamisis said they didn\u2019t want the instruction as they were preparing their own jury \ninstructions.   \n{\u00b649} The Khamisis further argue that the prosecutor addressed the issue \neven though he was instructed not to, which is untrue.  Moreover, the prosecutor \nmerely told the potential jurors during voir  dire that \u201c[t]he State and the Court have \nalso offered these defendants [the] right to not appear in jail garb as well; that was \ntheir choice to do that, and you will not hold that against them, will you?\u201d  Therefore, \nthe Khamisis were not prejudiced.   \n{\u00b650} Next, the Khamisis argue that their family member, Kijai, was denied \nthe right to advise them and to file documents on their behalf.  They also argue that \nshe was imprisoned for three days without probable cause.  The record shows that \nthe trial court found her in contempt for giggling and laughing in the court room and \ninterrupting the court.  Noth ing in the record shows that that finding of contempt \nwas improper.  Moreover, the Khamisis lacked standing to raise the issue of the \nvalidity of that contempt finding.  Liti gants may assert their own rights, not the \nrights of third parties.  Util. Serv. Partners, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm. , 124 Ohio St.3d \n284, 2009-Ohio-6764, 921 N.E.3d 1038, \u00b6 49; In re K.C., 2017-Ohio-8383, 99 N.E.3d \n1061, \u00b6 5 (1st Dist.). \n{\u00b651} Further, while the Khamisis had th e right to repres ent themselves, \nthey did not have the right to have a nona t t o r n e y  a d v i s e  t h e m  o r  f i l e  a n y t h i n g  o n  \ntheir behalf.  Only a licensed attorney may file pleadings on behalf of another in OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 17 \nc o u r t .   R . C .  4 7 0 5 . o 1 ;  State ex rel. Army of Twelve Monkeys v.

Ct. of \nCommon Pleas, 156 Ohio St.3d 346, 2019-Ohio-901, 126 N.E.3d 1113, \u00b6 5. \n{\u00b652} Finally, the Khamisis make numerous references to excessive bail. \nH a b e a s  c o r p u s  i s  t h e  p r o p e r  r e m e d y  t o  r a i s e  a  c l a i m  o f  e x c e s s i v e  b a i l  i n  p r e t r i a l -\nrelease cases.

After conviction, any \nerror concerning pretrial bail is moot, and the issue cannot be raised on direct \nappeal.  State v. Knisley , 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22897, 2010-Ohio-116, \u00b6 25; \nTowns at \u00b6 20. Consequently, we overrule the Khamisis\u2019 second assignments of \nerror. \nV.  Impartial Judge/Jurisdiction \n{\u00b653} In their third assignments of error,  the Khamisis argue that the trial \ncourt committed structural error by denying th eir right to an impartial judge.   They \nargue that the trial court was biased agains t them, ignored jurisdiction, denied their \nright to represent themselves, set excessive bail, and misstated the law and the facts.  \nThese assignments of error are not well taken. \n{\u00b654} First, as a general rule, a direct appeal is not the proper place to raise \nan argument that the trial judge was biased.  The proper avenue for redress when a \nparty believes that a trial judge is biased is the filing of an affidavit of bias and \nprejudice with the Supreme Court of Ohio as provided for in R.C. 2701.03.  Gandy, \n1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-05 0804, 2006-Ohio-6282, at \u00b6 22.  The Khamisis filed \naffidavits of bias and prejudice against the original trial ju dge, which the Ohio \nSupreme Court denied.   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 18\n{\u00b655} But even if we address the merits of the issue, the Khamisis\u2019 arguments \nstill fail.  A trial before a judge who is no t impartial results in structural error that \nwould require reversal without a harmless-error analysis.  State v. Sanders, 92 Ohio \nSt.3d 245, 278, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001); State v. Buck , 2017-Ohio-8242, 100 N.E.3d \n118, \u00b6 82 (1st Dist.).  The Ohio Supreme Court has described judicial bias as \u201ca hostile \nfeeling or spirit of ill will or undue frie ndship or favoritism toward one of the \nlitigants or his attorney, with the formatio n of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the \npart of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be \ngoverned by the law and facts.\u201d  Buck at \u00b6 83, quoting State ex rel. Pratt v. \nWeygandt, 164 Ohio St. 463, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956), paragraph four of the syllabus.   \n{\u00b656} A trial court is presumed to be fair and impartial.  In re \nDisqualification of Kilpatrick , 47 Ohio St.3d 605, 606, 546 N.E.2d 929 (1989); \nGandy at \u00b6 23.  The Khamisis have failed to  overcome this pres umption relating to \nthe original trial judge or the visiting judge.  The judges\u2019 failure to provide the relief \nto which the Khamisis believe they were entitled does not establish actual bias.  See \nState v. Jackson, 149 Ohio St.3d 55, 2016-Ohio-5488, 73 N.E.3d 414, \u00b6 40.  Further, \nthe fact that the Khamisis had filed litigati on against the judges or that the judges \nhad presided over the civil quiet-title action s, without more, does not establish bias.  \nSee In re Disqualification of Pokorny , 135 Ohio St.3d 1268, 2013-Ohio-915, 986 \nN.E.2d 993, \u00b6 4; In re Disqualification of Bryant , 117 Ohio St.3d 1251, 2006-Ohio-\n7227, 885 N.E.2d 246, \u00b6 4.   \n{\u00b657} The Khamisis argue that both judg es ignored their motions.  Both \njudges simply refused to reconsider the same motions they had already ruled on that \nthe Khamisis continued to ra i s e  t i m e  a n d  a g a i n .   W h e n  a  c o u r t  f a i l s  t o  r u l e  o n  a  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 19 \npending motion, we presume that th e court elected to overrule it.  State v. Smith, 1st \nDist. Hamilton Nos. C-180439 and C-180604, 2019-Ohio-5350, \u00b6 13. \n{\u00b658} Next, the Khamisis contend that th e visiting judge imposed his own \nmorality upon the proceedings.  The remarks about which they complain occurred at \nthe sentencing hearing where the judge asked how they could morally justify taking \nother people\u2019s property.  This is a proper consideration at sentencing.  See State v. \nArnett, 88 Ohio St.3d 208, 221-222, 724 N.E.2d 302 (2000); State v. Brown , 11th \nDist. Geauga No. 2003-G-2504, 2004-Ohio-1843, \u00b6 35; State v. Golson , 2d Dist. \nMontgomery No. 17707, 2001 WL 227372, *7 (Mar. 9, 2001). \n{\u00b659} The Khamisis argue that even though the visiting judge tried the case, \nthey were prejudiced because the bailiff was the original trial judge\u2019s sister, which \nthey did not learn until after trial.  Much of this argument involves matters outside \nthe record on appeal, which we cannot consider.  See State v. Ishmail, 54 Ohio St.2d \n402, 405-406, 377 N.E.2d 500 (1978);  State v. Dieterle , 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-\n070796, 2009-Ohio-1888, \u00b6 49.  Nothing in the record shows that the bailiff \ninfluenced the jury or acted in a way to deny the Khamisis a fair trial.  \n{\u00b660} Finally, the Khamisis argue that bo th judges ignored their lack of \njurisdiction, which was actually the cr ux of their argume nts throughout the \nproceedings.  They fail to understand th e nature of subject-matter jurisdiction.  \nSubject-matter jurisdiction involves a court\u2019s power to hear a case.  State v. Mbodj , \n129 Ohio St.3d 325, 2011-Ohio-2880, 951 N.E.2d 1025, \u00b6 10.   \n{\u00b661} Section 4(B), Article IV of the Ohio  Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he \ncourts of common pleas and divisions thereof shall have such original jurisdiction \nover all justiciable matters and such powers of review of proceedings as may be \nprovided by law.\u201d  R.C. 2931.03 provides that jurisdiction over all crimes and OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 20\noffenses is vested in the court of common pleas, general division, unless jurisdiction \nis specifically and exclusivel y vested in other divisions of the court or in the lower \ncourts.  State ex rel. McMinn v. Whitfield, 27 Ohio St.3d 4, 5, 500 N.E.2d 875 (1986).  \nMoreover, \u201c[a]bsent a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court with \ngeneral subject-matter jurisdiction may determine its own jurisdiction.\u201d  State ex rel. \nBrown v. Luebbers , 137 Ohio St.3d 542, 2013-Ohio-5062, 1 N.E.3d 395, \u00b6 12.  The \ncourt had jurisdiction to hear the case, an d the fact that it did not agree with the \nKhamisis\u2019 arguments does not mean that the court lacked jurisdiction. \n{\u00b662} In sum, nothing in the record show s that the trial court violated its \nduty of impartiality or behaved in a way that  deprived the Khamisis of a fair trial.  \nSee State v. Brewster, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-030024 and C-030025, 2004-Ohio-\n2993, \u00b6 68-69; State v. Johnson, 140 Ohio App.3d 385, 391-392, 747 N.E.2d 863 (1st \nDist.2000).  Consequently, we overrule the Khamisis\u2019 third assignments of error. \nV.  Public Trial/Jury Issues \n{\u00b663} In their fourth assignments of erro r, the Khamisis contend that the \ntrial court committed structural error by denyin g their rights to a public trial, a jury \nof  the ir  pe er s , a nd a  f air  tr ial .  T hey  a rgue that the trial court ignored jurisdiction, \ndenied them their rights to represent themselves, set excessive bail, misstated the \nlaw and facts, and failed to be impartial.  These assignments of error are not well \ntaken.  \n{\u00b664} Some of arguments the Khamisis make under these assignments of \nerror are a rehash of arguments we have already rejected.  As to the right to a public \ntrial, the United States and Ohio Constitu tions guarantee an a ccused the right to a \npublic trial.  Waller v. Georgia , 467 U.S. 39, 46, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 21\n(1984); State v. Wilks , 154 Ohio St.3d 359, 2018-Ohio- 1562, 114 N.E.2d 1092, \u00b6 64.  \nThe violation of the right to a public tria l is considered structural error and not \nsubject to the harmless-error analysis.  Waller at 49-50; State v. Drummond , 111 \nOhio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.3d 1038, \u00b6 50.   \n{\u00b665} The right to a public trial is not absolute, and in some instances, must \nyield to other interests.  The trial court ha s broad discretion to exercise control over \nthe proceedings.  The court may order the exclusion of spectators as long as it does \nnot inappropriately deny the defend ant\u2019s right to a public trial.  Drummond at \u00b6 51; \nState v. Curtis, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150174, 2016-Ohio-1318, \u00b6 17.   \n{\u00b666} The record does not show that th e trial court closed the courtroom. \nPrior to voir dire, the Khamisis claimed th at they were told that nobody, with the \nexception of Kimberly\u2019s mother and her \u201ccounselor,\u201d would be able to attend.  The \ntrial court indicated that it had concerns about the lack of space for potential jurors.  \nIt stated that \u201c[w]ell, that was for purposes of voir dire, and that\u2019s just a matter of \nwe\u2019ve got no place to put anybody.\u201d  It went on, \u201cI have no problem with anybody \nbeing in here as long as they don\u2019t pose a security risk.  * * *  I don\u2019t care if you fill up \nwith your community or other people or the general public.\u201d \n{\u00b667} The Khamisis complained that \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t relayed that way\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s \ntoo late, because it\u2019s now the jury selection process and my community is not here \nthat\u2019s too late for that one. \u201d  The court replied that \u201cas soon as we get the jury, \nhopefully one of your people can let the community know that they\u2019re welcome to be \nhere.\u201d   \n{\u00b668} Federal courts have held that excl usion of a defendant\u2019s friends or \nfamily members because of a lack of space does not deprive the defendant of the \nright to a public trial.  See Bunn v. Lopez , E.D.Cal. No. 2:11-cv-1373, 2016 WL OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 22 \n4010038, 8-9 (July 26, 2016): Benabe v. United States , 68 F.Supp. 858, 867-868 \n(N.D.Ill.2014).  Moreover, the record is inconclusive as to whether any one was \nactually excluded from the courtroom at any time.  We cannot hold, without more, \nthat the Khamisis were denied the right to a public trial.  See State v Williams , 9th \nDist. Summit No. 26014, 2012-Ohio-5873, \u00b6 10.   \n{\u00b669} Next, the Khamisis argue that they were denied a jury of their peers \nbecause none of the jurors were aware of the doctrine of adverse possession.  A jury \nof one\u2019s peers means a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.  \nTaylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 527, 95 S.Ct. 692, 42 L.Ed.2d 690 (1975); State v. \nSeymour, 5th Dist. Richland No. 03-CA-37, 2004-Ohio-3835, \u00b6 53.  A defendant is \nentitled to a qualified panel of citizens \u201cs elected by the best method that thoughtful \nmen, who are cognizant of the practicalities  of selection and the inherent problems \ninvolved, have been able to develop.\u201d  State v. McCarter , 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-\n830823, 1984 WL 6715, *2 (July 25, 1984), quoting State v. Strodes , 48 Ohio St.2d \n113, 115, 357 N.E.2d 375 (1976), vacated on other grounds , 438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. \n3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1978).    \n{\u00b670} To establish a violation of this requirement, the defendant must prove, \namong other things, that the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the \ncommunity.  State v. Fulton , 57 Ohio St.3d 120, 566 N.E.2d 1195 (1991), paragraph \ntwo of the syllabus;  State v. Ford , 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014CA00145, 2015-Ohio-\n4093, \u00b6 19.  People aware of adverse possession are not a distinctive group in the \ncommunity.  A criminal defendant has no affirmative right to a jury of a particular \nracial, gender or age composition, much less one aware of certain legal doctrines.  \nSee Seymour at \u00b6 54. Thus, the Khamisis have to failed show that they were not tried \nby a jury of their peers.   OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 23\n{\u00b671} Finally, the Khamisis argue that they were denied a fair trial because \nthe jury was not instructed on the issue of adverse possession.  The trial court must \nfully and completely give all jury instructions that are relevant and necessary for the \njury to weigh the evidence and to discharge its duty as the trier of fact.  State v. \nComen, 50 Ohio St.3d 206, 553 N.E.2d 640 (1990), paragraph two of the syllabus; \nState v. Robinson , 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-060434 , 2007-Ohio-2388, \u00b6 18.  A trial \ncourt must give a defendant\u2019s requested inst ructions to the jury if they are correct, \npertinent statements of law and are appropriate under the facts of the case.  State v. \nLessin, 67 Ohio St.3d 487, 493, 620 N.E.2d 72 (1993); Brewster, 1st Dist. Hamilton \nNos. C-030024 and C-030025, 2004-Ohio-2993, at \u00b6 58.   \n{\u00b672} The Khamisis\u2019 defense at trial was that the properties were abandoned \nand they were in the process of establishing adverse possession of the properties.  \nThe trial court instructed the jury regarding whether property was abandoned, but \nrefused to give an instruction on adverse possession because the evidence did not \nwarrant it.  We agree with the trial court\u2019s decision. \n{\u00b673} Adverse possession is disfavored in the law, as it is in contravention of \nthe ideals set forth in the Constitution protecting life, liberty and property.  Houck v. \nBd. of Park Commrs. of the Huron Cty. Park Dist. , 116 Ohio St.3d 148, 2007-Ohio-\n5586, 876 N.E.2d 1210, \u00b6 29; Grace v. Koch, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-950802, 1996 \nWL 577843, *2-3 (Oct. 9, 1996), affirmed, 81 Ohio St.3d 577, 692 N.E.2d 1009 \n(1998).  Title is strictly construed in favor of the person holding legal title and against \nthe adverse claimant.  Grace at *3.  \n{\u00b674} A person seeking to establish adverse possession must show exclusive \npossession that is open, notorious, continuous, and adverse for 21 years.  Evanich v. \nBridge, 119 Ohio St.3d 260, 2008-Ohio-3820, 893 N.E.2d 481, \u00b6 7; Grace at *3.  The OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS  \n 24\nKhamisis, by their own admission, had not been in possession of any of the \nproperties for 21 years.  Therefore, an instruction on adverse possession was not \nsupported by the evidence. \n{\u00b675} Despite their attempts to justify thei r conduct, the record is clear that \nthey were never anything but trespassers an d had no legal interest  in the properties \na t  a l l .   T h e y  c a n n o t  s h o w  t h a t  t h e y  w e r e entitled to the properties by adverse \npossession.  \u201cA claim for continuing trespa ss may be brought at any time until the \nclaim has ripened into a presumptive right by adverse possession, which takes 21 \nyears.\u201d  Reith v. McGill Smith Punshon, Inc., 163 Ohio App.3d 709, 2005-Ohio-4852, \n840 N.E.2d 226, \u00b6 50 (1st Dist.).   \n{\u00b676} Simply put, attempting to establish adverse possession is not a defense \nto a charge of theft or tampering with reco rds.  The trial court did not err in refusing \nto instruct the jury on adverse possession.  The Khamisis were not denied their rights \nto a fair trial, and we overrule their fourth assignments of error. \nVI.  Summary \n{\u00b677} In sum, we find no merit in any of the Khamisis\u2019 assignments of error.  \nThey have not demonstrated that the tria l court committed reversible error, much \nless structural error.  Therefore, we overru le all of their assignments of error, and we \naffirm the trial court\u2019s judgments. \nJudgments affirmed. \n \nMOCK , P.J.,  and CROUSE , J.,  concur.   \n \nPlease note: \n The court has recorded its own entry this date.

Ayinde Khamisi, pro se,\n\nJelani Khamisi, pro se,\n\nKimberly Khamisi, pro se,\n\nKaia Khamisi, pro se.\nDefendants-appellants Ayinde Khamsi, a.k.a. Ayinde Khamisi, Jelani Khamisi, Kimberly Khamisi, and Kaia Khamisi (collectively \u201cthe Khamisis\u201d) appeal convictions for theft under former R.C. 2913.02(A)(3) and tampering with records under R.C. 2913.42(A)(1). Because they were tried together and have filed nearly identical briefs, we have sua sponte consolidated their appeals. We affirm their convictions.\n\nI. Factual Background\n\nEvidence presented at a jury trial showed that the Khamisis had engaged in schemes to steal real property from its rightful owners by filing fraudulent documents. The Khamisis justified their actions by claiming that the properties were abandoned and that they were in the process of establishing ownership through adverse possession.\n\nA. 3610 Washington Avenue\n\nProperty located at 3610 Washington Avenue was the former site of the Zion Nursing Care Center. Dr. William Poole was the last remaining member of the board of directors of the nursing home and was attempting to sell the property. Dr. Poole had been devoted to the nursing home and had taken numerous actions to keep it open. He had taken a mortgage on the property in 2008, which was still valid at the time of trial.\n\nWhen Dr. Poole discovered \u201csquatters\u201d on the property, he called an attorney, Michael Gray. According to Gray, Dr. Poole \u201cforgot to file a statement of continuation with the secretary of state\u201d which caused the organization, Zion\nNursing Care Center, to go \u201cinactive.\u201d Gray discovered that the Hamilton County auditor showed an entity that Dr. Poole did not recognize as the owner of the property. Prior to trial, Dr. Poole passed away. But both his son and Gray testified that although the nursing home was closed and the building was vacant, the property had never been abandoned.\n\n{\u00b65} The Khamisis created an entity with a name similar to and using the same address as the Zion Nursing Care Center by filing paperwork with the secretary of state. Those documents were signed by Kimberly, Ayinde, and Jelani. Jelani was named as the statutory agent. They filed additional documents, including a quit-claim deed, in the Hamilton County recorder\u2019s office that purported to transfer ownership of the property to other entities they had created. They also filed liens on the property. A representative of the Ohio attorney general\u2019s office testified that the Khamisis never registered these alleged charitable entities with the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\n{\u00b66} Detective Cynthia Alexander of the Cincinnati Police Department began investigating the Khamisis. She discovered several organizations that the Khamisis used in an attempt to gain control of the property at 3610 Washington Avenue.\n\n{\u00b67} Kimberly filed a quiet-title action against \u201cZion Nursing Home, Inc.\u201d and \u201cZion Care Center, Inc.\u201d alleging that she had rightful possession of the property. The trial court in that case determined that Kimberly and her associated entities had no interest in the property and ordered the Hamilton County recorder\u2019s office to strike the quit-claim deed.\nB. 215 Mitchell Avenue\n\nProperty at 215 Mitchell Avenue was owned by Ruby Red Services, LLC, a business incorporated by Melissa Meade. Meade later died in a car accident, and the house was vacant. Visio Mortgage Services held a mortgage on the property and began foreclosure proceedings. Claiming the property was abandoned, Jelani occupied the property. Subsequently, he and Kimberly filed multiple documents asserting an interest in the property, including a quit-claim deed. Several of the documents were filed after a court had refused to let them intervene in the foreclosure proceedings.\n\nC. 453 Sheffield Road\n\nThe Anderson family owned property located at 453 Sheffield Road. Marsha Anderson testified that it was her parents\u2019 house, in which she had been raised. When her mother passed away, she left the property to Marsha and her siblings. Marsha moved out of the home in 2010, leaving it vacant, but continued to make mortgage payments on the home.\n\nClaiming the property was abandoned, Jelani occupied the property. In 2017, he filed a quiet-title action naming all the Anderson siblings as the defendants. A notice about the lawsuit was sent to Marsha\u2019s brother, Michael, who was deceased, at the Sheffield Avenue address. Jelani\u2019s complaint was dismissed when he failed to appear for trial.\n\nMarsha did not know about the action until Detective Alexander notified her about it. She testified that the property was not abandoned and that the quiet-title action was hurtful because the property had belonged to her parents, and she and her sister had taken care of their parents there.\nWhen he filed the quiet-title action, Jelani also filed an affidavit of indigency, in which he claimed had no income. In reality, he was employed by Stepping Stones, a nonprofit agency. He earned $18,979 in 2015, $22,591 in 2016, and $22,574 in 2017.\n\nD. 533 Glenwood Avenue\n\nMelissa Sherrod owned the property located at 533 Glenwood Avenue. Melissa's husband, Shareef Sherrod, testified that he was a real estate broker and investor who bought and rehabbed vacant properties, mostly single-family homes. The properties were put in his wife's name because it was easier for her to get financing, but he was the one who operated the business. He and his wife purchased the property in 2011 with the intent to renovate it and then rent it. He had contractors come out to look at the property for bids. Shereef made sure that the grass was cut every two to three weeks. He secured the property with a lockbox, sealed the windows, and had a neighbor watch out for trespassers.\n\nAyinde occupied the property, and filed a quiet-title action naming Melissa as a defendant, in which he contended that he had an interest in the property. He also filed an affidavit of indigency. Ayinde's complaint was eventually dismissed for want of prosecution.\n\nThe Sherrods had no notice of the action. They only learned of it when Detective Alexander contacted them. Shareef hired an attorney and paid her $500. He testified that he never gave anyone permission to take the property, and he had not abandoned it. He eventually sold the property and received the proceeds.\nE. 4945 Paddock Road\n\n{\u00b616} Terrence Davis owned property located at 4945 Paddock Road. Davis owned a construction company and bought the property to remodel either as a daycare or \u201cliving units.\u201d The property was vacant when he bought it. He sealed it with a steel door that could not be entered.\n\n{\u00b617} Davis had not yet started working on the property, but roofing material had been delivered and was sitting on the roof, when he saw one man and two women walking about the property and looking in the windows. Subsequently, he began the process of cleaning out the property and putting on a new roof.\n\n{\u00b618} Kaia filed a quiet-title action, naming Davis as a defendant, along with an affidavit of indigency. He received notice of the action in his post-office box. Davis hired an attorney and filed an answer. His attorney made some phone calls and learned of the police\u2019s investigation into similar transactions. He testified that no one had his consent to come onto the property and that it was not abandoned. Kaia\u2019s complaint was eventually dismissed for want of prosecution.\n\nF. 200 Clinton Springs\n\n{\u00b619} Brenda Willis owned property located at 200 Clinton Springs, which used to be her parents\u2019 house. On January 6, 2017, Kimberly filed a quiet-title action naming as defendants Brenda and her husband, Charles Willis, although only Brenda\u2019s name was on the deed. Kimberly also filed an affidavit of indigency.\n\n{\u00b620} Brenda stated that her siblings were living in the house until January 2018, and that none of the claims in Kimberly\u2019s complaint were true. She and her husband both filed answers, after which Kimberly dismissed her complaint. Brenda\nalso stated that the property was not abandoned, and she had never given anyone permission to enter the property.\n\n**G. 3944 Vine Street**\n\n{\u00b621} Kimberly filed a quiet-title action for property located at 3944 Vine Street, along with an affidavit of indigency. She claimed that the property was abandoned, and she was the possessor of the property. Anchor Holdings, LLC, was the property\u2019s owner. The quiet-title action was dismissed because Kimberly never obtained service on Anchor Holdings. Detective Alexander was unable to locate a representative for the company.\n\n**H. 1595 Summit Avenue**\n\n{\u00b622} Michael West incorporated 4 Kennedy, LLC, a real estate business, to make money to pay for his daughter\u2019s college tuition. He bought property at 1595 Summit Road in 2015 and began renovations. Kimberly filed a quiet-title action alleging that the property was abandoned and that she had entered the property and claimed title to it.\n\n{\u00b623} West did not find out about the action until Detective Alexander contacted his wife. He stated that he had not abandoned the property and that he believed that \u201csomebody was trying to steal [his] property.\u201d The quiet-title action was dismissed when Kimberly failed to show up for court. Detective Alexander stated that at that time, Kimberly was aware that the Cincinnati Police Department was investigating the Khamisis.\nI. 10508 Toulon Drive\n\n{\u00b624} James and Imogene Bronson had owned property at 10508 Toulon Drive. The Bronsons passed away, and the survivor identified in the deed was Michelle Reed. Wells Fargo Bank had initiated a foreclosure proceeding. Kimberly filed a quiet-title action against the Bronsons, Reed, and Wells Fargo, along with an affidavit of indigency. She claimed that the property was abandoned and that she was in possession. She also claimed that Wells Fargo did not have a valid mortgage. The case was dismissed for want of prosecution.\n\nJ. The Convictions\n\n{\u00b625} Kimberly was convicted of three counts of tampering with records and three counts of theft. She was sentenced to three years in prison. Jelani was convicted of three counts of tampering with records and three counts of theft. He was sentenced to one year in prison. Ayinde was convicted of two counts of tampering with records and two counts of theft. He was sentenced to two years in prison. Kaia was convicted of one count of tampering with records and one count of theft. She was sentenced to one year in prison. These appeals followed.\n\nII. Structural Error\n\n{\u00b626} The Khamisis each present four identical assignments of error for review. In all of these assignments of error, they contend that the trial court committed structural error. A structural error is a constitutional defect that affects the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than being an error in the trial process itself. State v. Clinton, 153 Ohio St.3d 422, 2017-Ohio-9423, 108 N.E.3d 1, \u00b6 198; State v. Jones, 2018-Ohio-4754, 124 N.E.3d 439, \u00b6 19 (1st Dist.). Because a\nstructural error is deemed prejudicial per se, it requires an automatic reversal. *State v. Davis*, 127 Ohio St.3d 268, 2010-Ohio-5706, 939 N.E.2d 147, \u00b6 22; *State v. Furr*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170046, 2018-Ohio-2205, \u00b6 3. Most constitutional errors are not structural, and structural errors have been recognized only in limited classes of cases. *State v. Perry*, 101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, \u00b6 18; *Furr* at \u00b6 4; *Jones* at \u00b6 20.\n\n{\u00b627} In determining whether an error is structural, the threshold inquiry is whether the error involves deprivation of a constitutional right. *State v. Fisher*, 99 Ohio St.3d 127, 2003-Ohio-2761, 789 N.E.2d 222, \u00b6 18; *Jones* at \u00b6 21. \u201c[T]he trial-error/structural-error distinction is irrelevant unless it is first established that constitutional error has occurred.\u201d *Jones* at \u00b6 21, quoting *State v. Esparza*, 74 Ohio St.3d 660, 662, 660 N.E.2d 1194 (1996).\n\n**III. Indictment**\n\n{\u00b628} In their first assignments of error, the Khamisis contend that the trial court committed structural error \u201cby Creating a Fatal Variance Between the Grand Jury\u2019s Indictment and the Bill of Particulars and Evidence***.\u201d They argue that the indictments failed to give them adequate notice of the alleged criminal conduct with which they were charged, that they were not supported by sufficient facts, and that they were falsely procured by the prosecutor. These assignments of error are not well taken.\n\n{\u00b629} Under the United States and Ohio Constitutions, an individual accused of a felony is entitled to an indictment setting forth the \u201cnature and cause of the accusation.\u201d *State v. Sellards*, 17 Ohio St.3d 169, 170, 478 N.E.2d 781 (1985); *State v. Lukacs*, 188 Ohio App.3d 597, 2010-Ohio-2364, 936 N.E.2d 506, \u00b6 41 (1st Dist.).\nThe government must aver all material facts constituting the essential elements of the offense so that the accused has adequate notice and an opportunity to defend. *Sellards* at 170; *Lukacs* at 41. But the indictment need not contain a recitation of the evidence supporting the various facts. *Lukacs* at \u00b6 41; *State v. Gingell*, 7 Ohio App.3d 364, 366, 455 N.E.2d 1066 (1st Dist.1982). Generally, the requirements of an indictment may be met by reciting the language of the criminal statute. *State v. Childs*, 88 Ohio St.3d 194, 199, 724 N.E.2d 781 (2000).\n\n{\u00b630} In this case, the indictments tracked the language of the applicable statutes. Therefore, the Khamisis can demonstrate no error. See *State v. Skatzes*, 104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 26; *State v. Murphy*, 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 583, 605 N.E2d 884 (1992).\n\n{\u00b631} Further, each of the Khamisis was supplied with a bill of particulars. The accused can obtain more specific details by requesting a bill of particulars as provided in Crim.R. 7(E). But the bill of particulars need not provide the accused with specifications of the evidence or serve as a substitute for discovery. *Sellards* at 171; *Lukacs* at \u00b6 43; *Gingell* at 367. The indictments and the bills of particulars together were sufficient to apprise the Khamisis of the charges against them. Therefore, they did not give rise to any error, much less structural error. See *State v. Roberts*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-040575 and C-050005, 2005-Ohio-4848, \u00b6 9, reversed on other grounds, *In re Criminal Sentencing Statutes Cases*, 109 Ohio St.3d 313, 2006-Ohio-2109, 817 N.E.2d 1174.\n\n{\u00b632} The Khamisis claimed throughout trial that they had no notice of the offenses with which they were charged. The record shows that they were provided with discovery, and that their claims that they had no notice were trial tactics. They were well aware of the factual basis of the charges against them. They took great\noffense that the bill of particulars described them as \u201csquatters,\u201d and they argue that squatting is not necessarily illegal. The purpose of the bill of particulars is to provide notice. The use of the word is not improper, but even if it were, its use did not affect the validity of the notice.\n\n{\u00b633} The Khamisis also argue that the indictments were not supported by sufficient and credible evidence. The grand jury, in inquiring into crimes and offenses returning indictments, does not exercise a judicial function. An indictment and subsequent proceedings based on that indictment are not rendered invalid on the ground that illegal and incompetent testimony was heard by the grand jury. Villasino v. Maxwell, 174 Ohio St. 483, 484-485, 190 N.E.2d 265 (1963); State v. Cunningham, 1st Dist. Warren No. 54, 1975 WL 181079, *4 (Dec. 29, 1975); Wickline v. Alvis, 103 Ohio App. 1, 9-10, 144 N.E.2d 207 (10th Dist.1957).\n\n{\u00b634} Thus, an indictment valid on its face is not subject to challenge on the ground that the grand jury acted on the basis of inadequate or incompetent evidence. United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 344-345, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974); State v. Blalock, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 80419 and 80420, 2002-Ohio-4580, \u00b6 24. \u201cAn indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury, like an information drawn by a prosecutor, if valid on its face, is enough to call for the trial of the charge on the merits.\u201d Villasino at 485; Blalock at \u00b6 24.\n\n{\u00b635} In this case, the indictments were valid on their faces. Therefore, the Khamisis cannot challenge the evidence supporting the indictments. It appears they are actually trying to challenge the weight and sufficiency of the evidence at trial, but they have not raised assignments of error to that effect. Because they failed to raise assignments of error challenging the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, we need\nnot address those issues. See State v. Harris, 2017-Ohio-5594, 92 N.E.3d 1283, \u00b6 43 (1st Dist.).\n\n{\u00b636} Finally, under these assignments of error, the Khamisis argue that their not-guilty pleas were entered against their wishes. Crim.R. 11(A) provides that if a defendant refuses to plead, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty on behalf of the defendant. A not-guilty plea does not admit any facts and does not waive any of the defendant's rights, including the right to have the prosecution prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Schaeffer, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA92-04-038, 1993 WL 106146, *1 (Apr. 12, 1993). Because the Khamisis refused to enter pleas, the court could do so on their behalf and they were not prejudiced by the application of this rule. See Cleveland Metroparks v. Sferra, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106341, 2018-Ohio-3169, \u00b6 22. Consequently, we overrule the Khamisis' first assignments of error.\n\nIV. Self-Representation\n\n{\u00b637} In their second assignments of error, the Khamisis argue that the court committed structural error by denying them the right to represent themselves. Both the United States Supreme Court and the Ohio Supreme Court have recognized a criminal defendant's right to represent himself or herself at trial without counsel when the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily chooses to waive counsel. See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 819-820, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975); State v. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, \u00b6 23-24; Furr, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170046, 2018-Ohio-2205, at \u00b6 6. The right to represent oneself is \u201cthwarted when counsel is forced upon an unwilling defendant, who alone bears the risks of a potential conviction.\u201d State v. Obermiller, 147 Ohio\nThe record does not show that the Khamisis were denied their rights to represent themselves. Originally, the trial court had recognized their rights to represent themselves and had advised them it was bad idea. Subsequently, the Khamisis refused to sign written waivers of counsel, although they had indicated that they wished to represent themselves. The trial court, believing that a written waiver was required, told them they would be appointed lawyers.\n\nCrim.R. 44 governs the procedure for waiver of counsel in \u201cserious offense\u201d cases. A \u201cserious offense\u201d includes any felony. Crim.R. 2(C). Under Crim.R. 44(A), when a defendant is unable to obtain counsel, counsel must be assigned to represent the defendant in all stages of the proceedings, unless the defendant, after being fully advised of his right to counsel, knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waives his right to counsel. Furr at \u00b6 7. The waiver must be made in open court and must be in writing. Crim.R. 44(C).\n\nBut, the written waiver is not constitutionally required, so a trial court needs only to substantially comply with Crim.R. 44. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, at \u00b6 38; Furr, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170046, 2018-Ohio-2205, at \u00b6 8. A court substantially complies with Crim.R. 44 when it makes a sufficient inquiry to determine whether the defendant fully understands and intelligently relinquishes the right to counsel. Martin at \u00b6 39; Furr at \u00b6 8.\n\nAt the next hearing, the trial court stated that it had made a mistake because only substantial compliance with Crim.R. 44 was required. It then informed the Khamisis of the nature of the charges, the range of allowable punishments, possible defenses to the charges and \u201cthe other facts essential to a broad\nunderstanding of the whole matter.\u201d See State v. Gibson, 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 377, 345 N.E.2d 399 (1976); Furr at \u00b6 9. It also explained the disadvantages of self-representation and that they would be required to follow the same rules and procedures that normally govern the conduct of a trial. See Furr at \u00b6 9; State v. Murphy, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170390, 2018-Ohio-1063, \u00b6 6. The court then determined that they knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived their rights to counsel.\n\n\u00b642 The Khamisis then represented themselves throughout the trial. Many of the issues of which they now complain were the result of their inexperience and lack of counsel. A defendant who elects to represent himself cannot complain about the quality of his own defense. Faretta, 422 U.S. at 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, fn. 46.\n\n\u00b643 One of the Khamisis\u2019 complaints involves an order the trial court journalized early in the proceedings. The court ordered the clerk of courts to remove the case completely from display on the clerk\u2019s website. It also stated that all parties had to seek leave of court before obtaining copies of any filings in the case. The record shows that the court made that order because the Khamisis had attempted to evade arrest, and they were not all arrested at the same time.\n\n\u00b644 The case was later assigned to a visiting judge. When the Khamisis argued that the order prevented them from defending themselves, the court said that \u201cmy interpretation was that some documents were being attempted to be filed in this case while one or more of you had an outstanding warrant; that was the rationale that I thought for the issuance of that order.\u201d The court agreed to rescind the order, which was vacated less than four months after it was journalized.\nThe court also offered to grant a continuance. The Khamisis initially refused and argued about the alleged lack of notice and jurisdiction. After a lot of back-and-forth, the court granted a continuance. In fact, the court went to great lengths to ensure that the Khamisis received transcripts of the various hearings and had access to the internet at the jail. Thus, they were not prevented from preparing a defense.\n\nNext, the Khamisis argue that because they represented themselves they were forced to appear in front of the jury in jail garb. Courts have recognized that a defendant may be prejudiced by appearing in jail clothing, but a defendant may purposefully elect, as a matter of trial strategy, to stand trial in that attire. See Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 504-505, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976); State v. Gandy, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-050804, 2006-Ohio-6282, \u00b6 4. There is no rule requiring all convictions in which the defendant has worn jail clothing be overturned. Instead, the inquiry focuses on whether the accused's appearance before the jury was compelled. Gandy at \u00b6 4.\n\nThe Khamisis raised the issue about the same time that they were arguing about the order removing the case from the clerk of court's website, which did not allow the parties to file any documents at that time without leave of court. Kaia said that she had asked her caseworker about wearing regular clothing, and the caseworker had said they could not \u201cdo anything\u201d without an order from the trial court. The trial court stated, \u201cSee, this is one of the major disadvantages you have by not having an attorney, because the attorney would immediately ask that you be permitted to wear civilian clothes.\u201d Then a public defender who was involved in the case said that his office had a bank of clothes and \u201cwe can try to get them in civilian clothes if they are interested.\u201d They all said they were not interested.\nThus, they were not compelled to appear before the jury in jail clothing. They chose to do so. Further, the court said that it would instruct the jury that it should not hold the fact that they were wearing prison garb against them. The Khamisis said they didn\u2019t want the instruction as they were preparing their own jury instructions.\n\nThe Khamisis further argue that the prosecutor addressed the issue even though he was instructed not to, which is untrue. Moreover, the prosecutor merely told the potential jurors during voir dire that \u201c[t]he State and the Court have also offered these defendants [the] right to not appear in jail garb as well; that was their choice to do that, and you will not hold that against them, will you?\u201d Therefore, the Khamisis were not prejudiced.\n\nNext, the Khamisis argue that their family member, Kijai, was denied the right to advise them and to file documents on their behalf. They also argue that she was imprisoned for three days without probable cause. The record shows that the trial court found her in contempt for giggling and laughing in the court room and interrupting the court. Nothing in the record shows that that finding of contempt was improper. Moreover, the Khamisis lacked standing to raise the issue of the validity of that contempt finding. Litigants may assert their own rights, not the rights of third parties. Util. Serv. Partners, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., 124 Ohio St.3d 284, 2009-Ohio-6764, 921 N.E.3d 1038, \u00b6 49; In re K.C., 2017-Ohio-8383, 99 N.E.3d 1061, \u00b6 5 (1st Dist.).\n\nFurther, while the Khamisis had the right to represent themselves, they did not have the right to have a nonattorney advise them or file anything on their behalf. Only a licensed attorney may file pleadings on behalf of another in\ncourt. R.C. 4705.01; State ex rel. Army of Twelve Monkeys v. Warren Cty. Ct. of Common Pleas, 156 Ohio St.3d 346, 2019-Ohio-901, 126 N.E.3d 1113, \u00b6 5.\n\n{\u00b652} Finally, the Khamisis make numerous references to excessive bail. Habeas corpus is the proper remedy to raise a claim of excessive bail in pretrial-release cases. Chari v. Vore, 91 Ohio St.3d 323, 325, 744 N.E.2d 763 (2001); State v. Towns, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 88059, 2007-Ohio-529, \u00b6 20. After conviction, any error concerning pretrial bail is moot, and the issue cannot be raised on direct appeal. State v. Knisley, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22897, 2010-Ohio-116, \u00b6 25; Towns at \u00b6 20. Consequently, we overrule the Khamisis\u2019 second assignments of error.\n\nV. Impartial Judge/Jurisdiction\n\n{\u00b653} In their third assignments of error, the Khamisis argue that the trial court committed structural error by denying their right to an impartial judge. They argue that the trial court was biased against them, ignored jurisdiction, denied their right to represent themselves, set excessive bail, and misstated the law and the facts. These assignments of error are not well taken.\n\n{\u00b654} First, as a general rule, a direct appeal is not the proper place to raise an argument that the trial judge was biased. The proper avenue for redress when a party believes that a trial judge is biased is the filing of an affidavit of bias and prejudice with the Supreme Court of Ohio as provided for in R.C. 2701.03. Gandy, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-050804, 2006-Ohio-6282, at \u00b6 22. The Khamisis filed affidavits of bias and prejudice against the original trial judge, which the Ohio Supreme Court denied.\nBut even if we address the merits of the issue, the Khamisis\u2019 arguments still fail. A trial before a judge who is not impartial results in structural error that would require reversal without a harmless-error analysis. *State v. Sanders*, 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 278, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001); *State v. Buck*, 2017-Ohio-8242, 100 N.E.3d 118, \u00b6 82 (1st Dist.). The Ohio Supreme Court has described judicial bias as \u201ca hostile feeling or spirit of ill will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and facts.\u201d *Buck* at \u00b6 83, quoting *State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt*, 164 Ohio St. 463, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956), paragraph four of the syllabus.\n\nA trial court is presumed to be fair and impartial. *In re Disqualification of Kilpatrick*, 47 Ohio St.3d 605, 606, 546 N.E.2d 929 (1989); *Gandy* at \u00b6 23. The Khamisis have failed to overcome this presumption relating to the original trial judge or the visiting judge. The judges\u2019 failure to provide the relief to which the Khamisis believe they were entitled does not establish actual bias. See *State v. Jackson*, 149 Ohio St.3d 55, 2016-Ohio-5488, 73 N.E.3d 414, \u00b6 40. Further, the fact that the Khamisis had filed litigation against the judges or that the judges had presided over the civil quiet-title actions, without more, does not establish bias. See *In re Disqualification of Pokorny*, 135 Ohio St.3d 1268, 2013-Ohio-915, 986 N.E.2d 993, \u00b6 4; *In re Disqualification of Bryant*, 117 Ohio St.3d 1251, 2006-Ohio-7227, 885 N.E.2d 246, \u00b6 4.\n\nThe Khamisis argue that both judges ignored their motions. Both judges simply refused to reconsider the same motions they had already ruled on that the Khamisis continued to raise time and again. When a court fails to rule on a\npending motion, we presume that the court elected to overrule it. *State v. Smith*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-180439 and C-180604, 2019-Ohio-5350, \u00b6 13.\n\n{\u00b658} Next, the Khamisis contend that the visiting judge imposed his own morality upon the proceedings. The remarks about which they complain occurred at the sentencing hearing where the judge asked how they could morally justify taking other people's property. This is a proper consideration at sentencing. *See State v. Arnett*, 88 Ohio St.3d 208, 221-222, 724 N.E.2d 302 (2000); *State v. Brown*, 11th Dist. Geauga No. 2003-G-2504, 2004-Ohio-1843, \u00b6 35; *State v. Golson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 17707, 2001 WL 227372, *7* (Mar. 9, 2001).\n\n{\u00b659} The Khamisis argue that even though the visiting judge tried the case, they were prejudiced because the bailiff was the original trial judge's sister, which they did not learn until after trial. Much of this argument involves matters outside the record on appeal, which we cannot consider. *See State v. Ishmail*, 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 405-406, 377 N.E.2d 500 (1978); *State v. Dieterle*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-070796, 2009-Ohio-1888, \u00b6 49. Nothing in the record shows that the bailiff influenced the jury or acted in a way to deny the Khamisis a fair trial.\n\n{\u00b660} Finally, the Khamisis argue that both judges ignored their lack of jurisdiction, which was actually the crux of their arguments throughout the proceedings. They fail to understand the nature of subject-matter jurisdiction. Subject-matter jurisdiction involves a court's power to hear a case. *State v. Mbodj*, 129 Ohio St.3d 325, 2011-Ohio-2880, 951 N.E.2d 1025, \u00b6 10.\n\n{\u00b661} Section 4(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he courts of common pleas and divisions thereof shall have such original jurisdiction over all justiciable matters and such powers of review of proceedings as may be provided by law.\u201d R.C. 2931.03 provides that jurisdiction over all crimes and\noffenses is vested in the court of common pleas, general division, unless jurisdiction is specifically and exclusively vested in other divisions of the court or in the lower courts. *State ex rel. McMinn v. Whitfield*, 27 Ohio St.3d 4, 5, 500 N.E.2d 875 (1986). Moreover, \u201c[a]bsent a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court with general subject-matter jurisdiction may determine its own jurisdiction.\u201d *State ex rel. Brown v. Luebbers*, 137 Ohio St.3d 542, 2013-Ohio-5062, 1 N.E.3d 395, \u00b6 12. The court had jurisdiction to hear the case, and the fact that it did not agree with the Khamisis\u2019 arguments does not mean that the court lacked jurisdiction.\n\n{\u00b662} In sum, nothing in the record shows that the trial court violated its duty of impartiality or behaved in a way that deprived the Khamisis of a fair trial. *See State v. Brewster*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-030024 and C-030025, 2004-Ohio-2993, \u00b6 68-69; *State v. Johnson*, 140 Ohio App.3d 385, 391-392, 747 N.E.2d 863 (1st Dist.2000). Consequently, we overrule the Khamisis\u2019 third assignments of error.\n\n**V. Public Trial/Jury Issues**\n\n{\u00b663} In their fourth assignments of error, the Khamisis contend that the trial court committed structural error by denying their rights to a public trial, a jury of their peers, and a fair trial. They argue that the trial court ignored jurisdiction, denied them their rights to represent themselves, set excessive bail, misstated the law and facts, and failed to be impartial. These assignments of error are not well taken.\n\n{\u00b664} Some of arguments the Khamisis make under these assignments of error are a rehash of arguments we have already rejected. As to the right to a public trial, the United States and Ohio Constitutions guarantee an accused the right to a public trial. *Waller v. Georgia*, 467 U.S. 39, 46, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31\nThe violation of the right to a public trial is considered structural error and not subject to the harmless-error analysis. *Waller* at 49-50; *State v. Drummond*, 111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.3d 1038, \u00b6 50.\n\n\u00b665 The right to a public trial is not absolute, and in some instances, must yield to other interests. The trial court has broad discretion to exercise control over the proceedings. The court may order the exclusion of spectators as long as it does not inappropriately deny the defendant\u2019s right to a public trial. *Drummond* at \u00b6 51; *State v. Curtis*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150174, 2016-Ohio-1318, \u00b6 17.\n\n\u00b666 The record does not show that the trial court closed the courtroom. Prior to voir dire, the Khamisis claimed that they were told that nobody, with the exception of Kimberly\u2019s mother and her \u201ccounselor,\u201d would be able to attend. The trial court indicated that it had concerns about the lack of space for potential jurors. It stated that \u201c[w]ell, that was for purposes of voir dire, and that\u2019s just a matter of we\u2019ve got no place to put anybody.\u201d It went on, \u201cI have no problem with anybody being in here as long as they don\u2019t pose a security risk. * * * I don\u2019t care if you fill up with your community or other people or the general public.\u201d\n\n\u00b667 The Khamisis complained that \u201c[i]t wasn\u2019t relayed that way\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s too late, because it\u2019s now the jury selection process and my community is not here that\u2019s too late for that one.\u201d The court replied that \u201cas soon as we get the jury, hopefully one of your people can let the community know that they\u2019re welcome to be here.\u201d\n\n\u00b668 Federal courts have held that exclusion of a defendant\u2019s friends or family members because of a lack of space does not deprive the defendant of the right to a public trial. *See Bunn v. Lopez*, E.D.Cal. No. 2:11-cv-1373, 2016 WL\nMoreover, the record is inconclusive as to whether any one was actually excluded from the courtroom at any time. We cannot hold, without more, that the Khamisis were denied the right to a public trial. See State v Williams, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26014, 2012-Ohio-5873, \u00b6 10.\n\nNext, the Khamisis argue that they were denied a jury of their peers because none of the jurors were aware of the doctrine of adverse possession. A jury of one\u2019s peers means a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 527, 95 S.Ct. 692, 42 L.Ed.2d 690 (1975); State v. Seymour, 5th Dist. Richland No. 03-CA-37, 2004-Ohio-3835, \u00b6 53. A defendant is entitled to a qualified panel of citizens \u201cselected by the best method that thoughtful men, who are cognizant of the practicalities of selection and the inherent problems involved, have been able to develop.\u201d State v. McCarter, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-830823, 1984 WL 6715, *2 (July 25, 1984), quoting State v. Strodes, 48 Ohio St.2d 113, 115, 357 N.E.2d 375 (1976), vacated on other grounds, 438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1978).\n\nTo establish a violation of this requirement, the defendant must prove, among other things, that the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community. State v. Fulton, 57 Ohio St.3d 120, 566 N.E.2d 1195 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus; State v. Ford, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014CA00145, 2015-Ohio-4093, \u00b6 19. People aware of adverse possession are not a distinctive group in the community. A criminal defendant has no affirmative right to a jury of a particular racial, gender or age composition, much less one aware of certain legal doctrines. See Seymour at \u00b6 54. Thus, the Khamisis have to failed show that they were not tried by a jury of their peers.\nFinally, the Khamisis argue that they were denied a fair trial because the jury was not instructed on the issue of adverse possession. The trial court must fully and completely give all jury instructions that are relevant and necessary for the jury to weigh the evidence and to discharge its duty as the trier of fact. *State v. Comen*, 50 Ohio St.3d 206, 553 N.E.2d 640 (1990), paragraph two of the syllabus; *State v. Robinson*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-060434, 2007-Ohio-2388, \u00b6 18. A trial court must give a defendant\u2019s requested instructions to the jury if they are correct, pertinent statements of law and are appropriate under the facts of the case. *State v. Lessin*, 67 Ohio St.3d 487, 493, 620 N.E.2d 72 (1993); *Brewster*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-030024 and C-030025, 2004-Ohio-2993, at \u00b6 58.\n\nThe Khamisis\u2019 defense at trial was that the properties were abandoned and they were in the process of establishing adverse possession of the properties. The trial court instructed the jury regarding whether property was abandoned, but refused to give an instruction on adverse possession because the evidence did not warrant it. We agree with the trial court\u2019s decision.\n\nAdverse possession is disfavored in the law, as it is in contravention of the ideals set forth in the Constitution protecting life, liberty and property. *Houck v. Bd. of Park Commrs. of the Huron Cty. Park Dist.*, 116 Ohio St.3d 148, 2007-Ohio-5586, 876 N.E.2d 1210, \u00b6 29; *Grace v. Koch*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-950802, 1996 WL 577843, *2-3 (Oct. 9, 1996), affirmed, 81 Ohio St.3d 577, 692 N.E.2d 1009 (1998). Title is strictly construed in favor of the person holding legal title and against the adverse claimant. *Grace* at *3.\n\nA person seeking to establish adverse possession must show exclusive possession that is open, notorious, continuous, and adverse for 21 years. *Evanich v. Bridge*, 119 Ohio St.3d 260, 2008-Ohio-3820, 893 N.E.2d 481, \u00b6 7; *Grace* at *3. The\nKhamisis, by their own admission, had not been in possession of any of the properties for 21 years. Therefore, an instruction on adverse possession was not supported by the evidence.\n\n{\u00b675} Despite their attempts to justify their conduct, the record is clear that they were never anything but trespassers and had no legal interest in the properties at all. They cannot show that they were entitled to the properties by adverse possession. \u201cA claim for continuing trespass may be brought at any time until the claim has ripened into a presumptive right by adverse possession, which takes 21 years.\u201d Reith v. McGill Smith Punshon, Inc., 163 Ohio App.3d 709, 2005-Ohio-4852, 840 N.E.2d 226, \u00b6 50 (1st Dist).\n\n{\u00b676} Simply put, attempting to establish adverse possession is not a defense to a charge of theft or tampering with records. The trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on adverse possession. The Khamisis were not denied their rights to a fair trial, and we overrule their fourth assignments of error.\n\nVI. Summary\n\n{\u00b677} In sum, we find no merit in any of the Khamisis\u2019 assignments of error. They have not demonstrated that the trial court committed reversible error, much less structural error. Therefore, we overrule all of their assignments of error, and we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgments.\n\nJudgments affirmed.\n\nMock, P.J., and Crouse, J., concur.\n\nPlease note:\n\nThe court has recorded its own entry this date."}

Hunt, 2021-Ohio-528.] \nGwin, P.J. \n{\u00b61} Appellant Kolt L. Hunt appeals the August 20, 2020 judgment ent ry of the \nTuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas denying his petition for post-conviction relief.  \nAppellee is the state of Ohio. \nFacts & Procedural History \n{\u00b62} In 2019, appellant was found guilty by a jury of two counts of child \nendangering, one violation of R.C. 2919.22(B)(1) and (E)(2)(d),  a felony of the second \ndegree, and one violation of R.C. 2919.22(A) and (E)(2)(c), a f elony of the third degree.  \nAppellant appealed his convictions and sentence to this Court, arguing:  his convictions \nwere against the manifest weight of the evidence; his convictio ns were based upon \ninsufficient evidence; ineffectiveness of trial counsel for fai ling to object to Dr. Benton\u2019s \ntestimony regarding the pain the child would have experienced during and after appellant \nbeat him; and prosecutorial misconduct, amounting to the denial of due process.  In State \nv. Hunt , 5th Dist. Tuscarawas No. 2019 AP 07 0023, 2020-Ohio-1124, thi s Court \noverruled appellant\u2019s assignments of error and affirmed appella nt\u2019s convictions and \nsentence.  Appellant filed an application for reconsideration.  This Court denied his \napplication for reconsideration on January 6, 2021.   \n{\u00b63} On August 3, 2020, appellant filed a petition to vacate or set aside \nconviction and sentence, arguing he was denied due process of l aw, denied effective \nassistance of counsel, and subject to cruel and unusual punishm ent.  Appellee filed an \nobjection to the petition on August 10, 2020.   \n{\u00b64} On August 20, 2020, the trial court issued a judgment entry den ying the \npetition.  The trial court stated it, \u201creviewed the petition of  the Defendant and the Tuscarawas County, Case No. 2020 AP 09 0019 3 \nobjections set forth by the State of Ohio.\u201d  Further, the trial  court found, \u201cthat the petition \nto vacate or set aside judgment of conviction or sentence is not well taken and should be \ndenied.\u201d   \n{\u00b65} Appellant appeals the August 20, 2020 judgment entry of the Tus carawas \nCounty Court of Common Pleas and assigns the following as error: \n{\u00b66} \u201cI. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING PETITIONER HUNT AN \nEVIDENTIARY HEARING IN REGARD TO HIS PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTI ON \nRELIEF.  \n{\u00b67} \u201cII. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ISSUING INADEQUATE AND \nERRONEOUS FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW IN REGARD TO \nPETITIONER HUNT\u2019S PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF.\u201d   \nII. \n{\u00b68} We first address appellant\u2019s second assignment of error because  i t  i s  \ndispositive of appellant\u2019s appeal.  Appellant argues in his second assignment of error that \nthe trial court erred in denying his petition for post-conviction relief without making findings \nof fact and conclusions of law as required by R.C. 2953.21.  We agree. \n{\u00b69} R.C. 2953.21(H) states, \u201cif the court does not find grounds for granting relief, \nit shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall enter judgment \ndenying relief on the petition.\u201d  If a court fails to do so, th e decision is subject to reversal \non appeal.

State v. \nJacks, 5th Dist. Licking No. 99 CA 113, 2000 WL 329740 (Feb. 29, 2000), citing State v. \nLester, 41 Ohio St.2d 51, 322 N.E.2d 656 (1975).  The purpose of requiring the trial court \nto include findings of fact and conclusions of law in its judgm ent entry is to sufficiently \napprise both the petitioner and the potential appellate court of the grounds for its decision.  \nState v. Staats, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2015CA00207, 2016-Ohio-2921.   \n{\u00b611} The Supreme Court has held that a trial court \u201cneed not issue f indings of \nfact and conclusions of law when it dismisses an untimely [post-conviction-relief] petition.\u201d  \nState ex rel. Kimbrough v. Greene, 98 Ohio St.3d 116, 2002-Ohio-7042, 781 N.E.2d 155.  \nIf a petition for post-conviction relief is untimely, the trial  court had no clear duty to issue \nfindings of fact or conclusions of law.  Dillon v. Cottrill, 5th Dist. Muskingum No. CT2014-\n0053, 2015-Ohio-1785.  Further, a trial court \u201chas no duty to i ssue findings of fact and \nconclusions of law on successive * * * petitions for post-convi ction relief.\u201d  State ex rel. \nGeorge v. Burnside, 118 Ohio St.3d 406, 2008-Ohio-2702, 889 N.E.2d 533. \n{\u00b612} This is the first post-conviction petition appellant filed and is therefore not a \nsuccessive petition.  Appellee contends the trial court was not  required to issue findings \nof fact and conclusions of law because appellant\u2019s petition was not timely filed.  Appellant \nfiled a direct appeal of his sentencing entry.  Pursuant to R.C . 2953.21(A)(2), a petition \nfor post-conviction relief must be filed no later than 365 days  after the date on which the \ntrial transcript is filed with the court of appeals in the dire ct appeal of the judgment of \nconviction.  In this case, the transcript in appellant\u2019s direct  appeal was filed on July 30, \n2019.  Thus, pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(A)(2), appellant\u2019s petiti on had to be filed by July \n29, 2020.  Appellant filed his petition on August 3, 2020.   Tuscarawas County, Case No. 2020 AP 09 0019 5 \n{\u00b613} However, on March 9, 2020, the Governor of the State of Ohio is sued \nExecutive Order 2020-01D and declared a state of emergency in O hio in response to \nCOVID-19.  On March 27, 2020, the Governor of Ohio signed into law Am.Sub.H.B. No. \n197, which immediately tolled, retroactively to March 9, 2020, all statutorily established \nstatutes of limitations, time limitations, and deadlines in the  Ohio Revised Code and \nAdministrative Code until July 30, 2020.  In re Tolling of Time Requirements Imposed by \nRules Promulgated by Supreme Court & Use of Technology, 158 Ohio St.3d 1447, 2020-\nOhio-1166, 141 N.E.3d 974.  The Ohio Supreme Court determined t hat this tolling order \napplied to all filing deadlines within the applicable period.  Id.  The deadline for appellant\u2019s \npetition in this case fell within the emergency period.  Becaus e the deadline fells within \nthe emergency period, it is tolled effective March 9, 2020.  223 days had already passed \nbefore the deadline was tolled.  Once the emergency period ende d, appellant had 142 \ndays left after July 30, 2020, to file his petition.  According ly, appellant\u2019s petition was \ntimely.   \n{\u00b614} Appellee also contends appellant failed to submit substantive g rounds for \nrelief and that his claims are barred by res judicata.  However, this analysis is relevant to \nwhether appellant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing, not to a determination of whether \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law in the trial court\u2019s ju dgment entry are sufficient to \napprise the petitioner and this Court of the grounds for its decision.  State v. Atkinson, 5th \nDist. Muskingum No. CT2019-0055, 2019-Ohio-3122; R.C. 2953.21(D); R.C. 2953.21(H).   \n{\u00b615} In this case, the trial court did not make any findings of fact and conclusions \nof law, and denied the petition for post-conviction relief with out stating its reasons for \ndenying the petition.  We therefore sustain appellant\u2019s second assignment of error and Tuscarawas County, Case No. 2020 AP 09 0019 6 \nreverse and remand this matter to the trial court to make findings of fact and conclusions \nof law.  We will not address appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, as it is moot based upon \nour disposition of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.  Fur ther, appellant filed a \nmotion on January 20, 2021 regarding leave to file additional pages to his brief and leave \nto add an additional assignment of error to his brief.  We also find this motion moot based \nupon our disposition of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.   \n{\u00b616} Based on the foregoing, the August 20, 2020 judgment entry of t he \nTuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas is reversed and remanded to the trial court \nfor proceedings consistent with this opinion.   \nBy Gwin, P.J., \n \nHoffman, J., and \n \nWise, Earle, J, concur \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  ", "case_juv": "0", "case_crim": "0", "case_2001": "0", "case_app": "0", "case_pros": "0", "aoe_none": "0", "aoe_grandjury": "0", "aoe_court": "0", "aoe_defense": "0", "aoe_procbar": "0", "aoe_prochist": "1", "case_timeframe": "0", "other": "76    0\nName: other, dtype: int64", "olmocr_text": "COURT OF APPEALS\nTUSCARAWAS COUNTY, OHIO\nFIFTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\nSTATE OF OHIO : Hon.

Hunt appeals the August 20, 2020 judgment entry of the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas denying his petition for post-conviction relief. Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n\nFacts & Procedural History\n\nIn 2019, appellant was found guilty by a jury of two counts of child endangering, one violation of R.C. 2919.22(B)(1) and (E)(2)(d), a felony of the second degree, and one violation of R.C. 2919.22(A) and (E)(2)(c), a felony of the third degree. Appellant appealed his convictions and sentence to this Court, arguing: his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence; his convictions were based upon insufficient evidence; ineffectiveness of trial counsel for failing to object to Dr. Benton\u2019s testimony regarding the pain the child would have experienced during and after appellant beat him; and prosecutorial misconduct, amounting to the denial of due process. In State v. Hunt, 5th Dist. Tuscarawas No. 2019 AP 07 0023, 2020-Ohio-1124, this Court overruled appellant\u2019s assignments of error and affirmed appellant\u2019s convictions and sentence. Appellant filed an application for reconsideration. This Court denied his application for reconsideration on January 6, 2021.\n\nOn August 3, 2020, appellant filed a petition to vacate or set aside conviction and sentence, arguing he was denied due process of law, denied effective assistance of counsel, and subject to cruel and unusual punishment. Appellee filed an objection to the petition on August 10, 2020.\n\nOn August 20, 2020, the trial court issued a judgment entry denying the petition. The trial court stated it, \u201creviewed the petition of the Defendant and the\nobjections set forth by the State of Ohio.\u201d Further, the trial court found, \u201cthat the petition to vacate or set aside judgment of conviction or sentence is not well taken and should be denied.\u201d\n\nAppellant appeals the August 20, 2020 judgment entry of the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas and assigns the following as error:\n\n\u201cI.

Appellant argues in his second assignment of error that the trial court erred in denying his petition for post-conviction relief without making findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by R.C. 2953.21. We agree.\n\nR.C. 2953.21(H) states, \u201cif the court does not find grounds for granting relief, it shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall enter judgment denying relief on the petition.\u201d If a court fails to do so, the decision is subject to reversal on appeal.

Jones appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition for post-\nconviction relief following an evidentiary hearing. \n{\u00b6 2} In his sole assignment of error, Jones contends the trial court abused its \ndiscretion in denying his petition, which alleged that his trial counsel had provided \nineffective assistance by, among other things, failing to retain an expert witness to rebut \nthe prosecution\u2019s case at trial. \nI. Procedural and Trial Factual Background \n{\u00b6 3} The record reflects that a jury convicted Jones on one count of child \nendangering, a second-degree felony. The 2014 conviction stemmed from a head injury \nsustained by \u201cMarianne,\u201d1 the four-year-old daughter of Jones\u2019 girlfriend, while the child \nwas in his care. On August 5, 2010, the child\u2019s mother and Jones put the child down for \na nap in an upstairs bedroom of the house where they were living with friends and the \nfriends\u2019 children. The mother then left the house, and Jones was the only remaining adult \nwith Marianne and the friends\u2019 children. Jones said he then went downstairs and watched \nthe friends\u2019 children play a video game. Within about 20 minutes, he said he went back \nupstairs and found Marianne lying on her side on the floor. He testified that her eyes were \nrolled back in her head, and she was gurgling. Jones carried the child to a neighbor\u2019s \nhouse and called for help. A paramedic arrived and transported the child to Upper Valley \nMedical Center (UVMC). Her mother also responded to the hospital. She testified that at \nUVMC the child had a large knot on the left side of her forehead and bruising on the left \n                                                           \n1 As we did in a prior direct appeal, we will use the fictitious name \u201cMarianne\u201d to protect \nthe child\u2019s privacy.  \n-3- \near, neither of which was there when she left the child at home with the appellant. \nMarianne\u2019s mother testified that the remains of the knot were also visible in State\u2019s photo \nExhibits 11 and 12, taken several days after the incident, which depict an obvious \nabrasion on the left forehead. At UVMC, the child was unconscious, had a CAT2 scan \nperformed, had a ventilator with a breathing tube applied, and then was care-flighted to \nCincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital. \n{\u00b6 4} In Cincinnati, Dr. Charles Stevenson, a pediatric neurosurgeon, confirmed \nthe existence of a large blood clot, or hematoma, in the subdural space over the left side \nof the child\u2019s brain. Due to the size of the hematoma in the confined skull, pressure had \npushed the brain dramatically, about three-quarters of an inch [2 cm], to the right. Dr. \nStevenson performed surgery \u201cto remove the [left] side of the skull and take it off as one \nlarge piece.\u201d (T-2, 15).3 He saw an active hemorrhage. At trial, he explained: \n [S]o we open up, we widely open up the membrane that\u2019s containing \nthe clot. And then at that point in time you can see the clot. It is large, it is \nred, it\u2019s under significant pressure, and once you release it, it normally starts \nto extrude itself; the brain starts to extrude it out towards you. And so what \nwe very quickly do then is use gentle irrigation and instruments to remove \n                                                           \n2 We perceive the more current and common term is \u201cCT\u201d scan, and the UVMC report \nrefers to \u201cCT Head C.\u201d But because the transcript generally refers to the test as a \u201cCAT\u201d \nscan, we often use that term. \n \n3 The transcripts of the three-day jury trial are designated Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3, but \nthe pages for each volume serially begin at number 1. Consequently, we refer to the jury \ntrial transcript as T-1, T-2 and T-3 and then by page number of that volume. The post-\nconviction evidentiary hearing transcripts also are designated Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3, \nand are serially numbered beginning at 1 for each volume, and there is the separate \ndeposition of Dr. Kenneth Monson. We refer to these as T-PCR-1 T-PCR-2, and T-PCR-\n3 and Monson Depo., and then by page number.     \n-4- \nall of this clot off the surface of the brain. And as you do that, you can see \nthe underlying surface of the brain, * * * * \n This then continues for several minutes, because you want to be able \nto remove all of the clot or as much as you safely can, and typically what \nhappens is at some point, when you remove some bit of the clot, you\u2019re \ngoing to find the underlying blood vessels that are actually responsible for \nthe bleeding, all right, those blood vessels that were injured that started \nbleeding to cause the hematoma. \n And in this case, we definitely found that. There are very large set of \nveins at the top of all of our brains that run in the center and just off to each \nside. And she had significant amount of active hemorrhage from these, \nwhich I was able to identify as soon as I removed the clot in that region. I \nthen spent several minutes stopping this bleeding. \nWhen asked if this was \u201cfresh blood,\u201d Dr. Stevenson stated:  \n Yes. The vast majority of this blood that was either forming clot in \nvarious stages, that was either a few hours old or there were some just liquid \nblood that was so fresh that it had not yet had time to clot off. Especially \nnear the regions of the veins that she had bleeding, there was just active \nspurting of blood that was pooling and had not yet clotted off.  \n Q. Okay. So there\u2019s fresh blood that had collected and then still \nactive bleeding- \n A .   Y e s .   \n(T-2, 16-17). \n  \n-5- \nThe only documentary evidence introduced at trial regarding the UVMC CAT scan\u2014two \nphotocopies of CAT scan image slices (State\u2019s Exhibits 15 and 16)\u2014had been referred \nto on direct examination of Dr. Stevenson. Upon cross examination, defense counsel \nreferred to these exhibits as follows: \nQ.  Okay and you had indicated that the bright white part is new \nblood, okay. But that brown, or the darker layer could be several different \nthings, okay. One of the things that you had indicated that it could be old \nblood. Correct? Okay. If a person suffered a minor subdural hematoma, \nokay, where there was bleeding, okay, but we didn\u2019t remove the blood, \nokay, and there are those cases, correct? \nA. Yes there are.  \n* * * \nQ. Okay. All right. With this, it\u2019s possible is it not doctor that the darker \nimages there [Exhibit 15 or 16] reflect that there has been prior bleeding in \nthis brain?  \nA. Based purely off the CAT scan images , that\u2019s always a \nconsideration, yes.  \n(T-2, 32) (Emphasis added). And upon further questioning, Dr. Stevenson \nreiterated:  \nQ. Okay in looking at this CAT scan, is it possible that this could be \nan acute [new or fresh] on chronic [old]? \nA. Based purely off of the CAT scan, there is a chance that that could \nbe the case yes.     \n-6- \n(T-2, 34). (Emphasis added).  \n{\u00b6 5} On re-direct examination, Dr. Stevenson testified that he did not note any \nindication of a prior subdural hematoma in his report, but if during surgery he had visually \nobserved what he believed to be indication of a prior \u201cminor\u201d subdural hematoma he would \nhave noted it:  \n* * * because it would make a difference in terms of what was done \nprocedurally, and what the patient\u2019s prognosis would be expected to be.  \nQ. And there was nothing in \u2013 correct me if I\u2019m wrong, there was \nnothing in your review of the scans from July 25th or the previous nasal injury \nto suggest that there was any sort of minor subdural hematoma? \n  A. Not to the best of my knowledge, no. \n  Q. When you performed this surgery, and you actually had the \nopportunity to look at this child\u2019s brain, is there \u2013 was there anything there \nto you that was suggesting \u2013 did you believe this to be an old injury, or did \nyou believe this to be a fresh injury?  \n  A. Well the injury that we were treating emergently was absolutely \nfresh injury. She had a very large clot, only some of which is actually \ndepicted on these images that we had here. The volume of the clot was \nquite extensive. The clot itself was new, organizing blood, and she had \nactive bleeding, active hemorrhage out into the operative field, pooling \nthere. So all of that was absolutely new.  \n  Q. Okay. And does a \u2013 if a \u2013 although you didn\u2019t see any evidence \nof a minor subdural hematoma, does a small subdural hematoma cause a  \n-7- \nlarge, acute subdural hematoma like you saw in [Marianne] when you \ntreated her? \n  A. No it does not. \n  Q. So there would have to have been some separate event that \ncaused the acute subdural hematoma that you witnessed? \n  A. Yes.  \n(T-2, 44-45). Dr. Stevenson\u2019s testimony also included that subdural hematomas almost \nalways are caused by traumatic injuries including, for example, motor-vehicle collisions \nor falls from a significant height such a second-story window or, possibly, the top of a \nbunk bed.  \n{\u00b6 6} Fortunately, within days of the surgery, the child made a \u201cdramatic recovery\u201d \nand was able to open her eyes, breathe on her own, and begin talking. \n{\u00b6 7} In Jones\u2019 defense, through Dr. Stevenson and other witnesses, his attorney \nasserted that Marianne was a medically-fragile child who suffered from a rare condition \nknown as VATER Association.4  As a result of that condition, she had undergone \napproximately 25 surgeries, including multiple abdominal organ transplants. Defense \ncounsel also cross examined the State\u2019s medical experts about a fall that Marianne had \nexperienced about three weeks earlier on July 17, 2010. On that occasion, Marianne \ntripped in the kitchen and fell face-first onto the floor, hitting her nose. A few days later, a \ndoctor examined the child during a regularly-scheduled visit and concluded that her nose \n                                                           \n4 This condition is now more accurately known as VACTERL Association due to the \nrecognition of additional potential defects. It typically refers to the presence of at least \nthree of a recognized group of birth defects tending to have a non-random occurrence. \nBecause the numerous transcript references use the term \u201cVATER,\u201d we use it here.     \n-8- \nwas fine. In the days following the fall, the child was not lethargic and she engaged in \nnormal activities. On July 25, 2010, however, the child awoke with a bruised, swollen nose \nand yellow drainage. The child\u2019s mother took her to the hospital, where a CAT scan \nrevealed two nasal fractures. Marianne underwent emergency surgery to treat an \ninfection behind the fractures, and she remained hospitalized until August 3, 2010 while \nreceiving intravenous antibiotics.  \n{\u00b6 8} Defense counsel theorized at trial that the large subdural hematoma \nMarianne experienced two days later on August 5, 2010 may have been related to the \nchild\u2019s complex medical condition, the fracture she experienced when she fell on July 17, \n2010, and the resulting infection she suffered. In particular, defense counsel suggested \nthat Marianne\u2019s fall on July 17, 2010 may have caused a small hematoma that re-bled \nand became larger when the child jumped or fell from her bed on August 5, 2010. Dr. \nStevenson, the treating pediatric neurosurgeon, agreed that such a scenario \n\u201ctheoretically\u201d could occur if there was an older, minor subdural hematoma followed by \u201ca \nrepeat trauma to the exact, same place.\u201d He added, however, that he had never seen \nsuch a situation and did not see evidence of an older, minor hematoma when treating \nMarianne. There was no evidence from any witness that she had reinjured her nose. Dr. \nStevenson also testified that he had seen the facial CAT scan that had been taken earlier, \nwhich had revealed the broken nose, and although it only shows limited images of the \nbrain, there was no indication of a prior clot and no indication of a shift of the brain from \nleft to right. Finally, Dr. Stevenson found no connection between Marianne\u2019s serious injury \nand either her VATER Association or her recent nasal fracture. As indicated in testimony \npreviously quoted, he testified there was nothing to suggest a prior minor chronic  \n-9- \nhematoma.   \n{\u00b6 9} Dr. Kathi Makoroff, who was called by the State, is a pediatrician who \nspecializes in child abuse and is board certified in that field. She has been practicing in \nthat capacity at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Medical Center for 17 years. At the time of her March \n2014 testimony, she said she was the chair of the Ohio Chapter of the American Academy \nof Pediatrics Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, and president of the Ray Helfer \nSociety, an honorary society for physicians practicing in the area of child abuse. She was \na consultant in Marianne\u2019s treatment, and ruled out causes of the child\u2019s subdural \nhematoma other than a traumatic injury involving \u201ca great bit of force.\u201d She explained: \n\u201cWe do see these types of injuries in kids who have severe car accidents and are ejected \nfrom the car or [in] very severe accidents. Kids who have very severe falls, like falling out \nof the\u2014out of a window, you know, not on the first floor of the house but subsequent \nfloors of the house, and we also see it in children with inflicted injury or abusive head \ntrauma when they come in and they have injuries similar to\u2014to\u2014to what we see on \n[Marianne\u2019s] CAT scan.\u201d (T-2, 65). Dr. Makoroff ruled out as a possible cause of \nMarianne\u2019s injury a jump or a fall from the child\u2019s bed: \n So I could also rule out that history of a\u2014of a roll off of a bed or even \na jump off a\u2014off of a bed from something so small, you know, thirteen \ninches off of the floor and onto carpet, which, you know, obviously has some \npadding to it; the carpet itself has\u2014has some padding properties to it. And \nso I\u2019m left with inflicted injury or abusive head trauma. \n * * * Right so it goes back to your question about the amount of force \nrequired. So even though we can\u2019t give you\u2014we can't give you a number  \n-10-\nof the amount of force, it certainly lies between kids who, and you know, \nmost people know someone\u2014know a child and maybe some of the Jurors \nwere that child who, you know, went down the steps on a skateboard \nbecause it was fun, or was klutzy or climbed a lot and had lots of falls, and \nthose kids don\u2019t end up like this. Those kids don\u2019t come into the emergency \nroom emergently and then require surgery to evacuate the blood. So even \nthough those kids are either klutzy or very sort of rambunctious and often \ndoing things and\u2014and hitting their head requiring sutures or staples, you \nknow, to\u2014because they\u2019re hitting their head and getting\u2014and getting \nlacerations, they still don\u2019t\u2014they still don't cause these types of injuries. But \nthe really more forceful types of mechanisms, like a car accident, do. So the \nanswer to your question is even the rambunctious child who is maybe \njumping on the bed and even hits their head in the room, just\u2014just\u2014it\u2019s \nnot\u2014it's not enough injury to cause this type of subdural. \n * * * So again, I can\u2019t rule out there wasn\u2019t an impact to her head; I \nmean she doesn\u2019t have a skull fracture, but just because there isn\u2019t a skull \nfracture doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t impacted especially if she was impacted \nonto a soft surface. That may be enough of an impact to cause injury, but \nnot enough of an impact, or an impact onto the wrong type of surface to \ncause a skull fracture. Or certainly a shaking; if she was picked up and \nshaken violently, that would cause these types\u2014this type of subdural, these \ntypes of injuries. And of course there\u2019s no impact there; she wasn\u2019t actually \nimpacted onto a hard or soft surface, which would go along with her not  \n-11-\nhaving a skull fracture. \n(T-2, 72-78). \n{\u00b6 10} Dr. Makoroff stated that even a prior minor subdural hematoma, followed by \n\u201ca trivial fall like falling out of a bed thirteen inches\u201d high, would not have caused \nMarianne\u2019s injury. She opined that the child\u2019s injury was caused by \u201cabusive head \ntrauma,\u201d which she explained is the current terminology for what previously was known \nas \u201cshaken-baby syndrome.\u201d Dr. Makoroff testified that \u201cshaken-baby syndrome\u201d is an \n\u201cold term\u201d that means the \u201csame exact thing\u201d as \u201cabusive head trauma.\u201d In essence, Dr. \nMakoroff used the process of elimination to conclude that Marianne\u2019s injuries were not \naccidental.  \n{\u00b6 11} Dr. Makoroff also rejected the scenarios proposed by defense counsel. Her \nopinion ruled out the possibility that a \u201cshort fall\u201d could have caused Marianne\u2019s subdural \nhematoma on August 5, 2010. She testified that a \u201cshort fall\u201d potentially could \u201ccause a \nsubdural\u201d but not a large one like this child suffered: \n[Y]es, injury \u2013 a fall, and I have seen these \u2013 these cases my \u2013 \nmyself, many of them, where a fall does cause a \u2013 a subdural. In \nthose cases, there is frequently a skull fracture, and then there is a \nsmall amount of subdural blood underneath the skull fracture, and no \ndamage to the surrounding brain at all. So I just want to be clear that \nI would answer your question yes, a short fall can cause a subdural, \nbut no a short fall wouldn\u2019t cause a subdural like [Marianne] suffered. \n(T-2, 92).  \n{\u00b6 12} Dr. Makoroff also rejected the idea that the hematoma on August 5, 2010  \n-12-\nwas a \u201cre-bleed\u201d of a prior hematoma that resulted from the child\u2019s earlier fall and nasal \nfracture. She explained: \n So first of all I can rule that out with [Marianne]. Now to be very clear, \nwhen she had a CAT scan for her nose, they didn\u2019t image all of her brain; \nthey imaged a good part of it in looking at the note, but they didn\u2019t do a brain \nCT, they did a facial CT on her, so they did see a good bit of her brain in \nthat it all looked normal. So for your theory to work, she would have had\u2014\nhad to of had a large enough subdural initially, and they would have picked \nit up on that CAT scan. So I can feel confident saying no for that reason. I \ncan feel confident also saying no because if [Marianne] suffered a re-\nbleeding, she would not have been symptomatic the way she was. She\u2014\nshe was not really conscious, and her brain was being affected by the re-\nbleed, and that\u2019s never really been described in re-bleeding, and she \nrequired neurosurgery to take out the blood. And so that\u2019s why I can rule \nthat out.  \n I can also rule it out because Dr. Stevenson, and I talked to Dr. \nStevenson after the surgery and read his operative report, would have seen \nthis within the hematoma. He would have seen a bunch of older, trying to \nheal blood, with new blood as well. And he did not see that. \n(T-2, 94-95). Also in response to defense cross examination, she stated: \nSo as you pointed out, I wasn\u2019t there, you weren\u2019t there, so I \u2013 I don\u2019t \nknow what happened, you don\u2019t know what happened, but I can tell you \nwhat didn\u2019t happen. So it wasn\u2019t related to any of her past medical history.  \n-13-\nIt \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a direct cause of her nasal fracture from \u2013 from July, and it \ndidn\u2019t happen from her falling off of a bed or even jumping off of her bed \nand jumping into something in her room, if that in fact happened.  \n(T-2, 100-101).  \n{\u00b6 13} Dr. Makoroff was also cross examined in regard to a study in which a short \nfall resulted in a subdural hemorrhage. She expressed ample familiarity with the study of \nDr. John Plunkett regarding falls from playground equipment, which some have used to \nsupport that a subdural hematoma, and even death, can result from a short fall. Ultimately \nthough, her testimony was as we previously quoted, \u201ca short fall wouldn\u2019t cause a \nsubdural like [Marianne] suffered.\u201d (T-2, 92).  \n{\u00b6 14} On re-direct examination, Dr. Makoroff also testified that very few accidental \nfalls in children \u201cresult in retinal hemorrhages\u201d and that the retinal hemorrhages Marianne \nexperienced were larger and \u201cmore diffused throughout the whole retina\u201d than what might \noccur in a short fall. Dr. Makoroff added: \n * * * So when we see retinal hemorrhages we don\u2019t\u2014we\u2014we\u2014we\u2014\nwe, you know, again, it\u2019s a very sort of short list of medical causes; many of \nthem the same as subdurals that can cause retinal hemorrhages, none of \nthem [Marianne] had. And so then if we are left with injury, same thing as \nwhat I just testified to. Short household falls, even if we say they can cause \nretinal hemorrhages, which is rare, they don\u2019t cause retinal hemorrhages to \nthe degree of which [Marianne] had. \n(T-2, 116). \n{\u00b6 15} Dr. Michael Gray, a pediatric ophthalmologist at Cincinnati Children\u2019s  \n-14-\nHospital, testified that the retinas of both of Marianne\u2019s eyes had many and diffuse multi-\nlayered retinal hemorrhaging. He said there could be several causes for this, and he looks \nfor bleeding problems, infection in the eye, or a history of trauma. Regarding trauma he \ntestified \u201cgenerally it\u2019s to cause hemorrhages or bleeding in the retina, it would have to be \nsevere trauma; usually head trauma.\u201d ( Id. at 124). He also testified that swelling of the \nbrain, \u201cbrain edema by itself does not lead to retinal hemorrhages.\u201d (Id. at 135).   \n{\u00b6 16} As indicated, Jones\u2019 defense at trial consisted primarily of his attorney cross \nexamining the State\u2019s witnesses about Marianne\u2019s multiple medical problems, the \npossibility of re-bleeding of an old hematoma, whether a short fall could cause a subdural \nhematoma, and the several possible causes of retinal hemorrhage. Counsel was able to \nobtain several admissions regarding the possibility of the defense theories though not \nsufficient for the State\u2019s witnesses to alter their opinions. Defense counsel called no \nexperts to rebut the prosecution\u2019s experts. The only defense witness was Jones. He \ntestified that he went upstairs and found Marianne on the floor, limp and non-responsive. \nHe denied striking, throwing, or shaking the child. He also denied becoming angry or \nfrustrated with the child. He testified that he had no idea how her injuries occurred.  \n{\u00b6 17} In closing argument, the prosecutor stressed that \u201cno doctor or any other \nwitness ever said there is an old injury that\u2019s related to the injury [Marianne] suffered on \nAugust 5, 2010.\u201d The prosecutor described Jones\u2019 \u201cstory\u201d as \u201csimply inconceivable\u201d and \nargued that it \u201cdefies medical evidence[.]\u201d \n{\u00b6 18} After considering the evidence presented, the jury found Jones guilty on \none count of child endangering. The trial court imposed an eight-year prison sentence. \nThis court affirmed on direct appeal, rejecting arguments challenging the manifest weight  \n-15-\nand legal sufficiency of the State\u2019s evidence and an argument alleging prosecutorial \nmisconduct. With regard to the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, this court \nreasoned: \n In the case before us, the circumstantial evidence is compelling that \nJones physically abused Marianne, and thereby caused her serious \nphysical harm. When Marianne was left in his care, she did not have the \nbrain injury that she had after she was in his care. He was the only adult in \nher presence. By his admission, the three other children in the house were \non another floor, playing a video game. \n Drs. Stevenson and Makoroff ruled out possible causes of \nMarianne\u2019s injury other than physical abuse, either in the form of impact to \nMarianne\u2019s head against a soft surface, or severe shaking. Under the \ncircumstances, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Jones was the \nperson who caused Marianne\u2019s injury, if not intentionally, at the very least \nrecklessly, since a reasonable person would know that the impact to \nMarianne\u2019s head or the severe shaking necessary to cause her injury would \nlikely cause her serious physical harm. \nState v. Jones, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2014-CA-11, 2015-Ohio-196, \u00b6 30-31. \n \nII. Post-Conviction Proceedings \n \n{\u00b6 19} In December 2014, Jones filed an R.C. 2953.21 petition for post-conviction \nrelief with supporting evidentiary materials. (Doc. #43). Those materials included an \naffidavit and report from Dr. Robert Rothfeder, a board-certified emergency room \nphysician with more than 30 years of experience in emergency medicine involving all  \n-16-\nvarieties of adult and pediatric trauma, including brain-injury cases. The materials also \nincluded an affidavit from Kenneth Monson, a PhD associate professor in mechanical \nengineering and an adjunct assistant professor in bioengineering at the University of \nUtah, and an affidavit from Dr. Marvin Miller of Dayton Children\u2019s Hospital addressing the \nproper terminology for VATER Association. Finally, the materials included an affidavit \nfrom Jones\u2019 trial counsel, Andrew Wannemacher, who explained that he knew he needed \nthe assistance of an expert witness and that his failure to obtain one was not a \u201cstrategic \nmove.\u201d  \n{\u00b6 20} One of the documents attached to the post-conviction submission was the \nfirst page of an apparent two-page UVMC \u201cCT Head C\u201d scan report which, appellant \npoints out, stated: \u201c[T]here is a left hemispheric acute on chronic subdural hematoma.\u201d \nWhat appellant does not reference is that the document also states: \u201cGiven the acute on \nchronic nature of this finding, nonaccidental trauma must be suspected.\u201d (Petition, Exhibit \nE). The trial court scheduled the post-conviction petition for an evidentiary hearing.   \n{\u00b6 21} The trial court held a three-day hearing on Jones\u2019 petition in May and June \n2015. Jones presented testimony from Dr. Rothfeder and attorney Wannemacher as well \nas the videotaped deposition testimony from Monson. The State countered with testimony \nfrom its own expert, Dr. Robert Shapiro from Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital.  \n{\u00b6 22} Dr. Rothfeder, also a lawyer, trained as an internist and practiced as an \nemergency-room physician for more than 30 years, a discipline in which he was board \ncertified in 1996. He treated adults and children and estimated that about half were \nchildren. He left emergency-room practice in 2006. He said he continued with a part-time, \nabout one-half, clinical practice until he retired from patient care at the end of 2013. He  \n-17-\nhas not had a practice dedicated specifically to pediatrics, and he is not a neurologist. He \nsaid that over the past ten years he has developed a focused interest in child abuse and \ninfant brain injury. He spends the vast majority of his professional time consulting on \nmedical issues most of which are child abuse head-injury cases. In the last ten or fifteen \nyears, he has testified only for the defense. He estimated he has testified between one \nand two hundred times on this topic.  \n{\u00b6 23} Based on his review of the case, including Marianne\u2019s extensive medical \nrecords, Dr. Rothfeder opined that the child\u2019s serious medical problems related to VATER \nAssociation made her more \u201cfragile\u201d and vulnerable to the injury she sustained in this \ncase. Dr. Rothfeder has encountered only a \u201ccouple\u201d VATER Association patients in his \ncareer, but his treatment of them was for something peripheral. He acknowledged he has \nno clinical experience working with children with this association. (T-PCR-1, 23). Yet he \nopined that she was generally a \u201cfragile\u201d child who was \u201cmore vulnerable to injury of any \ntype. * * * I mean what she\u2019s made of just isn\u2019t as strong and viable as the tissue would \nbe in a normal individual.\u201d (Id. at 41). \n{\u00b6 24} Dr. Rothfeder explained that he had reviewed a CAT scan of the serious \nsubdural hematoma taken after the incident. Although he was not specifically qualified as \na radiologist or neurologist, he opined that the scan revealed the presence of \u201cnew\u201d blood \nand older blood, signifying the existence of a \u201cchronic subdural\u201d and an \u201cacute subdural\u201d \n * * * [W]hen you look at the scan there\u2019s\u2014there\u2019s mixed density in \nthe hematoma. In other words, the\u2014the\u2014the tissue and the blood products \nthat are seen on the scan look different in terms of the white and black \ndensities depending on the composition of the fluid and in this scan there  \n-18-\nwas a mixed density which indicated that the subdural consisted of a chronic \nsubdural, that is blood which had been present for a period of time which \nwas not new and which had been present for at least a number of weeks \nand possibly longer, perhaps months even. And within that there was acute \nbleeding. So there was new bleeding into the chronic subdural and that\u2014\nthat\u2019s a phenomenon that we refer to as re-bleeding of a chronic subdural \nand something that\u2019s seen not uncommonly with chronic subdurals. \n(T-PCR-1, 26-27). Notably, however, the CAT scan itself was not separately introduced \ninto evidence. Nor was the original radiologist\u2019s report, the first page of which we indicated \nwas attached to the petition, otherwise entered as an exhibit. Nor was the radiologist \ncalled by Jones\u2019 counsel in post-conviction proceedings even though the petition argued, \nin \u201cGround III\u201d of the incidents amounting to ineffective assistance of counsel, that Jones\u2019 \ntrial counsel was deficient \u201cwhen his attorney failed to call the Upper Valley Medical \nCenter treating physicians and radiologists as witnesses.\u201d (Petition at 38).   \n{\u00b6 25} When asked, Dr. Rothfeder did not render an opinion within a reasonable \ndegree of medical certainty as to the cause of what he surmised was a chronic subdural \nhematoma, and he could not indicate when it originated. Rather, he indicated that \u201cone of \nthe possibilities\u201d was Marianne\u2019s fall on July 17, 2010, which resulted in the nasal fracture \nand infection. He added: \n * * * However, it\u2019s entirely possible that you know other unwitnessed \nhead trauma that the child might have had at some point in the past could \nhave caused it or medical condition that\u2019s\u2014that complicated things could \nhave caused it. For instance, when the nasal hematoma and the result[ing]  \n-19-\ninfection occurred, a potential complication of an infection in the head like \nthat would be clotting or thrombosis in one of the veins inside the head \nthat\u2014that feeds the dura or that drains the dura and it\u2019s known among other \nthings that\u2014what we call cortical venous thrombosis. Thrombosis of one of \nthose veins can be a cause of subdurals. So a variety of possibilities are\u2014\nare in play and the\u2014the only one that I can really identify specifically as \npotentially causative would relate to the\u2014the trauma that caused the nasal \nfracture ten days or a couple of weeks preceding the August event.   \nT-PCR-1, 30. \n{\u00b6 26} With regard to the acute subdural hematoma that led to Jones\u2019 conviction, \nDr. Rothfeder testified: \n * * * The way that chronic subdurals can re-bleed relates to the \nspecific anatomy and pathology of the subdural. Once a chronic subdural \nforms, a membrane forms over the subdural and the membrane contains \ntiny little immature blood vessels and those\u2014those vessels are subject to \nre-bleeding and it\u2019s thought that re-bleeding in these instances, in these \nsmall blood vessels in the membrane of a subdural can\u2014it\u2019s thought that \nthose things\u2014that re-bleeding of these things can occur in the absence of \ntrauma, spontaneously or with mild trauma which might otherwise be \nincidental. Now understand that what I\u2019m talking about now is not the type \nof phenomenon that is now well understood or completely understood or \nhas been you know historically clarified over time. It\u2019s not the kind of thing \nthat physicians have a perfect handle on. So everything I\u2019m talking about  \n-20-\nremains in a \u2013 a state of incomplete understanding as \u2013 as medicine \npresently exists.  \n(T-PRC-1, 31-32).  \n{\u00b6 27} Dr. Rothfeder further testified that one of the underlying bases for his \nopinions was that \u201con top of that [his chronic re-bleed possibility] one thing we haven\u2019t \ndiscussed but I believe is contributory is the fact that on top of everything else, blood \ntesting when she was admitted to Cincinnati Children\u2019s indicated that the state of her \nblood coagulation was not normal at that point in time.\u201d (Id.) (Emphasis added). In more \nthan three pages of transcript testimony, he specifically described this poor coagulation \nand how \u201cit would have contributed to the expansion of the new bleed.\u201d That testimony is \nsimilar to the portion of Dr. Rothfeder\u2019s affidavit, submitted with the petition, where he was \ncritical of Dr. Makoroff\u2019s trial testimony to the effect that Marianne\u2019s coagulation was \nnormal. He went on to expound upon how the abnormal coagulation made this case \u201cas \ncomplex in terms of many different things going on as any I\u2019ve seen,\u201d (Id. at 33). And, he \ntestified her coagulation \u201cwas not safe.\u201d ( Id. at 36). But he was wrong. On cross \nexamination, it was pointed out that he had incorrectly referred to the coagulation testing \nfrom 9:16 p.m. in the evening of admission, after the intensive medical intervention of a \ntwo-hour brain surgery with multiple medications, and not the coagulation testing at the \ntime of admission at 4:40 p.m. in the afternoon. He had to admit that he was incorrect \nand, contrary to his affidavit and hearing testimony, that her coagulation studies were \nnormal upon admission when the hematoma had already formed.  \n{\u00b6 28} Dr. Rothfeder did acknowledge that what looks like \u201cnew\u201d blood and \u201cold\u201d \nblood when analyzing a hematoma on a CAT scan can be new blood that\u2019s moving. In  \n-21-\nhis opinion, formed from review of only the CAT scan, \u201cthat did not appear to me to have \nbeen the case with this mixed density [blood].\u201d When Rothfeder was cross examined  \nabout Dr. Stevenson\u2019s testimony that Stevenson saw no old blood upon surgically viewing \nMarianne\u2019s brain, Dr. Rothfeder testified he relies on \u201cwhat I\u2019ve been told by \nneurosurgeons\u201d (Id. at 49) that it is entirely possible that evacuation of an acute \nhematoma wouldn\u2019t allow visualization of old blood somewhere else in the subdural \nspace. So, in Dr. Rothfeder\u2019s estimation, the absence of old blood doesn\u2019t rule out its \npresence. However, his direct testimony about his own reading of the CAT scan had been \nthat the old blood and new blood was in the same place. After describing what he believed \nwas a chronic subdural, he said that \u201cwithin that [his suspected chronic subdural] there \nwas acute bleeding. So there was new bleeding into the chronic subdural ** * *.\u201d ( Id. at \n27).  \n{\u00b6 29} With regard to the cause of Marianne\u2019s injury on August 5, 2010, Dr. \nRothfeder opined: \u201c* * * I mean this is the farthest thing from a\u2014a simple case to attempt \nto analyze and\u2014and draw conclusions from and\u2014and I think that\u2014that really explains \nthe\u2014you know the opinions that I\u2019m attempting to express here in saying that I don\u2019t \nbelieve it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s really possible to draw definite conclusions in terms of the cause of that \nacute subdural with any reasonable certainty.\u201d (Id. at 33). In his ultimate conclusion, Dr. \nRothfeder stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think that given everything I\u2019ve discussed that it\u2019s possible to\u2014\nto conclude that those injuries were the result of child abuse.\u201d (Id. at 37). A fair evaluation \nof his testimony is that he does not believe in the diagnosis of abusive head trauma  \nbecause one cannot divine intent from an unobserved mechanism of injury. He agrees \nthe diagnosis is accepted by the majority of pediatricians and the position papers of the  \n-22-\nnumber of organizations that support the diagnosis, which he gratuitously referred to as \n\u201cthe political statements that derive from those organizations.\u201d (Id. at 54). \n{\u00b6 30} On cross examination, Dr. Rothfeder expressed his belief that a \nbiomechanical engineer would be better suited than Dr. Makoroff to assess whether a \nshort fall could have caused Marianne\u2019s injury. While acknowledging that biomechanical \nengineers typically do not work in emergency rooms, he explained: \u201cWell, the\u2014if the\u2014\nthe kinematics and so forth of an injury were rarely\u2014were really rarely contributory to \nwhat I was doing in the emergency room. I mean for instance if\u2014if someone comes in \nyou know with a history of a particular injury, my job is to diagnose and treat the injury.\u201d \nConcerning Dr. Makoroff\u2019s opinion, and consistent with his rejection of the abusive head \ntrauma diagnosis, he added: \n * * * [W]e\u2019re not dealing with an issue of medical treatment. Dr. \nMakoroff\u2019s role in this case didn\u2019t involve contributing to the treatment in this \ncase. It involved coming to a medical legal conclusion and I think that \nphysicians have nothing more than anecdotal experience to attempt to \nconclude for instance whether a you know a\u2014a particular short fall could \nhave caused a given injury. That\u2019s why I\u2019m critical.  \n(Id. at 46). \n{\u00b6 31} With regard to the alleged \u201cabusive head trauma\u201d at issue, Dr. Rothfeder \nopined that \u201cthe medical diagnosis really is head trauma\u201d and that \u201cwhether it\u2019s abusive \nor not is a medical legal conclusion.\u201d  \n{\u00b6 32} Dr. Rothfeder additionally maintained that the presence or absence of \nretinal hemorrhages in this case had no diagnostic value to him, partially because he  \n-23-\nbelieved they could have been caused by the \u201cpresence of an expanding subdural \nhematoma\u201d (Id. at 52) itself, which in his opinion had an uncertain cause. Rothfeder was \nnot qualified as an opthamologist, and the foregoing opinion was directly contrary to the \npreviously quoted testimony of Dr. Gray, the only ophthalmologist who testified in this \nrecord. Finally, he disputed whether severe shaking ever can damage bridging veins in \nthe brain and result in a subdural hematoma.  \n{\u00b6 33} Jones\u2019 other expert witness, Kenneth Monson, testified via video deposition. \nMonson, who holds a doctorate in mechanical engineering, also did three years of post-\ndoctoral work in conjunction with the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of \nCalifornia San Francisco. There he collaborated with neurosurgeons in studying the \napplication of force and resulting trauma. In addition, he filled a research position at a \nbrain and spinal injury center. His doctoral thesis involved \u201cmechanical and failure \nproperties of human cerebral blood vessels.\u201d The study concerned \u201cthe response of the \ncerebral blood vessels to head trauma.\u201d  \n{\u00b6 34} Monson testified that, based on his experience and study, the acceleration \nlevels from shaking someone are too low to produce a head injury such as bleeding on \nthe brain. According to Monson, the lowest level of G-forces that might injure a six-month-\nold child is 50Gs, whereas a subdural hematoma might be expected to result at around \n85Gs. Monson testified, however, that the peak accelerations associated with shaking \nare around 15Gs. He stated that these numbers are peer reviewed and generally \naccepted. He testified that greater G-forces would be required to injure an older child.   \n{\u00b6 35} Monson also discussed \u201cshort falls\u201d that might occur inside a residence. He \nrecognized that a multitude of variables must be considered to assess whether the force  \n-24-\ninvolved could produce a given injury. They include the height of the fall, whether the \nhead impacted, what part of the head impacted, the characteristics of the floor, whether \nanything broke the fall, any physical acceleration before the fall (such as jumping or \nrunning), etc. With regard to Marianne\u2019s specific injury at issue, Monson, who admits he \nis not trained in medicine (Monson Depo. at 51), opined: \n So, if\u2014if she had been standing on the bed, for example, and \nsomehow managed to get herself to the point of the floor, whatever that \nwas\u2014I don\u2019t know what the distance from the bed was where she was \nfound, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s feasible. \n But if she were standing on the bed and fell and hit her head, there \nwould be\u2014and I should say, if it were an unprotected fall\u2014if she struck her \nhead squarely on the floor without any protection, then that would produce \na significant acceleration that would potentially be in the ballpark of what we \nhave been talking about for injury thresholds.  \n If we\u2014if we talk about\u2014and I should say this is all for a healthy \ninfant\u2014or for a healthy child. There\u2014there aren\u2019t really any data out there \nsuggesting that\u2014that the child has previous\u2014a pre-existing condition like \nchronic bleeding, chronic subdural\u2014I think that, based on my review of the \nrecords, there was actually mixed density blood in the CT scan suggesting \nthat there was blood before, you know, that would have been present days \nbefore this particular incident. \n But, anyway, so that matters, but falling off the bed if she is standing \non it is different from if she is standing in the middle of the floor and  \n-25-\nsomehow fell down, which is also different from if she is lying on the bed \nand rolls off the bed.  \n Clearly, those different scenarios in order of decreasing height \nbecome less and less severe and\u2014to the point where I don\u2019t think you could \nachieve the levels of acceleration required to produce injury from that\u2014from \nrolling off that 13-inch bed.  \n(Id. at 40-41). \n{\u00b6 36} In Monson\u2019s opinion, depending on how such a fall occurred, the range of \npossibility of a serious injury would go from \u201calmost impossible to do it to it could happen.\u201d \nMore specifically, he explained that \u201cthe accelerations could range from, you know, \nsignificantly over 100Gs down to 0, basically.\u201d Monson stated that he was unaware of any \nobserved case in which shaking had produced a subdural hematoma. He was aware of \nan observed case in which a \u201cshort fall\u201d had produced such an injury. \n{\u00b6 37} On cross examination, Monson conceded that serious injuries from short \nfalls are \u201cpretty rare\u201d and \u201cquite unlikely.\u201d (Id. at 67). He also stated that he could not draw \na conclusion in the present case as to whether a short fall in fact produced Marianne\u2019s \ninjury. Monson recognized that if Marianne had been shaken and then \u201cslammed\u201d against \nsomething causing an impact, the slamming would significantly increase the acceleration \nand deceleration levels. He reiterated, however, that \u201cthe accelerations associated with \nshaking are very low compared to the thresholds for injury * * * like a subdural \nhematoma[.]\u201d (Id. at 82). Finally, when asked whether the injury in this case was from a \nshort fall he said \u201cI can\u2019t actually draw an opinion on what - - what caused it.\u201d (Id. at 68). \n{\u00b6 38} Jones\u2019 final witness, Andrew Wannemacher, testified about his efforts as  \n-26-\ndefense counsel at trial. Specifically, he discussed his cross examination of the State\u2019s \nmedical experts. Wannemacher also admitted realizing, at the outset of his involvement, \nthat \u201cthere needed to be an expert for the defense to not only explain the medical \ndocumentation that had been provided by the State, but also to counteract Dr. Makoroff\u2019s \nshaken baby syndrome or abusive head trauma\u201d theory. Wannemacher explained that he \ndid file a motion for a medical expert. He recalled the trial court required him first to get a \nmedical opinion that an expert would be helpful to the defense and to provide a fee \nestimate. To do that, Wannemacher contacted a Dr. Miller at Dayton Children\u2019s Hospital, \nwho agreed to review the documentation but refused to participate as a trial witness. \nWannemacher testified that Dr. Miller never followed up, or indicated whether he had \nreviewed any materials. Wannemacher never received an opinion from him. \nWannemacher contacted other doctors but concluded on his own that their fees were \nbeyond what the trial court would authorize. As a result, he never obtained an expert \nwitness to assist with the defense. He also never consulted a medical or biomechanical \nexpert to determine whether a short fall could have produced Marianne\u2019s injury. \nWannemacher testified that he reviewed approxim ately 2,000 pages of medical records \nhimself but did not \u201cadequately understand what they meant.\u201d He testified that his failure \nto obtain the assistance of an expert witness was not a strategic decision. After the first \ncase against Jones was nolled, and then refiled, Wannemacher did not refile his motion \nfor an expert witness because he assumed that he would not be able to get one. \nAccording to Wannemacher, he would have called a medical expert to testify if he had \none.  \n{\u00b6 39} The only other witness at the hearing was Dr. Robert Shapiro, a child-abuse  \n-27-\npediatrician from Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital, who was called to testify by the State.    \nDr. Shapiro is the director of the Mayerson Center for Safe and Healthy Children at the \nhospital, is an attending physician there, and is board certified in both pediatrics and child \nabuse pediatrics. He has been practicing pediatrics for over thirty years in Ohio and \npreviously for seven years in New York. He has testified in court in those fields about \ntwice a month for the last 25 years and estimated the totals would be between 400 and \n500 times. Although he said he almost always testifies on behalf of the prosecution, he \ndid serve as an expert for the Baltimore Public Defender\u2019s Office. He has reviewed \u201clots \nand lots of cases for the defense\u201d (T-PCR-2, 38), but if he made a determination that child \nabuse was not warranted, \u201cthe case doesn\u2019t go,\u201d so he has only testified in court a couple \nof times for the defense. (Id. at 38-39).      \n{\u00b6 40} Based on his review of the records in this case, Dr. Shapiro agreed that \nMarianne was a \u201cvery complex medical patient\u201d (T-PCR-2, 19). But he rejected Dr. \nRothfeder\u2019s opinion that the child\u2019s VATER Association or any other existing medical \ncomplications predisposed her to, or contributed to, the injury she suffered on August 5, \n2010. He observed that her liver was functioning well, which is critical because that is \nresponsible for many aspects that keep a child from bleeding (T-PCR-2, 15). He also \ndisagreed with Dr. Rothfeder\u2019s opinion that a short fall could have produced a subdural \nhematoma like Marianne experienced that day. According to Dr. Shapiro, the child\u2019s \ninjuries were consistent with abuse rather than a short fall. Dr. Shapiro also opined that \nbiomechanical engineering studies cannot accurately assess the forces generated from \ndifferent traumatic events involving children. With regard to the latter, he explained: \nI would tell you that the biomechanical studies are flawed right now  \n-28-\nand too limited to be abuse (sic) [of use] to making a diagnosis and \nunderstanding cause and effect. That\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t have hope \none day that biomechanical studies will be more informative in this area and \nthey are still undergoing but it\u2019s a remarkably difficult thing to study. The \nhead is far more complex than a lake. We barely have biomechanical \nstudies to understand what happens when a child falls. It\u2019s way too \ncomplicated in terms of mass of the child, size of the bone, angle that the \nbone strikes, the manner that the child fell, how the bone ends up, what \nparts of the other parts of the body, so we\u2019re beginning to understand a little \nbit more about what type of all, stair falls might result to what type fractures. \nThe head is unbelievably more complex than a femur. And we have \u2013 we \nprobably actually have \u2013 will never have any way to understand why type of \nangular and other forces are required to cause a bridging vein to rupture \nand what different individual factors are involved, so do I actually have hope \nthat biomechanical engineers will actually be able to tell us what actually \nhappens? No, I actually don\u2019t. Maybe they will. I can tell you that we have \nlots of data and lots of experience from accidental falls, from witnessed falls, \nwe have lots of experimental data that tells us about children who we know \nhave been abused because of a multitude of other reasons who have \ninjuries exactly like [Marianne] has and we have lots of experience knowing \nwhat kinds of injuries happen to kids who fall. So that\u2019s the data that we \nhave. That\u2019s good data. It\u2019s not biomechanical data.  \n(T-PCR-2, 51-52).    \n-29-\n{\u00b6 41} Dr. Shapiro compellingly contradicted  Dr. Rothfeder regarding whether  \nMarianne had an older, chronic subdural hematoma and a newer, acute subdural \nhematoma, i.e., \u201cold\u201d blood and \u201cnew\u201d blood, giving four distinct reasons why Rothfeder\u2019s \nsupposition is incorrect.  \n* * *A number of reasons. So the radiographic appearance actually \nshows as you correctly said mixed densities on the CT Scan. And what the \nCT Scan shows is the radiographic appearance from the computed \ntomography scan of what is inside the cranium. And there is \u2013 there is fluid \nbetween the brain and the sku (sic) \u2013 skull, that\u2019s within a particular space \nthat is correctly referred to as a subdural compartment, subdural space and \nit shows a mixed density. [Rothfeder] is correct about that. The \ninterpretation of what those mixed densities are cannot be determined with \nany reliability based upon the CT Scan alone. One explanation is exactly as \nhe states, that it\u2019s old blood with new blood bleeding into that space and \nmixing with the old blood. That is one possibility. Then the other possibility \nis that this is all new blood that shows different densities because what we \nbelieve is movement of the blood, in other words active bleeding. So an \ninformed radiologist cannot make that determination and I am aware that \nmany radiologists are \u2013 are not current and they believe that they know and \nthey\u2019re \u2013 they don\u2019t, they\u2019re wrong. So that\u2019s number one. Number two, in \nthis particular instance, [Marianne] had a CT Scan of her sinuses for \nevaluation of the nasal fracture and there was less than two weeks, I don\u2019t \nforget- I don\u2019t remember the exact number of days, maybe ten, eleven days  \n-30-\napart. That CT Scan shows us the space between the brain and the skull, \nthe subdural space. We don\u2019t see the entire subdural space but we see the \nfrontal lobes and there is no fluid in there. So in terms of chronic or even \u2013 \nchronic blood on top of old blood well it would have been there, should have \nbeen there at the time and there was no evidence that it was there. So in \nthis case, although radiographically we can\u2019t say whether this is new blood \non old or all new, we do have the benefit of a fairly recent CT Scan and the \nblood was not there. So that\u2019s a powerful argument to suggest that this is \nnot new on top of chronic but it\u2019s all new. And then lastly, not lastly, number \nthree, this child had surgery and the neurosurgeon opened the child\u2019s skull \nand looked at what was in there and saw no evidence of chronic subdural. \nSo we wouldn\u2019t expect chronic subdural and the neurosurgeon didn\u2019t see \nany chronic subdural. And then number four, we recognize that there is a \npossibility that children who have abnormal subdural space, which would \nbe chronic subdural fluid in the space, that they might re-bleed, they might \nhave bleeding on top of that chronic fluid with minimal impact. This is area- \nactually a area of study that we are still learning about. We \u2013 we know a \nlimited amount. Some people actually don\u2019t believe that this predisposes \nchildren. I have \u2013 I happen to be somebody who does believe that it \u2013 it \ndoes predispose to bleeding. However, the bleeding that it predisposes to \nhas nothing to do with the kind of bleeding and life threatening event that \n[Marianne] had. So, I would tell you that beyond a reasonable degree of \nmedical certainty this is new blood and we had absolutely no reason to  \n-31-\nbelieve there\u2019s old blood in there and we have some evidence to suggest \nthat there was no old blood in there.  \n(T-PCR-2, 24-26).   \n{\u00b6 42} Dr. Shapiro also rejected Dr. Rothfeder\u2019s opinion that Marianne\u2019s retinal \nhemorrhages had no diagnostic value. Dr. Shapiro agreed that retinal hemorrhaging is \nnot \u201cpathogonomic\u201d (meaning a definitive diagnostic sign indicative of a particular \ncondition) but he testified it was irresponsible to ignore it. Dr. Shapiro also disagreed with   \nDr. Rothfeder\u2019s opinion that the existence of the subdural hematoma itself may have \ncaused the retinal hemorrhages in this case. He stated: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cause hemorrhaging \nlike we saw in [Marianne].\u201d (Id. at 30).   \n{\u00b6 43} Dr. Shapiro testified that  he disagreed with Dr. Rothfeder\u2019s suggestion in \nhis report that a short fall could have caused Marianne\u2019s injury.  \n* * * He is right, and I agree, that short falls can at times cause \nunexpected intracranial injury including bleeding and we \u2013 I recognize this. \nSometimes remarkably minimal impact results in intracranial bleeding. The \n\u2013 the types of bleeding that occurs from a short fall is not the type of bleeding \nand not the scenario that we see in [Marianne]. Typically, short fall \nbleedings \u2013 bleeding from short falls will be directly on the site of impact. \n[Marianne]\u2019s was in the classic distribution that we see in kids who have \nsuffered shaken injuries. And children who have trauma and head injury \nfrom short falls will, at most, have very minimal retinal hemorrhaging. \nTypically, they will have no retinal hemorrhages, that\u2019s bleeding behind the \neyes. When they do have bleeding behind the eyes, it\u2019s limited to a small  \n-32-\npart of the retina. [Marianne] had bleeding in multiple layers and devastating \nbleeding. So, this is frankly as a physician it would be irresponsible for me \nto suggest that [Marianne\u2019s] intracranial injury was a result of a short fall.  \n     *  *  *  \n* * * I\u2019ve certainly seen kids who have unexpected injury from such \nminor falls as falling back on the back of the head. These are unusual, they \ncan happen, but they don\u2019t look like [Marianne]\u2019s injuries. So, it\u2019s my \nexperience includes kids who fall off of couches, fall off of beds, fall off of \nchanging tables, fall off of bunk beds, kids who fall off the swings, kids who \nfall in playgrounds, kids who get their heads knocked in sporting injuries, \nthese are all bread and butter pediatric emergency medicine type findings \nand they don\u2019t look anything like the injuries that [Marianne] presented with. \n* * *  \n(Id. at 16-18). \n{\u00b6 44} With regard to whether abusive head trauma or shaken baby syndrome is \nwidely accepted, Shapiro testified it is widely accepted in a large number of medical fields. \nIn regard to those who do not believe in the diagnosis, he said:  \n* * * It\u2019s a tiny fraction of the medical community that speaks a very \nloud voice. There\u2019s broad acceptance and concurrence among \nneurosurgeons, neurologists, radiologists, pediatricians in the diagnosis of \nshaken baby syndrome. We have no debate. There is no debate in the \nmedical field, except for a small handful of individuals who, for whatever \nreasons, feel that they need to speak very loudly about a so-called debate.  \n-33-\nThe debate is trumped up and doesn\u2019t exist.  \n(Id. at 33). \n{\u00b6 45} In conclusion, Dr. Shapiro opined that Marianne\u2019s injury was inconsistent \nwith an accident and was indicative of abusive head trauma. On cross examination, he \nelaborated on that opinion: \u201c* * * But you\u2019ve got retinal hemorrhages in multiple layers, \nyou\u2019ve got terrible intracranial bleeding, you got no serious trauma. So as a responsible \nphysician, the\u2014any diagnosis other than child abuse would be rather difficult to come up \nwith.\u201d (Id. at 55).  \nThe trial court decision  \n{\u00b6 46} Based on the evidence presented, the trial court overruled Jones\u2019 post-\nconviction relief petition in an October 2016 decision and judgment entry. (Doc. #68). It \nheld that attorney \u201cWannemacher\u2019s representation of the defendant was not objectively \nunreasonable, the defendant was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance, and the \ndefendant has failed to show that the result of the trial would not [sic] have been different \nbut for counsel\u2019s representation.\u201d The trial court reasoned that Wannemacher had \nengaged in effective cross examination of the State\u2019s experts. It discounted Monson\u2019s \nexpert testimony, pointing out that no biomechanical studies ever have been performed \nmeasuring the effect of forces on the brains of live humans. The trial court additionally \nfound \u201clittle support\u201d for Jones\u2019 \u201cre-bleed\u201d theory.  \n{\u00b6 47} With regard to Wannemacher\u2019s failure to secure any expert witnesses, the \ntrial court concluded that counsel\u2019s failure to do so \u201cdoes not rise to the level of ineffective \nassistance of counsel, since the defendant has not shown a reasonable probability that \nthe testimony of additional experts would change the outcome of this case.\u201d The trial court  \n-34-\nfound that Dr. Rothfeder\u2019s testimony about short falls and retinal hemorrhages was \u201ccalled \ninto question\u201d by the contrary opinions of Dr. Makoroff and Dr. Shapiro, who the trial court \nfound more credible largely because Dr. Rothfeder lacked \u201cclinical experience\u201d to testify \nabout a child with Marianne\u2019s \u201ccomplicated and unusual medical conditions.\u201d The trial \ncourt also credited Dr. Shapiro\u2019s testimony that the nature of Marianne\u2019s retinal \nhemorrhages and extensive subdural hematoma were inconsistent with a short fall. In \naddition, the trial court found no credible evidence of any \u201cacute on chronic\u201d re-bleeding.  \n{\u00b6 48} As for Monson, the trial court noted that his experience is laboratory in \nnature and that hospitals do not employ biomechanical engineers. The trial court \ndetermined that his testimony was not \u201cparticularly probative of the issues\u201d in this case. \nThe trial court also pointed out that Monson had discounted confessions involving injuries \nto shaken babies because the confessions might have been false or the defendants might \nhave both shaken and struck the victims. The trial court then reasoned: \n Dr. Makoroff\u2019s testimony at trial was that [Marianne] suffered abusive \nhead trauma, the likes of which are consistent with shaking and impact with \na soft surface. The defendant was not prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure \nto call an expert to testify on his behalf. [Marianne\u2019s] complex medical \nhistory causes Dr. Rothfeder to erroneously conclude she is chronically \nfragile and that must be why she was so badly injured. Dr. Makoroff and Dr. \nShapiro, whose entire careers have exclusively involved the care and \ntreatment of children, have the necessary medical training and clinical \nexperience to know, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that \n[Marianne] suffered abusive injuries, consistent with their experience with  \n-35-\nboth abuse injuries and accidental short falls. The proposed expert \ntestimony would not have discredited Dr. Makoroff or Dr. Stevenson\u2019s \ntestimony and would not have affected the outcome of the case. \n{\u00b6 49} Finally, the trial court found no ineffective assistance of counsel based on \nWannemacher\u2019s failure to call witnesses from Upper Valley Medical Center to testify \nabout the UVMC CT scan reference to an acute-on-chronic subdural hematoma or his \nfailure to impeach Dr. Makoroff with UVMC records on that issue. The trial court reasoned \nthat Wannemacher had conducted effective cross examination and that there was \u201clittle \nmedical support\u201d for the acute-on-chronic theory.  \nIII. Analysis of Present Appeal \n{\u00b6 50} Jones has appealed from the trial court\u2019s denial of post-conviction relief. \nThe governing statute, R.C. 2953.21, provides that \u201c[a]ny person who has been convicted \nof a criminal offense * * * and who claims that there was such a denial or infringement of \nthe person\u2019s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution \nor the Constitution of the United States * * * may file a petition in the court that imposed \nsentence, stating the grounds for relief relied upon, and asking the court to vacate or set \naside the judgment or sentence or to grant other appropriate relief.\u201d R.C. \n2953.21(A)(1)(a).  \n{\u00b6 51} We review a trial court\u2019s denial of post-conviction relief for an abuse of \ndiscretion. State v. Sapp, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2015-CA-43, 2017-Ohio-1467, \u00b6 6. An abuse \nof discretion implies an arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable attitude on the part of \nthe trial court. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). \n\u201cA decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process that would support  \n-36-\nthat decision.\u201d Parrett v. Wright , 2017-Ohio-764, 85 N.E.3d 1067, \u00b6 13 (2d Dist.). \nMoreover, we have previously indicated that we defer to the trial court\u2019s finding with regard \nto credibility in post- conviction proceedings. State v. Hathaway , 2015-Ohio-5488, 55 \nN.E.3d 634, \u00b6 21 (2d Dist.). We have recognized that during an evidentiary hearing on a \npost-conviction relief petition, the trial court serves as the trier of fact and is charged with \nassessing the credibility of the witnesses. State v. Robinson, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2013-\nCA-33, 2014-Ohio-1663, \u00b6 36; State v. Hamilton, 2d Dist. Clark No. 98 CA 98, 2000 WL \n282303, *5 (March 17, 2000). \n{\u00b6 52} Jones\u2019 petition alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, which can \nconstitute grounds for post-conviction relief. State v. Robinson, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2013-\nCA-33, 2014-Ohio-1663, \u00b6 20. He claimed ineffective assistance based on, among other \nthings, Wannemacher\u2019s failure to retain one or more expert witnesses to assist in his \ndefense. A defendant is deprived of effective assistance of counsel when (1) counsel\u2019s \nperformance is deficient and (2) that deficient performance prejudices the defendant. \nStrickland v. Washington , 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To \nestablish prejudice, a defendant must do more than show that counsel\u2019s deficient \nperformance had a conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding. State v. \nHathaway, 2015-Ohio-5488, 55 N.E.3d 634, \u00b6 12 (2d Dist.), quoting Strickland at 693. For \nineffective assistance of counsel to cause prejudice, such a result does not have to be \nshown by a preponderance of the evidence. \u201cThe defendant must show that there is a \nreasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the \nproceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient \nto undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id., at 694.   \n-37-\nGrounds asserted in the post-conviction petition. \n{\u00b6 53} Specifically, in his petition, Jones raises four distinct grounds as a bases for \nrelief. We review these grounds and the trial court\u2019s disposition of them in an order that \nfacilitates our analysis. The first raised ground is that trial counsel \u201cfailed to reasonably \ninvestigate and challenge the medical records in the case.\u201d (Doc. #43 at 32). The focus \nof this contention is that counsel should have done more to challenge Dr. Makaroff\u2019s \nopinions. Jones asserts that Marianne \u201cdid, in fact have a bleeding disorder\u201d (Id. at 33), \nthat a short fall could not be ruled out as a cause of the injury because Monson said a \nshort fall is of much higher acceleration than shaking, and that Makaroff\u2019s elimination of \na re-bleed possibility went unchallenged. Essentially, this ground of the petition claims \nthe medical records demonstrate Dr. Makaroff was wrong on the issues of \u201cbleeding \ndisorder, short fall, and acute on chronic subdural hematoma.\u201d (Id. at 35). The trial court \nreasonably found no support for this ground, and we agree.  \n{\u00b6 54} With regard to the medical records supporting the notion that Marianne had \na \u201cbleeding disorder,\u201d the trial court concluded that contention was based on a \n\u201cmisstatement,\u201d which we characterize as a plain mistake, by the medical expert Jones \npresented. No further consideration of a failure to present evidence of a non-existent \nbleeding disorder is warranted.  \n{\u00b6 55} With regard to injury from a short fall, a term for which there is no apparent \naccepted definition, the trial court noted that the essence of Monson\u2019s testimony was only \nthat impact from a short fall would produce larger accelerations than shaking. We believe \nin addition that Monson\u2019s testimony also supports a biomechanical opinion that shaking \nalone would not cause Marianne\u2019s subdural hematoma. But, in any event, we agree with  \n-38-\nthe trial court that Monson\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot particularly probative of the issues \ninvolved\u201d in the post-conviction proceeding and would have had \u201cnegligible probative \nvalue.\u201d We note that although Dr. Makaroff testified that such an injury could result from \nbeing \u201cshaken violently,\u201d her opinion of abusive head trauma included the potential of an \n\u201cimpact to her head\u201d (T-2, 78) or slamming onto a soft or hard surface ( Id. at 87). Her \ntestimony that this type of injury \u201crequires a great bit of force\u201d (T-2, 63) is not inconsistent \nwith Monson\u2019s. The inconsistency between Monson\u2019s testimony and that of Dr. Makaroff\u2019s \nis Monson\u2019s opinion that shaking alone does not result in sufficient G-force to result in an \ninjury like Marianne\u2019s. We also note from the testimony that we have quoted, Monson\u2019s \nadmission that he could not say Marianne\u2019s injuries were from a short fall (Monson Depo., \n68) and that such results are \u201cpretty rare.\u201d (Id. at 67). The trial court also considered the \npost-conviction testimony of Dr. Shapiro to the effect that Marianne\u2019s injury was not the \nresult of a short fall. In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that \nthe post-conviction evidence about the possibility of a short fall would not have made any \nd i f f e r e n c e .             \n{\u00b6 56} In his petition, Appellant argues that \u201cDr. Stevenson admitted that he would \nnot have been able to see the old blood because of the active bleeding in [Marianne\u2019s] \nbrain at the time.\u201d (Doc. #43 at 34). We believe that argument is inconsistent with the \nentirety of Dr. Stevenson\u2019s testimony. Dr. Stevenson concluded there was no evidence \nof a prior subdural hematoma. We have also quoted Dr. Shapiro\u2019s testimony on the \nsubject, which we referred to as compelling. On this record, no reasonable juror would \nconclude that Marianne had a prior subdural hematoma or a re-bleed thereof.         \n{\u00b6 57} Ground III of the petition asserts that counsel was ineffective when he \u201cfailed  \n-39-\nto call the Upper Valley Medical Center treating physicians and Radiologists as \nwitnesses.\u201d (Doc. #43 at 38). We observe that if this ground were sufficient to constitute \nineffective assistance of counsel, a conclusion we do not embrace, current counsel has \nrepeated it. Those potential witnesses were not called to the post-conviction hearing. \nConsequently, petitioner has presented no evidence that calling those witnesses would \nhave made any difference. On this ground, the trial court wrote that \u201cthere is little medical \nsupport that there was an acute on chronic subdural hematoma that caused [Marianne\u2019s] \nhematoma. The CT scan from UVMC alone is not sufficient to make that determination. \nThe CT scan reveals the possibility of mixed-density blood but that is not substantiated \nby the prior facial CT scan from her nasal fracture showing no subdural hematoma at all \nor Dr. Stevenson\u2019s observation of [Marianne] during brain surgery.\u201d (Doc# 68 at14).  We \ndo not find the trial court was unreasonable in rejecting this ground for relief in the petition.  \n{\u00b6 58} Enumerated Ground IV of the petition states that trial counsel was \nineffective when he \u201cfailed to impeach Dr. Makaroff with medical records that were readily \navailable\u201d. (Doc.# 43, 40) The medical records specifically itemized are a) the UVMC \nrecords to contradict that there was no evidence of an acute on chronic subdural \nhematoma and b) the Children\u2019s Hospital records regarding a bleeding disorder. \nPetitioner argued that introduction of these records would have impeached Dr. Makaroff\u2019s \ntestimony. In reverse order, there is no record that demonstrates a bleeding disorder at \nthe time of admission to Children\u2019s. And, there is no reasonable possibility the UVMC CT \nscan record we have discussed at length would have had any influence on Dr. Makaroff\u2019s \ntestimony let alone the speculation that it would have impeached her testimony. There is \nno reasonable probability that this ground would have impacted the trial whatsoever.      \n-40-\nGround II, failure to retain an expert  \n{\u00b6 59} The remaining Ground II for relief is that Jones\u2019 counsel was ineffective \n\u201cwhen his attorney failed to retain an expert to provide trial testimony\u201d. (Doc. #43 at 35). \nIn our opinion, because trial counsel did not sufficiently exhaust attempts to obtain the \nassistance of or the testimony of an expert witness, and he was therefore not in a position \nto make an informed decision whether or not to call an expert to testify, we conclude the \ntrial court\u2019s decision finding no deficient performance by Wannemacher was \nunreasonable. Nonetheless, on this record, given the trial and post-conviction evidence, \nwe conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding there is not a reasonable \nprobability of a different result and denying the post-conviction motion for relief.  \nA. Deficient Representation \n{\u00b6 60} We find it unreasonable  to conclude that W annemacher prov ided non-\ndeficient representation by failing to engage an expert to assist in the defense and to \nallow counsel to be able to make an informed decision whether to have that expert testify.   \nWe do not dispute that Wannema cher himself prepared for the issues in the trial. A \nsummary of Jones\u2019 contentions in his post-conviction evidence is that 1) Marianne was a \ncomplex patient, a fact that contributed to her injury, 2) there is a possibility of an acute-\non-chronic hematoma, 3) a short fall can cause a subdural hematoma, 4) Marianne had \na bleeding disorder, and 5) a retinal hemorrhage is not diagnostic. We eliminate the \nbleeding disorder because it did not exist. With regard to each of the other post-conviction  \ncontentions, Wannemacher\u2019s cross examination at trial and his testimony at the post-\nconviction-relief hearing both reflect significant preparation to show he was familiar with \nand inquired about each of the contentions raised in post-conviction, and he was able to  \n-41-\nobtain several concessions from the State\u2019s witnesses.   \n{\u00b6 61} In the case of Flick v. Warren, 465 Fed.Appx. 461 (6th Cir. 2012), the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals indicated in a 1998 shaken-baby death case that it was not \nineffective assistance of counsel to decide not to further seek an expert after counsel \nreceived unfavorable responses from three doctors he had contacted for help. Under \nthose circumstances, \u201ceffective assistance of counsel does not require counsel to \ncontinue contacting experts until he has found one.\u201d Id. at 464. On the other hand, here \nwe conclude Wannemacher\u2019s efforts to obtain an expert were simply insufficient to \ndemonstrate that he made a strategic choice to proceed without an expert. \u201cStrategic \nchoices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the \nextent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation. In \nother words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a \nreasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d Strickland at 690-\n691.  \n{\u00b6 62} On this record, we see no sound reason for Wannemacher\u2019s admitted \nfailure to retain an expert to assist with medical issues, and to put counsel in a position to \nmake a strategic decision whether that expert should be called to testify. That failure was \nnot \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d and was deficient. The evidence established that Jones and \nthe child\u2019s mother had put the child down for a nap shortly before the injury. Jones testified \nin his own defense and claimed subsequently to have found the child on the floor \nunresponsive. The State\u2019s experts ruled out any other cause and opined that Marianne\u2019s \ncondition must have been the result of abuse by Jones. At that point, although there were \nconcessions about other potential causes of Marianne\u2019s injury, Jones should have been  \n-42-\nin a position to decide whether to call an expert in his defense. Due to defense counsel\u2019s \nfailure to retain an expert, he had little beyond Jones\u2019 own testimony to offer. We do not, \nand need not, resolve the question of whether Wannamaker, armed with the experts who \ntestified in post-conviction, could have made a strategic decision not to call them after he \nhad obtained some concessions on each of the medical issues called into question.    \nB. Prejudice \n{\u00b6 63} The remaining issue is whether Jones was prejudiced by defense counsel\u2019s \nfailure to retain an expert and/or to call an expert to testify at trial to rebut the State\u2019s \nexperts. The trial court found no prejudice to Jones based largely on its evaluation of the \ncredibility of the competing experts. With regard to defense exper ts Dr. Ro thfeder and \nMonson, the trial court found that the nature of their experience made them less credible \nthan the prosecution\u2019s experts. It reasoned: \n The court found the testimony of defendant\u2019s experts, Dr. Rothfeder \nand Dr. Monson, to have negligible probative value in evaluating their \ncriticisms of and differences with the testimony of Dr. Makoroff and Dr. \nStevenson. This conclusion is based in no small part on the vast difference \nin clinical experience between [Marianne\u2019s] treating physicians at Cincinnati \nChildren\u2019s Hospital and Dr. Rothfeder, and, in the case of Dr. Monson, the \nabsence of clinical experience. The testimony of the defendant\u2019s experts \ndoes not demonstrate to this court a probability that the jury would have \nreached a different verdict. \n{\u00b6 64} The trial court also found more credible the prosecution experts\u2019 testimony \nabout retinal hemorrhages, the \u201cre-bleed\u201d dis pute, the inability of a short fall to cause  \n-43-\nMarianne\u2019s injuries, and abusive head trauma actually causing the child\u2019s injury. We \nrecognize that \u201cexpert witnesses in criminal cases can testify in terms of possibility rather \nthan in terms of a reasonable sci entific certainty or probability.\u201d State v. Lang, 129 Ohio \nSt.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, \u00b6 77. \u201cThe treatment of such testimony \ninvolves \u2018an issue of sufficiency, not admissibility.\u2019 \u201dId., quoting State v. D'Ambrosio, 67 \nOhio St.3d 185, 191, 616 N.E.2d 909 (1993).5 But when experts testify about a variety of \npossibilities or about underlying suppositions that are unsupported by the weight of the \nevidence, the strength of their opinions has less weight than those expressed to a \nreasonable medical certainty.  \n{\u00b6 65} As set forth above, Dr. Rothfeder opined that it would be impossible \u201cto draw \ndefinite conclusions in terms of the cause of [Marianne\u2019s] acute subdural with any \nreasonable certainty\u201d and that it would be impossible \u201cto conclude that those injuries were \nthe result of child abuse.\u201d (T-PCR-1, 17). But a fair reading of his entire testimony is that \nhe would testify to that effect regardless of the medical aspects of this case because there \nwas no witness to or admission about the mechanism of injury and in those circumstances \nhe does not believe in the abusive head trauma/shaken baby diagnosis at all. (T-PCR-1, \n37). The potential contributing causes Dr. Rothfeder identified were re-bleeding of a prior, \nchronic subdural hematoma, a complex patient with ongoing infection related to the earlier \nnasal fracture, a \u201cshort fall,\u201d and his mistaken bleeding disorder, none of which did he \nspecify was the probable or reasonably certain cause of Marianne\u2019s injury. We previously \nindicated Appellant complains that in closing argument, the prosecutor seized on the \n                                                           \n5 A more cogent reason for allowing criminal-case experts to testify about \u201cpossibilities\u201d \nis that the defense has no burden to prove what happened, but may raise reasonable \ndoubt about what possibly may not have happened.  \n-44-\nabsence of any competing expert testimony at trial and \u201cemphasized that \u2018no doctor or \nany other witness ever said there is an old injury that\u2019s related to the injury [Marianne] \nsuffered\u2019.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Merit Brief at 6). Even if Jones\u2019 post-conviction medical expert had \ntestified at trial, the preceding closing argument could still accurately and correctly have \nbeen made because that defense expert testified in terms of possibilities rather than \ncertainty or probability. For instance, regarding the existence of a chronic hematoma, he \nstated: \u201cSo a variety of possibilities are in play * * *.\u201d (T-PCR-1, 30). And with regard to \nthe possibility of spontaneous or mild trauma as a cause of re-bleeding, he said: \u201c[W]hat \nI\u2019m talking about now is not the type of phenomenon that is now well understood or \ncompletely understood or has been you know historically clarified over time. It\u2019s not the \nkind of thing that physicians have a perfect handle on. So everything I\u2019m talking about \nremains in a \u2013 a state of incomplete understanding as \u2013 as medicine presently exists.\u201d \n(Id. at 32). Moreover, had the defense called Dr. Rothfeder at trial, his mistaken testimony \nabout Marianne\u2019s non-existent bleeding disorder, which he said contributed to his \nanalysis, likely would have resulted in further loss of credibility with the jury. \n{\u00b6 66} The trial court additionally discredited Monson\u2019s testimony because he \nlacks clinical experience, biomechanical studies have not been performed measuring the \neffect of impact forces on the brains of live humans, and Monson\u2019s experience is \nlaboratory in nature an d hospitals do not employ biomec hanical engineers. In our view, \ntaking Monson\u2019s testimony at face-value leads to the conclusion that an intensely forceful \nevent occurred in Marianne\u2019s bedroom, which is consistent with the opinions of Drs. \nStevenson, Makaroff, Gray, and Shapiro and contrary to the opinions of Dr. Rothfeder.   \n{\u00b6 67} To be sure, we recognize that there are those, including Jones\u2019 post- \n-45-\nconviction experts, who reject the diagnosis of abusive head trauma. Our research, and \nthe evidence in this case, supports a belief that acceptance of the diagnosis is by far the \nprevailing view. See, e.g., Sandeep Narang, M.D., J.D., A Daubert Analysis of Abusive \nHead Trauma/Shaken Baby Syndrome , 11 Hous. J. Health L. & Pol\u2019y 505-633 (2011).  \nCriticism is often fostered by the legal defense community adopting the minority medical \nopinion. See, e.g., Deborah Tuerkheimer, The Next Innocence Project: Shaken Baby \nSyndrome and the Criminal Courts, 87 Wash. U. L.Rev. 1, 27 (2009). Some courts have \nalso joined the fray by doing their own literature analysis to support a conclusion for one \nside or the other. See, e.g., Cavazos v. Smith, 565 U.S. 1, 132 S.Ct. 2, 181 L.Ed.2d 311 \n(2011) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (citing biomechanical and other studies raising doubt \nabout shaken baby syndrome, most particularl y whether it can be caused by shaking \nalone). But our function and duty is not to weigh in or vote for one side or the other, let \nalone solve any disagreement of some in the medical community. Nor is it our position to \nsubstitute how we might have ruled on the petition if we had considered it in the first \ninstance. Our review is to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in its \nruling.  \n{\u00b6 68} Having painstakingly reviewed the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s \ncredibility analysis was not unrea sonable and did not in itself constitute an abuse of \ndiscretion. We also determine that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it \nconcluded that the post-conviction evidence, in the context of the entire record, would not \nsupport a reasonable probability of a different result.  Finally, Jones\u2019 post-conviction \nevidence is not sufficient to undermine our confidence in the outcome of his trial. \nIV. Conclusion  \n-46-\n{\u00b6 69} Based on the reasoning set forth above, we overrule Jones\u2019 assignment of \nerror and affirm the judgment of the Miami County Common Pleas Court.  \n. . . . . . . . . . . . . \n \nTUCKER, J., concurs. \n \nFROELICH, J., dissenting; \n{\u00b6 70} I would hold that the trial court acted unreasonably in finding that there is \nnot a reasonable probability that, had the defense called experts, the result would have \nbeen different. This does not mean that the Appellant probably would have been found \nnot guilty with \u201cevidence to support his story,\u201d only that it is not unreasonable to so \nconclude. \n{\u00b6 71} Marianne slept in the same room as her mother and Appellant and the injury \nhappened during a \u201cwindow\u201d when the child was not connected to any medical support \nequipment. (T-1, 202) Although the prosecutor speculated in closing that there were \nincidents that might have angered the Appellant and caused him to momentarily \u201cstep too \nfar over that cliff\u201d (T-3, 9), there was no testimony or evidence that the Appellant had ever \nbeen abusive to Marianne or anyone prior to the day of the injury; nor was there any \nevidence that he had a quick temper or wa s prone to fits of anger or wa s anxious, \noverwhelmed, or upset on the day of the injury.  \n{\u00b6 72} The State argued that motive is not an element and that Appellant\u2019s \ntestimony that \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to her,\u201d \u201cjust doesn\u2019t cut it in the face of the \nmedical evidence that we have in this case.\u201d (T-3, 4). \u201cIf he asks you to believe something, \nwhich he did, there has to be evidence to support it. And the medical evidence does not  \n-47-\nsupport his story\u201d (emphasis added) ( T-3, 11). \u201cNo matter what defense counsel tells \nyou, use your collective memory; no doctor or any other witness ever said there is an old \ninjury that\u2019s related to the injury she suffered on August 5, 2010 \u2026\u201d (T-3, 11); the \nevidence, the prosecutor argued, \u201cdoesn\u2019t support\u201d any of those \u201ctheoretical possibilities\u201d \nsuggested by defense counsel. \u201cIt defies medical evidence that it- this injury could have \nbeen caused by a non-event, which is what the Defendant would have you believe\u201d (T-3, \n31), but rather it had to be \u201cshaking her or hitting her against a soft surface.\u201d (T-3, 37). \n{\u00b6 73} The State\u2019s arguments were based on the only evidence the jury heard; and \nthe jury\u2019s verdict was, as we held on direct appeal, not against the manifest weight of the \nevidence. The State concluded that \u201c\u2026 you can follow the medical evidence and the \nexpert testimony and the vast experience on this particular topic, or you can follow what \nthe Defendant said\u2026\u201d (T-3, 30). In other words, in the absence of any medical explanation \nto the contrary, the jury should believe the unrebutted scientific, medical testimony the \nState produced and not the denial of a person with no \u201cevidence to support it\u201d and         \nwith an obvious reason not to tell the truth. As in Ceasor v. Ocwieja, 655 Fed.Appx. 263 \n(6th Cir. 2016), \u201cThe expert is the case.\u201d (Emphasis in original and internal citations \nomitted.) 6  \n{\u00b6 74} The trial court\u2019s wholesale rejection of Monson\u2019s bio-mechanical-based \ntestimony and its total discounting of Rothfeder\u2019s testimony, based on his different \n                                                           \n6 In Ceasor, a federal habeas corpus case, the state court had denied an appeal of an \nineffective assistance of counsel claim without holding a hearing where the defendant \ncould introduce his own experts\u2019 testimony on what they would have said at trial. Here, \nthe trial court held the hearing and, as stated above, found there was no reasonable \nprobability of a different result. In neither case did the defense call any experts and the \nconvictions were dependent on the State\u2019s experts alone. \n  \n-48-\nprofessional experiences than the State\u2019s physicians, deprived Appellant of the right to \nhave the jury make such credibility decisions. 7 I appreciate that in a PCR hearing, the \ncourt may sometimes make such judgments. However, in this entirely circumstantial case \nwithout any other inferentially-supportive evidence of the Defendant\u2019s actions, and where \ncompetent evidence exists that is not a \u201ctheoretical possibility,\u201d confidence in the fairness \nof the proceeding and the outcome of the case is undermined. \n \n \n \n \nCopies mailed to: \n \nJanna Parker \nNikki Baszynski \nHon.

Jones appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition for post-conviction relief following an evidentiary hearing.\n\nIn his sole assignment of error, Jones contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying his petition, which alleged that his trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance by, among other things, failing to retain an expert witness to rebut the prosecution\u2019s case at trial.\n\nI. Procedural and Trial Factual Background\n\nThe record reflects that a jury convicted Jones on one count of child endangering, a second-degree felony. The 2014 conviction stemmed from a head injury sustained by \u201cMarianne,\u201d the four-year-old daughter of Jones\u2019 girlfriend, while the child was in his care. On August 5, 2010, the child\u2019s mother and Jones put the child down for a nap in an upstairs bedroom of the house where they were living with friends and the friends\u2019 children. The mother then left the house, and Jones was the only remaining adult with Marianne and the friends\u2019 children. Jones said he then went downstairs and watched the friends\u2019 children play a video game. Within about 20 minutes, he said he went back upstairs and found Marianne lying on her side on the floor. He testified that her eyes were rolled back in her head, and she was gurgling. Jones carried the child to a neighbor\u2019s house and called for help. A paramedic arrived and transported the child to Upper Valley Medical Center (UVMC). Her mother also responded to the hospital. She testified that at UVMC the child had a large knot on the left side of her forehead and bruising on the left\n\n1 As we did in a prior direct appeal, we will use the fictitious name \u201cMarianne\u201d to protect the child\u2019s privacy.\near, neither of which was there when she left the child at home with the appellant. Marianne\u2019s mother testified that the remains of the knot were also visible in State\u2019s photo Exhibits 11 and 12, taken several days after the incident, which depict an obvious abrasion on the left forehead. At UVMC, the child was unconscious, had a CAT scan performed, had a ventilator with a breathing tube applied, and then was care-flighted to Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\n\u00b6 4 In Cincinnati, Dr. Charles Stevenson, a pediatric neurosurgeon, confirmed the existence of a large blood clot, or hematoma, in the subdural space over the left side of the child\u2019s brain. Due to the size of the hematoma in the confined skull, pressure had pushed the brain dramatically, about three-quarters of an inch [2 cm], to the right. Dr. Stevenson performed surgery \u201cto remove the [left] side of the skull and take it off as one large piece.\u201d (T-2, 15). He saw an active hemorrhage. At trial, he explained:\n\n[S]o we open up, we widely open up the membrane that\u2019s containing the clot. And then at that point in time you can see the clot. It is large, it is red, it\u2019s under significant pressure, and once you release it, it normally starts to extrude itself; the brain starts to extrude it out towards you. And so what we very quickly do then is use gentle irrigation and instruments to remove\n\n---\n\n2 We perceive the more current and common term is \u201cCT\u201d scan, and the UVMC report refers to \u201cCT Head C.\u201d But because the transcript generally refers to the test as a \u201cCAT\u201d scan, we often use that term.\n\n3 The transcripts of the three-day jury trial are designated Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3, but the pages for each volume serially begin at number 1. Consequently, we refer to the jury trial transcript as T-1, T-2 and T-3 and then by page number of that volume. The post-conviction evidentiary hearing transcripts also are designated Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3, and are serially numbered beginning at 1 for each volume, and there is the separate deposition of Dr. Kenneth Monson. We refer to these as T-PCR-1 T-PCR-2, and T-PCR-3 and Monson Depo., and then by page number.\nall of this clot off the surface of the brain. And as you do that, you can see the underlying surface of the brain, * * * *\n\nThis then continues for several minutes, because you want to be able to remove all of the clot or as much as you safely can, and typically what happens is at some point, when you remove some bit of the clot, you\u2019re going to find the underlying blood vessels that are actually responsible for the bleeding, all right, those blood vessels that were injured that started bleeding to cause the hematoma.\n\nAnd in this case, we definitely found that. There are very large set of veins at the top of all of our brains that run in the center and just off to each side. And she had significant amount of active hemorrhage from these, which I was able to identify as soon as I removed the clot in that region. I then spent several minutes stopping this bleeding.\n\nWhen asked if this was \u201cfresh blood,\u201d Dr. Stevenson stated:\n\nYes. The vast majority of this blood that was either forming clot in various stages, that was either a few hours old or there were some just liquid blood that was so fresh that it had not yet had time to clot off. Especially near the regions of the veins that she had bleeding, there was just active spurting of blood that was pooling and had not yet clotted off.\n\nQ. Okay. So there\u2019s fresh blood that had collected and then still active bleeding-\n\nA. Yes.\n\n(T-2, 16-17).\nThe only documentary evidence introduced at trial regarding the UVMC CAT scan\u2014two photocopies of CAT scan image slices (State\u2019s Exhibits 15 and 16)\u2014had been referred to on direct examination of Dr. Stevenson. Upon cross examination, defense counsel referred to these exhibits as follows:\n\nQ. Okay and you had indicated that the bright white part is new blood, okay. But that brown, or the darker layer could be several different things, okay. One of the things that you had indicated that it could be old blood. Correct? Okay. If a person suffered a minor subdural hematoma, okay, where there was bleeding, okay, but we didn\u2019t remove the blood, okay, and there are those cases, correct?\n\nA. Yes there are.\n\n***\n\nQ. Okay. All right. With this, it's possible is it not doctor that the darker images there [Exhibit 15 or 16] reflect that there has been prior bleeding in this brain?\n\nA. Based purely off the CAT scan images, that\u2019s always a consideration, yes.\n\n(T-2, 32) (Emphasis added). And upon further questioning, Dr. Stevenson reiterated:\n\nQ. Okay in looking at this CAT scan, is it possible that this could be an acute [new or fresh] on chronic [old]?\n\nA. Based purely off of the CAT scan, there is a chance that that could be the case yes.\nOn re-direct examination, Dr. Stevenson testified that he did not note any indication of a prior subdural hematoma in his report, but if during surgery he had visually observed what he believed to be indication of a prior \u201cminor\u201d subdural hematoma he would have noted it:\n\n* * * because it would make a difference in terms of what was done procedurally, and what the patient\u2019s prognosis would be expected to be.\n\nQ. And there was nothing in \u2013 correct me if I\u2019m wrong, there was nothing in your review of the scans from July 25th or the previous nasal injury to suggest that there was any sort of minor subdural hematoma?\n\nA. Not to the best of my knowledge, no.\n\nQ. When you performed this surgery, and you actually had the opportunity to look at this child\u2019s brain, is there \u2013 was there anything there to you that was suggesting \u2013 did you believe this to be an old injury, or did you believe this to be a fresh injury?\n\nA. Well the injury that we were treating emergently was absolutely fresh injury. She had a very large clot, only some of which is actually depicted on these images that we had here. The volume of the clot was quite extensive. The clot itself was new, organizing blood, and she had active bleeding, active hemorrhage out into the operative field, pooling there. So all of that was absolutely new.\n\nQ. Okay. And does a \u2013 if a \u2013 although you didn\u2019t see any evidence of a minor subdural hematoma, does a small subdural hematoma cause a\nlarge, acute subdural hematoma like you saw in [Marianne] when you treated her?\n\nA. No it does not.\n\nQ. So there would have to have been some separate event that caused the acute subdural hematoma that you witnessed?\n\nA. Yes.\n\n(T-2, 44-45). Dr. Stevenson\u2019s testimony also included that subdural hematomas almost always are caused by traumatic injuries including, for example, motor-vehicle collisions or falls from a significant height such a second-story window or, possibly, the top of a bunk bed.\n\n{\u00b6 6} Fortunately, within days of the surgery, the child made a \u201cdramatic recovery\u201d and was able to open her eyes, breathe on her own, and begin talking.\n\n{\u00b6 7} In Jones\u2019 defense, through Dr. Stevenson and other witnesses, his attorney asserted that Marianne was a medically-fragile child who suffered from a rare condition known as VATER Association.4 As a result of that condition, she had undergone approximately 25 surgeries, including multiple abdominal organ transplants. Defense counsel also cross examined the State\u2019s medical experts about a fall that Marianne had experienced about three weeks earlier on July 17, 2010. On that occasion, Marianne tripped in the kitchen and fell face-first onto the floor, hitting her nose. A few days later, a doctor examined the child during a regularly-scheduled visit and concluded that her nose\n\n---\n\n4 This condition is now more accurately known as VACTERL Association due to the recognition of additional potential defects. It typically refers to the presence of at least three of a recognized group of birth defects tending to have a non-random occurrence. Because the numerous transcript references use the term \u201cVATER,\u201d we use it here.\nwas fine. In the days following the fall, the child was not lethargic and she engaged in normal activities. On July 25, 2010, however, the child awoke with a bruised, swollen nose and yellow drainage. The child's mother took her to the hospital, where a CAT scan revealed two nasal fractures. Marianne underwent emergency surgery to treat an infection behind the fractures, and she remained hospitalized until August 3, 2010 while receiving intravenous antibiotics.\n\nDefense counsel theorized at trial that the large subdural hematoma Marianne experienced two days later on August 5, 2010 may have been related to the child's complex medical condition, the fracture she experienced when she fell on July 17, 2010, and the resulting infection she suffered. In particular, defense counsel suggested that Marianne's fall on July 17, 2010 may have caused a small hematoma that re-bled and became larger when the child jumped or fell from her bed on August 5, 2010. Dr. Stevenson, the treating pediatric neurosurgeon, agreed that such a scenario \"theoretically\" could occur if there was an older, minor subdural hematoma followed by \"a repeat trauma to the exact, same place.\" He added, however, that he had never seen such a situation and did not see evidence of an older, minor hematoma when treating Marianne. There was no evidence from any witness that she had reinjured her nose. Dr. Stevenson also testified that he had seen the facial CAT scan that had been taken earlier, which had revealed the broken nose, and although it only shows limited images of the brain, there was no indication of a prior clot and no indication of a shift of the brain from left to right. Finally, Dr. Stevenson found no connection between Marianne's serious injury and either her VATER Association or her recent nasal fracture. As indicated in testimony previously quoted, he testified there was nothing to suggest a prior minor chronic\nhematoma.\n\nDr. Kathi Makoroff, who was called by the State, is a pediatrician who specializes in child abuse and is board certified in that field. She has been practicing in that capacity at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Medical Center for 17 years. At the time of her March 2014 testimony, she said she was the chair of the Ohio Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, and president of the Ray Helfer Society, an honorary society for physicians practicing in the area of child abuse. She was a consultant in Marianne\u2019s treatment, and ruled out causes of the child\u2019s subdural hematoma other than a traumatic injury involving \u201ca great bit of force.\u201d She explained: \u201cWe do see these types of injuries in kids who have severe car accidents and are ejected from the car or [in] very severe accidents. Kids who have very severe falls, like falling out of the\u2014out of a window, you know, not on the first floor of the house but subsequent floors of the house, and we also see it in children with inflicted injury or abusive head trauma when they come in and they have injuries similar to\u2014to\u2014to what we see on [Marianne\u2019s] CAT scan.\u201d (T-2, 65). Dr. Makoroff ruled out as a possible cause of Marianne\u2019s injury a jump or a fall from the child\u2019s bed:\n\nSo I could also rule out that history of a\u2014of a roll off of a bed or even a jump off a\u2014off of a bed from something so small, you know, thirteen inches off of the floor and onto carpet, which, you know, obviously has some padding to it; the carpet itself has\u2014has some padding properties to it. And so I\u2019m left with inflicted injury or abusive head trauma.\n\n*** Right so it goes back to your question about the amount of force required. So even though we can\u2019t give you\u2014we can\u2019t give you a number\nof the amount of force, it certainly lies between kids who, and you know, most people know someone\u2014know a child and maybe some of the Jurors were that child who, you know, went down the steps on a skateboard because it was fun, or was klutzy or climbed a lot and had lots of falls, and those kids don\u2019t end up like this. Those kids don\u2019t come into the emergency room emergently and then require surgery to evacuate the blood. So even though those kids are either klutzy or very sort of rambunctious and often doing things and\u2014and hitting their head requiring sutures or staples, you know, to\u2014because they\u2019re hitting their head and getting\u2014and getting lacerations, they still don\u2019t\u2014they still don\u2019t cause these types of injuries. But the really more forceful types of mechanisms, like a car accident, do. So the answer to your question is even the rambunctious child who is maybe jumping on the bed and even hits their head in the room, just\u2014just\u2014it\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s not enough injury to cause this type of subdural.\n\n* * * So again, I can\u2019t rule out there wasn\u2019t an impact to her head; I mean she doesn\u2019t have a skull fracture, but just because there isn\u2019t a skull fracture doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t impacted especially if she was impacted onto a soft surface. That may be enough of an impact to cause injury, but not enough of an impact, or an impact onto the wrong type of surface to cause a skull fracture. Or certainly a shaking; if she was picked up and shaken violently, that would cause these types\u2014this type of subdural, these types of injuries. And of course there\u2019s no impact there; she wasn\u2019t actually impacted onto a hard or soft surface, which would go along with her not\nhaving a skull fracture.\n\n(T-2, 72-78).\n\n{\u00b6 10} Dr. Makoroff stated that even a prior minor subdural hematoma, followed by \u201ca trivial fall like falling out of a bed thirteen inches\u201d high, would not have caused Marianne\u2019s injury. She opined that the child\u2019s injury was caused by \u201cabusive head trauma,\u201d which she explained is the current terminology for what previously was known as \u201cshaken-baby syndrome.\u201d Dr. Makoroff testified that \u201cshaken-baby syndrome\u201d is an \u201cold term\u201d that means the \u201csame exact thing\u201d as \u201cabusive head trauma.\u201d In essence, Dr. Makoroff used the process of elimination to conclude that Marianne\u2019s injuries were not accidental.\n\n{\u00b6 11} Dr. Makoroff also rejected the scenarios proposed by defense counsel. Her opinion ruled out the possibility that a \u201cshort fall\u201d could have caused Marianne\u2019s subdural hematoma on August 5, 2010. She testified that a \u201cshort fall\u201d potentially could \u201ccause a subdural\u201d but not a large one like this child suffered:\n\n[Y]es, injury \u2013 a fall, and I have seen these \u2013 these cases my \u2013 myself, many of them, where a fall does cause a \u2013 a subdural. In those cases, there is frequently a skull fracture, and then there is a small amount of subdural blood underneath the skull fracture, and no damage to the surrounding brain at all. So I just want to be clear that I would answer your question yes, a short fall can cause a subdural, but no a short fall wouldn\u2019t cause a subdural like [Marianne] suffered.\n\n(T-2, 92).\n\n{\u00b6 12} Dr. Makoroff also rejected the idea that the hematoma on August 5, 2010\nwas a \u201cre-bleed\u201d of a prior hematoma that resulted from the child\u2019s earlier fall and nasal fracture. She explained:\n\nSo first of all I can rule that out with [Marianne]. Now to be very clear, when she had a CAT scan for her nose, they didn\u2019t image all of her brain; they imaged a good part of it in looking at the note, but they didn\u2019t do a brain CT, they did a facial CT on her, so they did see a good bit of her brain in that it all looked normal. So for your theory to work, she would have had\u2014had to of had a large enough subdural initially, and they would have picked it up on that CAT scan. So I can feel confident saying no for that reason. I can feel confident also saying no because if [Marianne] suffered a re-bleeding, she would not have been symptomatic the way she was. She\u2014she was not really conscious, and her brain was being affected by the re-bleed, and that\u2019s never really been described in re-bleeding, and she required neurosurgery to take out the blood. And so that\u2019s why I can rule that out.\n\nI can also rule it out because Dr. Stevenson, and I talked to Dr. Stevenson after the surgery and read his operative report, would have seen this within the hematoma. He would have seen a bunch of older, trying to heal blood, with new blood as well. And he did not see that.\n\n(T-2, 94-95). Also in response to defense cross examination, she stated:\n\nSo as you pointed out, I wasn\u2019t there, you weren\u2019t there, so I \u2013 I don\u2019t know what happened, you don\u2019t know what happened, but I can tell you what didn\u2019t happen. So it wasn\u2019t related to any of her past medical history.\nIt \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a direct cause of her nasal fracture from \u2013 from July, and it\ndidn\u2019t happen from her falling off of a bed or even jumping off of her bed\nand jumping into something in her room, if that in fact happened.\n\n(T-2, 100-101).\n\n\u00b6 13 Dr. Makoroff was also cross examined in regard to a study in which a short\nfall resulted in a subdural hemorrhage. She expressed ample familiarity with the study of\nDr. John Plunkett regarding falls from playground equipment, which some have used to\nsupport that a subdural hematoma, and even death, can result from a short fall. Ultimately\nthough, her testimony was as we previously quoted, \u201ca short fall wouldn\u2019t cause a\nsubdural like [Marianne] suffered.\u201d (T-2, 92).\n\n\u00b6 14 On re-direct examination, Dr. Makoroff also testified that very few accidental\nfalls in children \u201cresult in retinal hemorrhages\u201d and that the retinal hemorrhages Marianne\nexperienced were larger and \u201cmore diffused throughout the whole retina\u201d than what might\noccur in a short fall. Dr. Makoroff added:\n\n*** So when we see retinal hemorrhages we don\u2019t\u2014we\u2014we\u2014we\u2014we\u2014\nwe, you know, again, it\u2019s a very sort of short list of medical causes; many of\nthem the same as subdursals that can cause retinal hemorrhages, none of\nthem [Marianne] had. And so then if we are left with injury, same thing as\nwhat I just testified to. Short household falls, even if we say they can cause\nretinal hemorrhages, which is rare, they don\u2019t cause retinal hemorrhages to\nthe degree of which [Marianne] had.\n\n(T-2, 116).\n\n\u00b6 15 Dr. Michael Gray, a pediatric ophthalmologist at Cincinnati Children\u2019s\nHospital, testified that the retinas of both of Marianne\u2019s eyes had many and diffuse multi-layered retinal hemorrhaging. He said there could be several causes for this, and he looks for bleeding problems, infection in the eye, or a history of trauma. Regarding trauma he testified \u201cgenerally it's to cause hemorrhages or bleeding in the retina, it would have to be severe trauma; usually head trauma.\u201d (Id. at 124). He also testified that swelling of the brain, \u201cbrain edema by itself does not lead to retinal hemorrhages.\u201d (Id. at 135).\n\n\u00b6 16 As indicated, Jones\u2019 defense at trial consisted primarily of his attorney cross examining the State\u2019s witnesses about Marianne\u2019s multiple medical problems, the possibility of re-bleeding of an old hematoma, whether a short fall could cause a subdural hematoma, and the several possible causes of retinal hemorrhage. Counsel was able to obtain several admissions regarding the possibility of the defense theories though not sufficient for the State\u2019s witnesses to alter their opinions. Defense counsel called no experts to rebut the prosecution\u2019s experts. The only defense witness was Jones. He testified that he went upstairs and found Marianne on the floor, limp and non-responsive. He denied striking, throwing, or shaking the child. He also denied becoming angry or frustrated with the child. He testified that he had no idea how her injuries occurred.\n\n\u00b6 17 In closing argument, the prosecutor stressed that \u201cno doctor or any other witness ever said there is an old injury that\u2019s related to the injury [Marianne] suffered on August 5, 2010.\u201d The prosecutor described Jones\u2019 \u201cstory\u201d as \u201csimply inconceivable\u201d and argued that it \u201cdefies medical evidence[.]\u201d\n\n\u00b6 18 After considering the evidence presented, the jury found Jones guilty on one count of child endangering. The trial court imposed an eight-year prison sentence. This court affirmed on direct appeal, rejecting arguments challenging the manifest weight\nand legal sufficiency of the State's evidence and an argument alleging prosecutorial misconduct. With regard to the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, this court reasoned:\n\nIn the case before us, the circumstantial evidence is compelling that Jones physically abused Marianne, and thereby caused her serious physical harm. When Marianne was left in his care, she did not have the brain injury that she had after she was in his care. He was the only adult in her presence. By his admission, the three other children in the house were on another floor, playing a video game.\n\nDrs. Stevenson and Makoroff ruled out possible causes of Marianne's injury other than physical abuse, either in the form of impact to Marianne's head against a soft surface, or severe shaking. Under the circumstances, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Jones was the person who caused Marianne's injury, if not intentionally, at the very least recklessly, since a reasonable person would know that the impact to Marianne's head or the severe shaking necessary to cause her injury would likely cause her serious physical harm.\n\nState v. Jones, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2014-CA-11, 2015-Ohio-196, \u00b6 30-31.\n\nII. Post-Conviction Proceedings\n\n\u00b6 19 In December 2014, Jones filed an R.C. 2953.21 petition for post-conviction relief with supporting evidentiary materials. (Doc. #43). Those materials included an affidavit and report from Dr. Robert Rothfeder, a board-certified emergency room physician with more than 30 years of experience in emergency medicine involving all\nvarieties of adult and pediatric trauma, including brain-injury cases. The materials also included an affidavit from Kenneth Monson, a PhD associate professor in mechanical engineering and an adjunct assistant professor in bioengineering at the University of Utah, and an affidavit from Dr. Marvin Miller of Dayton Children\u2019s Hospital addressing the proper terminology for VATER Association. Finally, the materials included an affidavit from Jones\u2019 trial counsel, Andrew Wannemacher, who explained that he knew he needed the assistance of an expert witness and that his failure to obtain one was not a \u201cstrategic move.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 20 One of the documents attached to the post-conviction submission was the first page of an apparent two-page UVMC \u201cCT Head C\u201d scan report which, appellant points out, stated: \u201c[T]here is a left hemispheric acute on chronic subdural hematoma.\u201d What appellant does not reference is that the document also states: \u201cGiven the acute on chronic nature of this finding, nonaccidental trauma must be suspected.\u201d (Petition, Exhibit E). The trial court scheduled the post-conviction petition for an evidentiary hearing.\n\n\u00b6 21 The trial court held a three-day hearing on Jones\u2019 petition in May and June 2015. Jones presented testimony from Dr. Rothfeder and attorney Wannemacher as well as the videotaped deposition testimony from Monson. The State countered with testimony from its own expert, Dr. Robert Shapiro from Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\n\u00b6 22 Dr. Rothfeder, also a lawyer, trained as an internist and practiced as an emergency-room physician for more than 30 years, a discipline in which he was board certified in 1996. He treated adults and children and estimated that about half were children. He left emergency-room practice in 2006. He said he continued with a part-time, about one-half, clinical practice until he retired from patient care at the end of 2013. He\nhas not had a practice dedicated specifically to pediatrics, and he is not a neurologist. He said that over the past ten years he has developed a focused interest in child abuse and infant brain injury. He spends the vast majority of his professional time consulting on medical issues most of which are child abuse head-injury cases. In the last ten or fifteen years, he has testified only for the defense. He estimated he has testified between one and two hundred times on this topic.\n\n{\u00b6 23} Based on his review of the case, including Marianne\u2019s extensive medical records, Dr. Rothfeder opined that the child\u2019s serious medical problems related to VATER Association made her more \u201cfragile\u201d and vulnerable to the injury she sustained in this case. Dr. Rothfeder has encountered only a \u201ccouple\u201d VATER Association patients in his career, but his treatment of them was for something peripheral. He acknowledged he has no clinical experience working with children with this association. (T-PCR-1, 23). Yet he opined that she was generally a \u201cfragile\u201d child who was \u201cmore vulnerable to injury of any type. * * * I mean what she\u2019s made of just isn\u2019t as strong and viable as the tissue would be in a normal individual.\u201d (Id. at 41).\n\n{\u00b6 24} Dr. Rothfeder explained that he had reviewed a CAT scan of the serious subdural hematoma taken after the incident. Although he was not specifically qualified as a radiologist or neurologist, he opined that the scan revealed the presence of \u201cnew\u201d blood and older blood, signifying the existence of a \u201cchronic subdural\u201d and an \u201cacute subdural\u201d\n\n* * * [W]hen you look at the scan there\u2019s\u2014there\u2019s mixed density in the hematoma. In other words, the\u2014the\u2014the tissue and the blood products that are seen on the scan look different in terms of the white and black densities depending on the composition of the fluid and in this scan there\nwas a mixed density which indicated that the subdural consisted of a chronic subdural, that is blood which had been present for a period of time which was not new and which had been present for at least a number of weeks and possibly longer, perhaps months even. And within that there was acute bleeding. So there was new bleeding into the chronic subdural and that\u2014that's a phenomenon that we refer to as re-bleeding of a chronic subdural and something that's seen not uncommonly with chronic subdural\n\n(T-PCR-1, 26-27). Notably, however, the CAT scan itself was not separately introduced into evidence. Nor was the original radiologist's report, the first page of which we indicated was attached to the petition, otherwise entered as an exhibit. Nor was the radiologist called by Jones' counsel in post-conviction proceedings even though the petition argued, in \u201cGround III\u201d of the incidents amounting to ineffective assistance of counsel, that Jones\u2019 trial counsel was deficient \u201cwhen his attorney failed to call the Upper Valley Medical Center treating physicians and radiologists as witnesses.\u201d (Petition at 38).\n\n{\u00b6 25} When asked, Dr. Rothfeder did not render an opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to the cause of what he surmised was a chronic subdural hematoma, and he could not indicate when it originated. Rather, he indicated that \u201cone of the possibilities\u201d was Marianne\u2019s fall on July 17, 2010, which resulted in the nasal fracture and infection. He added:\n\n*** However, it's entirely possible that you know other unwitnessed head trauma that the child might have had at some point in the past could have caused it or medical condition that\u2019s\u2014that complicated things could have caused it. For instance, when the nasal hematoma and the result[ing]\ninfection occurred, a potential complication of an infection in the head like that would be clotting or thrombosis in one of the veins inside the head that\u2014that feeds the dura or that drains the dura and it's known among other things that\u2014what we call cortical venous thrombosis. Thrombosis of one of those veins can be a cause of subdurals. So a variety of possibilities are\u2014are in play and the\u2014the only one that I can really identify specifically as potentially causative would relate to the\u2014the trauma that caused the nasal fracture ten days or a couple of weeks preceding the August event.\n\nT-PCR-1, 30.\n\n{\u00b6 26} With regard to the acute subdural hematoma that led to Jones\u2019 conviction, Dr. Rothfeder testified:\n\n* * * The way that chronic subdurals can re-bleed relates to the specific anatomy and pathology of the subdural. Once a chronic subdural forms, a membrane forms over the subdural and the membrane contains tiny little immature blood vessels and those\u2014those vessels are subject to re-bleeding and it\u2019s thought that re-bleeding in these instances, in these small blood vessels in the membrane of a subdural can\u2014it\u2019s thought that those things\u2014that re-bleeding of these things can occur in the absence of trauma, spontaneously or with mild trauma which might otherwise be incidental. Now understand that what I'm talking about now is not the type of phenomenon that is now well understood or completely understood or has been you know historically clarified over time. It's not the kind of thing that physicians have a perfect handle on. So everything I'm talking about\nremains in a \u2013 a state of incomplete understanding as \u2013 as medicine presently exists.\n\n(T-PRC-1, 31-32).\n\n{\u00b6 27} Dr. Rothfeder further testified that one of the underlying bases for his opinions was that \u201con top of that [his chronic re-bleed possibility] one thing we haven\u2019t discussed but I believe is contributory is the fact that on top of everything else, blood testing when she was admitted to Cincinnati Children\u2019s indicated that the state of her blood coagulation was not normal at that point in time.\u201d (Id.) (Emphasis added). In more than three pages of transcript testimony, he specifically described this poor coagulation and how \u201cit would have contributed to the expansion of the new bleed.\u201d That testimony is similar to the portion of Dr. Rothfeder\u2019s affidavit, submitted with the petition, where he was critical of Dr. Makoroff\u2019s trial testimony to the effect that Marianne\u2019s coagulation was normal. He went on to expound upon how the abnormal coagulation made this case \u201cas complex in terms of many different things going on as any I\u2019ve seen,\u201d (Id. at 33). And, he testified her coagulation \u201cwas not safe.\u201d (Id. at 36). But he was wrong. On cross examination, it was pointed out that he had incorrectly referred to the coagulation testing from 9:16 p.m. in the evening of admission, after the intensive medical intervention of a two-hour brain surgery with multiple medications, and not the coagulation testing at the time of admission at 4:40 p.m. in the afternoon. He had to admit that he was incorrect and, contrary to his affidavit and hearing testimony, that her coagulation studies were normal upon admission when the hematoma had already formed.\n\n{\u00b6 28} Dr. Rothfeder did acknowledge that what looks like \u201cnew\u201d blood and \u201cold\u201d blood when analyzing a hematoma on a CAT scan can be new blood that\u2019s moving. In\nhis opinion, formed from review of only the CAT scan, \u201cthat did not appear to me to have been the case with this mixed density [blood].\u201d When Rothfeder was cross examined about Dr. Stevenson\u2019s testimony that Stevenson saw no old blood upon surgically viewing Marianne\u2019s brain, Dr. Rothfeder testified he relies on \u201cwhat I\u2019ve been told by neurosurgeons\u201d (Id. at 49) that it is entirely possible that evacuation of an acute hematoma wouldn\u2019t allow visualization of old blood somewhere else in the subdural space. So, in Dr. Rothfeder\u2019s estimation, the absence of old blood doesn\u2019t rule out its presence. However, his direct testimony about his own reading of the CAT scan had been that the old blood and new blood was in the same place. After describing what he believed was a chronic subdural, he said that \u201cwithin that [his suspected chronic subdural] there was acute bleeding. So there was new bleeding into the chronic subdural ** * *.\u201d (Id. at 27).\n\n\u00b6 29 With regard to the cause of Marianne\u2019s injury on August 5, 2010, Dr. Rothfeder opined: \u201c** * * I mean this is the farthest thing from a\u2014a simple case to attempt to analyze and\u2014and draw conclusions from and\u2014and I think that\u2014that really explains the\u2014you know the opinions that I\u2019m attempting to express here in saying that I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s really possible to draw definite conclusions in terms of the cause of that acute subdural with any reasonable certainty.\u201d (Id. at 33). In his ultimate conclusion, Dr. Rothfeder stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think that given everything I\u2019ve discussed that it\u2019s possible to\u2014to conclude that those injuries were the result of child abuse.\u201d (Id. at 37). A fair evaluation of his testimony is that he does not believe in the diagnosis of abusive head trauma because one cannot divine intent from an unobserved mechanism of injury. He agrees the diagnosis is accepted by the majority of pediatricians and the position papers of the\nnumber of organizations that support the diagnosis, which he gratuitously referred to as \u201cthe political statements that derive from those organizations.\u201d (Id. at 54).\n\n\u00b6 30 On cross examination, Dr. Rothfeder expressed his belief that a biomechanical engineer would be better suited than Dr. Makoroff to assess whether a short fall could have caused Marianne\u2019s injury. While acknowledging that biomechanical engineers typically do not work in emergency rooms, he explained: \u201cWell, the\u2014if the\u2014the kinematics and so forth of an injury were rarely\u2014were really rarely contributory to what I was doing in the emergency room. I mean for instance if\u2014if someone comes in you know with a history of a particular injury, my job is to diagnose and treat the injury.\u201d Concerning Dr. Makoroff\u2019s opinion, and consistent with his rejection of the abusive head trauma diagnosis, he added:\n\n* * * [W]e\u2019re not dealing with an issue of medical treatment. Dr. Makoroff\u2019s role in this case didn\u2019t involve contributing to the treatment in this case. It involved coming to a medical legal conclusion and I think that physicians have nothing more than anecdotal experience to attempt to conclude for instance whether a you know a\u2014a particular short fall could have caused a given injury. That's why I'm critical. (Id. at 46).\n\n\u00b6 31 With regard to the alleged \u201cabusive head trauma\u201d at issue, Dr. Rothfeder opined that \u201cthe medical diagnosis really is head trauma\u201d and that \u201cwhether it\u2019s abusive or not is a medical legal conclusion.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 32 Dr. Rothfeder additionally maintained that the presence or absence of retinal hemorrhages in this case had no diagnostic value to him, partially because he\nbelieved they could have been caused by the \u201cpresence of an expanding subdural hematoma\u201d (Id. at 52) itself, which in his opinion had an uncertain cause. Rothfeder was not qualified as an ophthalmologist, and the foregoing opinion was directly contrary to the previously quoted testimony of Dr. Gray, the only ophthalmologist who testified in this record. Finally, he disputed whether severe shaking ever can damage bridging veins in the brain and result in a subdural hematoma.\n\n\u00b6 33 Jones\u2019 other expert witness, Kenneth Monson, testified via video deposition. Monson, who holds a doctorate in mechanical engineering, also did three years of post-doctoral work in conjunction with the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of California San Francisco. There he collaborated with neurosurgeons in studying the application of force and resulting trauma. In addition, he filled a research position at a brain and spinal injury center. His doctoral thesis involved \u201cmechanical and failure properties of human cerebral blood vessels.\u201d The study concerned \u201cthe response of the cerebral blood vessels to head trauma.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 34 Monson testified that, based on his experience and study, the acceleration levels from shaking someone are too low to produce a head injury such as bleeding on the brain. According to Monson, the lowest level of G-forces that might injure a six-month-old child is 50Gs, whereas a subdural hematoma might be expected to result at around 85Gs. Monson testified, however, that the peak accelerations associated with shaking are around 15Gs. He stated that these numbers are peer reviewed and generally accepted. He testified that greater G-forces would be required to injure an older child.\n\n\u00b6 35 Monson also discussed \u201cshort falls\u201d that might occur inside a residence. He recognized that a multitude of variables must be considered to assess whether the force\ninvolved could produce a given injury. They include the height of the fall, whether the head impacted, what part of the head impacted, the characteristics of the floor, whether anything broke the fall, any physical acceleration before the fall (such as jumping or running), etc. With regard to Marianne's specific injury at issue, Monson, who admits he is not trained in medicine (Monson Depo. at 51), opined:\n\nSo, if\u2014if she had been standing on the bed, for example, and somehow managed to get herself to the point of the floor, whatever that was\u2014I don't know what the distance from the bed was where she was found, so I don't know if that's feasible.\n\nBut if she were standing on the bed and fell and hit her head, there would be\u2014and I should say, if it were an unprotected fall\u2014if she struck her head squarely on the floor without any protection, then that would produce a significant acceleration that would potentially be in the ballpark of what we have been talking about for injury thresholds.\n\nIf we\u2014if we talk about\u2014and I should say this is all for a healthy infant\u2014or for a healthy child. There\u2014there aren't really any data out there suggesting that\u2014that the child has previous\u2014a pre-existing condition like chronic bleeding, chronic subdural\u2014I think that, based on my review of the records, there was actually mixed density blood in the CT scan suggesting that there was blood before, you know, that would have been present days before this particular incident.\n\nBut, anyway, so that matters, but falling off the bed if she is standing on it is different from if she is standing in the middle of the floor and\nsomehow fell down, which is also different from if she is lying on the bed and rolls off the bed.\n\nClearly, those different scenarios in order of decreasing height become less and less severe and\u2014to the point where I don\u2019t think you could achieve the levels of acceleration required to produce injury from that\u2014from rolling off that 13-inch bed.\n\n(Id. at 40-41).\n\n\u00b6 36 In Monson\u2019s opinion, depending on how such a fall occurred, the range of possibility of a serious injury would go from \u201calmost impossible to do it to it could happen.\u201d More specifically, he explained that \u201cthe accelerations could range from, you know, significantly over 100Gs down to 0, basically.\u201d Monson stated that he was unaware of any observed case in which shaking had produced a subdural hematoma. He was aware of an observed case in which a \u201cshort fall\u201d had produced such an injury.\n\n\u00b6 37 On cross examination, Monson conceded that serious injuries from short falls are \u201cpretty rare\u201d and \u201cquite unlikely.\u201d (Id. at 67). He also stated that he could not draw a conclusion in the present case as to whether a short fall in fact produced Marianne\u2019s injury. Monson recognized that if Marianne had been shaken and then \u201cslammed\u201d against something causing an impact, the slamming would significantly increase the acceleration and deceleration levels. He reiterated, however, that \u201cthe accelerations associated with shaking are very low compared to the thresholds for injury * * * like a subdural hematoma[.]\u201d (Id. at 82). Finally, when asked whether the injury in this case was from a short fall he said \u201cI can\u2019t actually draw an opinion on what - - what caused it.\u201d (Id. at 68).\n\n\u00b6 38 Jones\u2019 final witness, Andrew Wannemacher, testified about his efforts as\ndefense counsel at trial. Specifically, he discussed his cross examination of the State's medical experts. Wannemacher also admitted realizing, at the outset of his involvement, that \u201cthere needed to be an expert for the defense to not only explain the medical documentation that had been provided by the State, but also to counteract Dr. Makoroff's shaken baby syndrome or abusive head trauma\u201d theory. Wannemacher explained that he did file a motion for a medical expert. He recalled the trial court required him first to get a medical opinion that an expert would be helpful to the defense and to provide a fee estimate. To do that, Wannemacher contacted a Dr. Miller at Dayton Children\u2019s Hospital, who agreed to review the documentation but refused to participate as a trial witness. Wannemacher testified that Dr. Miller never followed up, or indicated whether he had reviewed any materials. Wannemacher never received an opinion from him. Wannemacher contacted other doctors but concluded on his own that their fees were beyond what the trial court would authorize. As a result, he never obtained an expert witness to assist with the defense. He also never consulted a medical or biomechanical expert to determine whether a short fall could have produced Marianne\u2019s injury. Wannemacher testified that he reviewed approximately 2,000 pages of medical records himself but did not \u201cadequately understand what they meant.\u201d He testified that his failure to obtain the assistance of an expert witness was not a strategic decision. After the first case against Jones was nolled, and then refiled, Wannemacher did not refile his motion for an expert witness because he assumed that he would not be able to get one. According to Wannemacher, he would have called a medical expert to testify if he had one.\n\n{\u00b6 39} The only other witness at the hearing was Dr. Robert Shapiro, a child-abuse\npediatrician from Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital, who was called to testify by the State. Dr. Shapiro is the director of the Mayerson Center for Safe and Healthy Children at the hospital, is an attending physician there, and is board certified in both pediatrics and child abuse pediatrics. He has been practicing pediatrics for over thirty years in Ohio and previously for seven years in New York. He has testified in court in those fields about twice a month for the last 25 years and estimated the totals would be between 400 and 500 times. Although he said he almost always testifies on behalf of the prosecution, he did serve as an expert for the Baltimore Public Defender\u2019s Office. He has reviewed \u201clots and lots of cases for the defense\u201d (T-PCR-2, 38), but if he made a determination that child abuse was not warranted, \u201cthe case doesn\u2019t go,\u201d so he has only testified in court a couple of times for the defense. (Id. at 38-39).\n\n\u00b6 40 Based on his review of the records in this case, Dr. Shapiro agreed that Marianne was a \u201cvery complex medical patient\u201d (T-PCR-2, 19). But he rejected Dr. Rothfeder\u2019s opinion that the child\u2019s VATER Association or any other existing medical complications predisposed her to, or contributed to, the injury she suffered on August 5, 2010. He observed that her liver was functioning well, which is critical because that is responsible for many aspects that keep a child from bleeding (T-PCR-2, 15). He also disagreed with Dr. Rothfeder\u2019s opinion that a short fall could have produced a subdural hematoma like Marianne experienced that day. According to Dr. Shapiro, the child\u2019s injuries were consistent with abuse rather than a short fall. Dr. Shapiro also opined that biomechanical engineering studies cannot accurately assess the forces generated from different traumatic events involving children. With regard to the latter, he explained:\n\nI would tell you that the biomechanical studies are flawed right now\nand too limited to be abuse (sic) [of use] to making a diagnosis and understanding cause and effect. That's not to say that I don't have hope one day that biomechanical studies will be more informative in this area and they are still undergoing but it's a remarkably difficult thing to study. The head is far more complex than a lake. We barely have biomechanical studies to understand what happens when a child falls. It's way too complicated in terms of mass of the child, size of the bone, angle that the bone strikes, the manner that the child fell, how the bone ends up, what parts of the other parts of the body, so we're beginning to understand a little bit more about what type of all, stair falls might result to what type fractures. The head is unbelievably more complex than a femur. And we have \u2013 we probably actually have \u2013 will never have any way to understand why type of angular and other forces are required to cause a bridging vein to rupture and what different individual factors are involved, so do I actually have hope that biomechanical engineers will actually be able to tell us what actually happens? No, I actually don't. Maybe they will. I can tell you that we have lots of data and lots of experience from accidental falls, from witnessed falls, we have lots of experimental data that tells us about children who we know have been abused because of a multitude of other reasons who have injuries exactly like [Marianne] has and we have lots of experience knowing what kinds of injuries happen to kids who fall. So that's the data that we have. That's good data. It's not biomechanical data.\n\n(T-PCR-2, 51-52).\nDr. Shapiro compellingly contradicted Dr. Rothfeder regarding whether Marianne had an older, chronic subdural hematoma and a newer, acute subdural hematoma, i.e., \u201cold\u201d blood and \u201cnew\u201d blood, giving four distinct reasons why Rothfeder\u2019s supposition is incorrect.\n\n* * *A number of reasons. So the radiographic appearance actually shows as you correctly said mixed densities on the CT Scan. And what the CT Scan shows is the radiographic appearance from the computed tomography scan of what is inside the cranium. And there is \u2013 there is fluid between the brain and the skull, that\u2019s within a particular space that is correctly referred to as a subdural compartment, subdural space and it shows a mixed density. [Rothfeder] is correct about that. The interpretation of what those mixed densities are cannot be determined with any reliability based upon the CT Scan alone. One explanation is exactly as he states, that it\u2019s old blood with new blood bleeding into that space and mixing with the old blood. That is one possibility. Then the other possibility is that this is all new blood that shows different densities because what we believe is movement of the blood, in other words active bleeding. So an informed radiologist cannot make that determination and I am aware that many radiologists are \u2013 are not current and they believe that they know and they\u2019re \u2013 they don\u2019t, they\u2019re wrong. So that\u2019s number one. Number two, in this particular instance, [Marianne] had a CT Scan of her sinuses for evaluation of the nasal fracture and there was less than two weeks, I don\u2019t forget- I don\u2019t remember the exact number of days, maybe ten, eleven days\napart. That CT Scan shows us the space between the brain and the skull, the subdural space. We don\u2019t see the entire subdural space but we see the frontal lobes and there is no fluid in there. So in terms of chronic or even \u2013 chronic blood on top of old blood well it would have been there, should have been there at the time and there was no evidence that it was there. So in this case, although radiographically we can't say whether this is new blood on old or all new, we do have the benefit of a fairly recent CT Scan and the blood was not there. So that\u2019s a powerful argument to suggest that this is not new on top of chronic but it\u2019s all new. And then lastly, not lastly, number three, this child had surgery and the neurosurgeon opened the child's skull and looked at what was in there and saw no evidence of chronic subdural. So we wouldn\u2019t expect chronic subdural and the neurosurgeon didn\u2019t see any chronic subdural. And then number four, we recognize that there is a possibility that children who have abnormal subdural space, which would be chronic subdural fluid in the space, that they might re-bleed, they might have bleeding on top of that chronic fluid with minimal impact. This is area-actually a area of study that we are still learning about. We \u2013 we know a limited amount. Some people actually don\u2019t believe that this predisposes children. I have \u2013 I happen to be somebody who does believe that it \u2013 it does predispose to bleeding. However, the bleeding that it predisposes to has nothing to do with the kind of bleeding and life threatening event that [Marianne] had. So, I would tell you that beyond a reasonable degree of medical certainty this is new blood and we had absolutely no reason to\nbelieve there\u2019s old blood in there and we have some evidence to suggest that there was no old blood in there.\n\n(T-PCR-2, 24-26).\n\n{\u00b6 42} Dr. Shapiro also rejected Dr. Rothfeder's opinion that Marianne's retinal hemorrhages had no diagnostic value. Dr. Shapiro agreed that retinal hemorrhaging is not \u201cpathogonomic\u201d (meaning a definitive diagnostic sign indicative of a particular condition) but he testified it was irresponsible to ignore it. Dr. Shapiro also disagreed with Dr. Rothfeder's opinion that the existence of the subdural hematoma itself may have caused the retinal hemorrhages in this case. He stated: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cause hemorrhaging like we saw in [Marianne].\u201d (Id. at 30).\n\n{\u00b6 43} Dr. Shapiro testified that he disagreed with Dr. Rothfeder's suggestion in his report that a short fall could have caused Marianne's injury.\n\n* * * He is right, and I agree, that short falls can at times cause unexpected intracranial injury including bleeding and we \u2013 I recognize this. Sometimes remarkably minimal impact results in intracranial bleeding. The \u2013 the types of bleeding that occurs from a short fall is not the type of bleeding and not the scenario that we see in [Marianne]. Typically, short fall bleedings \u2013 bleeding from short falls will be directly on the site of impact. [Marianne]'s was in the classic distribution that we see in kids who have suffered shaken injuries. And children who have trauma and head injury from short falls will, at most, have very minimal retinal hemorrhaging. Typically, they will have no retinal hemorrhages, that's bleeding behind the eyes. When they do have bleeding behind the eyes, it's limited to a small\npart of the retina. [Marianne] had bleeding in multiple layers and devastating bleeding. So, this is frankly as a physician it would be irresponsible for me to suggest that [Marianne\u2019s] intracranial injury was a result of a short fall.\n\n***\n\n*** I\u2019ve certainly seen kids who have unexpected injury from such minor falls as falling back on the back of the head. These are unusual, they can happen, but they don\u2019t look like [Marianne]\u2019s injuries. So, it\u2019s my experience includes kids who fall off of couches, fall off of beds, fall off of changing tables, fall off of bunk beds, kids who fall off the swings, kids who fall in playgrounds, kids who get their heads knocked in sporting injuries, these are all bread and butter pediatric emergency medicine type findings and they don\u2019t look anything like the injuries that [Marianne] presented with.\n\n***\n\n(Id. at 16-18).\n\n\u00b6 44 With regard to whether abusive head trauma or shaken baby syndrome is widely accepted, Shapiro testified it is widely accepted in a large number of medical fields. In regard to those who do not believe in the diagnosis, he said:\n\n*** It\u2019s a tiny fraction of the medical community that speaks a very loud voice. There\u2019s broad acceptance and concurrence among neurosurgeons, neurologists, radiologists, pediatricians in the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome. We have no debate. There is no debate in the medical field, except for a small handful of individuals who, for whatever reasons, feel that they need to speak very loudly about a so-called debate.\nThe debate is trumped up and doesn't exist. (Id. at 33).\n\n\u00b6 45 In conclusion, Dr. Shapiro opined that Marianne\u2019s injury was inconsistent with an accident and was indicative of abusive head trauma. On cross examination, he elaborated on that opinion: \u201c* * * But you've got retinal hemorrhages in multiple layers, you've got terrible intracranial bleeding, you got no serious trauma. So as a responsible physician, the\u2014any diagnosis other than child abuse would be rather difficult to come up with.\u201d (Id. at 55).\n\nThe trial court decision\n\n\u00b6 46 Based on the evidence presented, the trial court overruled Jones\u2019 post-conviction relief petition in an October 2016 decision and judgment entry. (Doc. #68). It held that attorney \u201cWannemacher\u2019s representation of the defendant was not objectively unreasonable, the defendant was not prejudiced by counsel's performance, and the defendant has failed to show that the result of the trial would not [sic] have been different but for counsel's representation.\u201d The trial court reasoned that Wannemacher had engaged in effective cross examination of the State\u2019s experts. It discounted Monson\u2019s expert testimony, pointing out that no biomechanical studies ever have been performed measuring the effect of forces on the brains of live humans. The trial court additionally found \u201clittle support\u201d for Jones\u2019 \u201cre-bleed\u201d theory.\n\n\u00b6 47 With regard to Wannemacher\u2019s failure to secure any expert witnesses, the trial court concluded that counsel\u2019s failure to do so \u201cdoes not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel, since the defendant has not shown a reasonable probability that the testimony of additional experts would change the outcome of this case.\u201d The trial court\nfound that Dr. Rothfeder\u2019s testimony about short falls and retinal hemorrhages was \u201ccalled into question\u201d by the contrary opinions of Dr. Makoroff and Dr. Shapiro, who the trial court found more credible largely because Dr. Rothfeder lacked \u201cclinical experience\u201d to testify about a child with Marianne\u2019s \u201ccomplicated and unusual medical conditions.\u201d The trial court also credited Dr. Shapiro\u2019s testimony that the nature of Marianne\u2019s retinal hemorrhages and extensive subdural hematoma were inconsistent with a short fall. In addition, the trial court found no credible evidence of any \u201cacute on chronic\u201d re-bleeding.\n\n\u00b6 48 As for Monson, the trial court noted that his experience is laboratory in nature and that hospitals do not employ biomechanical engineers. The trial court determined that his testimony was not \u201cparticularly probative of the issues\u201d in this case. The trial court also pointed out that Monson had discounted confessions involving injuries to shaken babies because the confessions might have been false or the defendants might have both shaken and struck the victims. The trial court then reasoned:\n\nDr. Makoroff\u2019s testimony at trial was that [Marianne] suffered abusive head trauma, the likes of which are consistent with shaking and impact with a soft surface. The defendant was not prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to call an expert to testify on his behalf. [Marianne\u2019s] complex medical history causes Dr. Rothfeder to erroneously conclude she is chronically fragile and that must be why she was so badly injured. Dr. Makoroff and Dr. Shapiro, whose entire careers have exclusively involved the care and treatment of children, have the necessary medical training and clinical experience to know, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that [Marianne] suffered abusive injuries, consistent with their experience with\nboth abuse injuries and accidental short falls. The proposed expert testimony would not have discredited Dr. Makoroff or Dr. Stevenson\u2019s testimony and would not have affected the outcome of the case.\n\nFinally, the trial court found no ineffective assistance of counsel based on Wannemacher\u2019s failure to call witnesses from Upper Valley Medical Center to testify about the UVMC CT scan reference to an acute-on-chronic subdural hematoma or his failure to impeach Dr. Makoroff with UVMC records on that issue. The trial court reasoned that Wannemacher had conducted effective cross examination and that there was \u201clittle medical support\u201d for the acute-on-chronic theory.\n\nIII. Analysis of Present Appeal\n\nJones has appealed from the trial court's denial of post-conviction relief. The governing statute, R.C. 2953.21, provides that \u201c[a]ny person who has been convicted of a criminal offense * * * and who claims that there was such a denial or infringement of the person\u2019s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States * * * may file a petition in the court that imposed sentence, stating the grounds for relief relied upon, and asking the court to vacate or set aside the judgment or sentence or to grant other appropriate relief.\u201d R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a).\n\nWe review a trial court\u2019s denial of post-conviction relief for an abuse of discretion. State v. Sapp, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2015-CA-43, 2017-Ohio-1467, \u00b6 6. An abuse of discretion implies an arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable attitude on the part of the trial court. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). \u201cA decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process that would support\nthat decision.\" *Parrett v. Wright*, 2017-Ohio-764, 85 N.E.3d 1067, \u00b6 13 (2d Dist.). Moreover, we have previously indicated that we defer to the trial court's finding with regard to credibility in post-conviction proceedings. *State v. Hathaway*, 2015-Ohio-5488, 55 N.E.3d 634, \u00b6 21 (2d Dist.). We have recognized that during an evidentiary hearing on a post-conviction relief petition, the trial court serves as the trier of fact and is charged with assessing the credibility of the witnesses. *State v. Robinson*, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2013-CA-33, 2014-Ohio-1663, \u00b6 36; *State v. Hamilton*, 2d Dist. Clark No. 98 CA 98, 2000 WL 282303, *5 (March 17, 2000).\n\n{\u00b6 52} Jones' petition alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, which can constitute grounds for post-conviction relief. *State v. Robinson*, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2013-CA-33, 2014-Ohio-1663, \u00b6 20. He claimed ineffective assistance based on, among other things, Wannemacher's failure to retain one or more expert witnesses to assist in his defense. A defendant is deprived of effective assistance of counsel when (1) counsel's performance is deficient and (2) that deficient performance prejudices the defendant. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To establish prejudice, a defendant must do more than show that counsel's deficient performance had a conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding. *State v. Hathaway*, 2015-Ohio-5488, 55 N.E.3d 634, \u00b6 12 (2d Dist.), quoting *Strickland* at 693. For ineffective assistance of counsel to cause prejudice, such a result does not have to be shown by a preponderance of the evidence. \"The defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" *Id.*, at 694.\nGrounds asserted in the post-conviction petition.\n\n\u00b6 53 Specifically, in his petition, Jones raises four distinct grounds as a bases for relief. We review these grounds and the trial court\u2019s disposition of them in an order that facilitates our analysis. The first raised ground is that trial counsel \u201cfailed to reasonably investigate and challenge the medical records in the case.\u201d (Doc. #43 at 32). The focus of this contention is that counsel should have done more to challenge Dr. Makaroff\u2019s opinions. Jones asserts that Marianne \u201cdid, in fact have a bleeding disorder\u201d (Id. at 33), that a short fall could not be ruled out as a cause of the injury because Monson said a short fall is of much higher acceleration than shaking, and that Makaroff\u2019s elimination of a re-bleed possibility went unchallenged. Essentially, this ground of the petition claims the medical records demonstrate Dr. Makaroff was wrong on the issues of \u201cbleeding disorder, short fall, and acute on chronic subdural hematoma.\u201d (Id. at 35). The trial court reasonably found no support for this ground, and we agree.\n\n\u00b6 54 With regard to the medical records supporting the notion that Marianne had a \u201cbleeding disorder,\u201d the trial court concluded that contention was based on a \u201cmisstatement,\u201d which we characterize as a plain mistake, by the medical expert Jones presented. No further consideration of a failure to present evidence of a non-existent bleeding disorder is warranted.\n\n\u00b6 55 With regard to injury from a short fall, a term for which there is no apparent accepted definition, the trial court noted that the essence of Monson\u2019s testimony was only that impact from a short fall would produce larger accelerations than shaking. We believe in addition that Monson\u2019s testimony also supports a biomechanical opinion that shaking alone would not cause Marianne\u2019s subdural hematoma. But, in any event, we agree with\nthe trial court that Monson\u2019s testimony was \u201cnot particularly probative of the issues involved\u201d in the post-conviction proceeding and would have had \u201cnegligible probative value.\u201d We note that although Dr. Makaroff testified that such an injury could result from being \u201cshaken violently,\u201d her opinion of abusive head trauma included the potential of an \u201cimpact to her head\u201d (T-2, 78) or slamming onto a soft or hard surface (Id. at 87). Her testimony that this type of injury \u201crequires a great bit of force\u201d (T-2, 63) is not inconsistent with Monson\u2019s. The inconsistency between Monson\u2019s testimony and that of Dr. Makaroff\u2019s is Monson\u2019s opinion that shaking alone does not result in sufficient G-force to result in an injury like Marianne\u2019s. We also note from the testimony that we have quoted, Monson\u2019s admission that he could not say Marianne\u2019s injuries were from a short fall (Monson Depo., 68) and that such results are \u201cpretty rare.\u201d (Id. at 67). The trial court also considered the post-conviction testimony of Dr. Shapiro to the effect that Marianne\u2019s injury was not the result of a short fall. In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the post-conviction evidence about the possibility of a short fall would not have made any difference.\n\n\u00b6 56 In his petition, Appellant argues that \u201cDr. Stevenson admitted that he would not have been able to see the old blood because of the active bleeding in [Marianne\u2019s] brain at the time.\u201d (Doc. #43 at 34). We believe that argument is inconsistent with the entirety of Dr. Stevenson\u2019s testimony. Dr. Stevenson concluded there was no evidence of a prior subdural hematoma. We have also quoted Dr. Shapiro\u2019s testimony on the subject, which we referred to as compelling. On this record, no reasonable juror would conclude that Marianne had a prior subdural hematoma or a re-bleed thereof.\n\n\u00b6 57 Ground III of the petition asserts that counsel was ineffective when he \u201cfailed\nto call the Upper Valley Medical Center treating physicians and Radiologists as witnesses.\u201d (Doc. #43 at 38). We observe that if this ground were sufficient to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, a conclusion we do not embrace, current counsel has repeated it. Those potential witnesses were not called to the post-conviction hearing. Consequently, petitioner has presented no evidence that calling those witnesses would have made any difference. On this ground, the trial court wrote that \u201cthere is little medical support that there was an acute on chronic subdural hematoma that caused [Marianne\u2019s] hematoma. The CT scan from UVMC alone is not sufficient to make that determination. The CT scan reveals the possibility of mixed-density blood but that is not substantiated by the prior facial CT scan from her nasal fracture showing no subdural hematoma at all or Dr. Stevenson's observation of [Marianne] during brain surgery.\u201d (Doc# 68 at14). We do not find the trial court was unreasonable in rejecting this ground for relief in the petition.\n\nEnumerated Ground IV of the petition states that trial counsel was ineffective when he \u201cfailed to impeach Dr. Makaroff with medical records that were readily available\u201d. (Doc.# 43, 40) The medical records specifically itemized are a) the UVMC records to contradict that there was no evidence of an acute on chronic subdural hematoma and b) the Children\u2019s Hospital records regarding a bleeding disorder. Petitioner argued that introduction of these records would have impeached Dr. Makaroff\u2019s testimony. In reverse order, there is no record that demonstrates a bleeding disorder at the time of admission to Children\u2019s. And, there is no reasonable possibility the UVMC CT scan record we have discussed at length would have had any influence on Dr. Makaroff\u2019s testimony let alone the speculation that it would have impeached her testimony. There is no reasonable probability that this ground would have impacted the trial whatsoever.\nGround II, failure to retain an expert\n\n\u00b6 59 The remaining Ground II for relief is that Jones' counsel was ineffective \u201cwhen his attorney failed to retain an expert to provide trial testimony\u201d. (Doc. #43 at 35). In our opinion, because trial counsel did not sufficiently exhaust attempts to obtain the assistance of or the testimony of an expert witness, and he was therefore not in a position to make an informed decision whether or not to call an expert to testify, we conclude the trial court's decision finding no deficient performance by Wannemacher was unreasonable. Nonetheless, on this record, given the trial and post-conviction evidence, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding there is not a reasonable probability of a different result and denying the post-conviction motion for relief.\n\nA. Deficient Representation\n\n\u00b6 60 We find it unreasonable to conclude that Wannemacher provided non-deficient representation by failing to engage an expert to assist in the defense and to allow counsel to be able to make an informed decision whether to have that expert testify. We do not dispute that Wannemacher himself prepared for the issues in the trial. A summary of Jones' contentions in his post-conviction evidence is that 1) Marianne was a complex patient, a fact that contributed to her injury, 2) there is a possibility of an acute-on-chronic hematoma, 3) a short fall can cause a subdural hematoma, 4) Marianne had a bleeding disorder, and 5) a retinal hemorrhage is not diagnostic. We eliminate the bleeding disorder because it did not exist. With regard to each of the other post-conviction contentions, Wannemacher's cross examination at trial and his testimony at the post-conviction-relief hearing both reflect significant preparation to show he was familiar with and inquired about each of the contentions raised in post-conviction, and he was able to\nobtain several concessions from the State's witnesses.\n\n\u00b6 61 In the case of *Flick v. Warren*, 465 Fed.Appx. 461 (6th Cir. 2012), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals indicated in a 1998 shaken-baby death case that it was not ineffective assistance of counsel to decide not to further seek an expert after counsel received unfavorable responses from three doctors he had contacted for help. Under those circumstances, \u201ceffective assistance of counsel does not require counsel to continue contacting experts until he has found one.\u201d *Id.* at 464. On the other hand, here we conclude Wannemacher\u2019s efforts to obtain an expert were simply insufficient to demonstrate that he made a strategic choice to proceed without an expert. \u201cStrategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d *Strickland* at 690-691.\n\n\u00b6 62 On this record, we see no sound reason for Wannemacher\u2019s admitted failure to retain an expert to assist with medical issues, and to put counsel in a position to make a strategic decision whether that expert should be called to testify. That failure was not \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d and was deficient. The evidence established that Jones and the child\u2019s mother had put the child down for a nap shortly before the injury. Jones testified in his own defense and claimed subsequently to have found the child on the floor unresponsive. The State\u2019s experts ruled out any other cause and opined that Marianne\u2019s condition must have been the result of abuse by Jones. At that point, although there were concessions about other potential causes of Marianne\u2019s injury, Jones should have been\nin a position to decide whether to call an expert in his defense. Due to defense counsel's failure to retain an expert, he had little beyond Jones' own testimony to offer. We do not, and need not, resolve the question of whether Wannamaker, armed with the experts who testified in post-conviction, could have made a strategic decision not to call them after he had obtained some concessions on each of the medical issues called into question.\n\nB. Prejudice\n\n\u00b6 63 The remaining issue is whether Jones was prejudiced by defense counsel's failure to retain an expert and/or to call an expert to testify at trial to rebut the State's experts. The trial court found no prejudice to Jones based largely on its evaluation of the credibility of the competing experts. With regard to defense experts Dr. Rothfeder and Monson, the trial court found that the nature of their experience made them less credible than the prosecution's experts. It reasoned:\n\nThe court found the testimony of defendant's experts, Dr. Rothfeder and Dr. Monson, to have negligible probative value in evaluating their criticisms of and differences with the testimony of Dr. Makoroff and Dr. Stevenson. This conclusion is based in no small part on the vast difference in clinical experience between [Marianne's] treating physicians at Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Dr. Rothfeder, and, in the case of Dr. Monson, the absence of clinical experience. The testimony of the defendant's experts does not demonstrate to this court a probability that the jury would have reached a different verdict.\n\n\u00b6 64 The trial court also found more credible the prosecution experts' testimony about retinal hemorrhages, the \"re-bleed\" dispute, the inability of a short fall to cause\nMarianne\u2019s injuries, and abusive head trauma actually causing the child\u2019s injury. We recognize that \u201cexpert witnesses in criminal cases can testify in terms of possibility rather than in terms of a reasonable scientific certainty or probability.\u201d State v. Lang, 129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, \u00b6 77. \u201cThe treatment of such testimony involves \u2018an issue of sufficiency, not admissibility.\u2019 \u201dId., quoting State v. D\u2019Ambrosio, 67 Ohio St.3d 185, 191, 616 N.E.2d 909 (1993). But when experts testify about a variety of possibilities or about underlying suppositions that are unsupported by the weight of the evidence, the strength of their opinions has less weight than those expressed to a reasonable medical certainty.\n\n\u00b6 65 As set forth above, Dr. Rothfeder opined that it would be impossible \u201cto draw definite conclusions in terms of the cause of [Marianne\u2019s] acute subdural with any reasonable certainty\u201d and that it would be impossible \u201cto conclude that those injuries were the result of child abuse.\u201d (T-PCR-1, 17). But a fair reading of his entire testimony is that he would testify to that effect regardless of the medical aspects of this case because there was no witness to or admission about the mechanism of injury and in those circumstances he does not believe in the abusive head trauma/shaken baby diagnosis at all. (T-PCR-1, 37). The potential contributing causes Dr. Rothfeder identified were re-bleeding of a prior, chronic subdural hematoma, a complex patient with ongoing infection related to the earlier nasal fracture, a \u201cshort fall,\u201d and his mistaken bleeding disorder, none of which did he specify was the probable or reasonably certain cause of Marianne\u2019s injury. We previously indicated Appellant complains that in closing argument, the prosecutor seized on the\n\n5 A more cogent reason for allowing criminal-case experts to testify about \u201cpossibilities\u201d is that the defense has no burden to prove what happened, but may raise reasonable doubt about what possibly may not have happened.\nabsence of any competing expert testimony at trial and \u201cemphasized that \u2018no doctor or any other witness ever said there is an old injury that\u2019s related to the injury [Marianne] suffered\u2019.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Merit Brief at 6). Even if Jones\u2019 post-conviction medical expert had testified at trial, the preceding closing argument could still accurately and correctly have been made because that defense expert testified in terms of possibilities rather than certainty or probability. For instance, regarding the existence of a chronic hematoma, he stated: \u201cSo a variety of possibilities are in play * * *.\u201d (T-PCR-1, 30). And with regard to the possibility of spontaneous or mild trauma as a cause of re-bleeding, he said: \u201c[W]hat I\u2019m talking about now is not the type of phenomenon that is now well understood or completely understood or has been you know historically clarified over time. It\u2019s not the kind of thing that physicians have a perfect handle on. So everything I\u2019m talking about remains in a \u2013 a state of incomplete understanding as \u2013 as medicine presently exists.\u201d (Id. at 32). Moreover, had the defense called Dr. Rothfeder at trial, his mistaken testimony about Marianne\u2019s non-existent bleeding disorder, which he said contributed to his analysis, likely would have resulted in further loss of credibility with the jury.\n\n{\u00b6 66} The trial court additionally discredited Monson\u2019s testimony because he lacks clinical experience, biomechanical studies have not been performed measuring the effect of impact forces on the brains of live humans, and Monson\u2019s experience is laboratory in nature and hospitals do not employ biomechanical engineers. In our view, taking Monson\u2019s testimony at face-value leads to the conclusion that an intensely forceful event occurred in Marianne\u2019s bedroom, which is consistent with the opinions of Drs. Stevenson, Makaroff, Gray, and Shapiro and contrary to the opinions of Dr. Rothfeder.\n\n{\u00b6 67} To be sure, we recognize that there are those, including Jones\u2019 post-\nconviction experts, who reject the diagnosis of abusive head trauma. Our research, and the evidence in this case, supports a belief that acceptance of the diagnosis is by far the prevailing view. See, e.g., Sandeep Narang, M.D., J.D., A Daubert Analysis of Abusive Head Trauma/Shaken Baby Syndrome, 11 Hous. J. Health L. & Pol'y 505-633 (2011). Criticism is often fostered by the legal defense community adopting the minority medical opinion. See, e.g., Deborah Tuerkheimer, The Next Innocence Project: Shaken Baby Syndrome and the Criminal Courts, 87 Wash. U. L.Rev. 1, 27 (2009). Some courts have also joined the fray by doing their own literature analysis to support a conclusion for one side or the other. See, e.g., Cavazos v. Smith, 565 U.S. 1, 132 S.Ct. 2, 181 L.Ed.2d 311 (2011) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (citing biomechanical and other studies raising doubt about shaken baby syndrome, most particularly whether it can be caused by shaking alone). But our function and duty is not to weigh in or vote for one side or the other, let alone solve any disagreement of some in the medical community. Nor is it our position to substitute how we might have ruled on the petition if we had considered it in the first instance. Our review is to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in its ruling.\n\n\u00b6 68 Having painstakingly reviewed the record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s credibility analysis was not unreasonable and did not in itself constitute an abuse of discretion. We also determine that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that the post-conviction evidence, in the context of the entire record, would not support a reasonable probability of a different result. Finally, Jones\u2019 post-conviction evidence is not sufficient to undermine our confidence in the outcome of his trial.\n\nIV. Conclusion\nBased on the reasoning set forth above, we overrule Jones\u2019 assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the Miami County Common Pleas Court.\n\nTUCKER, J., concurs.\n\nFROELICH, J., dissenting;\n\nI would hold that the trial court acted unreasonably in finding that there is not a reasonable probability that, had the defense called experts, the result would have been different. This does not mean that the Appellant probably would have been found not guilty with \u201cevidence to support his story,\u201d only that it is not unreasonable to so conclude.\n\nMarianne slept in the same room as her mother and Appellant and the injury happened during a \u201cwindow\u201d when the child was not connected to any medical support equipment. (T-1, 202) Although the prosecutor speculated in closing that there were incidents that might have angered the Appellant and caused him to momentarily \u201cstep too far over that cliff\u201d (T-3, 9), there was no testimony or evidence that the Appellant had ever been abusive to Marianne or anyone prior to the day of the injury; nor was there any evidence that he had a quick temper or was prone to fits of anger or was anxious, overwhelmed, or upset on the day of the injury.\n\nThe State argued that motive is not an element and that Appellant\u2019s testimony that \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to her,\u201d \u201cjust doesn\u2019t cut it in the face of the medical evidence that we have in this case.\u201d (T-3, 4). \u201cIf he asks you to believe something, which he did, there has to be evidence to support it. And the medical evidence does not\nsupport his story\u201d (emphasis added) (T-3, 11). \u201cNo matter what defense counsel tells you, use your collective memory; no doctor or any other witness ever said there is an old injury that\u2019s related to the injury she suffered on August 5, 2010 ...\u201d (T-3, 11); the evidence, the prosecutor argued, \u201cdoesn\u2019t support\u201d any of those \u201ctheoretical possibilities\u201d suggested by defense counsel. \u201cIt defies medical evidence that it- this injury could have been caused by a non-event, which is what the Defendant would have you believe\u201d (T-3, 31), but rather it had to be \u201cshaking her or hitting her against a soft surface.\u201d (T-3, 37).\n\n{\u00b6 73} The State\u2019s arguments were based on the only evidence the jury heard; and the jury\u2019s verdict was, as we held on direct appeal, not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The State concluded that \u201c\u2026 you can follow the medical evidence and the expert testimony and the vast experience on this particular topic, or you can follow what the Defendant said\u2026\u201d (T-3, 30). In other words, in the absence of any medical explanation to the contrary, the jury should believe the unrebutted scientific, medical testimony the State produced and not the denial of a person with no \u201cevidence to support it\u201d and with an obvious reason not to tell the truth. As in Ceasor v. Ocwieja, 655 Fed.Appx. 263 (6th Cir. 2016), \u201cThe expert is the case.\u201d (Emphasis in original and internal citations omitted.) 6\n\n{\u00b6 74} The trial court\u2019s wholesale rejection of Monson\u2019s bio-mechanical-based testimony and its total discounting of Rothfeder\u2019s testimony, based on his different\n\n---\n\n6 In Ceasor, a federal habeas corpus case, the state court had denied an appeal of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim without holding a hearing where the defendant could introduce his own experts\u2019 testimony on what they would have said at trial. Here, the trial court held the hearing and, as stated above, found there was no reasonable probability of a different result. In neither case did the defense call any experts and the convictions were dependent on the State\u2019s experts alone.\nprofessional experiences than the State's physicians, deprived Appellant of the right to have the jury make such credibility decisions.\\textsuperscript{7} I appreciate that in a PCR hearing, the court may sometimes make such judgments. However, in this entirely circumstantial case without any other inferentially-supportive evidence of the Defendant's actions, and where competent evidence exists that is not a \u201ctheoretical possibility,\u201d confidence in the fairness of the proceeding and the outcome of the case is undermined.\n\nCopies mailed to:\n\nJanna Parker\nNikki Baszynski\nHon.

{"Index": "285-Guy", "Context": "1 \n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO \nEASTERN DIVISION \n \nJAMES GUY,        \n   Petitioner,  : Case No. 2:20-cv-5459   \n \n       Judge Sarah D. Morrison \n- vs    -     Magistrate Judge Michael R. Merz \n \nWARDEN, \n   Ross Correctional Institution \n \n   Defendant.  : \n \nOPINION AND ORDER \n  This habeas corpus action, brought pro se by Petitioner James Guy under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254, is before the Court on Petitioner\u2019s Objections (ECF No. 31) to the \nMagistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendations recommending that the Petition \nbe dismissed with prejudice. (ECF No. 28). \n A litigant who objects to a Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report on a dispositive matter \nsuch as the merits of a habeas corpus petition is entitled to a de novo review of \nthose portions of report to which substantial objection is made. The Court has \nconducted that de novo review; its conclusion is embodied in this Opinion and \nOrder. \nSummary of the Report \n In his Petition, Guy pleaded Grounds for Relief A through L. Then in his \nTraverse he voluntarily abandoned all claims that he did not argue in that pleading \nand re-numbered his claims. (Traverse, ECF No. 27, PageID 2616). The Report \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 1 of 16  PAGEID #: 26882 \n \nconcluded Guy\u2019s actual innocence claim had been abandoned and his insufficiency of \nthe evidence claim was without merit. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2650.)  The \nMagistrate Judge found Guy\u2019s claim of constitutional error in failing to excuse a \nbiased juror (Ground D/Four) was procedurally defaulted by failure to make a \ncontemporaneous objection. (Id. at PageID 2657.)  Guy claimed the trial judge \nimpermissibly allowed evidence of his religion (Ground F/Six) which the Magistrate \nJudge recommended be dismissed as without merit. (Id. at PageID 2662.)  The \nReport concluded that Guy\u2019s claim that he was unconstitutionally denied a new trial \n(Ground Ten/J) did not state a constitutional claim on which habeas corpus relief \ncould be granted. (Id. at PageID 2662.)   \nIn Ground Thirteen/K(a)(1) Guy asserted he received ineffective assistance of \nappellate counsel when his appellate attorney failed to plead as an assignment of \nerror that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to grant a continuance or \nimpose sanctions on the prosecution due to untimely disclosure of discovery \nmaterial. Petitioner had raised this claim in an application to reopen his appeal and \nthe Ohio Tenth District Court of Appeals rejected it on the merits. (Id. at PageID \n2664-66, quoting the Tenth District\u2019s opinion which appears in the State Court \nRecord. (ECF No. 18, Ex. 38, PageID 633-35).)  The Report concluded this decision \nwas entitled to deference under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). (ECF No. 28, PageID 2667.) \n  \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 2 of 16  PAGEID #: 26893 \n \nI. Petitioner\u2019s Objections Outside the Scope of the Report \n Aside from his objections on the merits of the Report, Petitioner raised two \nobjections to pre-Report orders. \nA. Objection to Transfer Order \n Petitioner objects \u201cstrongly\u201d to the transfer of the Magistrate Judge reference \nin this case from Magistrate Judge Vascura to Magistrate Judge Merz. (Objections, \nECF No. 31, PageID 2683). That transfer occurred August 16, 2021 and was entered \nby Judge Vascura with Judge Merz\u2019s consent (ECF No. 4). Because it was a pre-trial \ndecision on a non-dispositive matter, Petitioner had the right to object within \nfourteen days of service of the order, or not later than August 30, 2021. Fed.R.Civ.P. \n72(a). However, Petitioner made no objection to the Transfer Order until filing his \ninstant Objections on November 5, 2021. Rule 72(a) expressly provides \u201c[a] party \nmay not assign as error a defect in the order not timely objected to.\u201d  Petitioner\u2019s \nobjection to the Transfer Order is overruled because it is untimely. \n This Objection is also overruled on the merits. Litigants obviously have no \nright to choose the judges to whom their cases are assigned. By the same token, \nthey have no right to prevent transfer of cases within the Court when judges find \nsuch transfers useful \u201cto secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination\u201d of \na case. Quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. Magistrate Judge Merz is serving this Court on \nrecall and has particularly encouraged other Magistrate Judges to transfer habeas \ncorpus cases to him. All the District Judges of this Court have permitted Magistrate \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 3 of 16  PAGEID #: 26904 \n \nJudges to transfer cases among themselves upon mutual consent. Litigants do not \nhave standing to object to such transfers.  \nB. Objection to Exclusion of Personal Recorder \n Petitioner also objects to Magistrate Judge Merz\u2019s Order (ECF No. 26) \ndenying Petitioner\u2019s \u201cMotion to Accept Personal Recorder to Correct Current/False \nTranscript Record on File.\u201d (ECF No. 14). \n Petitioner\u2019s Motion advised the Court that he personally recorded his second \ntrial because he believed the record of his first trial, which ended in a mistrial, had \nbeen falsified. He now seeks to correct the record by substituting his recording for a \nportion of the official record. The Magistrate Judge denied this motion because it \nhad never been submitted to the Ohio courts, despite a provision for correcting the \nrecord on appeal (ECF No. 16, PageID 2623, citing Ohio R. App. P. 11(E)).  \n Petitioner objects, essentially arguing the merits of the substitution he \nwishes to make. He makes no response to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s conclusion that he \ndefaulted on this claim by never presenting it to the Ohio courts. Nor does he \ndispute the rationale behind the Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling:  because anyone can \nrecord anything that happens in an Ohio courtroom, failure to enforce Ohio R. App. \nP. 11(E) could easily lead to endless litigation about \u201cwhat really happened\u201d at the \ntrial.  \n Accordingly, Petitioner\u2019s objection on this issue is OVERRULED on the \nmerits and also because it is untimely. Any objection to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s \nOrder on this issue should have been filed by September 13, 2021. \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 4 of 16  PAGEID #: 26915 \n \nII. Petitioner\u2019s Objections to the Report Itself \nA. Failure to Excuse a Biased Juror (Ground Four/D) \n Turning to substantive objections, Petitioner first objects to the recommended \ndismissal of his claim that a biased juror should have been excused. (Objections, \nECF No. 31, PageID 2672-74).   \n Petitioner claims a particular juror should have been excused because (1) the \njuror was the mother-in-law of a good friend of the judge and (2) the same juror's \nson was best friends with an undercover police officer who had been convicted and \nimprisoned based on actions he took in his official capacity. During an in-chambers \nconference at which Petitioner was present, no one expressed any concern about the \njuror\u2019s remaining, but the next day Guy, who was representing himself, asked that \nshe be replaced.   \n The Respondent asserted this biased juror claim was procedurally defaulted \nbecause Guy failed to make a contemporaneous objection to her after he knew all \nthe relevant facts. The Magistrate Judge upheld this defense, noting that Ohio does \nhave a procedural rule requiring contemporaneous objection which the trial judge \nhad enforced by refusing to substitute an alternate and the Ohio Tenth District \nCourt of Appeals had enforced by reviewing this assignment of error only for plain \nerror. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2651-57). \n Petitioner objects that the Ohio contemporaneous objection rule does not \napply when an objection is eventually made at a time when it can be dealt with by \nthe trial court without prejudice to the parties. (ECF No. 31, PageID 2672). \nHowever, he cites no Ohio case law to that effect and this position is plainly \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 5 of 16  PAGEID #: 26926 \n \ninconsistent with his admission on appeal that he had failed to timely object and \nthe standard of review was therefore plain error. (Appellant\u2019s Brief, State Court \nRecord, ECF No. 18, Ex. 24, PageID 367-68.)1   \nThe question of whether an objection is \u201ccontemporaneous enough\u201d is a \nquestion of Ohio, not federal, law. In deciding habeas corpus cases, federal courts \nare bound by state court decisions of what the state law is. Railey v. Webb, 540 F.3d \n393 (6th Cir. 2008), citing Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U.S. 74, 76 (2005)(\u201cWe have \nrepeatedly held that a state court\u2019s interpretation of state law, including one \nannounced on direct appeal of the challenged conviction, binds a federal court \nsitting in habeas corpus.\u201d), Maldonado v. Wilson, 416 F.3d 470 (6th Cir. 2005); \nVroman v. Brigano, 346 F.3d 598 (6th Cir. 2003). In this particular case, the Ohio \nTenth District Court of Appeals essentially held that Guy\u2019s objection, made a day \nafter he had said he had no objection, was not timely. That is the Ohio law of \ncontemporaneous objection as it applies to this case. To put it another way, there is \nno clearly established federal constitutional law requiring a state to review on the \nmerits an objection to a sitting juror which is made a day after a defendant says he \nhas no objection. \nIn a Supplement to his Objections, Petitioner criticizes the Report\u2019s analysis \nof Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103 (1990). Noting Guy\u2019s citation to Osborne, the \nMagistrate Judge reasoned \u201cIn Osborne, supra, where the Supreme Court upheld \n \n1Although Guy represented himself at trial, he was represented by counsel on \nappeal. Guy is bound by the concession made on his behalf. \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 6 of 16  PAGEID #: 26937 \n \napplication of the contemporaneous objection rule, the error was in jury instructions \nto which no objection was made. There is no indication in the opinion that a later \nobjection would have saved the claim.\u201d  (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2656). \n In the portion of Osborne quoted in the Objections, the Supreme Court is \nexplaining its prior decision in Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415 (1965) when it \nstates:   \nWe followed [in Douglas] \u201cour consistent holdings that the adequacy of \nstate procedural bars to the assertion of federal questions is itself a \nfederal question\u201d and stated that \u201c[i]n determining the sufficiency of \nobjections we have applied the general principle that an objection \nwhich is ample and timely to bring the alleged federal error to the \nattention of the trial court and enable it to take appropriate corrective \naction is sufficient to serve legitimate state interests, and therefore \nsufficient to preserve the claim for review here.\u201d [quoting Douglas, 380 \nU.S. ] at 422, 85 S.Ct., at 1078. Concluding that \u201c[n]o legitimate state \ninterest would have been served by requiring repetition of a patently \nfutile objection,\u201d we held that the Alabama procedural ruling did not \npreclude our consideration of the defendant's constitutional claim. Id., \nat 421\u2013422, 85 S.Ct., at 1078\u20131079. \n \n496 U.S. at 125. \n Contrary to Petitioner\u2019s argument, the Report does not contradict Osborne. \nAs the Report noted, there are several issues involved in deciding whether a claim \nhas been procedurally defaulted. Once the Warden has raised the procedural \ndefault defense, the habeas court must decide if the State has a relevant procedural \nrule and whether the State courts have enforced that rule in the case in suit. \n(Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2654, citing, inter alia, Maupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d \n135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986)). Those are questions of state law. Then the habeas court \nmust decide if the state rule is an \"adequate and independent\" state ground on \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 7 of 16  PAGEID #: 26948 \n \nwhich the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim. \nMaupin. As Osborne teaches, this is a question of federal law. Unlike the repetitive \nobjection rule in Douglas discussed in Osborne, however, the Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals has repeatedly held that Ohio\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule is an \nadequate and independent procedural rule. Wogenstahl v. Mitchell, 668 F.3d 307, \n334 (6th Cir. 2012), citing Keith v. Mitchell, 455 F.3d 662, 673 (6th Cir. 2006); \nGoodwin v. Johnson, 632 F.3d 301, 315 (6th Cir. 2011); Smith v. Bradshaw, 591 F.3d \n517, 522 (6th Cir. 2010); Nields v. Bradshaw, 482 F.3d 442 (6th Cir. 2007); Biros v. \nBagley, 422 F.3d 379, 387 (6th Cir. 2005). \n Indeed as the Report notes, Guy admitted in his Traverse that the Sixth \nCircuit had repeatedly upheld this rule as adequate and independent. (Report, ECF \nNo. 28, PageID 2655, citing Traverse, ECF No. 27, PageID 2617.) The combined \ncitations given in the Report and those admitted by Petitioner conclusively \ndemonstrate that Ohio\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule is an adequate and \nindependent state procedural ground of decision, consistent with the analysis in \nOsborne, supra. \n Because he found this Ground for Relief procedurally defaulted, the \nMagistrate Judge did not address the merits. While the Court finds the procedural \ndefault analysis correct, it is also true that the biased juror claim is without merit. \nThe factual basis of the claim is (1) the juror in question was the mother-in-law of a \ngood friend of the judge and (2) the same juror's son was best friends with an \nundercover police officer who had been convicted and imprisoned based on actions \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 8 of 16  PAGEID #: 26959 \n \nhe took in his official capacity. Guy\u2019s argument that these facts show he was \ndeprived of an impartial jury is completely conclusory. Assume the juror, rather \nthan her mother-in-law, was friends with the judge. Why does that make her \nbiased?  Ohio judges are elected officials. In some smaller Ohio counties judges who \nhave been in office for some time probably get friends or acquaintances as jurors on \na regular basis, but the Supreme Court has never held this creates a biased jury. In \na large county like Franklin, this probably happens rarely, but the Constitution was \nwritten for counties of all sizes. \n As the Tenth District noted on appeal, there was never any evidence of actual \nbias. Rather the argument was that the juror was potentially biased and the trial \njudge, considering all the evidence, found no basis for disqualification. Whether or \nnot a juror is disqualified by bias is a question of fact on which we are bound by \nstate court findings unless a petitioner shows the finding is in error by clear and \nconvincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Petitioner has presented no evidence of \nactual bias, so his Fourth Ground for Relief fails on the merits, as well as being \nprocedurally defaulted. \nB. Ground Six/F:  Prejudicial Evidence of Petitioner\u2019s Religion \n In his Sixth Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims the trial judge improperly \nallowed evidence of his Muslim religion. The Warden argued this claim was \nprocedurally defaulted because it had been presented to the Tenth District solely as \nan issue of relevance under Ohio R. Evid. 402. While the Magistrate Judge provided \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 9 of 16  PAGEID #: 269610 \n \nsome analysis of the fair presentation claim, he ultimately recommended this claim \nbe denied on the merits. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2658-62.  \nThe Report found that evidence of Petitioner\u2019s religion was in a recorded jail \ncall in which he admitted he was a member of the Black P. Stone organization and \nthat was why he became a Muslim. While his religion was irrelevant, his \nmembership in Black P. Stone was a key factor in identifying him as the \nperpetrator of the crime in suit and the state courts found, after attempting \nredaction, that the Muslim and Black P. Stone admissions could not be separated. \nThe Magistrate Judge recommended deference to that state court fact finding. \n Petitioner objects that the prosecutor was allowed to argue that Guy\u2019s \naffiliation with Black P. Stone supported the improper inference that the use of the \nnickname \u201cStone\u201d during the crime proved Guy was the perpetrator. (Objections, \nECF No. 31, PageID 2675). To show the inference was improper, he argues that the \nState\u2019s expert witness testimony about conduct of members of the organization was \n\u201cbogus\u201d and then offers his own statements of fact to contradict the expert. Id. \n Arguments about the validity of expert testimony and of inferences are \nquestions for the jury. There was no constitutional violation in allowing the State to \nattempt to prove Guy was the perpetrator of this crime by introducing his \nadmission of membership in the Black P. Stone organization and then showing \nmembers often call one another \u201cBrother Stone\u201d which had happened during the \ncrime. The fact that Guy stated in the same breath that he was a Muslim was his \nown doing. The State made no argument at all relying on his religious \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 10 of 16  PAGEID #: 269711 \n \nidentification. And Petitioner\u2019s statement of fact in the Objections are not under \noath and cannot be considered because they were not offered in the trial court. \nCullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170 (2011). \nC. Ground Eight/H:  Insufficient Evidence  \n In his Eighth Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts there was insufficient \nevidence introduced at trial to support a conviction. The Tenth District Court of \nAppeals decided this claim on the merits and the Magistrate Judge concluded that \ndecision had applied the governing precedent, Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 \n(1979), applying that precedent reasonably. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2644-50, \nquoting State v. Guy, 2018-Ohio-4836 (Ohio App. 10th Dist. Dec. 6, 2018). \n Petitioner objects that the State conflated evidence from the controlled buy \non October 16, 2014, with evidence seized pursuant to search warrant on October \n17, 2014. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2677). As can be seen from reviewing \nthose portions of the Tenth District\u2019s decision on this issue, Petitioner made \nseparate claims of insufficiency as to the two dates. For October 16 he claimed the \nState had not shown enough to prove kidnapping and drug trafficking, but there \nwas evidence he brandished a firearm in complicity with his brother\u2019s sale of heroin \nto an undercover officer. The search that occurred on October 17 found him in the \nsame place, 72 South Wheatland, where the prior day\u2019s offenses had occurred. The \npolice also found heroin and drug packaging paraphernalia. The Tenth District \napplied the usual rule that circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction. State \nv. Guy, supra, \u00b6\u00b6 44. \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 11 of 16  PAGEID #: 269812 \n \n It is true that evidence of offenses on both days was presented in one trial. \nBut it is also true that circumstantial evidence from each of the two days supported \neach of the convictions. Petitioner did not raise as an assignment of error that these \ncases were tried together, even though he sought severance pre-trial. \n He also argues the State did not prove he possessed the drugs that were \nfound on October 17, asserting they were in the constructive possession of another \nindividual. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2677). He particularly refers the Court \nto the testimony of Daniel Guy at PageID 2193 where the witness testifies there \nwas a room at 72 South Wheatland for Andrew Naus, referred to in the transcript \nas \u201cDrew,\u201d which Drew usually kept locked when he wasn\u2019t there. Guy apparently \nintends this as conclusive proof that he did not have access to the drugs found in \nthat room. \n However, a jury is not required to believe everything it hears. Daniel Guy \ntestified he was the brother of the two Guys on trial. (Transcript, State Court \nRecord, ECF No. 18-2, PageID 2188.)  He testified he remembered \u201ca little bit\u201d \nabout the day of the search. Id. at PageID 2191. Daniel answered \u201cyes\u201d to James\u2019s \nleading questions whether Drew was working \u201cwith us in our company at that \ntime,\u201d whether we were all working together, and whether Daniel would consider \nDrew a member of the Guy family. Id. at PageID 2191-92. The house at 72 South \nWheatland was being fixed up by the Guy family so that Drew could move in, but he \nnever paid them for their help. Id. at PageID 2194-95. Given this testimony, most of \nwhich was elicited by leading questions from the Defendant\u2019s brother, the jury \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 12 of 16  PAGEID #: 269913 \n \nmight well have discredited the testimony as biased. Certainly, Daniel never \ntestified that any drugs at the house were locked up in Drew\u2019s room and no one else \nhad access.  \n Petitioner also asserts the State violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 \n(1963), by suppressing a Sheriff\u2019s Detail Call Sheet (Exhibit K(a)) which is alleged \nto identify two other suspects in the 72 South Wheatland residence before the raid. \n(Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2678). Petitioner made no Brady claim in the \nPetition and thus no such claim is before the Court. \nD. Ground Ten/J:  Denial of a New Trial \n In his Tenth Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims the trial court abused its \ndiscretion in denying his motion for new trial. The Report rejected this claim on the \ngrounds there is no federal constitutional right to a new trial. (ECF No. 28, PageID \n2662).  \nPetitioner objects that a new trial is constitutionally required when denial of \na new trial would leave a defendant convicted at a fundamentally unfair trial. (ECF \nNo. 31, citing Fleming v. Metrish, 556 F.3d 520, 535 (6th Cir. 2009). He argues that \nthe prosecutor engaged in misconduct by submitting inadmissible evidence despite \nthe trial judge\u2019s having excluded it and improperly impeaching Petitioner\u2019s alibi \nwitness.

(Entry, State \nCourt Record, ECF No. 18, Ex. 20). On appeal Guy argued this as his Ninth \nAssignment of Error. (Appellant\u2019s Brief, State Court Record, ECF No. 18, PageID \n392, et seq.)  In the course of his Brief, Guy never presented the two instances of \nprosecutorial misconduct he relies on here. Nor did he make any constitutional \nargument, relying instead on Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2945.79 and an abuse of \ndiscretion standard. To the extent, then, that Guy makes a constitutional argument \nabout denial of new trial in this case, he has procedurally defaulted that claim by \nfailing to present it as a constitutional claim to the Tenth District Court of Appeals. \nThe motion for new trial claim is also subject to procedural default because it \nwas untimely. In dealing with the Ninth Assignment of Error, the Tenth District \nwrote: \n{65) James did not assert there was newly discovered evidence in his \nmotion for new trial; therefore, it was required to be filed  within 14 \ndays after the verdicts were rendered. The jury rendered their verdicts \nin this case on March 2, 2017. James did not file his motion for new \ntrial until March 23, 2017. Thus, his motion was untimely and failed to \nestablish that he was unavoidably prevented from. filing within the \ntime set forth in the rules. Moreover, the motion for new trial was \nbased on alleged irregularities in the proceedings and a claim that \nthere was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdicts. These \nwere largely the same claims asserted in his appeal to this court. As \nexplained above, we find no merit to these arguments and cannot \nconclude the trial court abused its discretion by denying the motion for \nnew trial. \n \n2Even though the phone call was excluded, Guy claims the jury heard it \nanyway.  \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 14 of 16  PAGEID #: 270115 \n \n \nState v. Guy, supra. \n \nE. Ground Thirteen/K(a)(1):  Ineffective Assistance of \nAppellate Counsel \n \n In his Thirteenth Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he received ineffective \nassistance of appellate counsel when his appellate attorney failed to plead as an \nassignment of error that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to grant a \ncontinuance or impose sanctions on the prosecution due to untimely disclosure of \ndiscovery material. \n The Report notes that Petitioner raised this claim as part of an Application to \nReopen his Appeal under Ohio R. App. P. 26(B) and the Tenth District decided it on \nthe merits, concluding the omitted assignment of error would not likely have been \nsuccessful if it had been pleaded. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2664-65, quoting \nState v. Guy, supra.)  Concluding this decision was neither contrary to nor an \nobjectively unreasonable application of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 \n(1984), the Magistrate Judge recommended it be dismissed. Id. at PageID 2667. \n Petitioner objects that, contrary to the express finding of the Tenth District, \nhe did request a continuance, but can only prove that by admission of the personal \nrecording he made of the trial. The official trial record shows he did not. As noted in \nthe Magistrate Judge\u2019s denial of admission of the personal recorder, Petitioner had \na remedy for inaccuracies in the record under Ohio R. App. P. 11(E). His appellate \nattorney could have moved under that rule to correct the record but did not. If \nfailure to do so was ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, Guy could have \nCase: 2:20-cv-05459-SDM-MRM Doc #: 33 Filed: 11/29/21 Page: 15 of 16  PAGEID #: 270216 \n \nincluded that claim in his 26(B) Application but did not. Guy has not demonstrated \nthat the Tenth District\u2019s finding that he did not request a continuance is \ncontradicted by the record. \n The Objections note that Ohio R. Crim. P. 16 allows a continuance as a \nsanction for untimely discovery. That is true. But even assuming that the corrected \nrecord would show that Guy requested a continuance, the rule left the choice of \nsanction up to the trial judge. Guy has not shown there was an abuse of discretion \nin denying a continuance, assuming he requested one. Indeed, the Tenth District \nfound he was not prejudiced because of the nature of the late discovery.  \n Guy has not persuaded this Court that failure to complain of denial of a \ncontinuance on direct appeal was ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. \nIII. Conclusion \n Having reviewed de novo those portions of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report to \nwhich substantial objection has been made, the Court finds the Objections are not \nwell-taken and they are hereby OVERRULED. The Report is ADOPTED, and the \nClerk is directed to enter judgment dismissing the Petition with prejudice. Because \nreasonable jurists would not disagree with this conclusion, the Petitioner is denied a \ncertificate of appealability and the Court certifies to the Sixth Circuit that any \nappeal would be objectively frivolous and should not be permitted to proceed in \nforma pauperis.  \n_/s/ Sarah D.

Morrison\nMagistrate Judge Michael R. Merz\n\nOPINION AND ORDER\n\nThis habeas corpus action, brought pro se by Petitioner James Guy under 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254, is before the Court on Petitioner\u2019s Objections (ECF No. 31) to the\nMagistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendations recommending that the Petition\nbe dismissed with prejudice. (ECF No. 28).\n\nA litigant who objects to a Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report on a dispositive matter\nsuch as the merits of a habeas corpus petition is entitled to a de novo review of\nthose portions of report to which substantial objection is made. The Court has\nconducted that de novo review; its conclusion is embodied in this Opinion and\nOrder.\n\nSummary of the Report\n\nIn his Petition, Guy pleaded Grounds for Relief A through L. Then in his\nTraverse he voluntarily abandoned all claims that he did not argue in that pleading\nand re-numbered his claims. (Traverse, ECF No. 27, PageID 2616). The Report\nconcluded Guy\u2019s actual innocence claim had been abandoned and his insufficiency of the evidence claim was without merit. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2650.) The Magistrate Judge found Guy\u2019s claim of constitutional error in failing to excuse a biased juror (Ground D/Four) was procedurally defaulted by failure to make a contemporaneous objection. (Id. at PageID 2657.) Guy claimed the trial judge impermissibly allowed evidence of his religion (Ground F/Six) which the Magistrate Judge recommended be dismissed as without merit. (Id. at PageID 2662.) The Report concluded that Guy\u2019s claim that he was unconstitutionally denied a new trial (Ground Ten/J) did not state a constitutional claim on which habeas corpus relief could be granted. (Id. at PageID 2662.)\n\nIn Ground Thirteen/K(a)(1) Guy asserted he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel when his appellate attorney failed to plead as an assignment of error that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to grant a continuance or impose sanctions on the prosecution due to untimely disclosure of discovery material. Petitioner had raised this claim in an application to reopen his appeal and the Ohio Tenth District Court of Appeals rejected it on the merits. (Id. at PageID 2664-66, quoting the Tenth District\u2019s opinion which appears in the State Court Record. (ECF No. 18, Ex. 38, PageID 633-35).) The Report concluded this decision was entitled to deference under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). (ECF No. 28, PageID 2667.)\nI. Petitioner\u2019s Objections Outside the Scope of the Report\n\nAside from his objections on the merits of the Report, Petitioner raised two objections to pre-Report orders.\n\nA. Objection to Transfer Order\n\nPetitioner objects \u201cstrongly\u201d to the transfer of the Magistrate Judge reference in this case from Magistrate Judge Vascura to Magistrate Judge Merz. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2683). That transfer occurred August 16, 2021 and was entered by Judge Vascura with Judge Merz\u2019s consent (ECF No. 4). Because it was a pre-trial decision on a non-dispositive matter, Petitioner had the right to object within fourteen days of service of the order, or not later than August 30, 2021. Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a). However, Petitioner made no objection to the Transfer Order until filing his instant Objections on November 5, 2021. Rule 72(a) expressly provides \u201c[a] party may not assign as error a defect in the order not timely objected to.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s objection to the Transfer Order is overruled because it is untimely.\n\nThis Objection is also overruled on the merits. Litigants obviously have no right to choose the judges to whom their cases are assigned. By the same token, they have no right to prevent transfer of cases within the Court when judges find such transfers useful \u201cto secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination\u201d of a case. Quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. Magistrate Judge Merz is serving this Court on recall and has particularly encouraged other Magistrate Judges to transfer habeas corpus cases to him. All the District Judges of this Court have permitted Magistrate\nJudges to transfer cases among themselves upon mutual consent. Litigants do not have standing to object to such transfers.\n\nB. Objection to Exclusion of Personal Recorder\n\nPetitioner also objects to Magistrate Judge Merz\u2019s Order (ECF No. 26) denying Petitioner\u2019s \u201cMotion to Accept Personal Recorder to Correct Current/False Transcript Record on File.\u201d (ECF No. 14).\n\nPetitioner\u2019s Motion advised the Court that he personally recorded his second trial because he believed the record of his first trial, which ended in a mistrial, had been falsified. He now seeks to correct the record by substituting his recording for a portion of the official record. The Magistrate Judge denied this motion because it had never been submitted to the Ohio courts, despite a provision for correcting the record on appeal (ECF No. 16, PageID 2623, citing Ohio R. App. P. 11(E)).\n\nPetitioner objects, essentially arguing the merits of the substitution he wishes to make. He makes no response to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s conclusion that he defaulted on this claim by never presenting it to the Ohio courts. Nor does he dispute the rationale behind the Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling: because anyone can record anything that happens in an Ohio courtroom, failure to enforce Ohio R. App. P. 11(E) could easily lead to endless litigation about \u201cwhat really happened\u201d at the trial.\n\nAccordingly, Petitioner\u2019s objection on this issue is OVERRULED on the merits and also because it is untimely. Any objection to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Order on this issue should have been filed by September 13, 2021.\nII. Petitioner\u2019s Objections to the Report Itself\n\nA. Failure to Excuse a Biased Juror (Ground Four/D)\n\nTurning to substantive objections, Petitioner first objects to the recommended dismissal of his claim that a biased juror should have been excused. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2672-74).\n\nPetitioner claims a particular juror should have been excused because (1) the juror was the mother-in-law of a good friend of the judge and (2) the same juror's son was best friends with an undercover police officer who had been convicted and imprisoned based on actions he took in his official capacity. During an in-chambers conference at which Petitioner was present, no one expressed any concern about the juror's remaining, but the next day Guy, who was representing himself, asked that she be replaced.\n\nThe Respondent asserted this biased juror claim was procedurally defaulted because Guy failed to make a contemporaneous objection to her after he knew all the relevant facts. The Magistrate Judge upheld this defense, noting that Ohio does have a procedural rule requiring contemporaneous objection which the trial judge had enforced by refusing to substitute an alternate and the Ohio Tenth District Court of Appeals had enforced by reviewing this assignment of error only for plain error. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2651-57).\n\nPetitioner objects that the Ohio contemporaneous objection rule does not apply when an objection is eventually made at a time when it can be dealt with by the trial court without prejudice to the parties. (ECF No. 31, PageID 2672). However, he cites no Ohio case law to that effect and this position is plainly\ninconsistent with his admission on appeal that he had failed to timely object and the standard of review was therefore plain error. (Appellant\u2019s Brief, State Court Record, ECF No. 18, Ex. 24, PageID 367-68.)\n\nThe question of whether an objection is \u201ccontemporaneous enough\u201d is a question of Ohio, not federal, law. In deciding habeas corpus cases, federal courts are bound by state court decisions of what the state law is. Railey v. Webb, 540 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2008), citing Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U.S. 74, 76 (2005) (\u201cWe have repeatedly held that a state court\u2019s interpretation of state law, including one announced on direct appeal of the challenged conviction, binds a federal court sitting in habeas corpus.\u201d), Maldonado v. Wilson, 416 F.3d 470 (6th Cir. 2005); Vroman v. Brigano, 346 F.3d 598 (6th Cir. 2003). In this particular case, the Ohio Tenth District Court of Appeals essentially held that Guy\u2019s objection, made a day after he had said he had no objection, was not timely. That is the Ohio law of contemporaneous objection as it applies to this case. To put it another way, there is no clearly established federal constitutional law requiring a state to review on the merits an objection to a sitting juror which is made a day after a defendant says he has no objection.\n\nIn a Supplement to his Objections, Petitioner criticizes the Report\u2019s analysis of Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103 (1990). Noting Guy\u2019s citation to Osborne, the Magistrate Judge reasoned \u201cIn Osborne, supra, where the Supreme Court upheld\n\n1Although Guy represented himself at trial, he was represented by counsel on appeal. Guy is bound by the concession made on his behalf.\napplication of the contemporaneous objection rule, the error was in jury instructions to which no objection was made. There is no indication in the opinion that a later objection would have saved the claim.\u201d (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2656).\n\nIn the portion of Osborne quoted in the Objections, the Supreme Court is explaining its prior decision in Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415 (1965) when it states:\n\nWe followed [in Douglas] \u201cour consistent holdings that the adequacy of state procedural bars to the assertion of federal questions is itself a federal question\u201d and stated that \u201c[i]n determining the sufficiency of objections we have applied the general principle that an objection which is ample and timely to bring the alleged federal error to the attention of the trial court and enable it to take appropriate corrective action is sufficient to serve legitimate state interests, and therefore sufficient to preserve the claim for review here.\u201d [quoting Douglas, 380 U.S. ] at 422, 85 S.Ct., at 1078. Concluding that \u201c[n]o legitimate state interest would have been served by requiring repetition of a patently futile objection,\u201d we held that the Alabama procedural ruling did not preclude our consideration of the defendant's constitutional claim. Id., at 421\u2013422, 85 S.Ct., at 1078\u20131079.\n\n496 U.S. at 125.\n\nContrary to Petitioner\u2019s argument, the Report does not contradict Osborne. As the Report noted, there are several issues involved in deciding whether a claim has been procedurally defaulted. Once the Warden has raised the procedural default defense, the habeas court must decide if the State has a relevant procedural rule and whether the State courts have enforced that rule in the case in suit.\n\n(Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2654, citing, inter alia, Maupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986)). Those are questions of state law. Then the habeas court must decide if the state rule is an \"adequate and independent\" state ground on\nwhich the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim. \n\n*Maupin.* As *Osborne* teaches, this is a question of federal law. Unlike the repetitive objection rule in *Douglas* discussed in *Osborne*, however, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has repeatedly held that Ohio\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule is an adequate and independent procedural rule. *Wogenstahl v. Mitchell*, 668 F.3d 307, 334 (6th Cir. 2012), citing *Keith v. Mitchell*, 455 F.3d 662, 673 (6th Cir. 2006); *Goodwin v. Johnson*, 632 F.3d 301, 315 (6th Cir. 2011); *Smith v. Bradshaw*, 591 F.3d 517, 522 (6th Cir. 2010); *Nields v. Bradshaw*, 482 F.3d 442 (6th Cir. 2007); *Biros v. Bagley*, 422 F.3d 379, 387 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\nIndeed as the Report notes, Guy admitted in his Traverse that the Sixth Circuit had repeatedly upheld this rule as adequate and independent. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2655, citing Traverse, ECF No. 27, PageID 2617.) The combined citations given in the Report and those admitted by Petitioner conclusively demonstrate that Ohio\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule is an adequate and independent state procedural ground of decision, consistent with the analysis in *Osborne, supra*.\n\nBecause he found this Ground for Relief procedurally defaulted, the Magistrate Judge did not address the merits. While the Court finds the procedural default analysis correct, it is also true that the biased juror claim is without merit. The factual basis of the claim is (1) the juror in question was the mother-in-law of a good friend of the judge and (2) the same juror's son was best friends with an undercover police officer who had been convicted and imprisoned based on actions\nhe took in his official capacity. Guy\u2019s argument that these facts show he was deprived of an impartial jury is completely conclusory. Assume the juror, rather than her mother-in-law, was friends with the judge. Why does that make her biased? Ohio judges are elected officials. In some smaller Ohio counties judges who have been in office for some time probably get friends or acquaintances as jurors on a regular basis, but the Supreme Court has never held this creates a biased jury. In a large county like Franklin, this probably happens rarely, but the Constitution was written for counties of all sizes.\n\nAs the Tenth District noted on appeal, there was never any evidence of actual bias. Rather the argument was that the juror was potentially biased and the trial judge, considering all the evidence, found no basis for disqualification. Whether or not a juror is disqualified by bias is a question of fact on which we are bound by state court findings unless a petitioner shows the finding is in error by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Petitioner has presented no evidence of actual bias, so his Fourth Ground for Relief fails on the merits, as well as being procedurally defaulted.\n\nB. Ground Six/F: Prejudicial Evidence of Petitioner\u2019s Religion\n\nIn his Sixth Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims the trial judge improperly allowed evidence of his Muslim religion. The Warden argued this claim was procedurally defaulted because it had been presented to the Tenth District solely as an issue of relevance under Ohio R. Evid. 402. While the Magistrate Judge provided\nsome analysis of the fair presentation claim, he ultimately recommended this claim be denied on the merits. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2658-62.\n\nThe Report found that evidence of Petitioner\u2019s religion was in a recorded jail call in which he admitted he was a member of the Black P. Stone organization and that was why he became a Muslim. While his religion was irrelevant, his membership in Black P. Stone was a key factor in identifying him as the perpetrator of the crime in suit and the state courts found, after attempting redaction, that the Muslim and Black P. Stone admissions could not be separated. The Magistrate Judge recommended deference to that state court fact finding.\n\nPetitioner objects that the prosecutor was allowed to argue that Guy\u2019s affiliation with Black P. Stone supported the improper inference that the use of the nickname \u201cStone\u201d during the crime proved Guy was the perpetrator. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2675). To show the inference was improper, he argues that the State\u2019s expert witness testimony about conduct of members of the organization was \u201cbogus\u201d and then offers his own statements of fact to contradict the expert. Id.\n\nArguments about the validity of expert testimony and of inferences are questions for the jury. There was no constitutional violation in allowing the State to attempt to prove Guy was the perpetrator of this crime by introducing his admission of membership in the Black P. Stone organization and then showing members often call one another \u201cBrother Stone\u201d which had happened during the crime. The fact that Guy stated in the same breath that he was a Muslim was his own doing. The State made no argument at all relying on his religious\nidentification. And Petitioner\u2019s statement of fact in the Objections are not under oath and cannot be considered because they were not offered in the trial court.\n\n*Cullen v. Pinholster*, 563 U.S. 170 (2011).\n\n**C. Ground Eight/H: Insufficient Evidence**\n\nIn his Eighth Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts there was insufficient evidence introduced at trial to support a conviction. The Tenth District Court of Appeals decided this claim on the merits and the Magistrate Judge concluded that decision had applied the governing precedent, *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307 (1979), applying that precedent reasonably. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2644-50, quoting *State v. Guy*, 2018-Ohio-4836 (Ohio App. 10th Dist. Dec. 6, 2018).\n\nPetitioner objects that the State conflated evidence from the controlled buy on October 16, 2014, with evidence seized pursuant to search warrant on October 17, 2014. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2677). As can be seen from reviewing those portions of the Tenth District\u2019s decision on this issue, Petitioner made separate claims of insufficiency as to the two dates. For October 16 he claimed the State had not shown enough to prove kidnapping and drug trafficking, but there was evidence he brandished a firearm in complicity with his brother\u2019s sale of heroin to an undercover officer. The search that occurred on October 17 found him in the same place, 72 South Wheatland, where the prior day\u2019s offenses had occurred. The police also found heroin and drug packaging paraphernalia. The Tenth District applied the usual rule that circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction. *State v. Guy*, supra, \u00b6\u00b6 44.\nIt is true that evidence of offenses on both days was presented in one trial. But it is also true that circumstantial evidence from each of the two days supported each of the convictions. Petitioner did not raise as an assignment of error that these cases were tried together, even though he sought severance pre-trial.\n\nHe also argues the State did not prove he possessed the drugs that were found on October 17, asserting they were in the constructive possession of another individual. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2677). He particularly refers the Court to the testimony of Daniel Guy at PageID 2193 where the witness testifies there was a room at 72 South Wheatland for Andrew Naus, referred to in the transcript as \u201cDrew,\u201d which Drew usually kept locked when he wasn\u2019t there. Guy apparently intends this as conclusive proof that he did not have access to the drugs found in that room.\n\nHowever, a jury is not required to believe everything it hears. Daniel Guy testified he was the brother of the two Guys on trial. (Transcript, State Court Record, ECF No. 18-2, PageID 2188.) He testified he remembered \u201ca little bit\u201d about the day of the search. Id. at PageID 2191. Daniel answered \u201cyes\u201d to James\u2019s leading questions whether Drew was working \u201cwith us in our company at that time,\u201d whether we were all working together, and whether Daniel would consider Drew a member of the Guy family. Id. at PageID 2191-92. The house at 72 South Wheatland was being fixed up by the Guy family so that Drew could move in, but he never paid them for their help. Id. at PageID 2194-95. Given this testimony, most of which was elicited by leading questions from the Defendant\u2019s brother, the jury\nmight well have discredited the testimony as biased. Certainly, Daniel never testified that any drugs at the house were locked up in Drew\u2019s room and no one else had access.\n\nPetitioner also asserts the State violated *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), by suppressing a Sheriff\u2019s Detail Call Sheet (Exhibit K(a)) which is alleged to identify two other suspects in the 72 South Wheatland residence before the raid. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2678). Petitioner made no *Brady* claim in the Petition and thus no such claim is before the Court.\n\n**D. Ground Ten/J: Denial of a New Trial**\n\nIn his Tenth Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for new trial. The Report rejected this claim on the grounds there is no federal constitutional right to a new trial. (ECF No. 28, PageID 2662).\n\nPetitioner objects that a new trial is constitutionally required when denial of a new trial would leave a defendant convicted at a fundamentally unfair trial. (ECF No. 31, citing *Fleming v. Metrish*, 556 F.3d 520, 535 (6th Cir. 2009). He argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by submitting inadmissible evidence despite the trial judge\u2019s having excluded it and improperly impeaching Petitioner\u2019s alibi witness. *Id.* at PageID 2679. In the Motion for New Trial, Guy labels as misconduct the submission of a Facebook page in which Guy used the racial slur \u201cHonkies.\u201d He also claims that the only proper way to impeach an alibi witness is by cross-\nexamination and the prosecutor did so by attempting, unsuccessfully,\\(^2\\) to introduce a phone call allegedly coming from the alibi witness.\n\nThe trial judge denied the Motion for New Trial summarily. (Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 18, Ex. 20). On appeal Guy argued this as his Ninth Assignment of Error. (Appellant\u2019s Brief, State Court Record, ECF No. 18, PageID 392, et seq.) In the course of his Brief, Guy never presented the two instances of prosecutorial misconduct he relies on here. Nor did he make any constitutional argument, relying instead on Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2945.79 and an abuse of discretion standard. To the extent, then, that Guy makes a constitutional argument about denial of new trial in this case, he has procedurally defaulted that claim by failing to present it as a constitutional claim to the Tenth District Court of Appeals.\n\nThe motion for new trial claim is also subject to procedural default because it was untimely. In dealing with the Ninth Assignment of Error, the Tenth District wrote:\n\n\\(^{65}\\) James did not assert there was newly discovered evidence in his motion for new trial; therefore, it was required to be filed within 14 days after the verdicts were rendered. The jury rendered their verdicts in this case on March 2, 2017. James did not file his motion for new trial until March 23, 2017. Thus, his motion was untimely and failed to establish that he was unavoidably prevented from filing within the time set forth in the rules. Moreover, the motion for new trial was based on alleged irregularities in the proceedings and a claim that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdicts. These were largely the same claims asserted in his appeal to this court. As explained above, we find no merit to these arguments and cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion by denying the motion for new trial.\n\n\\(^2\\)Even though the phone call was excluded, Guy claims the jury heard it anyway.\nState v. Guy, supra.\n\nE. Ground Thirteen/K(a)(1): Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel\n\nIn his Thirteenth Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel when his appellate attorney failed to plead as an assignment of error that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to grant a continuance or impose sanctions on the prosecution due to untimely disclosure of discovery material.\n\nThe Report notes that Petitioner raised this claim as part of an Application to Reopen his Appeal under Ohio R. App. P. 26(B) and the Tenth District decided it on the merits, concluding the omitted assignment of error would not likely have been successful if it had been pleaded. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2664-65, quoting State v. Guy, supra.) Concluding this decision was neither contrary to nor an objectively unreasonable application of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), the Magistrate Judge recommended it be dismissed. Id. at PageID 2667.\n\nPetitioner objects that, contrary to the express finding of the Tenth District, he did request a continuance, but can only prove that by admission of the personal recording he made of the trial. The official trial record shows he did not. As noted in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s denial of admission of the personal recorder, Petitioner had a remedy for inaccuracies in the record under Ohio R. App. P. 11(E). His appellate attorney could have moved under that rule to correct the record but did not. If failure to do so was ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, Guy could have\nincluded that claim in his 26(B) Application but did not. Guy has not demonstrated that the Tenth District\u2019s finding that he did not request a continuance is contradicted by the record.\n\nThe Objections note that Ohio R. Crim. P. 16 allows a continuance as a sanction for untimely discovery. That is true. But even assuming that the corrected record would show that Guy requested a continuance, the rule left the choice of sanction up to the trial judge. Guy has not shown there was an abuse of discretion in denying a continuance, assuming he requested one. Indeed, the Tenth District found he was not prejudiced because of the nature of the late discovery.\n\nGuy has not persuaded this Court that failure to complain of denial of a continuance on direct appeal was ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\nHaving reviewed de novo those portions of the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report to which substantial objection has been made, the Court finds the Objections are not well-taken and they are hereby OVERRULED. The Report is ADOPTED, and the Clerk is directed to enter judgment dismissing the Petition with prejudice. Because reasonable jurists would not disagree with this conclusion, the Petitioner is denied a certificate of appealability and the Court certifies to the Sixth Circuit that any appeal would be objectively frivolous and should not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis.\n\n/s/ Sarah D.

In a \nsingle assignment of error, Carr contends that the trial court violated his due process \nrights by denying his request for public records under R.C. 149 .43(B)(8), when he has \nj u s t i c i a b l e  c l a i m s .     \n{\u00b6 2} We conclude that the trial court did not err in denying Carr\u2019s records\u2019 request. \nCarr failed to identify a pending proceeding to which the recor ds would be material, and \nhe did not indicate how the records would be material to any ju sticiable claim.  \nAccordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed. \n \nI.  Facts and Course of Proceedings \n{\u00b6 3} This case involves a post-judgment order in a criminal action initially brought \nagainst Brandon Carr in March 2017.  On March 23, 2017, an indi ctment was filed \ncharging Carr with twelve offenses related to the February 2016 death of Brittany Russell.  \nRussell\u2019s body had been found inside her car, which was parked at a Dayton, Ohio, \napartment complex.  Russell had bullet wounds in her head; her infant daughter was \nfound in the car\u2019s back seat, unharmed.  State v. Carr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, \n2019-Ohio-3802, \u00b6 2.1  In April 2017, a re-indictment filed in the case charged Carr  also \nwith possession of heroin.  Id.  a t  \u00b6  3 .      \n{\u00b6 4} During pretrial proceedings, Carr filed a motion to dismiss the  charges due \nto the pre-indictment destruction of Russell\u2019s car, together with any evidence it contained.  \n                                                           \n1 Case No. 28193 was an appeal from a post-judgment order issued by the trial court, not \nthe direct appeal of Carr\u2019s conviction.  \n-3- \nThe trial court overruled the motion from the bench on January 22, 2018, but did not file \na written decision.  Id. at \u00b6 4.  On January 27, 2018, Carr filed a motion for \nreconsideration of the decision on the motion to dismiss, which the court then considered \nduring trial.  Id.2  On February 6, 2018, the court filed a formal entry reflectin g its initial \ndecision on the motion to dismiss.  However, the court did not specifically state that it \nwas denying the motion to reconsider as well, although the cour t had overruled that \nmotion after hearing trial testimony.  July 12, 2018 Order at p .  3 .     \n{\u00b6 5} Following a jury trial, Carr was found guilty of aggravated mur der, murder \n(purposeful), murder (proximate result) (two counts), kidnappin g (two counts), felonious \nassault (two counts), tampering with evidence (two counts), end angering children, and \npossession of heroin.  Carr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-3802, at \u00b6 3 \nand 6.  The trial court tried a charge of having weapons under disability and found Carr \nguilty of that charge as well.  Id. at \u00b6 6.  After merging some counts, the court sentenced \nCarr to life without parole, plus a total of 34 additional years.  Id.      \n{\u00b6 6} On April 6, 2018, Carr appealed to our court, and his direct ap peal of his \nconviction was docketed as Montgomery App. No. 27960.  That app eal is still pending.  \nWhile the appeal was pending, Carr filed a pro se motion in the trial court, asking the court \nto journalize its decision on the motion for reconsideration.  On July 12, 2018, the court \n                                                           \n2 See July 12, 2018 Order Granting, in Part, Motion to Journalize Ru ling and Nunc Pro \nTunc Order Correcting Paragraphs 1 And 6 of Order Denying Motio n to Dismiss (\u201cJuly \n2018 Order\u201d), p. 2.  Under establis hed law, courts may appropriately take judicial notice \nof judicial opinions and public records that are accessible via the internet.  E.g., State ex \nrel. Everhart v.

In addition, we \nhave allowed the State to supplement the record with the summar ies of the docket and \njournal entries from the trial court case.  See State v. Carr , 2d Dist.

July 12, 2018 Order at p. 4.  \nOn August 8, 2018, Carr appealed from that order as well.  This appeal was docketed as \nMontgomery App. No. 28080, was subsequently consolidated with Case No. 27960, and \nalso remains pending.  Carr a t  \u00b6  1 .         \n{\u00b6 7} Subsequently, Carr filed several additional pro se post-judgmen t motions in \nthe trial court, and the court denied them all in a decision filed on October 11, 2018.  Carr \nagain filed a notice of appeal, and this appeal was docketed as  Montgomery App. No. \n28193.  Id. at \u00b6 10.  These motions involved the following matters: \u201ca mo tion to stay the \nrestitution award included in [Carr\u2019s] judgment of conviction; * * * a motion pursuant to \nR.C. 149.43(B)(8) for copies of the jury verdict forms; and * *  * a motion for grand jury \ntestimony from his case, purportedly to support a petition for postconviction relief.\u201d  Carr, \n2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-3802, at \u00b6 9.  On Sept ember 20, 2019, we \naffirmed the trial court\u2019s decision on all these matters.  Id.  a t  \u00b6  4 2 .       \n{\u00b6 8} In the meantime, Carr filed an additional post-judgment motion on February \n27, 2019, seeking release of public records under R.C. 149.43(B )(8).  On March 27, \n2019, the trial court denied that motion as well, and Carr filed a notice of appeal on April \n23, 2019.  This appeal was docketed as Montgomery App. No. 2836 0, and is the appeal \nnow under consideration.    \n \nRecords Request Under R.C. 149.43(B)(8) \n{\u00b6 9} Carr\u2019s sole assignment of error states that: \nThe Trial Court Abused Its Discretion and Violated Mr. Carr\u2019s D ue  \n-5- \nProcess Rights by Denying Mr. Carr\u2019s Request Pursuant to R.C. \n149.43(b)(8) to Obtain Forms Pertaining to Policy and Procedure of Dayton \nPolice Department Handling Evidence When Mr. Carr Has Justiciab le \nClaims.  \n{\u00b6 10} Under this assignment of error, Carr contends that the trial co urt erred in \nrefusing to grant his R.C. 149.43(B)(8) request for public reco rds because he has a \njusticiable claim.  Carr further asserts that he has numerous appeals pending in our court \nand the Supreme Court of Ohio, as well as a pending petition fo r post-conviction relief.  \nIn this regard, Carr notes that he filed a mandamus action in t he Supreme Court of Ohio \nand ultimately received a copy of the City of Dayton Police Dep artment\u2019s General Order \n1.06-1, concerning the policy and procedure for evidence and im pounded property.  \nAllegedly (according to his appellate brief), Carr reviewed the policy and discovered that \nit was not followed with respect to the murder vehicle.  Having  received this information, \nCarr then filed a motion with the trial court, requesting public  r e c o r d s .      \n{\u00b6 11} Specifically, Carr made the following request (quoted verbatim): \nThus, Mr. Carr request [sic] this court to have access to all \ndocuments related to the crime scene vehicle that was suppose [ sic] to be \ntowed to the EPOD North Evidence Garage as required by the Dayt on \nPolice Department policy General Order 1.06-1 pertaining to Evidence and \nimpounded Property. \nIn particular, any chain of custody documents, along with Evide nce \nProcessing Request Form VIA MOT and on any Complaint Memorandum  \ndirected to the Investigations-Administrative Services Division   \n-6- \nCommander\u2019s Office.  Also all or any emails. \nDoc. #1, Motion Pursuant to R.C. 149.43(B)(8), pp. 1-2.  \n{\u00b6 12} In denying the motion, the trial court held that Carr\u2019s asserti ons of having \nnumerous pending appeals in our court and the Supreme Court of Ohio, as well as a \npending petition for post-conviction relief, were not sufficient to support a justiciable claim.  \nDoc. #3, Order Denying Motion Pursuant to R.C. 149.43(B)(8), p. 2 .     \n{\u00b6 13} We review trial court orders on disclosure of public records for an abuse of \ndiscretion.  State v. Morris, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26949, 2017-Ohio-1196, \u00b6 29.  An \nabuse of discretion \u201c \u2018implies that the court's attitude is unr easonable, arbitrary or \nunconscionable.\u2019 \u201d  (Citations omitted.)  Blakemore v. Blakemore , 5 Ohio St.3d 217, \n219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983).  \u201c[M]ost instances of abuse of dis cretion will result in \ndecisions that are simply unreasonable, rather than decisions that are unconscionable or \narbitrary.\u201d  AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 \nOhio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597 (1990).  \u201cA decision is unr easonable if there is no \nsound reasoning process that would support that decision.\u201d  Id.     \n{\u00b6 14} As pertinent here, R.C. 149.43(B)(8) provides that:  \nA public office or person responsible for public records is not required \nto permit a person who is incarcerated pursuant to a criminal conviction * * * \nto obtain a copy of any public record concerning a criminal inv estigation or \nprosecution * * * unless the request to inspect or to obtain a copy of the \nrecord is for the purpose of acquiring information that is subj ect to release \nas a public record under this section and the judge who imposed  the \nsentence or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the judge's  \n-7- \nsuccessor in office, finds that the information sought in the p ublic record is \nnecessary to support what appears to be a justiciable claim of the person.3  \n{\u00b6 15} This statute \u201csets forth heightened requirements for inmates seeking public \nrecords, and requires an incarcerated criminal defendant to dem onstrate that the \ninformation he is seeking pursuant to R.C. 149.43 is necessary to support a justiciable \nclaim or defense.\u201d  State v. Gibson, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 06CA37, 2007-Ohio-7161, \n\u00b6 13.  A justifiable claim does not exist where an inmate fails  to identify \u201cany pending \nproceeding with respect to which the requested documents would be material * * *.\u201d  \nState v. Atakpu, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25232, 2013-Ohio-4392, \u00b6 9, citing Gibson at \n\u00b6  1 4 .       \n{\u00b6 16} In his R.C. 149.43(B)(8) motion, Carr mentioned that he had \u201cnu merous \npending appeals in the 2nd District and Ohio Supreme Court along with his post conviction \nrelief hearing * * *.\u201d  Doc. #1 at p. 1.  Carr\u2019s motion was filed in the trial court on February \n27, 2019.  At that time, the appeals mentioned above (Case Nos.  27960, 28080, and \n28193) were pending in our court.  The first two appeals were d irect appeals of Carr\u2019s \nconvictions and sentence.  The law is well-settled that \u201c[a] re viewing court cannot add \nmatter to the record before it, which was not a part of the tri al court's proceedings, and \nthen decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter.\u201d  State v. Ishmail, 54 Ohio St.2d \n402, 377 N.E.2d 500 (1978), paragraph one of the syllabus.  As a result, nothing outside \nthe record, like evidence discovered post-trial, would be material to those proceedings.   \n{\u00b6 17} The third case (Case No. 28193) involved a request to stay paym ent of \n                                                           \n3 R.C. 149.43 has been amended numerous times over the past few years, but the \nrelevant wording in R.C.149.43(B)(8) has not been changed.  Com pare the current text \nwith the text in Sub.H.B. 471, 2016 Ohio Laws 140, effective Dec. 19, 2016.    \n-8- \nrestitution, a public records request for copies of the jury verdict forms, and a request for \ntranscripts of grand jury proceedings.  Carr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-\n3802, at \u00b6 13, 19, 22, and 32-33.  The first two issues bear no  potential relation to police \nhandling of evidence, and the third issue involved alleged inconsistent witness testimony \nand alleged prosecutorial misconduct in adding a heroin charge after the first indictment \nwas filed.  Id. at \u00b6 26.  We see no possible way in which the requested mater ial would \nbe material to those issues.  The evidence would also be outsid e the record in relation \nto that case, as the trial court action had already been decided.   \n{\u00b6 18} In Case No. 28193, Carr raised a further issue about the July 12, 2018 Order \n(the nunc pro tunc entry), but that, again, would have been limited to the matters already \nin the record.  Id. at \u00b6 36.  In any event, Case No. 28193 has been decided, and Carr \ndid not elect to further appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio.  \n{\u00b6 19} Likewise, the case pending in the Supreme Court of Ohio was, as  Carr \nsuggests, a mandamus action filed by Carr against the Dayton Police Department.  See \nState of Ohio ex rel. Brandon Carr v. Dayton Police Dept. , No. 2018-1631, 03/05/2019 \nCase announcements, 2019-Ohio-761.  The mandamus action was dis missed at Carr\u2019s \nrequest on March 5, 2019.  Id.  Although the mandamus action was still pending when \nCarr filed his current public records request on February 27, 2 019, Carr received his \nrequested relief (disclosure of the Dayton Police Department\u2019s policy on preserving and \nhandling evidence) as a result of the mandamus proceeding.  See Mandamus Complaint \nfiled in Case No. 2018-1631 on November 15, 2018, and Relator B randon Carr\u2019s \nVoluntary Motion to Dismiss, filed on March 1, 2019.  According ly, Carr\u2019s current public \nr e c o r d s  r e q u e s t  w o u l d  b e  m o o t  i f  i t  c o n c e r n e d  t h a t  m a t t e r .      \n-9- \n{\u00b6 20} Furthermore, unless the evidence sought in the current case was  relevant \nto the mandamus proceeding, it would not be material to a pendi ng proceeding for \npurposes of R.C. 149.43(B)(8).  There is no relevance, however, because the relief being \nsought differs.  Specifically, in the case before us, Carr seek s various documents \npertaining to how the evidence was actually handled, not eviden ce of the policy itself.  \nThe evidence being sought is also evidence that was not present ed at trial.  A post-\nconviction proceeding is a situation where evidence outside the record can be presented.  \nE.g., State v. Kinley , 136 Ohio App.3d 1, 7, 735 N.E.2d 921 (2d Dist.1999); State v. \nGrimm, 2d Dist. Miami No. 96-CA-37, 1997 WL 200550, *2 (Apr. 25, 1997).  \n{\u00b6 21} The judgment entry imposing Carr\u2019s sentence was filed on March 13, 2018, \nand Carr promptly appealed on April 6, 2018.  Although Carr fil ed numerous post-\njudgment motions, the trial court denied all pending motions on  October 11, 2018, and \nCarr again appealed on November 1, 2018.  After that point, no post-judgment motions \nwere filed in the trial court before the current motion was filed on February 27, 2019, and \nno post-conviction proceedings were filed thereafter before the  court denied the motion.  \nThus, both when Carr filed his R.C. 149.43 motion and when the trial court dismissed it, \nno post-conviction proceedings were pending in the trial court.   Consequently, no \njustifiable claims existed with respect to any pending proceedi ng.  Atakpu, 2d Dist. \nMontgomery No. 25232, 2013-Ohio-4392, at \u00b6 9.    \n{\u00b6 22} Finally, even if any proceedings had been pending, Carr failed to articulate \nhow the requested information \u201cwould be material to any justici able claim he may have.\u201d  \nCarr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-3802, at \u00b6 23.  Whil e Carr has made \nsome comments in his appellate brief, at the trial court level,  he merely asked for  \n-10-\ndocuments to be produced without explaining why.  \n{\u00b6 23} We note that Carr did file motions for post-conviction relief i n the trial court \nin May 2019, June 2019, and July 2019.  However, those motions were not pending \nwhen his public records request was filed, nor were they pendin g when the trial court \ndenied the request on March 27, 2019.  As a result, they cannot  be considered for \npurposes of our discussion.4   \n{\u00b6 24} Based on the preceding discussion, Carr\u2019s sole assignment of er ror is \noverruled. \n \nIII.

Facts and Course of Proceedings\n\nThis case involves a post-judgment order in a criminal action initially brought against Brandon Carr in March 2017. On March 23, 2017, an indictment was filed charging Carr with twelve offenses related to the February 2016 death of Brittany Russell. Russell\u2019s body had been found inside her car, which was parked at a Dayton, Ohio, apartment complex. Russell had bullet wounds in her head; her infant daughter was found in the car\u2019s back seat, unharmed. State v. Carr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-3802, \u00b6 2. In April 2017, a re-indictment filed in the case charged Carr also with possession of heroin. Id. at \u00b6 3.\n\nDuring pretrial proceedings, Carr filed a motion to dismiss the charges due to the pre-indictment destruction of Russell\u2019s car, together with any evidence it contained.\n\n---\n\n1 Case No. 28193 was an appeal from a post-judgment order issued by the trial court, not the direct appeal of Carr\u2019s conviction.\nThe trial court overruled the motion from the bench on January 22, 2018, but did not file a written decision. *Id.* at \u00b6 4. On January 27, 2018, Carr filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision on the motion to dismiss, which the court then considered during trial. *Id.* On February 6, 2018, the court filed a formal entry reflecting its initial decision on the motion to dismiss. However, the court did not specifically state that it was denying the motion to reconsider as well, although the court had overruled that motion after hearing trial testimony. July 12, 2018 Order at p. 3.\n\n{\u00b6 5} Following a jury trial, Carr was found guilty of aggravated murder, murder (purposeful), murder (proximate result) (two counts), kidnapping (two counts), felonious assault (two counts), tampering with evidence (two counts), endangering children, and possession of heroin. *Carr*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-3802, at \u00b6 3 and 6. The trial court tried a charge of having weapons under disability and found Carr guilty of that charge as well. *Id.* at \u00b6 6. After merging some counts, the court sentenced Carr to life without parole, plus a total of 34 additional years. *Id.*\n\n{\u00b6 6} On April 6, 2018, Carr appealed to our court, and his direct appeal of his conviction was docketed as Montgomery App. No. 27960. That appeal is still pending. While the appeal was pending, Carr filed a pro se motion in the trial court, asking the court to journalize its decision on the motion for reconsideration. On July 12, 2018, the court\n\n---\n\n2 See July 12, 2018 Order Granting, in Part, Motion to Journalize Ruling and Nunc Pro Tunc Order Correcting Paragraphs 1 And 6 of Order Denying Motion to Dismiss (\u201cJuly 2018 Order\u201d), p. 2. Under established law, courts may appropriately take judicial notice of judicial opinions and public records that are accessible via the internet. *E.g.*, *State ex rel. Everhart v. McIntosh*, 115 Ohio St.3d 195, 2007-Ohio-4798, 874 N.E.2d 516, \u00b6 10; *State v. Bevers*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27651, 2018-Ohio-4135, \u00b6 13. In addition, we have allowed the State to supplement the record with the summaries of the docket and journal entries from the trial court case. See *State v. Carr*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28360 (Decision and Entry Oct. 21, 2019), p. 1.\ngranted the motion in part, and issued a nunc pro tunc order correcting its prior decision to indicate that it had denied the motion for reconsideration. July 12, 2018 Order at p. 4. On August 8, 2018, Carr appealed from that order as well. This appeal was docketed as Montgomery App. No. 28080, was subsequently consolidated with Case No. 27960, and also remains pending. Carr at \u00b6 1.\n\n\u00b6 7 Subsequently, Carr filed several additional pro se post-judgment motions in the trial court, and the court denied them all in a decision filed on October 11, 2018. Carr again filed a notice of appeal, and this appeal was docketed as Montgomery App. No. 28193. Id. at \u00b6 10. These motions involved the following matters: \u201ca motion to stay the restitution award included in [Carr\u2019s] judgment of conviction; * * * a motion pursuant to R.C. 149.43(B)(8) for copies of the jury verdict forms; and * * * a motion for grand jury testimony from his case, purportedly to support a petition for postconviction relief.\u201d Carr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-3802, at \u00b6 9. On September 20, 2019, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision on all these matters. Id. at \u00b6 42.\n\n\u00b6 8 In the meantime, Carr filed an additional post-judgment motion on February 27, 2019, seeking release of public records under R.C. 149.43(B)(8). On March 27, 2019, the trial court denied that motion as well, and Carr filed a notice of appeal on April 23, 2019. This appeal was docketed as Montgomery App. No. 28360, and is the appeal now under consideration.\n\nRecords Request Under R.C. 149.43(B)(8)\n\n\u00b6 9 Carr\u2019s sole assignment of error states that:\n\nThe Trial Court Abused Its Discretion and Violated Mr. Carr\u2019s Due\nProcess Rights by Denying Mr. Carr\u2019s Request Pursuant to R.C. 149.43(b)(8) to Obtain Forms Pertaining to Policy and Procedure of Dayton Police Department Handling Evidence When Mr. Carr Has Justiciab le Claims.\n\n\u00b6 10 Under this assignment of error, Carr contends that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his R.C. 149.43(B)(8) request for public records because he has a justiciab le claim. Carr further asserts that he has numerous appeals pending in our court and the Supreme Court of Ohio, as well as a pending petition for post-conviction relief. In this regard, Carr notes that he filed a mandamus action in the Supreme Court of Ohio and ultimately received a copy of the City of Dayton Police Department\u2019s General Order 1.06-1, concerning the policy and procedure for evidence and impounded property. Allegedly (according to his appellate brief), Carr reviewed the policy and discovered that it was not followed with respect to the murder vehicle. Having received this information, Carr then filed a motion with the trial court, requesting public records.\n\n\u00b6 11 Specifically, Carr made the following request (quoted verbatim):\n\nThus, Mr. Carr request [sic] this court to have access to all documents related to the crime scene vehicle that was suppose [sic] to be towed to the EPOD North Evidence Garage as required by the Dayton Police Department policy General Order 1.06-1 pertaining to Evidence and impounded Property.\n\nIn particular, any chain of custody documents, along with Evidence Processing Request Form VIA MOT and on any Complaint Memorandum directed to the Investigations-Administrative Services Division\nCommander's Office. Also all or any emails.\n\nDoc. #1, Motion Pursuant to R.C. 149.43(B)(8), pp. 1-2.\n\n\u00b6 12 In denying the motion, the trial court held that Carr's assertions of having numerous pending appeals in our court and the Supreme Court of Ohio, as well as a pending petition for post-conviction relief, were not sufficient to support a justiciable claim.\n\nDoc. #3, Order Denying Motion Pursuant to R.C. 149.43(B)(8), p. 2.\n\n\u00b6 13 We review trial court orders on disclosure of public records for an abuse of discretion. State v. Morris, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26949, 2017-Ohio-1196, \u00b6 29. An abuse of discretion \u201c\u2018implies that the court's attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019\u201d (Citations omitted.) Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). \u201c[M]ost instances of abuse of discretion will result in decisions that are simply unreasonable, rather than decisions that are unconscionable or arbitrary.\u201d AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597 (1990). \u201cA decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process that would support that decision.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 14 As pertinent here, R.C. 149.43(B)(8) provides that:\n\nA public office or person responsible for public records is not required to permit a person who is incarcerated pursuant to a criminal conviction * * * to obtain a copy of any public record concerning a criminal investigation or prosecution * * * unless the request to inspect or to obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose of acquiring information that is subject to release as a public record under this section and the judge who imposed the sentence or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the judge's\nsuccessor in office, finds that the information sought in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be a justiciable claim of the person.3\n\n\u00b6 15 This statute \u201csets forth heightened requirements for inmates seeking public records, and requires an incarcerated criminal defendant to demonstrate that the information he is seeking pursuant to R.C. 149.43 is necessary to support a justiciable claim or defense.\u201d State v. Gibson, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 06CA37, 2007-Ohio-7161, \u00b6 13. A justifiable claim does not exist where an inmate fails to identify \u201cany pending proceeding with respect to which the requested documents would be material * * *.\u201d State v. Atakpu, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25232, 2013-Ohio-4392, \u00b6 9, citing Gibson at \u00b6 14.\n\n\u00b6 16 In his R.C. 149.43(B)(8) motion, Carr mentioned that he had \u201cnumerous pending appeals in the 2nd District and Ohio Supreme Court along with his post conviction relief hearing * * *.\u201d Doc. #1 at p. 1. Carr\u2019s motion was filed in the trial court on February 27, 2019. At that time, the appeals mentioned above (Case Nos. 27960, 28080, and 28193) were pending in our court. The first two appeals were direct appeals of Carr\u2019s convictions and sentence. The law is well-settled that \u201c[a] reviewing court cannot add matter to the record before it, which was not a part of the trial court's proceedings, and then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter.\u201d State v. Ishmail, 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 377 N.E.2d 500 (1978), paragraph one of the syllabus. As a result, nothing outside the record, like evidence discovered post-trial, would be material to those proceedings.\n\n\u00b6 17 The third case (Case No. 28193) involved a request to stay payment of\n\n---\n\n3 R.C. 149.43 has been amended numerous times over the past few years, but the relevant wording in R.C.149.43(B)(8) has not been changed. Compare the current text with the text in Sub.H.B. 471, 2016 Ohio Laws 140, effective Dec. 19, 2016.\nrestitution, a public records request for copies of the jury verdict forms, and a request for transcripts of grand jury proceedings.  \n\nCarr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-3802, at \u00b6 13, 19, 22, and 32-33.  The first two issues bear no potential relation to police handling of evidence, and the third issue involved alleged inconsistent witness testimony and alleged prosecutorial misconduct in adding a heroin charge after the first indictment was filed.  Id. at \u00b6 26.  We see no possible way in which the requested material would be material to those issues.  The evidence would also be outside the record in relation to that case, as the trial court action had already been decided.\n\n\u00b6 18 In Case No. 28193, Carr raised a further issue about the July 12, 2018 Order (the nunc pro tunc entry), but that, again, would have been limited to the matters already in the record.  Id. at \u00b6 36.  In any event, Case No. 28193 has been decided, and Carr did not elect to further appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n\n\u00b6 19 Likewise, the case pending in the Supreme Court of Ohio was, as Carr suggests, a mandamus action filed by Carr against the Dayton Police Department.  See State of Ohio ex rel. Brandon Carr v. Dayton Police Dept., No. 2018-1631, 03/05/2019 Case announcements, 2019-Ohio-761.  The mandamus action was dismissed at Carr\u2019s request on March 5, 2019.  Id.  Although the mandamus action was still pending when Carr filed his current public records request on February 27, 2019, Carr received his requested relief (disclosure of the Dayton Police Department\u2019s policy on preserving and handling evidence) as a result of the mandamus proceeding.  See Mandamus Complaint filed in Case No. 2018-1631 on November 15, 2018, and Relator Brandon Carr\u2019s Voluntary Motion to Dismiss, filed on March 1, 2019.  Accordingly, Carr\u2019s current public records request would be moot if it concerned that matter.\nFurthermore, unless the evidence sought in the current case was relevant to the mandamus proceeding, it would not be material to a pending proceeding for purposes of R.C. 149.43(B)(8). There is no relevance, however, because the relief being sought differs. Specifically, in the case before us, Carr seeks various documents pertaining to how the evidence was actually handled, not evidence of the policy itself. The evidence being sought is also evidence that was not presented at trial. A post-conviction proceeding is a situation where evidence outside the record can be presented. E.g., State v. Kinley, 136 Ohio App.3d 1, 7, 735 N.E.2d 921 (2d Dist.1999); State v. Grimm, 2d Dist. Miami No. 96-CA-37, 1997 WL 200550, *2 (Apr. 25, 1997).\n\nThe judgment entry imposing Carr's sentence was filed on March 13, 2018, and Carr promptly appealed on April 6, 2018. Although Carr filed numerous post-judgment motions, the trial court denied all pending motions on October 11, 2018, and Carr again appealed on November 1, 2018. After that point, no post-judgment motions were filed in the trial court before the current motion was filed on February 27, 2019, and no post-conviction proceedings were filed thereafter before the court denied the motion. Thus, both when Carr filed his R.C. 149.43 motion and when the trial court dismissed it, no post-conviction proceedings were pending in the trial court. Consequently, no justifiable claims existed with respect to any pending proceeding. Atakpu, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25232, 2013-Ohio-4392, at \u00b6 9.\n\nFinally, even if any proceedings had been pending, Carr failed to articulate how the requested information \u201cwould be material to any justiciable claim he may have.\u201d Carr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-3802, at \u00b6 23. While Carr has made some comments in his appellate brief, at the trial court level, he merely asked for\ndocuments to be produced without explaining why.\n\n{\u00b6 23} We note that Carr did file motions for post-conviction relief in the trial court in May 2019, June 2019, and July 2019. However, those motions were not pending when his public records request was filed, nor were they pending when the trial court denied the request on March 27, 2019. As a result, they cannot be considered for purposes of our discussion.4\n\n{\u00b6 24} Based on the preceding discussion, Carr's sole assignment of error is overruled.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n{\u00b6 25} Carr's assignment of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\nDONOVAN, J. and FROELICH, J., concur.\n\nCopies sent to:\n\nMathias H. Heck, Jr.\nSarah E. Hutnik\nBrandon Charles Carr\nHon. Steven K. Dankof\n\n---\n\n4 The trial court also dismissed all these petitions on August 13, 2019. The docket does not indicate that Carr appealed from the dismissals."}

Mr. Dilley opened the door believing it to be his daughter returning home from work, \nbut instead it was a man holding a gun, with a bandana covering part of his face. Mr. \nDilley noticed the man was around six feet tall and had tattoos on his arms and on the \nhand holding the gun. The man charged into the house and pushed Mr. Dilley through \nthe threshold area of the home, into the living room, until Mr. Dilley was on his couch. The \nman pointed the gun at Mr. Dilley and demanded all of Mr. Dilley's money. Mr. Dilley told \nthe intruder his money was at the bank. The intruder then picked up a lid from a glass \ncandy jar and struck Mr. Dilley in the face. The intruder grabbed Mr. Dilley's cell phone \noff the coffee table and ran out of the house. Mr. Dilley followed the intruder to the front \nporch area. Once outside, Mr. Dilley noticed the glass candy dish lid had been dropped \nin his yard. On top of the broken glass lid was a flashlight.  \n{\u00b63} Mr. Dilley ran to the neighbor's house and asked him to call the police. When \nthe police arrived, they searched the area and found Dilley's cell phone in the middle of \nhis yard and returned it to him. The police also found the flashlight and a pistol bullet \ncartridge that had not been fired and both were submitted for DNA testing. The DNA \ndiscovered on the flashlight came back as a one in one trillion match to Appellant Mason \nSomers.  The test of the bullet was inconclusive. Muskingum County, Case No. CT2019-0020      3 \n \n{\u00b64} Appellant was indicted on one count of Aggravated Burglary, a felony of the \nfirst degree, in violation of R.C. 2911.11 1(A)(2), one count of Aggravated Robbery, a \nfelony of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), one count of Kidnapping with \na gun specification, a felony of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(1), and \none count of Felonious Assault, a felony of the second degree, in violation of R.C. \n2903.11(A)(2). \n{\u00b65} At trial, the jury heard testimony from Ernest Dilley, Deputy Andrew Murphy, \nDetective Amy Thompson, BCI forensic scientist Michael Monfredi, and Detective Brad \nShawger. \n{\u00b66} Mr. Dilley testified as to the events that took place on August 23, 2017, as \nset forth above. He further testified that the perpetrator's height and tattoos on his hands \nand arms were consistent with that of Appellant's height and tattoos on his hands and \narms. Mr. Dilley also testified that the flashlight found in the yard had not been there \npreviously because if it had been, he would have picked it up.  \n{\u00b67} The state presented two audio recordings of Appellant from a phone call \nand a visit. In the recordings, Appellant comments on the facts of the case and concludes \nthat he should get a \u201csweet deal\u201d as a result of the lack of any egregious actions during \nthe offense.  Appellee argued the statements were made prior to the state responding to \nAppellant\u2019s discovery requests, suggesting that Appellant had knowledge of the facts that \nonly the perpetrator would know. Appellee\u2019s trial counsel cross-examined the officer who \nintroduced the tapes, suggesting during those questions and in his closing argument that \nthere were alternative sources for the information the Appellant described, such as the \ncomplaint, trial counsel, or other individuals. Appellant\u2019s trial counsel chose not to have \nhis client testify and avoided subjecting him to cross examination, which, according to Muskingum County, Case No. CT2019-0020      4 \n \nAppellant\u2019s brief, would disclose a prior drug offense and, based upon the record, may \nhave been of little material assistance. \n{\u00b68} The jury found Appellant guilty of all counts and firearm specifications and \nthe trial court sentenced Appellant to serve 25 years in prison and pay court costs. \n{\u00b69} Appellant, through appointed counsel, filed a timely appeal assigning as \nerror that the conviction was based upon insufficient evidence and against the manifest \nweight of the evidence, that consecutive sentences were unconstitutional and that he \nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel.  This court rejected his assignments of error \nand affirmed the decision of the trial court on November 18, 2018. \n{\u00b610} Appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief on February 25, 2019, \nasking that the trial court grant a hearing on the petition and, ultimately, a new trial.  \nAppellant alleged that his constitutional rights were violated as a result of prosecutorial \nmisconduct and ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  In support of his motion, Appellant \nsupplied multiple references to transcripts of hearings before the trial court as well as his \naffidavit recounting his conversations with trial counsel before and during the hearings. \n{\u00b611} On March 8, 2019, the trial court denied Appellant\u2019s petition finding that the \nDefendant failed to raise these claims in his direct appeal, that he failed to present any \nmeritorious claims and that his motion was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. On \nMarch 25, 2019 Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal, listing three assignments of error: \n{\u00b612} \u201cI. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN \nIT DENIED APPELLANT'S POST-CONVICTION RELIEF PETITION WHEN \nAPPELLANT HAD SHOWN ESSENTIAL OPERATIVE FACTS IN(SIC) SUPPORTING \nEVIDENTIAY(SIC) QUALITY MATERIALS DEHORS THE RECORD IN VIOLATION OF \nTHE OHIO AND U.S. CONSTITUTIONS.\u201d Muskingum County, Case No. CT2019-0020      5 \n \n{\u00b613} \u201cII. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN \nIT DENIED APPELLANT'S POST-CONVICTION PETITION WITHOUT A HEARING \nWHEN THE COURT FILES, RECORD, AND DOCUMENTATION SUPPORTED SUCH \nA HEARING.\u201d \n{\u00b614} \u201cIII. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN \nIT FAILED TO ISSUE FACTS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AS REQUIRED BY R.C. \n2953.21.\u201d \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n{\u00b615} The appropriate standard for reviewing a trial court's decision to dismiss a \npetition for post-conviction relief, without an evidentiary hearing, involves a mixed \nquestion of law and fact. State v. Durr, 5th Dist. Richland No. 18CA78, 2019-Ohio-807. \nThis court must apply a manifest weight standard in reviewing a trial court's findings on \nfactual issues underlying the substantive grounds for relief, but we must review the trial \ncourt's legal conclusions de novo. Id. \n{\u00b616} With regard to Appellant\u2019s assertion he was entitled to a hearing, the \nSupreme Court of Ohio held that \u201c[i]n post-conviction cases, a trial court has a \ngatekeeping role as to whether a defendant will even receive a hearing.\u201d State v. Gondor, \n112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77. A petition for post-conviction relief \ndoes not provide a petitioner a second opportunity to litigate his or her conviction, nor is \nthe petitioner automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the petition. State v. \nWilhelm, 5th Dist. Knox No. 05-CA-31, 2006-Ohio-2450, citing State v. Jackson, 64 Ohio \nSt.2d 107, 413 N.E.2d 819 (1980).  Pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(C), a defendant's petition \nmay be denied without a hearing when the petition, supporting affidavits, documentary \nevidence, files, and records do not demonstrate that the petitioner set forth sufficient Muskingum County, Case No. CT2019-0020      6 \n \noperative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.\u201d State v. Adams , 11th Dist. \nNo.2003\u2013T\u20130064, 2005\u2013Ohio\u2013348, \u00b6 36 quoting State v. Calhoun,  86 Ohio St.3d 279, \n282, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999).  \n{\u00b617} We also note that the trial court\u2019s entry referred to the lack of \u201cmeritorious\u201d \nclaims, when R.C. 2953.21 obligates the trial court to review the petition for \u201csubstantive \ngrounds for relief.\u201d R.C. 2953.21(D).  In the context of this case, we accept the trial court\u2019s \ncite to \u201cmeritorious claims\u201d as referencing \u201csubstantive grounds for relief.\u201d \nI. \n{\u00b618} Appellant contends that prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective \nassistance of counsel supports his first assignment of error in which he argues the trial \ncourt abused its discretion by denying the petition.  He concludes his argument by \ncharacterizing the facts he describes as \u201coutside the trial court\u2019s record\u201d but the record \nrequires the opposite conclusion.  The facts Appellant relies upon were clearly part of the \nrecord and thus available for presentation and argument at trial and at a direct appeal of \nany alleged error. \n{\u00b619} Appellant first contends that the prosecutor acted inappropriately by arguing \nthat Appellant knew the facts of the case before Appellant received the state\u2019s discovery \nresponse and that guilt could be implied from that fact. Appellant refers to the Arraignment \nHearing Transcript, the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and recordings of Appellant\u2019s \ntelephone conversations while Appellant was in custody.  Appellant contends the \nprosecutor\u2019s comments on the evidence were improper because he knew or should have \nknown that Appellant was informed of the facts prior to and during the November 11, 2017 \narraignment hearing.  He states in his petition that \u201cThe prosecutor in this case knew that Muskingum County, Case No. CT2019-0020      7 \n \nhe was not going to get a conviction based upon the testimony of the victim and BCI \nforensic scientist, thus choose to result(sic) to conduct clearly prohibited by the \nprofessional rules of conduct by telling the jury that defendant committed the crimes \nbecause he had information about the crimes before defendant should have known it, \nresulting in prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d (Defendant Mason Somers Timely Motion for \nPostconviction Relief Pursuant To Ohio Revised Code Section 2953.21, February 25, \n2019, Docket # 47). \n{\u00b620} The alleged prosecutorial conduct was part of the record in this case. The \nprosecutor referenced Appellant\u2019s foreknowledge in his opening and closing statements, \ncontending that Appellant had information about the crime long before the state \nresponded to Appellant\u2019s discovery request.  The state presented two recorded \nconversations of Appellant in support of its contention that the Appellant had committed \nthe crimes described in the complaint because appellant had knowledge of the facts.  \nAppellant\u2019s trial counsel addressed this issue in cross examination and closing, arguing \nthat Appellant could have received the same information from other sources and the state \nhad failed to rule out those alternatives.    \n{\u00b621} Appellant had the opportunity to raise the claim of prosecutorial misconduct \nthat he now sets forth in the instant appeal at trial and in a direct appeal. Such claims, \ntherefore, are barred under the doctrine of res judicata. State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, \n180, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967). The Perry court explained the doctrine as follows: \u201cUnder \nthe doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars the convicted defendant \nfrom raising and litigating in any proceeding, except an appeal from that judgment, any \ndefense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by \nthe defendant at the trial which resulted in that judgment of conviction or on an appeal Muskingum County, Case No. CT2019-0020      8 \n \nfrom that judgment.\u201d Id. at paragraph 8 of the syllabus. A defendant who was represented \nby counsel is barred from raising an issue in a petition for post-conviction relief if the \ndefendant raised or could have raised the issue at trial or on direct appeal. State v. \nSzefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 96, 671 N.E.2d 233 (1996).   \n{\u00b622} Appellant had the opportunity to raise the issue of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct \nat trial and a direct appeal thereafter, but failed to do so.  This portion of the first \nassignment of error is overruled.   \n{\u00b623} Appellant argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to withdraw and \nrequest appointment of new counsel in the second part of his first assignment of error.  \nWhere ineffective assistance of counsel is alleged in a petition for \npostconviction relief, the defendant, in order to secure a hearing on his \npetition, must proffer evidence which, if believed, would establish not only \nthat his trial counsel had substantially violated at least one of a defense \nattorney's essential duties to his client but also that said violation was \nprejudicial to the defendant.   \nState v. Cole, 2 Ohio St.3d 112, 114, 443 N.E.2d 169 (1982). \n{\u00b624} Appellant\u2019s argument is based upon a contention that his trial counsel had \nthe obligation to withdraw from the case so he could be called as a witness and testify as \nto his conversations with his client regarding the facts of the case, in an effort to rebut the \nprosecutor\u2019s contention that Appellant had foreknowledge of the facts. In support of his \nargument, Appellant offers his own affidavit describing his conversations with counsel \nregarding the facts of the case and references to the record of the case.   Muskingum County, Case No. CT2019-0020      9 \n \n{\u00b625} The decision whether to call any witness falls within the purview of trial \ntactics. State v. Adkins,  144 Ohio App.3d 633, 646, 761 N.E.2d 94 (12th Dist.2001); \nLakewood v. Town , 106 Ohio App.3d 521, 527, 666 N.E.2d 599 (8th Dist.1995).  Had \nAppellant\u2019s counsel testified, it is likely that he would have waived attorney client privilege \nand subjected himself to prejudicial cross examination by the state.  Appellant discloses \nan example of the potential prejudicial information in his petition when he admits his trial \ncounsel warned him that his prior conviction of possession of drugs, if disclosed to the \njury, would have a negative effect.   \n{\u00b626} Appellant\u2019s trial counsel addressed the state\u2019s allegation regarding \nAppellant\u2019s knowledge of facts by cross examination of the officer that identified the \nrecordings and by suggesting to the jury the existence of alternative sources for the \ninformation in his closing argument. Trial counsel\u2019s failure to withdraw and act as a \nwitness in this case is not evidence of ineffective assistance, but part of a prudent trial \nstrategy and \u201c[w]e will not second-guess the strategic decisions counsel made at trial \neven though appellate counsel now argue that they would have defended differently.\u201d \nState v. Post, 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 388, 513 N.E.2d 754 (1987) as cited in State v. Mason, \n82 Ohio St.3d 144, 169, 1998-Ohio-370, 694 N.E.2d 932. Consequently, even if the trial \ncourt believed Appellant\u2019s allegations, he has not provided evidence of a substantial \nviolation of trial counsel\u2019s duties.  \n{\u00b627} We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the \nAppellant\u2019s allegations were barred by res judicata or did not provide substantive grounds \nfor relief. The first assignment of error is denied. \n Muskingum County, Case No. CT2019-0020      10 \n \nII. \n{\u00b628} Appellant revisits his allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel in his \nsecond assignment of error, arguing his trial counsel violated an essential duty by \nadvising him not to testify. \u201cThe advice provided by counsel to his or her client regarding \nthe decision to testify is \u201ca paradigm of the type of tactical decision that cannot be \nchallenged as evidence of ineffective assistance.\u201d State v. Winchester , 8th Dist. \nCuyahoga No. 79739, 2002\u2013Ohio\u20132130, \u00b6 12, quoting Hutchins v. Garrison , 724 F.2d \n1425, 1436 (C.A.4, 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1065, 104 S.Ct. 750, 79 L.Ed.2d 207 \n(1984). See also, Jones v. Murray (C.A.4, 1991), 947 F.2d 1106, 1116, fn. 6. Nonetheless, \na claim for ineffective assistance of counsel may be successful if the record demonstrates \nthe defendant's decision whether or not to testify was the result of coercion. Id, citing \nLema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 52\u201353 (1st Cir.1993).  \n{\u00b629} Nothing in the record suggests Appell ant's decision to not testify was the \nresult of coercion. Appellant has not shown that his decision to not testify was not of his \nown free will, and he therefore cannot challenge his decision to not testify as ineffective \nassistance of counsel. \n{\u00b630} Appellant has admitted that at least one reason for counsel\u2019s advice was \nhis prior conviction for drug possession.   As noted in our review of the first assignment \nof error, trial counsel employed a strategy that allowed him to attack the evidence without \nputting his client on the witness stand and exposing to cross examination.   \n{\u00b631} Even if the trial court accepted the assertions in Appellant\u2019s affidavit as true, \nthe trial court would not have abused its discretion by finding that the allegations did not \nstate substantive grounds for relief as the facts as stated by Appellant do not support a \nclaims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Muskingum County, Case No. CT2019-0020      11 \n \n{\u00b632} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled. \nIII. \n{\u00b633} In his third assignment of error, Appellant claims the trial court failed to \ninclude findings of fact and conclusions of law in its entry denying the petition.  Findings \nof fact and conclusions of law are mandatory if the trial court dismissed the petition without \nhearing as they are necessary \u201cto apprise petitioner of the grounds for the judgment of \nthe trial court and to enable the appellate **1331 courts to properly determine appeals in \nsuch a cause.\u2019 Jones v. State, 8 Ohio St.2d 21, 22, 222 N.E.2d 313 (1966) \nThe exercise of findings and conclusions are essential in order to \nprosecute an appeal. Without them, a petitioner knows no more than he lost \nand hence is effectively precluded from making a reasoned appeal. In \naddition, the failure of a trial judge to make the requisite findings prevents \nany meaningful judicial review, for it is the findings and the conclusions \nwhich an appellate court reviews for error. \nState v. Mapson, 1 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 438 N.E.2d 910 (1982). \n{\u00b634} We hold that the journal entry in this case satisfies the policy considerations \nannounced by the Supreme Court of Ohio in Mapson, supra.  The trial court did not label \nits entry as findings of fact and conclusions of law, but that is what its words import.  State \nex rel. Carrion v. Harris , 40 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 530 N.E.2d 1330 (1988).  We have \npreviously held that \u201cAs long as the basis for the court's ruling can be gleamed from the \nentry, R.C. 2953.21 has been complied with.\u201d  State v. Wells, 5th Dist. Licking No. 94 CA \n113, 1995 WL 495308, *1. In State v. Rouse,  5th Dist. Muskingum No. CT2013-0043, \n2014-Ohio-483, \u00b6 20, we found that an entry stating that the court found that the claims Muskingum County, Case No. CT2019-0020      12 \n \nwere barred by res judicata was sufficient.  The entry in the case sub judice contains that \nreference as well as a reference to the absence of \u201cmeritorious claims\u201d and failure to \naddress the arguments during the direct appeal.  Appellant does not claim any prejudice \nfrom the alleged failure to provide findings of fact or conclusions of law and it is clear that \nAppellant was aware of the trial court\u2019s rational as he presented argument, on pages 18 \nand 19 of his brief, that \u201cres judicata is inapplicable here\u201d and that \u201cthere are enough facts \nprovided to verify Appellants (sic) claims and to grant relief.\u201d   \n{\u00b635} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is denied. \n{\u00b636} The decision of the Muskingum County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.   \nBy: Baldwin, J. \n \nGwin, P.J. and \n \nWise, John, J. concur. \n  \n ", "case_juv": "0", "case_crim": "0", "case_2001": "0", "case_app": "0", "case_pros": "0", "aoe_none": "0", "aoe_grandjury": "0", "aoe_court": "0", "aoe_defense": "0", "aoe_procbar": "1", "aoe_prochist": "0", "case_timeframe": "0", "other": "151    0\nName: other, dtype: int64", "olmocr_text": "STATE OF OHIO : JUDGES:\nPlaintiff - Appellee : Hon.

Box 189\nZanesville, Ohio 43702-0189\n\nFor Defendant-Appellant\nMASON SOMERS\n#A741-605\nNoble Correctional Institution\n1578 McConnellsville Road\nCaldwell, Ohio 43724-8902\nMason Somers appeals the decision of the Muskingum County Court of Common Pleas denying his motion for post-conviction relief based upon the doctrine of res judicata, failure to address issues on direct appeal and lack of meritorious claims.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS AND THE CASE\n\nErnest Dilley was sitting in his home when there was a knock at his front door. Mr. Dilley opened the door believing it to be his daughter returning home from work, but instead it was a man holding a gun, with a bandana covering part of his face. Mr. Dilley noticed the man was around six feet tall and had tattoos on his arms and on the hand holding the gun. The man charged into the house and pushed Mr. Dilley through the threshold area of the home, into the living room, until Mr. Dilley was on his couch. The man pointed the gun at Mr. Dilley and demanded all of Mr. Dilley's money. Mr. Dilley told the intruder his money was at the bank. The intruder then picked up a lid from a glass candy jar and struck Mr. Dilley in the face. The intruder grabbed Mr. Dilley's cell phone off the coffee table and ran out of the house. Mr. Dilley followed the intruder to the front porch area. Once outside, Mr. Dilley noticed the glass candy dish lid had been dropped in his yard. On top of the broken glass lid was a flashlight.\n\nMr. Dilley ran to the neighbor's house and asked him to call the police. When the police arrived, they searched the area and found Dilley's cell phone in the middle of his yard and returned it to him. The police also found the flashlight and a pistol bullet cartridge that had not been fired and both were submitted for DNA testing. The DNA discovered on the flashlight came back as a one in one trillion match to Appellant Mason Somers. The test of the bullet was inconclusive.\nAppellant was indicted on one count of Aggravated Burglary, a felony of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2911.11 1(A)(2), one count of Aggravated Robbery, a felony of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), one count of Kidnapping with a gun specification, a felony of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(1), and one count of Felonious Assault, a felony of the second degree, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2).\n\nAt trial, the jury heard testimony from Ernest Dilley, Deputy Andrew Murphy, Detective Amy Thompson, BCI forensic scientist Michael Monfredi, and Detective Brad Shawger.\n\nMr. Dilley testified as to the events that took place on August 23, 2017, as set forth above. He further testified that the perpetrator's height and tattoos on his hands and arms were consistent with that of Appellant's height and tattoos on his hands and arms. Mr. Dilley also testified that the flashlight found in the yard had not been there previously because if it had been, he would have picked it up.\n\nThe state presented two audio recordings of Appellant from a phone call and a visit. In the recordings, Appellant comments on the facts of the case and concludes that he should get a \u201csweet deal\u201d as a result of the lack of any egregious actions during the offense. Appellee argued the statements were made prior to the state responding to Appellant\u2019s discovery requests, suggesting that Appellant had knowledge of the facts that only the perpetrator would know. Appellee\u2019s trial counsel cross-examined the officer who introduced the tapes, suggesting during those questions and in his closing argument that there were alternative sources for the information the Appellant described, such as the complaint, trial counsel, or other individuals. Appellant\u2019s trial counsel chose not to have his client testify and avoided subjecting him to cross examination, which, according to\nAppellant\u2019s brief, would disclose a prior drug offense and, based upon the record, may have been of little material assistance.\n\n{\u00b68} The jury found Appellant guilty of all counts and firearm specifications and the trial court sentenced Appellant to serve 25 years in prison and pay court costs.\n\n{\u00b69} Appellant, through appointed counsel, filed a timely appeal assigning as error that the conviction was based upon insufficient evidence and against the manifest weight of the evidence, that consecutive sentences were unconstitutional and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. This court rejected his assignments of error and affirmed the decision of the trial court on November 18, 2018.\n\n{\u00b610} Appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief on February 25, 2019, asking that the trial court grant a hearing on the petition and, ultimately, a new trial. Appellant alleged that his constitutional rights were violated as a result of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In support of his motion, Appellant supplied multiple references to transcripts of hearings before the trial court as well as his affidavit recounting his conversations with trial counsel before and during the hearings.\n\n{\u00b611} On March 8, 2019, the trial court denied Appellant\u2019s petition finding that the Defendant failed to raise these claims in his direct appeal, that he failed to present any meritorious claims and that his motion was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. On March 25, 2019 Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal, listing three assignments of error:\n\n{\u00b612} \u201cI. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT\u2019S POST-CONVICTION RELIEF PETITION WHEN APPELLANT HAD SHOWN ESSENTIAL OPERATIVE FACTS IN(SIC) SUPPORTING EVIDENTIARY(SIC) QUALITY MATERIALS DEHORS THE RECORD IN VIOLATION OF THE OHIO AND U.S. CONSTITUTIONS.\u201d\n\u201cII. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT\u2019S POST-CONVICTION PETITION WITHOUT A HEARING WHEN THE COURT FILES, RECORD, AND DOCUMENTATION SUPPORTED SUCH A HEARING.\u201d\n\n\u201cIII. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT FAILED TO ISSUE FACTS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AS REQUIRED BY R.C. 2953.21.\u201d\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nThe appropriate standard for reviewing a trial court's decision to dismiss a petition for post-conviction relief, without an evidentiary hearing, involves a mixed question of law and fact. State v. Durr, 5th Dist. Richland No. 18CA78, 2019-Ohio-807. This court must apply a manifest weight standard in reviewing a trial court's findings on factual issues underlying the substantive grounds for relief, but we must review the trial court's legal conclusions de novo. Id.\n\nWith regard to Appellant\u2019s assertion he was entitled to a hearing, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that \u201c[i]n post-conviction cases, a trial court has a gatekeeping role as to whether a defendant will even receive a hearing.\u201d State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77. A petition for post-conviction relief does not provide a petitioner a second opportunity to litigate his or her conviction, nor is the petitioner automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the petition. State v. Wilhelm, 5th Dist. Knox No. 05-CA-31, 2006-Ohio-2450, citing State v. Jackson, 64 Ohio St.2d 107, 413 N.E.2d 819 (1980). Pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(C), a defendant\u2019s petition may be denied without a hearing when the petition, supporting affidavits, documentary evidence, files, and records do not demonstrate that the petitioner set forth sufficient\noperative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.\u201d State v. Adams, 11th Dist. No.2003\u2013T\u20130064, 2005\u2013Ohio\u2013348, \u00b6 36 quoting State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 282, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999).\n\n\u00b617 We also note that the trial court\u2019s entry referred to the lack of \u201cmeritorious\u201d claims, when R.C. 2953.21 obligates the trial court to review the petition for \u201csubstantive grounds for relief.\u201d R.C. 2953.21(D). In the context of this case, we accept the trial court\u2019s cite to \u201cmeritorious claims\u201d as referencing \u201csubstantive grounds for relief.\u201d\n\nI.\n\n\u00b618 Appellant contends that prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel supports his first assignment of error in which he argues the trial court abused its discretion by denying the petition. He concludes his argument by characterizing the facts he describes as \u201coutside the trial court\u2019s record\u201d but the record requires the opposite conclusion. The facts Appellant relies upon were clearly part of the record and thus available for presentation and argument at trial and at a direct appeal of any alleged error.\n\n\u00b619 Appellant first contends that the prosecutor acted inappropriately by arguing that Appellant knew the facts of the case before Appellant received the state\u2019s discovery response and that guilt could be implied from that fact. Appellant refers to the Arraignment Hearing Transcript, the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and recordings of Appellant\u2019s telephone conversations while Appellant was in custody. Appellant contends the prosecutor\u2019s comments on the evidence were improper because he knew or should have known that Appellant was informed of the facts prior to and during the November 11, 2017 arraignment hearing. He states in his petition that \u201cThe prosecutor in this case knew that\nhe was not going to get a conviction based upon the testimony of the victim and BCI forensic scientist, thus choose to result(sic) to conduct clearly prohibited by the professional rules of conduct by telling the jury that defendant committed the crimes because he had information about the crimes before defendant should have known it, resulting in prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d (Defendant Mason Somers Timely Motion for Postconviction Relief Pursuant To Ohio Revised Code Section 2953.21, February 25, 2019, Docket # 47).\n\n{\u00b620} The alleged prosecutorial conduct was part of the record in this case. The prosecutor referenced Appellant's foreknowledge in his opening and closing statements, contending that Appellant had information about the crime long before the state responded to Appellant's discovery request. The state presented two recorded conversations of Appellant in support of its contention that the Appellant had committed the crimes described in the complaint because appellant had knowledge of the facts. Appellant's trial counsel addressed this issue in cross examination and closing, arguing that Appellant could have received the same information from other sources and the state had failed to rule out those alternatives.\n\n{\u00b621} Appellant had the opportunity to raise the claim of prosecutorial misconduct that he now sets forth in the instant appeal at trial and in a direct appeal. Such claims, therefore, are barred under the doctrine of res judicata. State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 180, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967). The Perry court explained the doctrine as follows: \u201cUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars the convicted defendant from raising and litigating in any proceeding, except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial which resulted in that judgment of conviction or on an appeal\nfrom that judgment.\" *Id.* at paragraph 8 of the syllabus. A defendant who was represented by counsel is barred from raising an issue in a petition for post-conviction relief if the defendant raised or could have raised the issue at trial or on direct appeal. *State v. Szefcyk*, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 96, 671 N.E.2d 233 (1996).\n\n{\u00b622} Appellant had the opportunity to raise the issue of the prosecutor's conduct at trial and a direct appeal thereafter, but failed to do so. This portion of the first assignment of error is overruled.\n\n{\u00b623} Appellant argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to withdraw and request appointment of new counsel in the second part of his first assignment of error.\n\nWhere ineffective assistance of counsel is alleged in a petition for postconviction relief, the defendant, in order to secure a hearing on his petition, must proffer evidence which, if believed, would establish not only that his trial counsel had substantially violated at least one of a defense attorney's essential duties to his client but also that said violation was prejudicial to the defendant.\n\n*State v. Cole*, 2 Ohio St.3d 112, 114, 443 N.E.2d 169 (1982).\n\n{\u00b624} Appellant's argument is based upon a contention that his trial counsel had the obligation to withdraw from the case so he could be called as a witness and testify as to his conversations with his client regarding the facts of the case, in an effort to rebut the prosecutor's contention that Appellant had foreknowledge of the facts. In support of his argument, Appellant offers his own affidavit describing his conversations with counsel regarding the facts of the case and references to the record of the case.\nThe decision whether to call any witness falls within the purview of trial tactics. *State v. Adkins*, 144 Ohio App.3d 633, 646, 761 N.E.2d 94 (12th Dist.2001); *Lakewood v. Town*, 106 Ohio App.3d 521, 527, 666 N.E.2d 599 (8th Dist.1995). Had Appellant\u2019s counsel testified, it is likely that he would have waived attorney client privilege and subjected himself to prejudicial cross examination by the state. Appellant discloses an example of the potential prejudicial information in his petition when he admits his trial counsel warned him that his prior conviction of possession of drugs, if disclosed to the jury, would have a negative effect.\n\nAppellant\u2019s trial counsel addressed the state\u2019s allegation regarding Appellant\u2019s knowledge of facts by cross examination of the officer that identified the recordings and by suggesting to the jury the existence of alternative sources for the information in his closing argument. Trial counsel\u2019s failure to withdraw and act as a witness in this case is not evidence of ineffective assistance, but part of a prudent trial strategy and \u201c[w]e will not second-guess the strategic decisions counsel made at trial even though appellate counsel now argue that they would have defended differently.\u201d *State v. Post*, 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 388, 513 N.E.2d 754 (1987) as cited in *State v. Mason*, 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 169, 1998-Ohio-370, 694 N.E.2d 932. Consequently, even if the trial court believed Appellant\u2019s allegations, he has not provided evidence of a substantial violation of trial counsel\u2019s duties.\n\nWe hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the Appellant\u2019s allegations were barred by res judicata or did not provide substantive grounds for relief. The first assignment of error is denied.\nII.\n\n{\u00b628} Appellant revisits his allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel in his second assignment of error, arguing his trial counsel violated an essential duty by advising him not to testify. \u201cThe advice provided by counsel to his or her client regarding the decision to testify is \u201ca paradigm of the type of tactical decision that cannot be challenged as evidence of ineffective assistance.\u201d State v. Winchester, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 79739, 2002\u2013Ohio\u20132130, \u00b6 12, quoting Hutchins v. Garrison, 724 F.2d 1425, 1436 (C.A.4, 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1065, 104 S.Ct. 750, 79 L.Ed.2d 207 (1984). See also, Jones v. Murray (C.A.4, 1991), 947 F.2d 1106, 1116, fn. 6. Nonetheless, a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel may be successful if the record demonstrates the defendant's decision whether or not to testify was the result of coercion. Id, citing Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 52\u201353 (1st Cir.1993).\n\n{\u00b629} Nothing in the record suggests Appellant's decision to not testify was the result of coercion. Appellant has not shown that his decision to not testify was not of his own free will, and he therefore cannot challenge his decision to not testify as ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n{\u00b630} Appellant has admitted that at least one reason for counsel\u2019s advice was his prior conviction for drug possession. As noted in our review of the first assignment of error, trial counsel employed a strategy that allowed him to attack the evidence without putting his client on the witness stand and exposing to cross examination.\n\n{\u00b631} Even if the trial court accepted the assertions in Appellant\u2019s affidavit as true, the trial court would not have abused its discretion by finding that the allegations did not state substantive grounds for relief as the facts as stated by Appellant do not support a claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\nAppellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\nIII.\n\nIn his third assignment of error, Appellant claims the trial court failed to include findings of fact and conclusions of law in its entry denying the petition. Findings of fact and conclusions of law are mandatory if the trial court dismissed the petition without hearing as they are necessary \u201cto apprise petitioner of the grounds for the judgment of the trial court and to enable the appellate courts to properly determine appeals in such a cause.\u2019 Jones v. State, 8 Ohio St.2d 21, 22, 222 N.E.2d 313 (1966)\n\nThe exercise of findings and conclusions are essential in order to prosecute an appeal. Without them, a petitioner knows no more than he lost and hence is effectively precluded from making a reasoned appeal. In addition, the failure of a trial judge to make the requisite findings prevents any meaningful judicial review, for it is the findings and the conclusions which an appellate court reviews for error.\n\nState v. Mapson, 1 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 438 N.E.2d 910 (1982).\n\nWe hold that the journal entry in this case satisfies the policy considerations announced by the Supreme Court of Ohio in Mapson, supra. The trial court did not label its entry as findings of fact and conclusions of law, but that is what its words import. State ex rel. Carrion v. Harris, 40 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 530 N.E.2d 1330 (1988). We have previously held that \u201cAs long as the basis for the court's ruling can be gleamed from the entry, R.C. 2953.21 has been complied with.\u201d State v. Wells, 5th Dist. Licking No. 94 CA 113, 1995 WL 495308, *1. In State v. Rouse, 5th Dist. Muskingum No. CT2013-0043, 2014-Ohio-483, \u00b6 20, we found that an entry stating that the court found that the claims\nwere barred by res judicata was sufficient. The entry in the case sub judice contains that reference as well as a reference to the absence of \u201cmeritorious claims\u201d and failure to address the arguments during the direct appeal. Appellant does not claim any prejudice from the alleged failure to provide findings of fact or conclusions of law and it is clear that Appellant was aware of the trial court\u2019s rational as he presented argument, on pages 18 and 19 of his brief, that \u201cres judicata is inapplicable here\u201d and that \u201cthere are enough facts provided to verify Appellants (sic) claims and to grant relief.\u201d\n\n{\u00b635} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is denied.\n\n{\u00b636} The decision of the Muskingum County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n\nBy: Baldwin, J.\n\nGwin, P.J. and\n\nWise, John, J. concur."}

(Indictment, State Court Record, \nECF No. 72, Exhibit 1). \n The case was tried from June 19 until July 7, 2014, when the trial jury found Petitioner guilty \nas to Count 2 (public indecency), Counts 3 and 8 (gross sexual imposition), Count 10 (rape), Count 14 \n(kidnapping), and Counts 15-18 (sexual battery)(Sta te Court Record, ECF No. 72, Exhibit 5).  \nPetitioner was acquitted on Counts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13 (Judgment Entry, State Court Record, \nECF No. 72, Ex. 5). \nOn August 26, 2014, the trial court found that Counts 10 (rape) and 15 (sexual battery) merged \nunder Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2945.71 for the purposes of sentencing, with the State electing sentencing \non Count 10.

Maleng v. Cook, 490 U.S. 488 (1989). \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 2 of 79  PAGEID #: 150593 \n \nI. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \n \n{\u00b6 2} During the period of the i ndicted offenses, appellant was an \nattorney licensed in Ohio, with a central Ohio general practice that \nover time became focused on criminal defense work. The women \nwho accused him of sexual misconduc t were clients or relatives of \nclients; two of the accusers also worked in appellant's law offices. \n \n{\u00b6 3} Columbus police began investigating appellant in 2013 after \none of the accusers, C.C., hired ap pellant to represent her son in \ncriminal proceedings and complained of appellant's unwanted \nphysical advances. After appellant's arrest at the termination of that \ninvestigation, other accusers began coming forth, leading to an 18\u2013\ncount indictment issued by the Franklin County Grand Jury alleging \ncrimes victimizing five different women: Counts 1, 2, and 3 alleged \nkidnapping, public indecency, and gross sexual imposition \ninvolving accuser C.C., all occurring on or about April 4, 2013. \nCounts 4 and 5 alleged rape and kidnapping involving accuser L.G., \narising out of a single incident  occurring between August 1 and \nAugust 31, 2008. Counts 6 and 7 alle ged sexual battery and gross \nsexual imposition involving accuser A.C., occurring between \nJanuary 1, 1998, and December 31, 2010. Count 8 alleged gross \nsexual imposition involving accuser K.R., occurring between \nAugust 8 and September 17, 2008. Counts 10 through 13 alleged \nrape involving accuser L.M. Count 14 alleged kidnapping involving \nL.M. in connection with one of the rape counts. Counts 15 through \n18 alleged sexual battery against L.M. All the counts involving L.M. \nalleged conduct occurring between January 1, 2002, and December \n31, 2008. All counts involving all accusers alleged that the criminal \nconduct occurred in Franklin County, Ohio. \n \n{\u00b6 4} The state provided a bill of particulars on June 1, 2014, \namended it on the eve of trial on June 6, 2014, and further amended \nit at the close of the state's cas e on June 22, 2014. The state, over \nobjection, also verbally amended the indictment during trial to \nconform to certain testimony. The specifics of these amendments \nare more extensively developed below in connection with \nappellant's first and sixth assignments of error (emphasis supplied). \n \nII. TRIAL PROCEEDINGS \n \n{\u00b6 5} The prosecution relied chiefly on the testimony of the five \naccusers. In addition, three other similarly situated women testified \nas other-acts witnesses regarding ev ents that did not give rise to \nfurther criminal charges. Two of these described appellant's conduct \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 3 of 79  PAGEID #: 150604 \n \nin connection with consensual sexual relationships, and one testified \nregarding appellant's offensive conduct or statements towards her. \n \n{\u00b6 6} The first accuser that testified at trial was C.C. She stated that \nshe hired appellant to represent her son in a criminal matter, and met \nwith appellant at his office on S outh High Street in Columbus. On \nApril 4, 2013, C.C. received a call from appellant's secretary asking \nher to come to appellant's Columbus office to discuss the upcoming \ntrial. During the course of their interview, appellant retrieved a legal \nfile and sat next to C.C., brushing up against her. Appellant then \nopened the file, C.C. testified, and when the file fell to the floor, he \ngripped C.C.'s left arm firmly a nd put his right arm down her shirt, \npulling her bra away from her breast s. C.C. testified that she was \nunable to move during this episode because of appellant's physical \nrestraint. C.C. then attempted to readjust her clothing, and realized \nthat appellant had stood up and unzipped his pants, placing his penis \nbefore her face. C.C. was offended, and quickly left the office, \ncalling a friend to pick her up. She later called her sister, K.C., to \ncomplain of the episode. \n \n{\u00b6 7} K.C. herself testified to confirm the phone call from C.C. She \ndescribed her sister as frantic during the call, which prompted K.C. \nto advise C.C. to call the police. \n \n{\u00b6 8} After C.C. reported the incident to the Columbus police, \ninvestigators contacted C.C. and asked her to set up further meetings \nwith appellant that could be recorded as evidence. She exchanged \nseveral recorded phone calls with appellant and eventually met him \nat a restaurant, where their conversation was recorded and observed \nby police. During this meeting, a ppellant again made unwanted \nadvances towards C.C. by repeatedly putting his hand on her thigh, \nand did not deny his prior conduct during their meeting at his office. \nIn the course of C.C.'s testimony, these recordings were played for \nthe jury in open court. \n \n{\u00b6 9} Officer Jeffrey Cain, of the Columbus Division of Police, \ntestified that he went to C.C.'s  apartment on April 4, 2013, to take \nthe report of a sexual assault. \n \n{\u00b6 10} Corporal Jeff Zech, of the Franklin County Sheriff's Office, \ntestified regarding the technical aspects of the audio recording \nprocess used for the restaurant meeting between C.C. and appellant. \n \n{\u00b6 11} Detective Jason Sprague, of the Columbus Division of \nPolice, testified regarding the preparations for the restaurant \nmeeting between C.C. and appellant. He was in the vicinity during \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 4 of 79  PAGEID #: 150615 \n \nthe meeting but had difficulty pi cking up the conversation because \nrecording sound was poor. After appellant's arrest upon leaving the \nrestaurant, Detective Sprague participated in a recorded interview \nwith appellant at the police station. \n \n{\u00b6 12} During Detective Sprague's testimony, the recording of \nappellant's post-arrest interview was played in open court. In this \ninterview, appellant described in detail his recent meeting with C.C. \nat his office regarding her son's cas e. He denied any inappropriate \nconduct on his part towards C.C. on that or any other occasion. He \nprofessed to be baffled by some of C.C.'s text messages and phone \ncalls that contained flirtatious or sexual references, and stated that \nhe had previously asked her to refrain from such comments. \n \n{\u00b6 13} Detective Jeffery Ackley, of the Columbus Division of \nPolice, testified about his participation in the investigation. He acted \nas security backup and an observer during the restaurant meeting. \nHis visual observations corroborated C.C.'s testimony regarding \nappellant's physical actions, alt hough the ambient noise prevented \nhim from overhearing their conversa tion directly. He was able to \nmake a partial video recording of  the meeting using his personal \nrecording device, and this was later transferred to CD by \ninvestigators. The video was partially played for the jury but did not \ninclude any of appellant's alleged physical advances. \n \n{\u00b6 14} On cross-examination of C.C., defense counsel played a \nvideo recording made in Colu mbus police facilities during a \ntelephone conversation between C.C. and her incarcerated son, who \nwas awaiting trial for aggravated murder and other charges. In the \nrecorded conversation, C.C. several times assured her son that, due \nto the developing conflict with appellant, the son would receive not \nonly new defense counsel but a di fferent prosecutor and judge for \nhis case. Upon further questioning, C. C. testified that she felt that \nthese changes would benefit her son, because she was dismayed by \nthe harsh 43\u2013year sentence offered to her son in plea discussions, \nand doubted whether appellant ha d obtained the best available \nresult. \n \n{\u00b6 15} In his testimony at trial regarding C.C.'s accusations, \nappellant denied any inappropriate conduct towards C.C. He \ndescribed his representation of her son against several extremely \nserious charges, including aggravat ed murder. Appellant testified \nthat his primary contact was with other family members or his jailed \nclient via telephone, because C.C., after two brief in itial meetings, \nmade herself unavailable. While other family members came to \nvarious court hearings, C.C. did not. After several months, in April \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 5 of 79  PAGEID #: 150626 \n \n2013, the trial date approached and appellant advised his client that \nthe prosecution's 43\u2013year offer was preferable to trial and a life \nsentence. Appellant felt that the st ate had put together a very solid \ninvestigation and his cl ient would have little  chance in front of a \njury, and a plea to the indictment without an agreed sentence would \nresult in more time. \n \n{\u00b6 16} Appellant testified that prior to the Apr il 4 meeting, he \ninstructed his assistant to contact C.C. and arrange a meeting to \nupdate C.C. regarding the case. The meeting was arranged for April \n4, and C.C. arrived as agreed. Her behavior struck him as odd. He \nasked about an individual that she had previously introduced to him \nas her husband, and she laughed a nd stated that she had this \nindividual arrested. They then di scussed her son's case, and C.C. \nexpressed extreme disa ppointment with the plea offer. Appellant \nexplained the situation to her and showed her some of his case notes. \nHe denied sitting next to her on th e office couch or touching her in \nany way. He was taken aback when C.C., on leaving the office, \nasked if he would like to have dinner some time. \n \n{\u00b6 17} Appellant testified that th e next day he learned from his \nclient, C.C.'s son, that the client no longer wanted to accept the plea \ndeal. C.C. then called him, and, in one of the conversations that he \nlater learned was recorded by he r at police request, asked for a \ndinner meeting to further discu ss her son's plea.  During the phone \ncall, C.C. made several flirtatious or sexually charged remarks, \nwhich appellant deflected. He was no t particularly put off by this \nbecause he considered C.C. to be somewhat unstable or \nunpredictable, and in any case he had experienced flirtatious \ncomments from other clients and could usually steer such \nconversations back to business wi thout difficulty. Appellant then \ndescribed the meeting with C.C. at the restaurant, and denied putting \nhis hand on her thigh or touching her inappropriately. \n \n{\u00b6 18} The defense called S.K., C.C.'s former roommate. She \ntestified that, in March 2013, C.C. approached her about \nblackmailing appellant. C.C. appeared frustrated by appellant's \nrepresentation and the poor plea offer made by the state in her son's \nmurder case. C.C. was also upset  about the amount of money she \nhad paid appellant for her son's re presentation. C.C. told S.K. that \nshe had lied regarding the sexual incident so that she could sue \nappellant and get a new attorney fo r her son. She promised to give \nS.K. a car if S.K. would particip ate in the blackm ail scheme. S.K. \nrefused to participate when she learned that appellant had been \narrested, whereupon C.C. kicked S.K. out of their shared apartment. \n \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 6 of 79  PAGEID #: 150637 \n \n{\u00b6 19} The second accuser to appear at trial was A.C. She testified \nthat she began working for appella nt in the late 1990's, during the \ntime that appellant represented her in a custody dispute. Appellant's \nprincipal office at the time was in  Marion, Ohio. A.C. worked for \nappellant for over seven years, and she eventually resided in one of \nhis rental properties. Early in the working relationship, A.C. testified \nappellant approached her when she was working in his Marion \noffice, rubbed her shoulders, put  his hands down her shirt, and \neventually requested that she pe rform oral sex. She acquiesced. \nThese incidents went on for some time, including an incident when \nshe was in his Columbus office during 2005 or 2006. She could \nprovide no specific dates for any of the incidents except for one \noccurring on September 11, 2001. On direct and cross-examination, \nA.C. agreed that she has a lengthy history of disabling mental illness \nand experienced many civil and criminal legal difficulties as a result. \nShe stated that the sexual activity with appellant was \u201cto an extent\u201d \nconsensual, but that at the time sh e felt she had little choice but to \ncomply with his demands. (Tr. at 834.) \n \n{\u00b6 20} Appellant testified that he first met A.C., as she had testified, \nduring representation of her in a custody matter in 1999. He agreed \nthat she had worked for him off and on over the years and had rented \na home from him. Appellant denied having any sexual relationship \nof any kind with A.C. He represented her on numerous legal matters, \nsome arising from her mental health issues, which often led to run-\nins with police. This legal representation ended when A.C. \ncomplained that appellant was taking too long obtaining a \ndissolution for her. \n \n{\u00b6 21} The third accuser to testify was L.G., who testified that she \nmet appellant in 2006 or 2007 when she retained appellant to \nrepresent her son in a legal matter. Their interactions began \nprofessionally, but she claime d appellant soon began acting \ninappropriately. She claimed that at one point, appellant demanded \noral sex in exchange for a prom ise to help her son. On several \noccasions he stripped naked in front of her in his office and \nmasturbated. Later, on the eve of her son's court appearance in \nSeptember or October 2007, she went  to appellant's office for a \nmeeting. Appellant and another ma n were drinking in the office. \nL.G. claimed appellant offered her a drink and suggested that if she \nperformed oral sex on both men, her son's case would have a better \noutcome. L.G. refused and left the office. \n \n{\u00b6 22} L.G. testified that next day, while in court attending her son's \nsentencing hearing, she realized that the man she had seen the night \nbefore with appellant was, in fact , the judge in her son's case. She \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 7 of 79  PAGEID #: 150648 \n \nwas extremely upset when th e judge imposed the maximum \nsentence on her son at this hearing. After the hearing, L.G. claimed \nappellant forced her to perform oral sex on him in an attorney \nconference room in the courthouse,  physically restraining her from \nleaving. She claimed that  after this, she was violently ill as she \nrejoined her family outside. L.G. testified that she had made a police \nreport about the incident in 2009 and refiled it in 2013 when learning \nof appellant's arrest. \n \n{\u00b6 23} Prosecution witness S.W. testified that she was L.G.'s aunt \nand had observed interaction between L.G. and appellant. She \nadvanced some funds for appellant's fees in the defense of L.G.'s son \nand later took L.G. to retrieve paperwork from appellant's office \nafter L.G. had terminated the atto rney-client relationship on behalf \nof her son. S.W. observed a heated confrontation between L.G. and \nappellant, prompted in part by appellant's refusal to return the son's \ncase file. At some point in the conversation, L.G. called appellant a \nrapist. From appellant's office, th ey drove to the Columbus police \ndepartment, where L.G. went insi de for at least two and one-half \nhours while S.W. remained in the car. On previous occasions, S.W. \nhad accompanied L.G. for case conferences, and felt that appellant \nwas upset that L.G. was not alone and would not come up to his \noffice alone. \n \n{\u00b6 24} Prosecution witness J.B. testified that she was L.G.'s de facto \nmother-in-law, as L.G. had lived  with her son for 24 years even \nthough the two were not married. She attended a meeting with L.G. \nat appellant's office in 2009 and observed an argument or scene in \nwhich L.G. called appellant a rapist. Thereafter, she rode in the car \nwith L.G. and S.W. to the police station, and testified that L.G. was \nin the police station only 15 or  20 minutes. On another occasion, \nJ.B. attended a hearing for her grandson at the courthouse and waited \noutside in the hall during proceedings . J.B. testified that, at some \npoint, L.G. emerged fr om the courtroom and became violently ill. \nWhen J.B. asked what was the matter, L.G. replied \u201cif you only \nknew.\u201d (Tr. at 1291.) \n \n{\u00b6 25} On cross-examination of L.G., the defense offered the dates \nand results of L.G.'s son's criminal cases, and the dates of appellant's \nrepresentation in those cases, to impeach her testimony. In \nparticular, the defense introduced court records indicating that her \nson had received only community control, rather than prison, in his \nappearance before the trial judge sh e identified as associating with \nappellant. \n \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 8 of 79  PAGEID #: 150659 \n \n{\u00b6 26} In his testimony regarding hi s contact with L.G., appellant \nagreed that he had represented he r son in a criminal case. He also \nnoted that he had represented he r personally in several criminal \ncases in 2006, as well as her other son during the same period. \nAppellant denied all allegations by L.G. regarding sexual conduct. \nHe testified that his representati on of her son ended when the son \nreceived probation in the cases on which appellant worked, but that \nshe asked him to appear at sentencing involving the son's other case. \nOn that occasion, appellant spoke briefly with L.G. before leaving \nafter the son's current counsel, a public defender, arrived. \n \n{\u00b6 27} Attorney Emily Huddleson testified for the defense regarding \nL.G.'s accusations. She stated that she was the public defender who \nrepresented L.G.'s son at the sentencing hearing in question. She \ntestified that after sentencing, she and L.G. walked out in the lobby \ntogether, were met by an older woman, and the three discussed the \nsentence and the reasoning behind it for 20 or 30 minutes. Despite \nthe fact that Huddleson was assigned counsel for all four cases \ninvolving L.G.'s son that day, L.G. complained to Huddleson that \nshe had paid appellant a lot of money and felt he should still be there. \nHuddleson testified that appellant was initially present at the hearing \nbut not there for the co nclusion when the j udge imposed a prison \nsentence on L.G.'s son. Huddleson de scribed L.G. as furious after \nher son received prison time. Huddleson did not observe L.G. \ncrying, being sick to her stomach, or going into a courthouse \nconference room with appellant or anyone else after the hearing. \n \n{\u00b6 28} The fourth accuser to testify was K.R. K.R. testified that \nappellant represented K.R.'s boyfriend in a case in which he had \nbeen accused of domestic violence against K.R. Despite being the \nvictim of the domestic violence at issue, K.R. met with appellant to \npursue dropping the charges. Appellant subsequently represented \nK.R. in a criminal matter of her own. Before her trial in September \n2008, K.R. testified they met in appellant's Marion office, where he \noffered her a drink, rubbed her sh oulders, and began feeling her \nbreasts. K.R. refused to have sex with appellant, whereupon \nappellant began masturbating in front of her. K.R. told her mother \nabout the incident, and reported the incident to the bar association, \npolice, and a judge of the Marion County common pleas court. After \nthe incident, she obtained new representation. Despite the statement \nthat she gave to police and court, she heard nothing more from local \nauthorities. Her own criminal case concluded with a guilty plea and \na one-year sentence in prison. The Columbus Bar Association \nreferred her complaint to the Supreme Court of Ohio, and a \nrepresentative of the Supreme Court interviewed her regarding her \nallegations. To her knowledge, nothing came of the matter. After \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 9 of 79  PAGEID #: 1506610 \n \nlearning of appellant's 2013 arrest involving similar allegations, she \ncontacted a detective with the Columbus police to renew her \nallegations in the matter. \n \n{\u00b6 29} Regarding K.R., appellant testified that he recalled \nrepresenting her in 2008, when th ey disagreed about a plea offer \nfrom the prosecution. She terminat ed representation when he \nrefused to seek a continuance on what he felt were unwarranted \nmedical grounds. He was later summoned to court for a pretrial and \nwas requested by the prosecution and the judge to arrive early. When \nhe arrived, the judge and prosecutor informed him that K.R. had \nreported a sexual assault. He withdrew from her case, and a new \nlawyer was appointed. Appellant denied any sexual misconduct with \nK.R. \n \n{\u00b6 30} The final accuser to testify was L.M., who described a long \nhistory of coerced sexual relati ons with appellant. Her testimony \nwith regard to dates was generally vague, and often established only \nby reference to the age of her young daughter, born in 1997, during \nthe various incidents described. \n \n{\u00b6 31} L.M. described her background as an immigrant from \nVenezuela with limited English. She came to America with her \nVenezuelan fianc\u00e9, and after they married in Florida he took a job \nin Ohio. She testified that she first retained appellant in late 1998 or \nearly 1999 to represent her in divorce proceedings. She selected him \nbased on his ability to communicate in Spanish. She also had \ndifficulties with her immigration status, which was solely based on \nher then-husband's student visa, a nd appellant advised her to delay \nthe divorce while dealing with these immigration issues. As a result, \nthe divorce action went on for a c onsiderable time, and L.M. met \nmany times with appellant. She traveled from her home in \nGroveport, in southeast Franklin County, to appellant's office in \nMarion for these meetings, which appellant usually scheduled for \nFriday afternoon or Saturday. At  first she brought her infant \ndaughter along, but approximately three months after taking the case \nappellant requested that she not bring the child to meetings. \n \n{\u00b6 32} The first incident she clai med occurred about four or five \nmonths after she retained appella nt. She testified that during an \noffice conference at appellant's Marion office, appellant offered \nL.M. a cup of coffee, and thereafter she lost consciousness. She \nawoke alone on appellant's office couch with her clothes in disarray \nand indications that she had experienced sexual intercourse. She felt \nconfused, as if drugged or drunk.  After a short time, appellant \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 10 of 79  PAGEID #: 1506711 \n \nreturned to the room and told her she had fainted. As a result of this \nincident, L.M. avoided seeing appellant for the next two months. \n \n{\u00b6 33} L.M. resumed contact with appellant after a series of phone \ncalls from him in which he advised that she was at risk of deportation \nand would lose custody of her daug hter. Around this time in 1999, \nappellant provided a tenant reference that helped L.M. move from \nGroveport to an apartment in Dublin, in northern Franklin County \nand thus closer to Marion. She claimed that she met again with \nappellant in his Marion office at this time, and another assault \noccurred. After briefly discussi ng her case, appellant suddenly \napproached her and pulled down hi s pants. Appellant threatened a \npoor result in her legal matters if  she did not perform oral sex. He \nplaced his hands behind her head, thereby \u201crestraining [her] head \nagainst his penis,\u201d told her to \u201cdo it,\u201d and forced his penis into her \nmouth. (Tr. at 1483.) \n \n{\u00b6 34} L.M. testified that after that incident sexual conduct between \nappellant and L.M. was frequent ove r approximately the next three \nyears, always under the implied th reat that if he dropped her case \nshe would lose her immigration status and custody of her daughter. \nThese events first took place at appellant's Marion office, where \nappellant eventually hired her to do office work to help pay her legal \nbills. Later appellant kept a residential apartment in Marion and took \nher there. Some incidents also took place at her apartment in Dublin, \nwhere appellant would ask L.M. to  lock her daughter in another \nroom. Although L.M.'s testimony did not provide details of any \nspecific instances for most of th e abuse occurring after the two \nspecific incidents described above, she did testify in more detail \nabout later events that formed the basis for two of the rape charges: \nsometime in 2000 or 2001, appellant drove L.M. in a white truck \nfrom his Marion office to a rural field where he forced her to have \nvaginal sex. Six months later, he repeated the offense. \n \n{\u00b6 35} L.M. testified that around the time that her daughter was three \nand one-half or four years old, L.M. became pregnant by appellant \nand appellant insisted that she have an abortion. The last time she \nclaimed she had sexual contact with appellant was 2003. This was \nthe year in which she obtained he r permanent U.S. residency, and \nwith her immigration stat us settled she no longer felt compelled to \nsubmit to appellant's demands. \n \n{\u00b6 36} L.M. learned of appellant's arrest in 2013 when her daughter \nemailed a link to a newspaper story.  From this she learned that she \nwas not the only person who claimed to suffer appellant's advances. \nAfter discovering this, L.M. called appellant to tell him that she was \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 11 of 79  PAGEID #: 1506812 \n \nglad that the arrest would prev ent him from taking advantage of \nother women. L.M. then contacted the Columbus police detective \nnamed in the news story to complain of the past incidents. \n \n{\u00b6 37} On cross-examination, L.M. denied that appellant had ceased \nrepresenting her in her divorce case by 2001. Defense counsel \noffered docket items to establish that a different attorney appeared \non her behalf in the domestic action after that time. L.M. responded \nthat many attorneys had represented her in different matters through \nthis time, but she felt certain that  appellant continued to act on her \nbehalf. She acknowledged that he r original divorce action was \ndismissed and she eventually di vorced under a new case filed in \n2003 by another attorney. She also acknowledged that, despite her \nprofessed hatred for appellant arising from past abuse, she had often \napproached appellant for informal assistance with legal or practical \nmatters over the years during and after the abusive conduct. She \nstated that she viewed this assistance as repayment for past abuse: \n\u201cI wanted to take advantage of him because he abused me so\u2014for \nso long. * * * So he abusing [me] so long, so he has to do it for me.\u201d \n(Tr. at 1645.) \n \n{\u00b6 38} Generally, appellant testified that he had a long-standing \nprofessional relationship with L.M., beginning when L.M. \napproached him for representation in a divorce matter. Even after \nhis representation of her in he r divorce matter terminated in \napproximately 2001, appellant testifie d L.M. repeatedly sought his \nassistance in several legal and non-legal matters. Regarding the \nduration of his legal representation, appellant testified that he filed \nL.M.'s divorce paperwork in D ecember 1999 and withdrew from \nrepresentation in 2001. Ot her attorneys took her case thereafter. In \n2004, appellant and his wife separa ted briefly, and appellant and \nL.M. dated for about two weeks. Appellant denied ever having any \ntype of sexual contact with L.M. at any other time during their \nrelationship. Their brief dating re lationship ended abruptly when \nL.M. told appellant she was pr egnant, and appellant, who had \nundergone a vasectomy, understood that she had been seeing other \nmen. He denied arranging an abortion for her. \n \n{\u00b6 39} The next witness was L.L., who was not the object of any \nindicted offenses, but testified as  to appellant's conduct when he \nrepresented her in 2009 as she faced a murder charge. The defense \nobjected unsuccessfully to this \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. \n \n{\u00b6 40} L.L. testified that during one of her pre-tria l meetings with \nappellant in a jailhouse conferen ce room, appellant illustrated his \nviews on witness credibi lity by stating that \u201che could rape [her] in \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 12 of 79  PAGEID #: 1506913 \n \nthe room and it would be [her] word against his and nobody would \nbe the wiser.\u201d (Tr. at 1794.) Appe llant also stated on that occasion \nthat L.L. could crawl under the table and perform oral sex on him \nbecause there were no correction officers around, and it would be \nonly her word against his if she complained. \n \n{\u00b6 41} In his testimony, appellant denied making any such \ncomments to L.L. \n \n{\u00b6 42} M.H. was another witness offered by the prosecution for \n\u201cother acts\u201d testimony, again over objection. M.H. testified that \nappellant represented her as he r attorney for over a decade, \nbeginning when she was 17 year s old and incarcerated in the \njuvenile detention fac ility. Upon initial releas e, she and appellant \nmet at his Marion office, went to dinner, and went back and had sex \nin his office. Over the ensuing 12 years, appellant represented M.H. \non multiple cases but she never paid him. They continued to have \nsex during this time, and M.H. accompanied appellant on a vacation \nto Florida. \n \n{\u00b6 43} Appellant testified that he met M.H. at the very beginning of \nhis legal career, when he substituted for an attorney who had failed \nto appear at the Marion County Juvenile Center. M.H. was 17 and \ncharged with a felony. She later approached appellant for \nrepresentation in a divorce. Rather than going on a dinner date \nfollowed by sex, as described by M. H., appellant recalled that they \nhad dinner with M.H.'s stepfather and mother, and he left that dinner \nmeeting alone. Appellant adamantly  denied ever having sex with \nM.H. He agreed that he conti nued to represent her in various \ncriminal matters for 12 years after the initial case. \n \n{\u00b6 44} C.P. testified over objection as the third and final \u201cother acts\u201d \nwitness. She testified that she met appellant about handling her \ndivorce. He did not do so because she eventually proceeded with a \ndissolution in another state. She then retained him to represent her \nboyfriend in a criminal case. C.P. acted as a liaison between the \nboyfriend and appellant while the boyfriend was incarcerated. \nDuring one jail call, which was recorded, C.P. told the boyfriend \nthat appellant had slapped her buttocks while she was leaving \nappellant's office one day. Appella nt learned of this conversation \nand told her he was upset about th is both because it would create \nfriction with his client and because  he knew that al l jailhouse calls \nwere recorded. Later, after a ppellant was removed from the \nboyfriend's case because he was a potential witness, C.P. and \nappellant began a consensual sexu al relationship. This continued \nintermittently until just prior to appellant's trial. \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 13 of 79  PAGEID #: 1507014 \n \n \n{\u00b6 45} Appellant's testimony with respect to C.P. denied any sexual \nconduct between them. He testified that in the course of his criminal \ndefense practice, his office routin ely obtained and reviewed audio \ndiscs of recorded jailhouse phone conversations involving many of \nhis clients. After reviewing th e recorded jailh ouse phone call in \nwhich C.P. told her boyfriend that  appellant had slapped or groped \nher buttocks, appellant asked fo r a meeting to explain why she \nwould make such a false statement to his client. She stated that she \nwas upset by reports of the boyfrie nd's past infidel ity and merely \nwished to make the boyfriend jealous. He then advised her to be \ncautious with such conversations. \n \n{\u00b6 46} In addition to his testimony addressing the specific \naccusations presented by the state's witnesses, appellant testified in \nhis case-in-chief regarding his background. He stated that he \ngraduated from Capital Law Scho ol in 1998 as an older, non-\ntraditional student with a growin g family. He clerked with an \nexperienced criminal defense attorney in Marion, Ohio, during law \nschool, and shared space in that office for one year after passing the \nbar. He then secured his own sp ace and began his own practice in \nMarion and, eventually, in Co lumbus, Mansfield, and Cleveland. \nHis practice, general at first, eventually focused on criminal defense \nwith a smaller proportion of dom estic and civil litigation. He \ntestified that he believed the accusations against him were the result \nof a coordinated campaign by the Franklin County Prosecutor's \nOffice, the Attorney General, a nd the Columbus police to remove \nhim from the practice of law becau se of his effective advocacy in \ncriminal cases. \n \n{\u00b6 47} The defense presented testimony from several current or \nformer female employees and client s of appellant's practice. These \nwitnesses testified that they had never experienced or witnessed any \nmisconduct by appellant. The defens e also sought to attack the \ncredibility of the accusers by introducing testimony, photographs, \nand documentary evidence that c onflicted with the accuser's \ndescriptions of appellant's office locations and interior furnishings. \n \n{\u00b6 48} With respect to the charges involving L.M., the jury returned \nguilty verdicts on Count 10 of the indictment (rape), Count 14 of the \nindictment (kidnapping), and Counts 15, 16, 17, and 18 of the \nindictment (sexual battery). The court merged Counts 15 and 10 of \nthe indictment for sentencing purposes, and the prosecution elected \nto sentence on Count 10 of the indictment for rape. The court \ndeclined to merge any other coun ts involving L.M., in particular, \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 14 of 79  PAGEID #: 1507115 \n \nfinding that the rape and kidnapping counts, although arising out of \nthe same transaction, were driven by a separate animus. \n \n{\u00b6 49} The jury returned a guilty verdict on Count 2, public \nindecency, involving C.C. The trial court addressed this in a separate \nmisdemeanor sentencing entry imposing 30 days jail time with full \ncredit for time served. \n \nArmengau I, supra.   \n Under 28 U.S.C. 2254(e)(1) as enacted by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996 (Pub. L. No 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214)(the  \"AEDPA\"), these findings of fact by the \nTenth District are presumed to be correct by this Court unless rebutte d by clear and convincing \nevidence. Warren v. Smith, 161 F.3d 358, 360-61 (6th Cir. 1998).   \n In evaluating state court findings of fact, this  Court is limited to considering the evidence \nthat was before the state courts.  Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170 (2011).  On the basis of the \nPinholster decision, the Magistrate Judge has excl uded a number of exhibits tendered by \nPetitioner, all of them portions of indictments in other cases, which were not presented to the Ohio \ncourts (See ECF Nos. 54, 55, 63, 71).  Petitione r has objected (ECF No. 78), but Chief Judge \nMarbley has not yet resolved those Objections.  Having reviewed the Objections, the Magistrate \nJudge notes that they argue Petitioner\u2019s case on the merits, but do not address the Pinholster bar. \nPetitioner offers the distinction that \u201c Pinholster dealt with the petitioner's personal records that \nweren't demonstrative or comparative but rather related directly to the personal defense of the petitioner \nthat would have been admissible in trial through testimony.\u201d  However, the rule in Pinholster is not \nlimited to the particular kinds of extra-record facts Pinholster tried to introduce in habeas, but applies \nbroadly to all extra-record evidence. \nIn the course of these proceedings, Petitioner has often referred to the dissent of Judge Gary \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 15 of 79  PAGEID #: 1507216 \n \nTyack2 in Armengau I.  The Magistrate Judge notes that J udge Tyack dissented on issues of law \nand not from any of these findings of fact. \n On August 7, 2015, Petitioner filed a motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial \n(State Court Record, ECF No. 77, Ex. 22).  The trial court denied leave on a finding that Petitioner had \nnot shown he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the new evidence he wished to present. Id. \nat Ex. 25.  The Tenth District affirmed and the Supreme Court of Ohio denied review.  Id. at Exs. 33, \n36. \n On September 19, 2017, Petitioner filed another motion for leave to file a delayed motion for \nnew trial.  Id. at Ex. 55.  The trial court denied the motion, the Tenth District again affirmed, and the \nSupreme Court of Ohio again denied review.  Id. at Exs. 58, 62, 65. \n On January 16, 2018, prior to re-sentenci ng on remand, Petitioner moved to dismiss Counts 8, \n10, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P.  29, arguing that he was convicted of crimes \nthat were never presented to a grand jury and that he was actually innocent. (Presentence Motion for \nDismissal, State Court Record, ECF No. 72-1, Ex. 70, PageID 9204-15).  The trial court denied the \nmotion. Id. at Ex. 72.  The Tenth District affirmed.3 State v. Armengau, 2019-Ohio-101 (10th Dist. Mar. \n21, 2019)(\u201cArmengau II\u201d), appellate jurisdiction declined, 157 Ohio St.3d 1405 (2019). \nOn March 27, 2018, pursuant to the Tenth District\u2019s remand, the trial court found that Counts \n14 (kidnapping) and 17 (sexual battery) merged with Count 10 (rape) for the purposes of sentencing. \nThe trial court imposed a four-year prison term for Count 15 (sexual battery) to run consecutively with \nCount 10. Armengau\u2019s previously imposed concurrent sentences of fifteen months each in prison for \nCounts 3 and 8, and thirty months each in prison for Counts 16 and 18 were ordered to remain in full \nforce and effect.  Id. at Ex. 77. \n \n2 The Return points out that Gary Tyack is now the elected prosecutor of Franklin County, Ohio.  He will, however, \nbe referred to in this Report as \u201cJudge Tyack,\u201d the capacity in which he was involved with this case.  \n3 The panel on Armengau\u2019s first direct appeal were Judges Klatt, Sadler, and Tyack (dissenting); the panel on this \nsecond appeal were Judges Dorrian, Brown, and Luper Schuster. \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 16 of 79  PAGEID #: 1507317 \n \nOn appeal, the Tenth District overruled Armengau\u2019s second assignment of error and \ndetermined that Armengau\u2019s third assignment of error was barred by the doctrines of res judicata and \nlaw of the case. The appellate court sustained Armengau\u2019s first assignment of error and remanded the \nmatter to the trial court for resentencing on Count 15. State v. Armengau, 2020-Ohio-3552 (Ohio App. \n10th Dist., Jun. 30, 2020)(Armengau II), appellate jurisdiction declined, 2020-Ohio-4811 (2020).  That \nre-sentencing remains pending, but Magistrate Judge Deavers earlier decided that did not prevent the \ncase from being ripe (ECF No. 40). \nPetitioner avers he placed his Petition in the prison mailing system on March 14, 2019 (Petition, \nECF No. 1, PageID 126).  This counts as the filing date.  Houston v. Lack,  487 U.S. 266 (1988); \nCook v. Stegall, 295 F.3d 517, 521 (6 th Cir. 2002).  Petitioner filed of right an Amended Petition \non April 11, 2019 (ECF No. 7), and a Second Amended Petition with court permission on June 13, \n2021 (ECF No. 70).   \n \nPositions of the parties: \n The Second Amended Petition \nIn his Second Amended Petition (ECF No. 70), Petitioner pleads the following grounds for \nrelief: \nGround One : Petitioner was denied his Constitutional Rights to \nDue process and Fundamental Fairness when he was convicted, \nsentenced and resentenced upon insufficient evidence and convicted \nand resentenced for unindicted and uncharged alleged conduct in \nCounts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 in violation of the Fifth, \nSixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \nand contrary to the United States Supreme Court's holding in \nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979) and the Ohio Supreme \nCourt's holdings in State v. Hampton,  2012-Ohio-5688 [footnote \nomitted; official citation 134 Ohio St.3d 44], Knight v. State , 54 \nOhio St. 365 (1896), and State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St. 3d 259. \n \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 17 of 79  PAGEID #: 1507418 \n \nSupporting Facts: Petitioner was indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, \n16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged incidents that occurred in \nColumbus, Ohio (Franklin County) on unknown dates but sometime \nbetween January 1, 2002 and De cember 31, 2008. During trial \nPetitioner established that he di d not commit the indicted crimes. \nProsecutors then, mid-trial, added three (3) years of unindicted and \nuncharged allegations to the indictment by amendment to \ncircumvent the defense. After adding three (3) years to the \nindictment, Petitioner was able to establish that he could not have \ncommitted any of the indicted alleged crimes because by the \nrelevant part of the expanded time frame, Petitioner had never been \nto the locations where the \"victims\" first claimed the indicted crimes \noccurred. Prosecutors then, mid-trial, changed the locations to \nMarion, Ohio, to circumvent the defense. No evidence was presented \nas to the elements of the factual incidents supporting the indictment.  \n \nGround Two:  Petitioner was denied his right to due process of law \nand notice of the specific offenses (charges) for which he was required \nto defend and for which he was convicted, sentenced and resentenced \nin Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, in violation of the Fifth, \nSixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \nand Petitioner's Constitutional right s under the Fifth, Sixth, and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution were further \nviolated where the charging document/instrument failed to adequately \ninform him of the specific crime for which he was indicted and for \nwhich he would be tried, convicted, sentenced and resentenced in \nCounts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. \n \nSupporting Facts:  Petitioner was indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, \n17 and 18 for specific alleged incidents that occurred in Columbus, \nOhio on unknown dates but sometime  between January 1, 2002, and \nDecember 31, 2008. During trial Petitioner established that he did not \ncommit the indicted crimes.  Prosecutors then added three (3) years of \nunindicted allegations to the indictment to circumvent the defense. \nAfter adding three years to the indictment, Petitioner was able to \nestablish that he could not have committed any of the indicted alleged \ncrimes because by the relevant part of the expanded time frame, \nPetitioner had never been to the locations where the alleged victims \ninitially claimed the incidents occurred. Prosecutors then changed the \nlocations to Marion, Ohio, mid-trial, to circumvent the defense. The \nindictment, jury instruction nor the verdict forms identify any specific \nfactual basis for conviction. During trial prosecutors were substituting \n404(B) and \"other act\" evidence for the charged crimes that were never \nmentioned prior to trial. Petitioner was ultimately being tried for factual \nbases that were not part of the indictment. During resentencing the trial \ncourt didn't know what factual basis was applied by prosecutors to any \nof the counts subject to resentencing and couldn't determine what \nincidents the jury considered and thereafter resentenced Petitioner to \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 18 of 79  PAGEID #: 1507519 \n \nprison for alleged incidents that never resulted in conviction and which \neven prosecutors never asked the jury to consider. The Court of \nAppeals in 14 AP 679 confirmed that the alleged crimes for which \nPetitioner has supposedly been convicted were not the crimes for which \nhe was indicted (\u00b6 56-61, June 22, 2017 decision). With regard to \nCounts 2 and 3, evidence was introduced which if believed allowed the \njury to convict for an allegation that was \"other-act\" evidence. This \nalleged incident was not noticed in the indictment or bills of particulars. \nThat claim was alleged to have occurred on April 10, 2013, at a \ndifferent location. The probability that for Count 2 and 3 the jury \nconsidered the unindicted other-act of April 10, 2013 is supported by \nseveral facts. The jury acquitted Petitioner of the kidnapping with \nrespect to the April 4th incident. \n \nAlthough legally not dispositive, logically and factually, the acquittal \nrendered the conviction for the April 4th alleged Gross Sexual \nImposition an impossibility as the acquittal for the kidnapping negated \nthe proof beyond a reasonable doubt required for \"force\" or \"threat of \nforce\". In light of this fact, Pe titioner's testimony, Jennifer Young's \ntestimony, Leslie Todd's testimony and Shirley Koval's testimony, \nacknowledging that the alleged \"victim\" admitted her claims were \nuntrue, the jury may have rejected the April 4th alleged incident and \nconsidered the April 10th allegation where the alleged \"victim\" \ntestified that Petitioner squeezed her thigh several times and where \nDetective Jeff Ackley testified to witnessing and video-taping the \nincident. Ackley testified that while he video-taped the entire incident, \ndue to a malfunction, the part where Petitioner was supposedly \ntouching the alleged \"victim\" was not recorded. The indictment in \nPetitioner's case informed him of alleged offenses that he would not \nhave to defend. Another fact that confirms the lack of constitutionally \nrequired notice, lack of unanimity, and violation of Petitioner's Sixth \nAmendment Apprendi claim is the material disagreement between what \nthe Court of Appeals claims are the facts supporting Count 16 and the \nfacts prosecutors assert support Count 16. The Court of Appeals claims \nthat Count 16 is an alleged unspecified incident that occurred in \nFranklin County and prosecutors who indicted and tried the case assert \nthat the incident supporting Count 16 occurred in Marion County, \nOhio. \n \nGround Three:  Petitioner was denied his right to due process of law \nand protections against double jeopardy as guaranteed by the Fifth, \nSixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \nwhen the court allowed the state to constructively amend the indictment \nto add unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed conduct and where the \ntrial court refused a requested unanimity instruction and failed to \ninstruct the jury that the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard had \nto be applied to one factual incident and where after resentencing, \nPetitioner remains unable to plead a conviction or acquittal to Counts \n2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 and where the factual basis for \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 19 of 79  PAGEID #: 1507620 \n \nconviction cannot be determined as decided by the jury and where \nPetitioner has been resentenced for alleged crimes with which he was \nnever charged and in several counts with crimes for which he wasn't \neven convicted. \n \nSupporting Facts:  Petitioner was indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, \n17 and 18 for specific alleged incidents that occurred in Columbus, \nOhio on unknown dates but sometime  between January 1, 2002, and \nDecember 31, 2008. The alleged \"victim\" in Counts 9-18 couldn't \nprovide a date, week, month or year for any alleged assault. During trial \nPetitioner established that he did not commit the indicted crimes. \nProsecutors then added three (3) years of unindicted allegations to the \nindictment to circumvent the defense. After adding three (3) years to \nthe indictment, Petitioner was able to establish that he could not have \ncommitted any of the indicted alleged crimes because by the relevant \npart of the expanded time frame, Petitioner had never been to the \nlocations where the \"victim\" initially claimed the indicted crimes \noccurred. Prosecutors then changed the locations to Marion, Ohio, \nrather than Columbus, Ohio, to circumvent the defense. The \nindictment, jury instructions nor the verdict forms identify any specific \nfactual basis for conviction. During trial prosecutors were substituting \nother-act evidence for the charged crimes. The Court of Appeals \nconfirmed that Petitioner was ultimately being tried for factual bases \nthat were not part of the indictment. As Petitioner was able to present \nfacts to defend the accusations, prosecutors simply kept amending the \nindictment and bill of particulars mid-trial to circumvent the defense. \nAfter trial and even after resentencing, Petitioner does not know what \nalleged facts resulted in conviction for any count for which Petitioner \nis imprisoned, according to the jury's findings. The Court of Appeals \nconfirmed that the crimes for which Petitioner was convicted were not \nthe alleged crimes for which he was indicted or charged. Petitioner was \nacquitted on Count 11, which is an identical charge to Count 10; Count \n14 was indicted as the restraint involved in Count 9. The Court of \nAppeals confirmed that no evidence was presented of the indicted \nCount 9 and Count 14 incident.  The trial court permitted prosecutors \nto arbitrarily reassign the Count 14 kidnapping to Count 10.  Petitioner \nwas not indicted with any kidnapping related to Count 10. The \nindictment in Petitioner's case informed him of alleged offenses that he \nwould not have to defend. At resentencing on March 27, 2018, the trial \ncourt sentenced Petitioner on Count 15 to a consecutive term of \nimprisonment while Count 15 was repr esented by prosecutors to the \njury in closing and the instructions as being the same incident as Count \n18 for which the sentence had already been fully completed. After the \nserial amendments, the alleged victim in Counts 9-18 was still unable \nto assign a date, week, month, or even year to any of her allegations. \nThe alleged \"victim\" in Counts 9-18, who first claimed to being raped \nrepeatedly in Columbus, Ohio, between 2002 and 2008 (3 times per \nweek for years), then changing her story mid-trial to being raped in \nMarion, Ohio, in 1998, 1999, or 2000, after being confronted with her \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 20 of 79  PAGEID #: 1507721 \n \nown emails conceded she was initiating contact with Petitioner \nthroughout the years and after moving to California in 2010, contacted \nPetitioner to provide him with her updated contact information. The \nalleged victim in Counts 9-18, in  2012 requested Petitioner go [to] \nCalifornia and offered for Petitioner to stay at her residence. Petitioner \nrespectfully declined all of Ms. Melean's offers. On Count 8, the \nalleged victim was forced to change her initial story and the accusation \nto Marion, Ohio, rather than as indicted. \n \nGround Four:  Petitioner was denied his right to due process of law \nand protections against double jeopardy as guaranteed under the Fifth, \nSixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \nwhen the court failed to instruct the jury that the proof beyond a \nreasonable doubt standard had to be applied to one factual incident and \nthe jury instructions were constitutionally defective as they permitted \nthe jury to consider and convict Petitioner of alleged crimes for which \nhe was never charged, indicted or noticed [other-act] and where due to \nthe defective instructions the trial court has resentenced Petitioner for \nalleged crimes for which no factual basis can be determined but that \nwere clearly unindicted and in several counts for alleged crimes for \nwhich Petitioner wasn't even convicted. \n \nSupporting Facts:  When Petitioner established that he did not commit \nany of the indicted crimes, prosecutors mid-trial changed not only the \ndate range of the indictment to circumvent the defense, but then \nchanged the locations to completely different locations after Petitioner \nestablished that he could not have committed the indicted alleged \ncrimes because by the newly argued time frame, Petitioner had never \nbeen to the locations where the alleged crimes were supposedly \ncommitted according to the initial accounts provided by their \"victims.\" \nAs Petitioner was able to present facts to defend the accusations, \nprosecutors simply kept amending the indictment and bill of particulars \nto circumvent the defense. After trial and even after resentencing, \nPetitioner does not know what alleged facts resulted in conviction for \nany count for which Petitioner is imprisoned. Whatever they may have \nbeen, the Court of Appeals confirmed that the crimes for which \nPetitioner was convicted were not the alleged crimes for which he was \nindicted or charged. While the trial court may have invoked jurisdiction \nfor the specific offenses contained in the indictment for Counts 2, 3, 8, \n10, 14, 15, 1 6, 17 and 18, none of the specific crimes in Counts 8, 10, \n14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, for which it obtained jurisdiction were ever \npresented to the jury. The trial court denied a requested unanimity \ninstruction and the instructions allowed a non-unanimous verdict and a \nverdict upon uncharged alleged conduct. \n \nGround Five:  Petitioner was denied his rights to due process of law \nin violation of his state and federal constitutional rights as guaranteed \nto him by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \nStates Constitution when he was denied a fundamentally fair trial due \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 21 of 79  PAGEID #: 1507822 \n \nto prosecutorial misconduct and where he was tried, convicted, and \nresentenced for convictions upon the admission of other-act evidence \nthat was unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed prior to trial and which \nwas presented by prosecutors to intentionally circumvent the defenses \nto the actually indicted alleged crimes. \n \nSupporting Facts:  When Petitioner established that he did not commit \nthe indicted crimes, prosecutors mid-trial changed not only the date \nrange of the indictment to circumvent the defense but then changed the \nlocations to completely different locations after Petitioner established \nthat he could not have committed the indicted alleged crimes because \nby the newly argued time frame Petitioner had never been to the \nlocations where the alleged victims claimed initially claimed the \nassaults were supposedly committed. As Petitioner was able to present \nfacts to defend the accusations, prosecutors simply kept amending the \nindictment and bill of particulars throughout trial.  Prosecutors \ncontinuously inserted allegations that were never disclosed, never \nindicted, or charged and allegations they confirmed in trial they never \nheard of until two weeks into trial. At one point in trial prosecutors \nadvised the court and defense counsel that Petitioner would not have to \ndefend a certain charge and later, after failing to present evidence on \nwhat they indicted, claimed the incident they acknowledged Petitioner \ndidn't have to defend, was in fact one of the counts for consideration. \nAfter trial and even after resent encing, Petitioner does not know what \nalleged set of facts resulted in conviction for any crime for which \nPetitioner is imprisoned. None of the jury instructions identify or are \nconfined to one factual incident. The jury instructions are devoid of any \nidentifying fact for the jury to determine which alleged incident \npertained to any count. The Court of Appeals confirmed prosecutors \nwere substituting unindicted and uncharged allegations for alleged \ncrimes that were indicted. To this day, prosecutors are unable to \ndetermine the alleged incidents for which Petitioner is imprisoned. In \nclosing argument, prosecutors told the jury that Counts 15 through 18 \nwere \"alternate\" theories of other counts. In their sentencing \nmemorandum prosecutors told the jury the court that they \"did not rely \non a single act to support multiple convictions.\". The conflicting \nstatements confirms their inability to determine the alleged incident \npertaining to any count and due to the prosecution' s need to plug-in \nunindicted allegations to convict Petitioner, Petitioner was denied a fair \ntrial as guaranteed under the United States Constitution as his counsel \ndid not know what facts supported the counts in the indictment.  \nCounsel repeatedly moved for a mistrial and advised the trial court that \nhe was unprepared to defend any allegation prior to 2002 for Counts 9-\n18. \n \nGround Six:  Petitioner was denied his rights to due process of law as \nguaranteed to him under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the United States Constitution when he was tried and convicted for \ncrimes for which he was never charged or indicted or noticed and for \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 22 of 79  PAGEID #: 1507923 \n \nwhich the court failed to obtain subject matter jurisdiction for alleged \ncrimes that were never presented to the grand jury and that were never \npresented to Petitioner in any charging document. \n \nSupporting Facts:  Petitioner was specifically indicted in Counts 8, \n10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged crimes that specifically \noccurred in Columbus, Ohio. Petitioner was not indicted or charged \nwith any crime occurring anywhere else. As of the start of trial \nPetitioner was defending allegations that occurred in Columbus, Ohio, \nbetween 2002-2008. Once Petitioner proved he did not commit any of \nthe charged and noticed crimes, prosecutors mid-trial inserted never \nalleged allegations of incidents each occurring at a different time and \nplace than those indicted. The grand jury never heard of any of the \nalleged incidents for which Petitioner is imprisoned and Petitioner was \nnever charged by any instrument for the alleged crimes for which he is \nnow imprisoned. The indictment contained and informed Petitioner of \nspecific offenses that he would not have to defend. The Court of \nAppeals confirmed the indicted offenses were not the offenses for \nwhich Petitioner stood trial and was convicted. Prosecutors midtrial \nconceded with respect to several counts that the alleged crimes they \nwould later argue for conviction were unknown to them until after the \ncase was indicted. \n \nGround Seven:  Petitioner was denied his right to Equal Protection as \nguaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution when the Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court \nintentionally disregarded the law set by their respective courts and the \nUnited States Supreme Court in order to affirm the convictions and for \nwhich now after resentencing Petitioner is imprisoned for crimes for \nwhich he never committed and was never charged or noticed until \nmidway through his trial and in several counts for which he wasn't even \nconvicted. \n \nSupporting Facts:  The state failed to prove that the crimes occurred \nin the County and State as alleged in the indictment for Counts 8, 10, \n14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, which is a required element to be proven for \nconviction under Ohio law. The state did not prove that the alleged \ncrimes occurred \"within the time frame alleged in the indictment\" \nwhich is also a requirement under Ohio law. State statutes and case-\nlaw set the elements to be proven and then the state is required to prove \neach of those elements. The state also changed the dates and locations \nof the charges after Petitioner established that he could not have \ncommitted the crimes for which he was indicted. The trial court failed \nto instruct the jury that they had to agree on one specific set of alleged \nfacts for each count, notwithstanding counsel requesting the \ninstruction. Prosecutors amended the indictment to add three (3) years \nof unindicted and uncharged conduct which is impermissible. Due to \nthe Equal Protection challenge, Petitioner must reference at least in this \nsection that state law and federal law as applied to other defendants \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 23 of 79  PAGEID #: 1508024 \n \nunder identical facts has never allowed what has been permitted to \noccur in Petitioner's case. The holdings and rulings in Petitioner's case \nare contrary to established precedent. Any court that allows a defendant \nto be imprisoned for alleged crimes with which he was never charged \nor for which he was never convicted must violate a defendant's rights \nto equal protection as a matter of law. \n \nGround Eight:  Petitioner, an actually innocent prisoner, is imprisoned \nas a result of violations of state and federal law and his rights \nguaranteed by the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth, Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitutions. \n \nSupporting Facts:  Regarding Counts 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, \n17 and 18, Petitioner was indicted for specific and then identifiable \nalleged crimes that occurred in Columbus, Ohio, between January 1, \n2002, and December 31, 2008. For every single referenced count, the \nstate at trial presented absolutely no evidence related to the accusations \nidentified in the indictment. Under the facts of Petitioner's case, \nPetitioner believes that when evidence of a specific crime that is \nidentified in the indictment cannot be produced at trial, the failure to \npresent any evidence of each indicted and charged crime must represent \nan accused's actual innocence. With regard to Counts 2 & 3, \nprosecutors inserted a second alleged incident that was unrelated to any \nalleged conduct occurring at a different location and at a different time \nafter they realized that their corroborating witness, Shirley Koval, \ndecided to testify for the defense. Based on the jury instructions, it \ncannot be determined which set of facts the jury elected to apply to \nCounts 2 and 3. This is not a case where the indictment reflected \ntypographical errors or clerical mistakes. The Court of Appeals \nconfirmed the state was permitted to substitute other-act 404(B) \nevidence for the indicted crimes they couldn't prove. \n \nGround Nine:  Petitioner was denied his right to a unanimous jury \nverdict in Counts 2, 3, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 when the trial court \ndenied a requested jury instruction on unanimity and thereafter \ninstructed the jury in a manner where individual jurors could select \ndifferent alleged incidents for conviction that were uncharged and were \nadmitted as other-act evidence. Unanimity independently affected \nPetitioner's resentencing as Petitione r has now been resentenced to \nprison for alleged crimes for which the jury never convicted and for \nwhich prosecutors didn't even request of the jury that it consider. \n \nSupporting Facts:  Prosecutors were permitted to introduce without \nlimitation as many other-act allegations as they needed and then select \nwhat \"other-acts\" they wished to apply to any count for which they \nwere unable to prove the factual bases for the indicted crimes. Count 9 \nand Count 14, for example, were indicted as one factual incident. The \nCourt of Appeals confirmed that no evidence was presented of the \nentire alleged incident. With no evidence presented at all of the indicted \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 24 of 79  PAGEID #: 1508125 \n \nincident, Petitioner must be legally and factually innocent of that \nspecific charge. Prosecutors mid-trial claimed that Count 9 was a never \nbefore mentioned \"drugging rape\". When defense counsel objected, the \nCourt sustained the objection. At that juncture, prosecutors advised the \nCourt that the \"drugging\" rape was not part of the indictment and was \nother-act evidence. Prosecutors notified the Court and defense counsel \nthat the defense did not need to defend that charge. However, later in \ntrial, when they were unable to procure any testimony of the underlying \nindicted incident for Count[s] 9 and 14, the trial court allowed \nprosecutors to then substitute the \"drugging\" rape incident, that \nprosecutors already acknowledged was not part of the indictment and \nPetitioner did not need to defend, for the count they couldn't prove \nbased upon the evidence upon which Petitioner was indicted. With \nCount 10, the Court of Appeals confirmed that no factual incident was \nprovided in the indictment. \n \nThe only facts regarding Count 10 were that the factual incident \noccurred in Franklin County and during 2002 and 2008. The Court of \nAppeals confirmed the factual basis for Count 10 changed from \nwhatever had been indicted to an alleged incident in Marion, Ohio in \neither 1998, 1999, or 2000. The Court of Appeals confirmed Petitioner \nwas not convicted of what originally supported Count 10. During \nresentencing on March 27, 2018, the trial court could not determine \nfrom the trial transcripts, opening, closing, jury instructions or verdict \nforms, which factual incidents applied to the respective counts for \nwhich Petitioner was being resentenced. The trial court actually \nresentenced Petitioner on Counts 15 and 18, for two incidents, when \nprosecutors argued to the jury in closing that Counts 15 and 18 were \none incident. On Count 15 and 18, the trial court resentenced Petitioner \nfor two incidents, supposedly occurring in Marion, Ohio, for which \nPetitioner was never convicted. In fact, prosecutors never requested of \nthe jury that it consider the alleged incidents the court used to \nresentence Petitioner. A review of the indictment, opening statement, \nclosing argument, jury instructions and verdict forms, the only parts of \nthe record to which the jury had access, will confirm for this court that \nthe factual incident(s) used by the Court to resentence Petitioner appear \nnowhere. Petitioner was resentenced on Count 10 for what the Court of \nAppeals confirmed was an uncharged factual basis. Comparing Counts \n10 and 11, the jury may have acquitted Petitioner for whatever factual \nbasis anyone believes resulted in conviction for Count 10. For Count \n16, a review of the indictment, opening, closing, jury instructions and \nverdict forms confirms that prosecutors never even assigned an actual \nfactual basis to that count. Perhaps confirming Petitioner's unanimity \nand due process argument, the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors \ndon't agree on what facts support Count 16. The Court of Appeals \nbelieves that Count 16 was a factual incident that occurred in Franklin \nCounty while prosecutors believe Count 16 is a different incident that \noccurred in Marion County. Petitioner respectfully suggests that when \nthe Court of Appeals and the prosecutors who are the ones who indicted \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 25 of 79  PAGEID #: 1508226 \n \nand tried the case can't agree on what factual basis supports any count, \nthere is clearly a due process, sufficiency, notice, double jeopardy, fair \ntrial, and unanimity problem. A revi ew of the same documents will \nfurther confirm that for Count 17, whatever the jury elected to apply to \nthat count cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. The lack \nof unanimity impacted Petitioner's resentencing, notwithstanding any \neffort by the state courts to find that the jury's verdicts were unanimous. \nWith Counts 8 through 18, Petitioner was indicted only with alleged \ncrimes that occurred in Franklin County, Ohio, between 2002 and \n2008. After what Court of Appeals coined \"Serial Amendments\", \nprosecutors then sought conviction for alleged \"other-acts\" that \noccurred in Marion County, Ohio, between 1998 and 2001. Defense \ncounsel repeatedly sought a mistrial as he acknowledged being \nunprepared to defend any allegation prior to 2002 in Marion, Ohio. \nPetitioner had witnesses under subpoena for the locations and time \nframes identified in the indictment. Then Court of Appeals Judge Gary \nTyack [footnote omitted] during oral arguments stated: \n \n\"So, that's part of what ties in here. Counsel has to prepare for \na major trial based on what's in the indictment and bills of \nparticulars. And, in this particular situation, all of a sudden \nyou're mid-trial and the prosecution is throwing four (4) years \nof additional allegations in front of the jury and then arguing \nthat the mere number of allegations is why this guy should be \nguilty of something . . . part of what you run into is you have \nno chance to create, to even investigate an alibi defense . . . \nfor times that aren't alleged in the whole thing, you don't have \na chance to tie down and bring in other witnesses . . . to \ncontradict these folks. You just all of a sudden, you're in the \nmiddle of trial and the name of the game has changed . . . \". \n(Oral Arguments, August 23, 2016, 14 AP 679). \n \nGround Ten:   Petitioner was denied his right to trial by jury \nguaranteed under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution whereby facts forming the basis for \nconviction [footnote omitted] and sentence must be conclusively \ndetermined by a trial jury and where in Petitioner's case those facts \nwere determined by trial and appellate judges. \n \nSupporting Facts:  Prior to Petitioner's resentencing on March \n27, 2018, Petitioner filed a motion with the trial court in advance \nof the proceedings requesting of the court that it confirm the \nfactual incidents pertaining to the counts for which Petitioner was \nto be resentenced (10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18). The Court denied the \nmotion. Since resentencing was to address allied offenses, Mr. \nBenton made the same request prior to the start of the hearing since \nin order to argue allied offenses the defense needed to know what \nfacts the trial court was considering for each count. The court \nagain denied the request. The court then resentenced Petitioner to \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 26 of 79  PAGEID #: 1508327 \n \nprison for counts where the court could not determine the facts \ndecided by the jury. Ultimately, the court sentenced Petitioner to \nprison for alleged crimes that were never even presented to the \njury for conviction. Prosecutors were permitted to introduce \nwithout limitation as many other-act allegations as they needed \nand then select what \"other-acts\" they wished to apply to any count \nfor which they were unable to prove the factual bases for the \nindicted crimes. Count 9 and Count 14, for example, were indicted \nas one factual incident. The Court of Appeals confirmed that no \nevidence was presented of the entire alleged incident. Prosecutors \nmid-trial claimed that Count 9 was a never before mentioned \n\"drugging rape\". However, earlier in trial, when defense counsel \nobjected to that evidence, the Court sustained the objection. At that \njuncture, prosecutors advised the Court that the \"drugging\" rape \nwas not part of the indictment and was other-act evidence. \nProsecutors notified the Court and defense counsel that the defense \ndid not need to defend that charge. Later in trial, when they were \nunable to procure any testimony of the underlying indicted \nincident for Count 9 and 14, the trial court allowed prosecutors to \nthen substitute the \"drugging\" rape incident, that prosecutors \nalready acknowledged was not part of the indictment for what they \ncouldn't prove. With Count 10, the Court of Appeals confirmed \nthat no factual incident was provided in the indictment. The only \nfacts regarding Count 10 were that the factual incident occurred in \nFranklin County and during 2002 and 2008. The Court of Appeals \nconfirmed the factual basis for Count 10 changed from whatever \nhad been indicted to an alleged incident in Marion, Ohio, in either \n1998, 1999 or 2000. During resentencing on March 27, 2018, the \ntrial court could not determine from the trial transcripts, opening, \nclosing, jury instructions, or verdict forms, which factual incidents \napplied to the respective counts for which Petitioner was being \nresentenced. The trial court actually resentenced Petitioner on \nCounts 15 and 18, for two incidents, when prosecutors argued to \nthe jury in closing that Counts 15 and 18 were one incident. On \nCount 15 and 18, the trial court resentenced Petitioner for two \nincidents, supposedly occurring in Marion, Ohio, for which \nPetitioner was never convicted.  In fact, the record confirms that \nprosecutors never requested of the jury that it consider the alleged \nincidents the court used to resentence Petitioner. A review of the \nindictment, opening statement, closing argument, jury instructions \nand verdict forms, the only parts of the record to which the jury \nhad access, will confirm for this court that the factual incident(s) \nused by the Court to resentence Petitioner appear nowhere. \nPetitioner was resentenced on Count 10 for what the Court of \nAppeals confirmed was an uncharged factual basis. Comparing \nCounts 10 and 11, the jury may have acquitted Petitioner for \nwhatever factual basis anyone believes resulted in conviction for \nCount 10. For Count 16, a review of the indictment, opening, \nclosing, jury instructions, and verdict forms confirms that \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 27 of 79  PAGEID #: 1508428 \n \nprosecutors never even assigned an actual factual basis to that \ncount. Perhaps confirming Petitioner's unanimity, Apprendi and \ndue process argument, the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors \ndon't agree on what facts support Count 16. The Court of Appeals \nbelieves that Count 16 was a factual incident that occurred in \nFranklin County while prosecutors believe Count 1 6 occurred in \nMarion County. Petitioner respectfully suggests that when the \nCourt of Appeals and the prosecutors who are the ones who \nindicted and tried the case can't agree on what factual basis \nsupports any count, there is clearly a due process, sufficiency, \nnotice, double jeopardy, fair trial, unanimity, and Apprendi \nproblem. A review of the same documents will further confirm that \nfor Count 17, whatever the jury elected to apply to that count \ncannot be determined with any degree of certainty. The lack of \nunanimity impacted Petitioner's resentencing, notwithstanding \nany effort by the state courts to fi nd that the jury's verdicts were \nunanimous. With Counts 8 through 18, Petitioner was indicted \nonly with alleged crimes that occurred in Franklin County, Ohio \nbetween 2002 and 2008. After what Court of Appeals coined \n\"Serial Amendments\", prosecutors then sought conviction for \nalleged \"other-acts\" that occurred in Marion County, Ohio \nbetween 1998 and 2001. \n \nSecond Amended Petition, ECF No. 70, PageID 7639-62. \n \n \n The Warden\u2019s Return \n \n  Non-Cognizable Claims \n \n   V e n u e  \n \n The Warden asserts that, to the extent Petitioner is complaining of the venue of trial \n(Franklin County), his claim is not cognizable under the United States Constitution (Return, ECF \nNo. 73, PageID 13877-80).  In this  same section, the Warden argues \u201cArmengau had no federal \nconstitutional right to prove [s ic] \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 that the crimes for which he was \nconvicted were committed in Franklin County, Ohio.\u201d Id. at PageID 13879. \n \n   Other Acts Evidence  \n \n To the extent Petitioner claims \u201cother acts\u201d  evidence was improperly admitted against him, \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 28 of 79  PAGEID #: 1508529 \n \nthe Warden asserts this claim is also not cognizable. Id. at PageID 13880-81. \n \n   Improper Indictment  \n The Warden notes Petitioner\u2019s claim in Grounds Two and Six that the indictment in this \ncase \u201cfailed to inform him of the nature of the char ges, and the trial court failed to obtain subject \nmatter jurisdiction for crimes were never presented to the gr and jury or in any charging \ninstrument.\u201d (ECF No. 73, PageID 13881, quoting Second Amended Petition, ECF No. 70, PageID  \n8641-42 and 7651-52).  Noting that the Fifth Ame ndment\u2019s grand jury guarantee does not apply \nto the States, the Warden asserts this claim is non-cognizable.  (ECF No. 73, PageID 13881, citing \nHurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516, 537-538 (1884); and Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665 (1972)). \n \n   Lack of Specificity in the Indictment \n The Warden asserts Petitioner\u2019s cl aim of lack of specificity in  the indictment  is also not \ncognizable (ECF No. 73, PageID 13883-87). \n \n   Jury Instruction Error \n \n The Warden notes Petitioner cl aims in his Fourth Ground for Relief that the trial court \ncommitted error in instructing the jury and asserts jury instruction error is not ordinarily cognizable \nin habeas (ECF No. 73, PageID 13887-89). \n \n   State Law Claims  \n The Warden notes \u201cIn his seventh ground for re lief, Armengau alleges an equal protection \nviolation when the Ohio courts \u201cintentionally disregarded the law set by their respective Courts.\u201d \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 29 of 79  PAGEID #: 1508630 \n \n(ECF No. 73, PageID 13889, quoting Second Ame nded Petition, ECF No. Doc.

Id. at PageID 13889-\n90. \n    \nActual Innocence \n The Warden asserts Petitioner\u2019s actual innocen ce claim in Ground for Relief Eight is not \ncognizable in habeas. Id. at PageID 13890-91. \n \n Affirmative Defenses \n  Procedural Default \n The Warden asserts Armengau has procedurally defaulted claims in Ground One related to \nCounts 2 and 16 because they were not fairly presented to the state courts as federal constitutional \nclaims (ECF No. 73, PageID 13896).  He makes th e same assertion as to Ground Two respecting \nCounts 2, 3, and 8.  Regarding \u201cother acts\u201d evidence, the Warden asserts that claim was presented \nto the state courts as a trial court error, but is presented here as a prosecutorial misconduct claim. \nId.  \n The Warden further asserts Armengau\u2019s jury instructions  claim in Ground Four is \nprocedurally defaulted for failure to make a contemporaneous objection. Id. at PageID 13898-902. \n Petitioner asserts he raised Grounds One through Seven and Ground Nine in his \npostconviction motion for dismissal. The Tenth District held these claims were barred, at least in part, \nby Ohio\u2019s doctrine of res judicata in criminal cases.  The Warden asserts this procedural default as a \nbar (ECF No. 73, PageID 13902-04). \n As to Ground Nine on jury unanimity, the Warde n asserts it is proced urally defaulted by \nArmengau\u2019s failure to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio from denial of the claim by the Tenth \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 30 of 79  PAGEID #: 1508731 \n \nDistrict (ECF No. 73, PageID 13904-05).   \n Respondent reads Ground Ten as alleging \u201ctha t the facts purporting to form the factual \nbasis for his conviction and sentence were determined by judicial fact-finding and not by the jury.\u201d  \n(ECF No. 73, PageID 13906, citing ECF No. 70, PageID 7661-62).  Respondent asserts this claim \nis also barred by res judicata. Id.  \n The Warden also responds on the merits to Petitioner\u2019s first, seventh, ninth, and tenth \ngrounds for relief (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13907-21). \n \n Petitioner\u2019s Reply4 \n  Fair Presentation \n Petitioner first argues that he has fairly pres ented all his claims to the Ohio courts (ECF \nNo. 77, PageID 13929-32).  As relevant precedent for what constitutes \u201cfair presentation,\u201d he relies \nrepeatedly on Gartrell v. Lynaugh, 833 F. 2d 527 (5 th Cir. 1987).  There is, however, published \nprecedent from the Sixth Circuit which is thirty years newer than Gartrell and holds a claim is \nfairly presented if the petitioner \n(1) relied upon federal cases employ ing constitutional analysis; (2) \nrelied upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis; (3) \nphrased the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms \nsufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional \nright; or (4) alleged facts well  within the mainstream of \nconstitutional law. \nHand v. Houk, 871 F.3d 390, 418 (6th Cir. 2017). \n Petitioner complains that the record is incomplete: \n \n4 Petitioner timely filed his Reply on July 27, 2021 (ECF No. 77 ).  Because of its extraord inary length (226 pages). \nthe Court granted Petitioner leave to file a summary which he did on August 2, 2021 (ECF No. 81).  These two \ndocuments will be read together as Petitioner\u2019s Reply. \n \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 31 of 79  PAGEID #: 1508832 \n \nthe docket (PagelD 6914-6921) establ ishes that Petitioner filed \nmultiple Notices of Supplemental Authority and Motions for Leave \nto File Supplemental Authority, all which were granted. From what \nPetitioner has received, none\ua78f of those documents are in the record \nfiled with this Court. \n \n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13928, n. 2).  Magistrate Judge Deavers\u2019 Order for Answer required \nthe Warden to file an answer conforming to the requirements of Rule 5 of the Rules Governing \u00a7 \n2254 Cases (ECF No. 8, PageID 239).  Rule 5 does not require the Respondent to file in the habeas \ncourt a copy of everything filed in the state courts.  To the extent that something is omitted which \na petitioner believes is necessary for decision of  the case, a petitioner may move to expand the \nrecord under Habeas Rule 7. \n Petitioner complains that \u201cseveral documents from the record appear not to have been filed \nor provided to Petitioner pursuant to this Court's May 27th and/or 28th, 2021 Order (Doc. 61, 62).\u201d  \nActually ECF No. 61 strikes the appearance of  attorney John Gonzalez who purported to be \nappearing in a capacity not permi tted by this Court\u2019s Local Rules.  Petitioner cites a number of \nadditional documents he says he has not received (ECF No. 77, PageID 13929), but the record had \nnot been ordered expanded to include those docu ments as of the time the Reply was filed.  \nRegarding these documents, the Magistrate Judge ha s ordered either that the record be expanded \nto include them or that Respondent provides reference to where they appear (ECF No. 86) and the \nWarden has responded as ordered (ECF No. 92).   \n \n Petitioner\u2019s Statement of Facts \n \n The Reply next contains a Statement of F acts, which appears to be an argumentative \nsummary of the evidence from Petitioner\u2019s pe rspective (ECF No. 77, Pa geID 13932-46).  With \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 32 of 79  PAGEID #: 1508933 \n \nrespect to findings of fact, this habeas Court is bound by state court findings, including those made \nby the Tenth District Court of Appeals, unless Petitioner shows those findi ngs to be in error by \nclear and convincing evidence.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e).  That showing must be made from evidence \nalready of record in the state court proceedings.  Pinholster, supra.  That is to say, this habeas \ncourt cannot make a de novo determination of the facts.   \n Repeatedly in his Statement of Facts, Petitio ner makes assertions of fact with no record \nreference.  This violates Magistrate Judge Deavers\u2019 Order for Answer which requires \u201cAll papers \nfiled in the case thereafter [after filing of the State Court Record] by each party shall include record \nreferences to the PAGEID number.\u201d  (ECF No. 8, PageID 240).  At PageID 13935-36, Petitioner  \npurports to repeat comments made  to the media by a Major Randy Ca ryer of the Marion Police.  \nAt PageID 13937, n.8, he purports to present facts that occurred September 17, 2008, in a court in \nMarion, Ohio, involving accuser K.R.  At PageID 13938, n. 11, he asserts that \u201c[d]uring multiple \npretrial hearings prosecutors repeatedly affirmed that all the alleged incidents with regards to these \ncounts occurred in Petitioner's Columbus Office.\u201d  On the same page he asserts that accuser L.M.\u2019s \naccount of her referral to him is incorrect.   At PageID 13939, he asserts accuser L.M. \u201cwas charged \ncriminally for beating her young daughter in 2003 (Trial Exhibit H-5, Case No. 2003 CRB 8472, \nDomestic Violence Case Number).\u201d  Whether this is a reference to a trial exhibit in this case or in \nthe domestic violence case, the exhibit is not in the record. Petitioner also relies on an affidavit by \na Diane Caldwell attached to his Petition (ECF N o. 1, Ex. D. This Affidavit was not part of the \nState Court Record and this Court is therefore barred from considering it by Pinholster. \n \n   \n \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 33 of 79  PAGEID #: 1509034 \n \n Non-Cognizable Claims \n \n Petitioner asserts that he submitted his sufficiency of the evidence claim on direct appeal \nand the Tenth District elected instead to decide that claim as if it were about venue.  Petitioner \nargues his case \u201crepresents an unreasonable a pplication of federal and state law and an \nunreasonable determination of facts based on the record. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254 (d)(l) and (d)(2)\u201d (ECF \nNo. 77, PageID 13949).  That is not the correct standard.  Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), the state \ncourts\u2019 decisions on claims of federal constitutional violations are entitled to deference unless they \nare contrary to or objectively unreasonable applications of United States Supreme Court precedent.  \nOn the other hand, we do not sit as an appellate court to decide whether any state court committed \nan error of state law. Instead, we are bound by state court determinations of state law.  Bradshaw \nv. Richey, 546 U.S. 74 (2005). \n Petitioner then, under this heading of Non- Cognizable Claims argues the merits of his \nGrounds for Relief  for 159 pages as follows:  Ground One at PageID 13948-140055; Ground Two \nat PageID 14005-36; Grounds Three and Six, argue d together at PageID 14036-81; Ground Four \nat PageID 14081-86; Ground Seven at PageID  14087-91; Ground Eight at PageID 14091-95; \nGround Nine at PageID 14095-104; and Ground Ten at PageID 14105-07. \n \n \n \n \n5 Throughout these 50+ pages, Petitioner repeatedly cites to  the exhibits attached to ECF No. 54.  The Magistrate \nJudge has twice held these exhibits cannot be added to the record (ECF Nos.  64 and 71, based on Pinholster, supra.)  \nPetitioner has objected to both of those decisions. S. D. Ohio  Civ. R. 72.3 provides \u201cWhen an objection is filed to a \nMagistrate Judge\u2019s ruling on a non-case dispositive motion, the ruling remains in full force and effect unless and until \nit is (1) stayed by the Magistrate Judge or a District Judge, or (2) overruled by a District Judge.\u201d  Since the Magistrate \nJudge\u2019s Pinholster ruling remains in effect, the exhibits will not be considered in rendering this Report.   \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 34 of 79  PAGEID #: 1509135 \n \n  Exhaustion, Procedural Default, and Waiver \n \nPetitioner argues that he has exhausted all availabl e state court remedies and that he has \nneither procedurally defaulted nor waived any of his claims (ECF No. 77, PageID 14107-33). \n \n Resentencing \n \nPetitioner contends that \u201cwhatever may have been used to determine the facts for the counts \nupon which Petitioner was resentenced, was obtained from uncharged other-acts\u201d (Reply, ECF No. 77, \nPageID 14133).   \nIt appears that the trial court at  resentencing cons idered facts for \neach count that were different from the facts considered by the Court \nat the time of sentencing and wh ich were different than the facts \nconsidered by the jury for conviction. A court is without jurisdiction \nto impose a sentence for an offens e not charged in the indictment. \nUnited States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 [(2002)]. \n \nId. at PageID 14134.  And again \n \nAt resentencing on March 27, 2018, the defense requested the Court \nprovide the parties with the underl ying factual basis for each count \nfor which Appellant was convicted  so that the defense could \nproperly argue the respective sentencing issues (Doc. 28-3, PageID \n6541, Tp. 15). The trial court refu sed the request and failed to \nprovide the facts underlying each count. \n \nId. at PageID 14142. \n \n \nClaims and Issues Assertedly No t Challenged or Addressed by \nRespondent \n \n \nPetitioner asserts there are some claims he has made which Respondent has not addressed.  \n\u201cAside from some general reference Respondent does not appear to provide any specific analysis \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 35 of 79  PAGEID #: 1509236 \n \nto Petitioner's claims of Fair Trial, Prosecuto rial Misconduct, or constr uctive amendment of the \ncharging document.\u201d (ECF No. 77, PageID 14147).   \n \nAnalysis \n  \n The following table sets forth the relationships , as the Magistrate Judge understands them, \nbetween accusers, counts of the Indictment and the verdicts. \nAccuser Counts Charged Verdict \nCC 1, 2, 3 Guilty on Count 2 \u2013 sentenced \nto time served \nAcquitted on Counts  1 & 3 \nLG 4, 5 Acquitte d \nAC 6,7 Acquitte d \nKR 8 convicte d \nLM 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, \n17, 18 \nGuilty on 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 & \n18 (5 & 10 merged) \u00b6 48 \nAcquitted on 9, 11, 12, 13 \n \n \nGround One:  Conviction on Insufficient Evidence \n \nIn his First Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he was convicted on insufficient evidence \non Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.  As noted above, because Petitioner\u2019s custody on Count \n2 ended before he filed his Petition, any claims regarding that count are no longer cognizable in habeas \ncorpus and Count Two will not be considered further.  Maleng v. Cook, 490 U.S. 488 (1989). \nAn allegation that a verdict was entered upon insufficient evidence states a claim under the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Jackson v. \nVirginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979); In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970); Johnson v. Coyle, 200 F.3d \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 36 of 79  PAGEID #: 1509337 \n \n987, 991 (6th Cir. 2000); Bagby v. Sowders, 894 F.2d 792, 794 (6th Cir. 1990)(en banc).  In order \nfor a conviction to be constitutionally sound, every element of the crime must be proved beyond a \nreasonable doubt.  In re Winship, 397 U.S. at 364. \n[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the \nlight most favorable to the pros ecution, any rational trier of fact \ncould have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a \nreasonable doubt . . . .  This familiar standard gives full play to the \nresponsibility of the trie r of fact fairly to re solve conflicts in the \ntestimony, to weigh the evidence and to draw reasonable inferences \nfrom basic facts to ultimate facts.  \n \nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. at 319; Smith v. Nagy, 962 F.3d 192, 205 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting \nJackson). This standard \u201cmust be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the \ncriminal offense as defined by state law.\u201d Id. (quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 324).  This rule was \nrecognized in Ohio law at State v. Jenks , 61 Ohio St. 3d 259 (1991).  Of  course, it is state law \nwhich determines the elements of  offenses; but once the state ha s adopted the elements, it must \nthen prove each of them beyond a reasonable doubt.  In re Winship, supra.   \n In cases such as Petitioner\u2019s challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and filed after \nenactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No 104-132, 110 \nStat. 1214)(the \u201cAEDPA\u201d), two levels of deference to state decisions are required: \nIn an appeal from a denial of ha beas relief, in which a petitioner \nchallenges the constitutional sufficiency of the evidence used to \nconvict him, we are thus bound by two layers of deference to groups \nwho might view facts di fferently than we would. First, as in all \nsufficiency-of-the-evidence cha llenges, we must determine \nwhether, viewing the trial testimony  and exhibits in the light most \nfavorable to the prosecution, any ra tional trier of fact could have \nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. \nSee Jackson v. Virginia,  443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. \nEd. 2d 560 (1979). In doing so, we do not reweigh the evidence, re-\nevaluate the credibility of witnesses, or substitute our judgment for \nthat of the jury. See United States v. Hilliard, 11 F.3d 618, 620 (6th \nCir. 1993). Thus, even though we might have not voted to convict a \ndefendant had we participated in jury deliberations, we must uphold \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 37 of 79  PAGEID #: 1509438 \n \nthe jury verdict if any rational tr ier of fact could have found the \ndefendant guilty after resolving all disputes in favor of the \nprosecution. Second, even were we to conclude that a rational trier \nof fact could not have found a petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable \ndoubt, on habeas review, we must s till defer to the state appellate \ncourt's sufficiency determination as  long as it is not unreasonable. \nSee 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). \n \nBrown v. Konteh, 567 F.3d 191, 205 (6th Cir. 2009).  In a sufficiency of the evidence habeas corpus \ncase, deference should be given to the trier-of-fact's verdict under Jackson v. Virginia and then to \nthe appellate court's consideration of that verdict, as commanded by AEDPA. Tucker v. Palmer, \n541 F.3d 652 (6th Cir. 2008); accord Davis v. Lafler, 658 F.3d 525, 531 (6th Cir. 2011)(en banc); \nParker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. 37, 43 (2012).  \nWe have made clear that Jackson claims face a high bar in federal \nhabeas proceedings because they are subject to two layers of judicial \ndeference. First, on direct appeal, \"it is the responsibility of the jury \n-- not the court -- to decide what conclusions should be drawn from \nevidence admitted at trial. A reviewing court may set aside the jury's \nverdict on the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational trier \nof fact could have agreed with the jury.\" Cavazos v. Smith, 565 U. \nS. 1, ___, 132 S. Ct. 2, 181 L. Ed. 2d 311, 313 (2011) (per curiam). \nAnd second, on habeas review, \"a federal court may not overturn a \nstate court decision rejecting a sufficiency of the evidence challenge \nsimply because the federal court disagrees with the state court. The \nfederal court instead may do so only if the state court decision was \n'objectively unreasonable.'\" Ibid. (quoting Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. \n___, ___, 130 S. Ct. 1855, 176 L. Ed. 2d 678 (2010)). \n \nColeman v. Johnson, 566 U.S. 650, 651, (2012)(per curiam); Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. 37, 43 \n(2012) (per curiam).  The federa l courts do not make credibility  determinations in reviewing \nsufficiency of the evidence claims.  Brooks v. Tennessee,  626 F.3d 878, 887 (6 th Cir. 2010).  \nThompson v. Skipper, 981 F.3d 476 (6 th Cir., 2020).  \u201cTo evaluate a sufficiency-of-the-evidence \nclaim, we consider \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in th e light most favorable to the \nprosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond \na reasonable doubt.\u2019 Smith v. Nagy, 962 F.3d 192, 205 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 38 of 79  PAGEID #: 1509539 \n \n443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979)). This standard \u201cmust be applied with exp licit reference to the \nsubstantive elements of the criminal  offense as defined by state law.\u201d Id. (quoting Jackson, 443 \nU.S. at 324).\u201d \nThe state court\u2019s application \u201cmust be \u2018objectively unreasonable,\u2019 not merely wrong; even \n\u2018clear error\u2019 will not suffice.\u201d Nagy, 962 F.3d at 199 (quoting White v. Woodall, 572 U.S. 415, 419 \n(2014)). In other words, \u201crelief is available under \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2019s unreasonable-application clause \nif, and only if, it is so obvious that a clearly established rule applies to a given set of facts that there \ncould be no \u2018fairminded disagreement\u2019 on the question.\u201d Woodall, 572 U.S. at 427 (quoting \nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 103 (2011)). \nTogether, Jackson and AEDPA\u2019s two layers of deferen ce dictate that \u201ca federal court\u2019s \n\u2018review of a state-court convi ction for sufficiency of the evidence is very limited.\u2019\u201d Tackett v. \nTrierweiler, 956 F.3d 358, 367 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Thomas v. Stephenson, 898 F.3d 693, 698 \n(6th Cir. 2018)). \n A habeas court cannot consider post-trial evidence in deciding a Jackson v. Virginia claim.   \nMcDaniel v. Brown, 558 U.S. 120 (2010).   \nIn order to demonstrate that the state court's decision was based on \nan unreasonable determination of  the facts under \u00a7 2254(d)(2), a \npetitioner must both establish the \"unreasonable determination\" and \nshow \"that the resulting state court decision was 'based on' that \nunreasonable determination.\"  \n \nTitlow v. Burt, 680 F.3d 577, 585 (6 th Cir. 2012)(rev\u2019d on another issue Burt v. Titlow, 571 U.S. \n12, 20 (2013). quoting  Rice v. White, 660 F.3d 242, 250 (6th Cir. 2011). \n Petitioner does not state in the Second Am ended Petition itself what elements of the \nconvicted crimes were not supported by sufficient evidence.  However, in his Reply he claims the \nState failed to prove that the locat ion of the offenses with which he was charged was in Franklin \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 39 of 79  PAGEID #: 1509640 \n \nCounty, Ohio, as alleged in the Indictment (R eply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13949).  He asserts the \nTenth District Court of Appeals, in order \u201cto avoid reversing the convictions, . . . simply ignored \nthe sufficiency issue raised by Petitioner.\u201d  Further, he claims, the \u201clocation of the crime charged \nis a material \"fact\" that the state is required to prove.\u201d Id. citing Knight v. State, 54 Ohio State 365 \n(1896) [the location of the crime is an essential fact and essential elemen t that must be proven \nbeyond a reasonable doubt because it is the place of the commission of the offense charged]. \n Petitioner correctly notes that it is state law which determines the elements of a crime which \nmust be proven beyond a reas onable doubt to satisfy the Jackson standard (Reply, ECF No. 77, \nPageID 13950, citing In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970)).   \n Petitioner asserts he presented this location- of-the-crime claim to the Tenth District on \ndirect appeal, but that court de cided a different claim,  a location-of-the-trial claim (Reply, ECF \nNo. 77, PageID 13950-52).  \nOn appeal Armengau presented the relevant sufficiency of the evidence claim as \nAssignment of Error VI: \n[VI.] The trial court erred in denying Javier Armengau's Crim.R. 29 \nmotion for acquittal, and violated his rights to due process and a fair \ntrial when, in the absence of sufficient evidence, it convicted him of \ncounts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18. \n \nArmengau I at \u00b6 53, quoting Armengau\u2019s appellate brief (State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 8).  \nThe Brief sets forth the following Issue Presented fo r Review as to this As signment of Error: \u201cIs \na conviction based upon insufficient evidence when venue is not proved beyond a reasonable doubt \nas charged in the indictment?\u201d Id. at PageID 7730.  Thus Petiti oner himself (through counsel) \ncharacterized the issue presented as one of \u201cvenue.\u201d  \n In arguing Assignment of Error VI, Petitioner made it clear that his objection was that the \nState had presented no evidence that  the offenses alleged in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 40 of 79  PAGEID #: 1509741 \n \nwere committed in Franklin County as alleged in the indictment. Id. at PageID 7857.  That \nwas because, he claimed, \"\u2019Venue\u2019\" has two applications-locale and element. Locale venue \nis governed by R.C. 2901.12. But that statut e has no impact on element venue. Element \nvenue is controlled by the i ndictment and the evidence,\u201d Id. at PageID 7859, relying on \nState v. Hampton, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24 (2012). \n The Tenth District decided Assi gnment of Error VI as follows: \n  Venue \n{\u00b6 104} Appellant's sixth assignment of error asserts that appellant's \nconvictions under Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the indictment \nmust be reversed because the state failed to present evidence to \nsupport venue for those crimes as charged in the indictment, and the \ntrial court accordingly erred in denying appellant's Crim.R. 29  \nmotion made after the state rested. We disagree. \n \n{\u00b6 105} Under Crim.R. 29(A), a court \u201cshall or der the entry of a \njudgment of acquittal of one or more offenses * * * if the evidence \nis insufficient to sustain a convic tion of such offense or offenses.\u201d \nBecause a Crim.R. 29  motion questions the sufficiency of the \nevidence, \u201c[w]e apply the same standard of review to Crim.R. 29 \nmotions as we use in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d \nState v.

Legal Standards \n \n{\u00b6 106} Venue commonly refers to the appropriate place of trial for \na criminal prosecution within a state. \u201c[J]urisdiction and venue are \nnot the same, as the former denote s the power of the court to hear \nthe case and the latter denotes the situs of trial.\u201d State v. Giffin, 62 \nOhio App.3d 396, 403, 575 N.E.2d 887 (10th Dist. 1991) , citing \nState v. Loucks , 28 Ohio App.2d 77, 274 N.E.2d 773 (4th Dist. \n1971). Proper venue insures th at \u201cthe state [does not] \nindiscriminately [seek] a favorable location for trial or [select] a site \nthat might be an inconvenience or disadvantage to the defendant.\u201d \nState v. Meridy, 12th Dist. No. CA2003-11-091, 2005-Ohio-241, \n2005 WL 123993, \u00b6 12 , quoting State v. Gentry , 61 Ohio Misc.2d \n31, 34, 573 N.E.2d 220 (1990) . The fact that venue is not a \nrestriction on territorial jurisdiction is underscored by the provisions \nof Crim. R. 18(B) and R.C. 2901.12(K), which provide for a change \nof venue if the trial court finds th at a fair and impartial jury cannot \nbe seated in the court where the action is pending. \n \n{\u00b6 107} Because venue is neither a jurisdictional nor a material \nelement of a criminal offense, the i ndictment is onl y required to \ncontain an allegation that the offense was committed within the \njurisdiction of the court. State v. Andrews, 148 Ohio App.3d 92, 772 \nN.E.2d 167 (10th Dist. 2002) . Even when multiple offenses are \nalleged in an indictment, an indictment is not rendered invalid where \nthe \u201cplace has been stated once therein.\u201d State v. Williams, 53 Ohio \nApp.3d 1, 557 N.E.2d 818 (10th Dist. 1988) . While venue is not a \nmaterial element of the offense as charged, it is a fact that the state \nmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt unless waived by a criminal \ndefendant. State v. Hampton, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, 2012-Ohio-5688, \n983 N.E.2d 324, \u00b6 22; State v.

Jackson , 141 Ohio St.3d 171, \n2014-Ohio-3707, 23 N.E.3d 1023, \u00b6 144. \n \n{\u00b6 108} The indictment in the present case alleged for each count \nthat the criminal conduct occurred \u201cwithin the county of Franklin.\u201d \n(May 20, 2013 Indictment, Counts 1 through 18.) Appellant argues \nthat for all but three of the counts for which he was convicted, the \nstate failed to prove venue because it introduced no evidence at all \nthat the crimes occurred in Franklin County: for Counts 8 (gross \nsexual imposition, K.R.), 10 (rape, L.M.), 14 (kidnapping, L.M.), \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 42 of 79  PAGEID #: 1509943 \n \nand 15, 17, and 18 (sexual battery, L.M.), the only evidence heard \nplaced the offenses in Marion County. In contrast, for Counts 2 and \n3 (public indecency and gross sexual imposition, C.C.), and Count \n16 (sexual battery, L.M.), appellant concedes on appeal that the \nevidence supported venue in Franklin County. At the close of the \nstate's case, the defense moved, unsuccessfully, for a Crim.R. 29 \nacquittal for those incidents for wh ich the evidence established the \nlocation as Marion County. Appellan t argues that the trial court \nerred when it denied his Crim.R. 29 motion. \n \n{\u00b6 109} The state responds that any deficiency in the indictment was \ncured by subsequent amendment of either the indictment or the bill \nof particulars. We disagree. It is the language of the indictment that \ndefines the venue for which the state bears the burden of proof. \nHampton, supra, at \u00b6 23 . As stated above, the original indictment \nspecified Franklin County as venue  for all crimes. The state never \namended the venue allegation in the indictment. Therefore, the state \nhad to prove that venue was proper in Franklin County. \n \n{\u00b6 110} The state also argues that all crimes took place as part of a \ncourse of criminal conduct across several jurisdictions, including \nFranklin County, establishing venue in Franklin County under the \ncourse of criminal conduct terms of R.C. 2901.12(H). We conclude \nthat the state presented sufficient evidence to prove venue under the \ncourse of criminal conduct provisions in R.C. 2901.12(H). \n \n2. Venue and Course of Criminal Conduct\u2013R.C. 2901.12(H) \n \n\u00b6 111} When an offender, as part of a course of criminal conduct, \ncommits offenses in different jurisdictions, the offender may be tried \nfor all of those offenses in any jurisdiction in which one of those \noffenses or any element of one  of those offenses occurred. R.C. \n2901.12(H). To establish a course of criminal conduct, the statute \nprovides in relevant part: \n \n(H) * * * Without li mitation on the evid ence that may be \nused to establish the course of criminal conduct, any of the \nfollowing is prima-facie eviden ce of a course of criminal \nconduct: \n(1) The offenses involved the same victim, or victims of \nthe same type or from the same group. \n(2) The offenses were committed by the offender in the \noffender's same employment, or capacity, or relationship to \nanother. \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 43 of 79  PAGEID #: 1510044 \n \n(3) The offenses were commit ted as part of the same \ntransaction or chain of events, or in furtherance of the same \npurpose or objective. \n(4) The offenses were committed in furtherance of the same \nconspiracy. \n(5) The offenses involved the same or a similar modus \noperandi. \n(6) The offenses were committed along the offender's line \nof travel in this state, regard less of the offender's point of \norigin or destination. \n \nR.C. 2901.12(H). \n \n{\u00b6 112} \u201cR.C. 2901.12(G) and (H) are statutory reflections of the \nmodern mobility of criminals to perform unlawful deeds over vast \ngeographical boundaries.\u201d State v. Draggo , 65 Ohio St.2d 88, 90, \n418 N.E.2d 1343 (1981) . Consistent with this multi-county venue, \n\u201ca grand jury of one county has au thority to indict on offenses \noccurring in other counties provided  that those offenses are part of \na course of criminal conduct.\u201d State v. Ahmed, 8th Dist. No. 84220, \n2005-Ohio-2999, 2005 WL 1406282, \u00b6 11 . The Supreme Court of \nOhio confirmed the law as stated in Ahmed when it decided Jackson \nat \u00b6 131: \n \nThere is no constitutional or statutory provision that \nprohibited the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury from indicting \nJackson for offenses that o ccurred in Erie and Lorain \nCounties as part of a course  of criminal conduct that \nincluded crimes within Cuyahoga County. R.C. 2901.11  \nand 2901.12 permit a grand jury to indict an offender for \noffenses that occurred outside the county, provided that the \noffenses are part of the same  course of criminal conduct \nthat took place in the county in which the grand jury \nresides. \n \n{\u00b6 113} The present case involves a series of offenses that fit four \nof the criteria enumerated in R.C. 2901.12(H). The victims were \u201cof \nthe same type, or from the same group\u201d under R.C. 2901.12(H)(1), \nbecause they are associated with appellant's law practice as clients, \nrelatives of clients, or employees. The offenses were committed \u201cin \nthe offender's same employment, or capacity, or relationship to \nanother\u201d under R.C. 2901.12(H)(2), again based on the centrality of \nappellant's law practice in his selection of victims. The offenses \ninvolved \u201cthe same or similar modus operandi\u201d under R.C. \n2901.12(H)(5), based on the grooming and exploitation of \nvulnerable female clients or relatives of clients. Finally, the offenses \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 44 of 79  PAGEID #: 1510145 \n \nwere committed in furtherance of  the same purpose or objective \n(sexual gratification). R.C. 2901.12(H)(3). \n \n{\u00b6 114} A similar case involving abuse of clients in a professional \npractice is persuasively on point. In Ahmed, the defendant, a \nlicensed obstetrician and gynecologi st, operated medical offices in \nseveral counties. The grand jury in Cuyahoga Count y returned an \nindictment charging him with multiple counts of rape, sexual \nimposition, and sexual battery involving 37 former patients. The \nindictment specified that the offenses occurred at Ahmed's offices \nin Cuyahoga, Summit, and Geauga counties. After disposing of the \npreliminary question of whether the grand jury could return an \nindictment addressing the out-of-county crimes, the Eighth District \nCourt of Appeals found that trial venue in Cuyahoga County for all \noffenses was appropriate:  \u201cThe evidence at trial revealed that all of \nthe victims were Ahmed's patients, all of the offenses occurred at \nhis medical offices while the victims were seeking medical care \nfrom him, and while situated in a vulnerable position. Further, each \nvictim identified the office location where the offense(s) occurred. \nBased on this evidence, we find that the State adequately proved that \nvenue was proper.\u201d Ahmed at \u00b6 18. \n \n{\u00b6 115} Ahmed presented the same type of course of criminal \nconduct that the state alleges here. Based on this precedent and \nanalysis of the applicable statutes governing venue, we conclude \nthat the state proved venue was proper in Franklin County for \nCounts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the indictment. \n \n{\u00b6 116} Citing Hampton, appellant argues that because the \nindictment alleged the conduct associated with Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, \n17, and 18 occurred in Frank lin County, the state could only \nestablish venue by proving that the alleged conduc t occurred in \nFranklin County. We do not read Hampton so restrictively. \nHampton involved a situation where al l of the alleged criminal \nconduct occurred outside the county where the case was venued. \nTherefore, R.C. 2901.12(H)  was not applicable. Moreover, the \nHampton court noted that \u201c[t]he Ge neral Assembly has given the \nstate considerable flexibility with  respect to esta blishing venue,\u201d \nciting R.C. 2901.12(G) as an example. Hampton at \u00b6 23 . See also \nState v. Young , 2017-Ohio-1400, 89 N.E.3d 175, \u00b6 15\u201316  (finding \nno authority for proposition that an indictment must include \u201ccourse \nof conduct\u201d language when the state intends to proceed under R.C. \n2901.12(H)). Lastly, appellant was on notice that the state would \nestablish venue by proving the conduct occurred in Franklin County \n\u201cor otherwise properly venued under R.C. 2901.12, the defendant, \nas part of a criminal cour se of conduct as defined in R.C. \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 45 of 79  PAGEID #: 1510246 \n \n2901.12(H)(1), which encompassed at least, Franklin and Marion \nCounties, Ohio.\u201d (June 1, 2014 B ill of Particulars at 6.) As \npreviously noted, the indictment a lleged and the state proved, that \nsome of the alleged criminal c onduct occurred in Franklin County \nand that the other offenses in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 were \ncommitted pursuant to a course of  criminal conduct as defined in \nR.C. 2901.12(H). \n \n3. Conclusion \n{\u00b6 117} For all of these reasons, we overrule appellant's sixth \nassignment of error. \n \nArmengau I, supra. \n \n Armengau appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio from this decision, represented by the \nsame Assistant State Public Defe nder who had represented him be fore the Tenth District.  He \npleaded two relevant Propositions of Law: \nFirst Proposition of Law: This Court's decision in Hampton does \nnot allow a defendant to be convicted of a crime when the indictment \nasserts the criminal conduct occurred in a specific county, and does \nnot reference R.C. 2901.12, and all evidence presented demonstrates \nthat the crime occurred in a different county than that named in the \nindictment. RC. 2901.12; State v. Hampton ,134 Ohio St.3d 447, \n2012-Ohio-5688, 983 N.E.2d 324. \n \nSecond Proposition of Law: Revised Code 2901.12(1-1) is \nunconstitutional and violates Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio \nConstitution which requires that a criminal act be tried in the county \nin which it occurred. R.C. 2901.12(H); Article l, Section 10, Ohio \nConstitution. \n \n(Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 13, PageID 8041).  \nArmengau admitted that the Ohio \u201cintermediate a ppellate courts remain vexed by the import of \nHampton and the precise requirements and legal eff ects set forth therein\u201d and that the Tenth \nDistrict had held Armengau\u2019s argument was \u201ctoo restrictive a reading of Hampton.\u201d  Id. at PageID \n8046.  He asked the Supreme Court of Ohio \u201caccept this issue to determine whether an indictment \nthat unequivocally represents a crime occurred in one county can be cured by R.C.2901.12.\u201d  As \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 46 of 79  PAGEID #: 1510347 \n \nan alternative he asked the court to declare Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.12(H) as interpreted by the \nTenth District to be a violation of the Ohio Constitution. Id. at PageID 8047-48.  The Ohio Supreme \nCourt denied review in a form entry, State v. Armengau, 151 Ohio St. 3d 1511 (2018). (State Court \nRecord, ECF No. 72, Ex. 14). \n Petitioner presented this issue again to a different panel of the Tenth District on appeal \nfrom denial of his Presentence Mo tion for Acquittal on Resentenci ng.  The Tenth District again \ndenied relief based on res judicata, law of the case, and the failure  of Armengau to persuade the \nappellate court that its prior decision on \u201cvenue\u201d was in error.  It noted that:  \n{\u00b6 16} These are issues appellant could have ra ised in a motion to \nreconsider in Armengau, 2017-Ohio-4452.4 Appellant did not file a \nmotion to reconsider this court's decision in Armengau, 2017-Ohio-\n4452. \n \n{\u00b6 17} Appellant did, however, file an appeal with the Supreme \nCourt. The Supreme Court did not accept his appeal for review. See \nState v. Armengau, 2018-Ohio-365. The Supreme Court also denied \nappellant's subsequent motion requesting reopening of appeal. See \nState v. Armengau , 2018-Ohio-1600. The Supreme Court denied \nanother motion filed by appella nt on April 30, 2018. Finally, the \nSupreme Court denied appellant's July 2, 2018 motion requesting \nthe court grant motion and supplemental notice. \n \n{\u00b6 18} Finally, we note appellant has made another attempt to raise \nthe same issues raised in this app eal and in his dir ect appeal in his \nappeal of the resentencing now pending before this court in State v. \nArmengau, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-300. \n \nArmengau II.  To the extent Petitioner believes Armengau I is a misinterpretation of Hampton, he \nhas offered both the Tenth Distri ct and the Ohio Supreme Court ample opportunity to accept his \nview, without any success.  This Court is therefore bound by the Tenth District\u2019s interpretation of \nHampton.  Bradshaw, supra.   \n \u201cVenue\u201d is a term that has, in recent years, come into common usage in American English \nto denote where some event has occurred or will occur.  Thus Americans discuss \u201csports venues\u201d \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 47 of 79  PAGEID #: 1510448 \n \nor \u201cconcert venues\u201d in common parlance.  Brian Garner writes that the word in legal usage means \n\u201c(1) originally the neighborhood from which a jury  had to be selected; (2) the county or other \nterritorial unit over which a trial court had jurisdiction; or (3) the proper or a possible place for the \ntrial of a lawsuit.\u201d  Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 2nd, at 916 (Oxford Univ. Press \n1995).  None of these meanings fi ts comfortably with the claims  Petitioner makes in his First \nGround for Relief.  Indeed, he criticizes the Tenth District for deciding what it labeled as a venue \nissue, but it was the same issue he had himself labeled \u201cvenue\u201d in his appellate brief.   \n Instead of arguing about venue in any of th ese senses, Armengau is arguing about venue \nin the sense of location of the offense.  In sum, he claims that the location of the offense as charged \nin the indictment is a material or substantiv e element which must be proved beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.  There is no dispute that the conduct charged as criminal  in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and \n18 occurred (if at all 6) in Marion County, Ohio, and not in Franklin Count y, Ohio.  Nor is there \nany dispute that the indictment charged this co nduct occurred in Franklin County and was never \namended.  The State did provide an  amended bill of particulars pr ior to trial that alleged conduct \nin Marion County, but did not amend the indictment. \n Under Jackson v. Virginia, supra , the State must prove all the substantial or material \nelements of a charged crime by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  Petitioner correctly asserts that \nit is state law which determines what are the elements.  (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13950, citing \nWinship).   \nArmengau relies principally on State v. Hampton, 134 Ohio St.3d 447 (2012).  Hampton \nwas indicted on charges he commit ted a home invasion and inflicted serious injuries in Franklin \n \n6 The jury found, applying the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, that the conduct occurred.  Petitioner does not \nconcede that point and the Magistrate Judge respects his denial with the phrase \u201cif at all.\u201d  It is not an expression of \npersonal doubt, which would be inappropriate. \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 48 of 79  PAGEID #: 1510549 \n \nCounty, Ohio.  During the State\u2019s ca se in chief, the lead  detective testified \u201che had just learned \nthat these offenses had occurred in Fairfield County, not in Franklin County.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 5.  The court \ntook a motion for acquittal under Ohio R. Crim P. 29 under advisement, but granted it after defense \nrested without presenting evidence, holding the St ate had failed to prove \u201cvenue.\u201d  The State \nappealed, but the Tenth District held the State had no right to appeal a judgment of acquittal.  The \nSupreme Court of Ohio granted review on thre e propositions of law proposed by the State and \ndecided: \n{\u00b6 18} In the state's second proposi tion of law, the state suggests \nthat lack of venue cannot re sult in an \u201cacquittal\u201d under Crim.R. 29 \nbecause motions under that rule are limited to claims of lack of proof \nof one or more material elements  of the offense. Venue, the state \nargues, is not a material element of the offense. \n \n{\u00b6 19} The Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10  provides an \naccused the right to \u201ca speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the \ncounty in which the offense is alleged to have been committed.\u201d We \nhave stated, \u201c Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution  fixes \nvenue, or the proper place to try a criminal matter * * *.\u201d State v. \nHeadley, 6 Ohio St.3d 475, 477, 453 N.E.2d 716 (1983) . We have \nalso stated, \u201cA conviction may not be had in a criminal case where \nthe proof fails to show that the crime alleged in the indictment \noccurred in the county where the indictment was returned.\u201d State v. \nNevius, 147 Ohio St. 263, 71 N.E.2d 258 (1947), paragraph three of \nthe syllabus. We have also stated that \u201cit is not essential that the \nvenue of the crime be proven in express terms, provided it be \nestablished by all the facts and ci rcumstances in the case, beyond a \nreasonable doubt, that the crime wa s committed in the county and \nstate as alleged in  the indictment.\u201d State v. Dickerson, 77 Ohio St. \n34, 82 N.E. 969 (1907), paragraph one of the syllabus. \n \n{\u00b6 20} Under Article I, Section 10  and R.C. 2901.12, evidence of \nproper venue must be presented in order to sustain a conviction for \nan offense. Headley at 477, 453 N.E.2d 716, citing State v. Draggo, \n65 Ohio St.2d 88, 90, 418 N.E.2d 1343 (1981); State v. Gribble, 24 \nOhio St.2d 85, 263 N.E.2d 904 (1970); Nevius, 147 Ohio St. 263, 71 \nN.E.2d 258. \n \n{\u00b6 21} In Nevius, we affirmed the decision of the court of appeals \nas it related to the finding of insufficient evidence relating to venue, \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 49 of 79  PAGEID #: 1510650 \n \nbut we then reversed the order of the court of appeals remanding the \nmatter for a new trial, instead ruling that the trial court should have \ngranted a directed verdict in favor of the defendant on count four of \nthe indictment, and we discharged the defendant accordingly on that \ncount. Id. at 266\u2013267, 287, 71 N.E.2d 258.  This common-law \nconcept of a directed verdict ha s now been memorialized through \nCrim.R. 29. \n \n{\u00b6 22} In arguing that insufficient proof of venue does not justify \nacquittal, the state would limit application of Crim.R. 29  to \nsituations in which the elements of the offense have not been proved \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The plain language of the rule itself does \nnot distinguish between  \u201cmaterial\u201d elemen ts and \u201cimmaterial\u201d \nelements. Instead, the plain language of the rule itself simply \nindicates that a judgment of acquittal is ap propriate when \u201cthe \nevidence is insufficient to sustai n a conviction of such offense or \noffenses.\u201d If the state fails to produce evidence of proper venue, then \nthe evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense \nor offenses. But, as stated above, Crim.R. 29 does not limit itself to \nelements or \u201cmaterial\u201d elements of the offense. The question is \nwhether \u201cthe evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such \noffense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Most jurisdictions place some burden \nupon the state to prove venue\u2014whether it be beyond a reasonable \ndoubt, by a preponderance of the ev idence, or by some evidence\u2014\nbecause it is a fact of the crime. See 4 LaFave, Criminal Procedure, \nSection 16.1(c), at 714 (3d Ed.2007). And Ohio has required proof \nof venue beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction. Knight \nv. State, 54 Ohio St. 365, 377, 43 N.E. 995 (1896) ; Dickerson, 77 \nOhio St. 34, 82 N.E. 969, paragraph one of the syllabus; Nevius, 147 \nOhio St. 263, 71 N.E.2d 258. \n \n{\u00b6 23} Crim.R. 29 is clear and straightforward and does not limit its \napplication to elements of the offense alone\u2014the trial judge may \ngrant an acquittal when there is a failure of proof  to sustain a \nconviction. Nothing in the Constitution, statutes, or rules requires a \ndefendant to raise the issue of venue  before trial. The state has the \nobligation to ensure the proper venue within the indictment, for the \nindictment puts the defendant on no tice and the state to its proof. \nThe General Assembly has given th e state considerable flexibility \nwith respect to establishing venue  when the state cannot determine \nthe precise location at which the offense took place. See, e.g., R.C. \n2901.12(G), which allows for an offense that was committed in any \nof two or more jurisdictions to  be charged in any of those \njurisdictions. \n \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 50 of 79  PAGEID #: 1510751 \n \n{\u00b6 24} Over a century of well-established jurisprudence clearly \nmandates that a motion for judgment of acquittal must be granted \nwhen the evidence is insufficient for reasonable minds to find that \nvenue is proper. Here, it is undisputed that all of the events in \nquestion occurred in Fairfield C ounty, not Franklin County, as \nalleged in the indictment. Under Headley, Crim.R. 29, R.C. 2901.12, \nand the well-established common-law rule set forth in cases like \nNevius, a judgment of acquittal may be entered when the state has \nfailed at trial to prove the venue of the offense as alleged in the \nindictment. \n \nHampton, supra. \n \n Hampton conflates under the label \u201cvenue\u201d the questions of the proper place for trial and \nlocation of the offense, but does hold location of th e offense as alleged in the indictment must be \nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.  On the othe r hand, it does recognize th e General Assembly, \npresumably constitutionally, \u201chas  given the state considerable flexibility with respect to \nestablishing venue when the state cannot determine the precise location at which the offense took \nplace.\u201d  The opinion provides no discussion of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.12(H), the statute relied \non by the Tenth District in this case. \n What is the proper application of Hampton to this case?    That is a question of Ohio, not \nfederal, law and on questions of state law, federal habeas courts are bound by state court rulings.  \nBradshaw, supra. The Tenth District plainly understood Hampton as relevant binding precedent, \nbut did not believe the decision sh ould be read as narrowly as Ar mengau insisted.  It noted the \nHampton court had recognized the flexibility the General Assembly had given counties in \ncomplying with the Ohio Constitution in course -of-conduct/multiple county situations and found \nOhio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.12(H) applied in  this case.  It also noted that Hampton was a one \noffense indictment, not involving course of cond uct, where all the charged misconduct occurred \nin a county other than the county of indictment. \n Hampton was in part an enforcement of the Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10 which \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 51 of 79  PAGEID #: 1510852 \n \nprovides an accused the right to \u201ca speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county in which \nthe offense is alleged to have been committed.\u201d  While the speedy and public trial and impartial \njury requirements are embodied in the Sixth Amendment and all of these are made applicable to \nthe States by the Fourteenth Amendment, the U.S. Constitution says nothing about trial in the same \ncounty where the offenses are alleged to have occurred 7.  Nor can Armengau\u2019s argument be \nsuccessfully construed as a federal right to grand jury indictment for state crimes, because no such \nright exists.  The Grand Jury Clause of the Fift h Amendment is not applic able to the States.  \nHurtado v. California , 110 U.S. 516 (1884); Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 687-88 n. 25 \n(1972); Gerstein v. Pugh,  420 U.S. 103 (1975);  Williams v. Haviland , 467 F.3d 527 (6 th Cir.  \n2006)(Apprendi does not change this result). \n Petitioner has no federal due process right to ha ve this Court enforce his Ohio Article I, \u00a7 \n10, right.  Failure to abide by state law is  not itself a const itutional violation.  Roberts v. City of \nTroy, 773 F.2d 720 (6 th Cir. 1985). Violation by a State of  its own procedural rules does not \nnecessarily constitute a violation of due process. Bates v. Sponberg, 547 F.2d 325 (6th Cir. 1976); \nRyan v. Aurora City Bd. of Educ. , 540 F.2d 222, 228 (6 th Cir. 1976).  \u201cA state cannot be said to \nhave a federal due process obligation to follow all of its procedures; such a system would result in \nthe constitutionalizing of every state rule, and would not be administrable.\u201d  Levine v. Torvik, 986 \nF.2d 1506, 1515 (6th Cir. 1993). \n There is no federal constitutional right to be tried for a crime in the same county where a \ngrand jury charges the crime occurred.  Armengau\u2019s First Ground for Relief should be dismissed \nas not cognizable in federal habeas corpus.   \n \n \n7 The Vicinage Clause requires that federal criminal trials be  held in the judicial district in which they are alleged to \nhave occurred and that those districts be determined in advance. \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 52 of 79  PAGEID #: 1510953 \n \nGround Two:  Lack of Notice of Crimes Charged \n \n In his Second Ground for Relief in the Sec ond Amended Petition, Armengau claims he was \ndenied due process of law when the indictment did not adequately  inform him of the \u201cspecific \ncrimes\u201d he was charged with comm itting in that the prosecutors changed the date range and the \nlocation(s) of the offense(s). \n In the Reply, however, Armengau labels Ground Two as being about  \u201cNotice, Defective \nIndictment & Other Acts\u201d (ECF No. 77, PageID 14005).  He argues  \nWhat Ohio law doesn't permit is the use of \"other acts\" to form the \nfactual basis of any charged crime. By Respondent's own \nadmission8, the convictions in Petition er's case cannot stand as the \nfactual basis for each crime was established by the introduction and \nsubstitution of \"other act\" evidence. \n \n* * *  \n \nRespondent fails to note for this Court where Petitioner was \nprovided notice that he would have to defend allegations for Counts \n8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 that occurred in Marion, Ohio or that for \ncounts 10 and 14 through 18, that he would have to defend \nallegations in 1998, 1999 or 2000. \n \nId.  \n Petitioner begins his argument in the Reply on this claim by alleging he was subjected to a \nconstructive amendment of the indictment (ECF No. 77, PageID  14006).  He asserts that under \nboth Ohio law and the United States Constitution, constructive amendments are forbidden.  This \nargument misses an important distinction.  The Ohio Constitution requires a grand jury indictment \nfor state felonies to be tried in Ohio courts.  Likewise the Fifth Amendment of the United States \nConstitution requires grand jury indictment for federal felonies to be tried in federal courts.  The \n \n8 Petitioner gives no record reference for this alleged admission. \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 53 of 79  PAGEID #: 1511054 \n \nprohibition against constructive am endment enforces the grand jury requirement in each set of \ncourts.  However, the Fifth Amendment grand jury clause is not applicable to the States.  Hurtado \nv. California , 110 U.S. 516 (1884); Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 687-88 n. 25 (1972); \nGerstein v. Pugh,  420 U.S. 103 (1975);  Williams v. Haviland , 467 F.3d 527 (6 th Cir.  \n2006)(Apprendi does not change this result).  Nor is the Ohio grand jury requirement enforceable \nin habeas corpus.  Federal habeas corpus is available only to correct federal constitutional \nviolations.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); Wilson v. Corcoran, 562 U.S. 1 (2010); Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S. \n764, 780 (1990); Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209 (1982), Barclay v. Florida, 463 U.S. 939 (1983).   \nArmengau\u2019s constructive amendment argument  is not cognizable be cause constructive \namendments do not violate any federal right to and jury indictment in state courts. \n Petitioner notes that his \u201cother  acts\u201d argument under this Ground for Relief is not about the \nuse of such evidence to convict a defendant by proving he has a bad character or has a propensity \nto crime, the usual argument against \u201cother acts\u201d evidence.  Rather, his clai m here is that \u201cother \nact\u201d evidence was substituted mid-trial for eviden ce of the crimes charged in the indictment \n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14008-36). \n Respondent asserts Armengau has procedurally defaulted in presenting Ground Two as a \nfederal constitutional claim to the Supreme Cour t of Ohio (Return, EC F No. 73, PageID 13896).  \nPetitioner responds that \u201c[t]he \u2018other-act\u2019 issues were raised in Propositions III, IV, V and VI to \nthe Ohio Supreme Court.\u201d  (Reply, ECF No. 77 , PageID 14007).  Those propositions of law as \npleaded are as follows: \nThird Proposition of Law:  If the purpose for which 404(B) \nevidence is sought to be introdu ced is already established by \nproperly admitted evidence in the State's case-in-chief, then Evid.R. \n403 precludes admission of those prior bad acts.

Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d \n1278 \n \nSixth Proposition of Law: When the State cannot provide a \ndefendant with accurate informa tion regarding the timeframe in \nwhich the alleged criminal conduct occurred, where it occurred, or \nthe conduct at issue until its witness has testified at trial, a defendant \nis misled and prejudiced, and is entitled to mistrial. Crim.R. 7(D).  \n \n(Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 13, PageID  8041-\n42).  On their face, these Propositions of Law do not present federal constitutional claims.  Instead, \nthey exhibit the usual objections to other acts evid ence, to wit, that it is  \u201cpropensity\u201d evidence, \nused to convict a defendant because of his or her bad character.  All of the case law cited is Ohio \ncase law.  In the body of his Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, Armengau argued \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 55 of 79  PAGEID #: 1511256 \n \nPropositions of Law Three, Four, and Five together. Id. at PageID 8048-53.  Nowhere in that \nargument does he claim the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence was substituted for the indicted conduct.  Instead, \nthe argument is all in terms of the propensity impact of other acts evidence.  The Federal \nConstitution is not mentioned at all nor are any federal cases cited.   \n In arguing the Sixth Proposition of Law, Arme ngau states \u201c[i]n his direct appeal, Mr. \nArmengau asserted that this course of litigation functioned to deny him his rights to a fair trial, \ndue process of law, and doubl e jeopardy protections.\u201d  Id. at PageID 8056.  Nowhere else in this \nargument does he mention any fe deral right or cite any fede ral case law or state case law \nreferencing the United States Constitution. \n To preserve a federal constitutional claim for presentation in habeas corpus, the claim must \nbe \"fairly presented\" to the state courts in a way which provides them with an opportunity to \nremedy the asserted constitutional violation, including presenting both the legal and factual basis \nof the claim.  Williams v. Anderson, 460 F.3d 789, 806 (6th Cir. 2006); Levine v. Torvik, 986 F.2d \n1506, 1516 (6 th Cir.), cert. denied, 509 U.S. 907 (1993), overruled in part on other grounds by \nThompson v. Keohane,  516 U.S. 99 (1995); Riggins v. McMackin,  935 F.2d 790, 792 (6 th Cir. \n1991). The claim must be fairly presented at every stage of the state appellate process. Wagner v. \nSmith, 581 F.3d 410, 418 (6th Cir. 2009). \nA claim is fairly presented if the petitioner \n(1) relied upon federal cases employ ing constitutional analysis; (2) \nrelied upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis; (3) \nphrased the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms \nsufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional \nright; or (4) alleged facts well  within the mainstream of \nconstitutional law. \n \nHand v. Houk, 871 F.3d 390, 418 (6th Cir. 2017) ; Franklin v. Rose, 811 F.2d 322, 326 (6 th  Cir. \n1987); accord, Whiting v. Birt, 395 F.3d 602 (6th Cir. 2005); McMeans v.

Slaughter v. Parker, 450 F.3d 224, 236 (6 th \nCir. 2006); Franklin v. Rose,  811 F.2d 322, 326 (6 th Cir. 1987); McMeans v. Brigano, 228 F.3d \n674, 681 (6th Cir. 2000), citing Petrucelli v. Coombe, 735 F.2d 684, 688-89 (2nd  Cir. 1984). Mere \nuse of the words \u201cdue process and a fair tr ial by an impartial jury\u201d are insufficient. Slaughter v. \nParker, 450 F.3d 224, 236 (6 th Cir. 2006); Blackmon v. Booker , 394 F.3d 399, 400 (6 th Cir. \n2004)(same). \u201cA lawyer need not develop a cons titutional argument at length, but he must make \none; the words \u2018due process\u2019 are not an argument.\u201d Riggins v. McGinnis, 50 F.3d 492, 494 (7th Cir. \n1995). \n Petitioner did not fairly pres ent his convicted-on-other-acts evidence claim as a federal \nconstitutional claim to the Supreme Court of Ohio.  The claim is therefore procedurally defaulted \nand Ground Two should be dismissed.   \n \nGround Three:  Denial of Due Process and Double Jeopardy Protection by Allowing \nConstructive Amendment and Refusing Unanimity Instruction \n \n \n In his Third Ground for Relief, Petitioner cl aims he was denied due process and double \njeopardy protection when the tria l court allowed constructive am endment of the indictment and \nrefused a requested unanimity instruction.  Those are at least the issues  on the face of Ground \nThree in the Second Amended Petition.  In the Reply, however, Armengau argues Ground Three \ntogether with Ground Six. In the Sixth Ground for Relief he claims he was denied due process \n\u201cwhen he was tried and convicted for crimes for whic h he was never charged or indicted or noticed \nand for which the court failed to obtain subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d  To make matters more confusing, \nhe argues both Grounds for Relief under the label \u201cConstructive Amendment, Double Jeopardy, Jury \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 57 of 79  PAGEID #: 1511458 \n \nInstructions, Defective Indictment & Notice\u201d and then asserts \u201cThis issue is inextricably related to the \nsufficiency [of the evidence] arguments set-forth above.\u201d  (ECF No. 77, PageID 14036).   \n The combined argument on these two Grounds for Relief then occupies forty-five pages of the \nReply (PageID 14036-81).  He begins with an argu ment about a criminal defendant\u2019s entitlement to \nnotice of the \u201capproximate time frame and at minimum, the general location as to where the crime(s) \noccurred. A defendant must also be advised of what he did (conduct)\u201d Id. at PageID 14036.  Armengau \nasserts it is not only the indictment which is defective, but that no court has given him notice of the \nfacts upon which he was convicted. \u201cPetitioner has been deprived of his Constitutional right to notice \nbefore trial, during trial, during sentencing and after resentencing.\u201d  Id. at PageID 14041.   \n Petitioner then switches to his jury unanimity argument: \nA jury has a duty to unanimously agr ee to a particular  set of facts. \nUnited States v. Echeverry, 698 F.2d 375 (9th Cir. 1983). The U.S. \nConstitution does require a unanimous verdict in state prosecutions. \nA jury must be unanimous in what facts are being considered to \ndetermine guilt.  Respondent does not  dispute that as of today no \none knows what \"act or incident\" constitutes any of the crimes for \nwhich Petitioner is imprisoned. \n \n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14042).  Petitioner then argues the bill of particulars was insufficient \nto provide notice. Id. at PageID 14045-51.  He then switches back to a jury instruction argument.  \nAt PageID 14067, et seq., he raises double jeopardy issues.  Then, without any notice of a change \nof direction, Petitioner turns back to notice issues.  Id.  \nReturning to the double jeopardy claim, Armengau asserts: \nUnited States Supreme Court decisi ons are clear that the charging \ndocument itself must, on its face, protect a defendant from double \njeopardy. Such holdings confirm that the federal constitutional \nrequirement of double jeopardy prot ection is preempt ive and must \nbe reflected in the charging document. \n \n* * *  \n \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 58 of 79  PAGEID #: 1511559 \n \nClearly established federal law re quires the protection be provided \nat the inception of the filing of the criminal charge. \n \nId. at PageID 14079.  However instead of citing any Supreme Court decisions, he cites instead to State \nv. Freeman, 2010-Ohio-3714 (Ohio App. 8th Dist. 2010), and Isaac v. Grider, 211 F.3d 1269 (6th Cir. \n2000).  In a single line at the conclusion of this se ction of the Reply, he asserts without any cited \nauthority \u201cThe trial court in Petitioner's case never had jurisdiction for any alleged crime in Marion, \nOhio[,] in 1998, 1999 or 2000 because the state never charged Petitioner with any such crime.\u201d  PageID \n14081.   \n \u201c[T]here is no constitutional ri ght in a state prosecution to a grand jury indictment with \nparticular specificity.\u201d  Williams v. Haviland , 467 F.3d 527, 534 (6 th Cir.  2006) citing Rose v. \nMitchell, 443 U.S. 545, 557, n. 7 (1979).  \u201cDue process mandates only that the indictment provide \nthe defendant with \u2018fair notice of the charges agai nst him to permit adequate preparation of his \ndefense.\u2019\u201d Williams at 535, quoting Koontz v. Glossa, 731 F.2d 365, 369 (6th Cir. 1984). \n Russell v. United States, 369 U.S. 749 (1962), holds the sufficiency of a federal indictment \nis to be measured by the following criteria:   \nThese criteria are, first, whet her the indictment \"contains the \nelements of the offense intended to  be charged, 'and sufficiently \napprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet,'\" and, \nsecondly, \"'in case any other proceed ings are taken against him for \na similar offense whether the reco rd shows with accuracy to what \nextent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction.'\" \n \n369 U.S. at 763-64.  While the right to grand jury indictment has not been extended to the States, \nthe Sixth Circuit has held these criteria are applicable as a matter of due process.  Valentine v. \nKonteh, 395 F.3d 626, 631 (6 th Cir. 2005).  In Valentine the defendant faced twenty carbon-copy \ncounts of rape of a minor and twenty carbon-copy counts of gross sexual imposition.  Judge Merritt \nwrote for the court: \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 59 of 79  PAGEID #: 1511660 \n \nThe problem in this case is not the fact that the prosecution did not \nprovide the defendant with exact times and places. If there had been \nsingular counts of each offense, th e lack of particularity would not \nhave presented the same problem. Instead, the problem is that within \neach set of 20 counts, there are ab solutely no distinctions made. \nValentine was prosecuted for two criminal acts that occurred twenty \ntimes each, rather than for forty separate criminal acts. In its charges \nand in its evidence before the ju ry, the prosecution did not attempt \nto lay out the factual bases of forty separate incidents that took place. \nInstead, the 8\u2013year\u2013old victim described \u201ctypical\u201d abusive behavior \nby Valentine and then testified that the \u201ctypical\u201d abuse occurred \ntwenty or fifteen times. Outside of the victim's estimate, no evidence \nas to the number of incidents was presented. \n \nId. at 632-33.   \nThis is not a case like Valentine.  Armengau was charged with separate incidents involving \nseparate victims, dates, and place s.  Testimony at trial varied from the dates and places in the \nindictment.  Some of the variations in date were dealt with by amendment to the indictment at trial; \nthe difference in location had been dealt with by an amended bill of particulars.  As the Tenth \nDistrict noted, Petitioner was not presenting alibi or impossibility defenses which would have been \ndefeated by date changes.9 \n Thus Valentine does not read directly on the indictment in this case.  More importantly, \nValentine is not \u201cclearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United \nStates.\u201d  The Supreme Court has held, since Valentine, that a circuit cour t may not use circuit \nprecedent \u201cto refine or sharpen a general rule of Supreme Court jurisprudence into a specific rule \nthat\u201d the Supreme Court has not announced.  Lopez v. Smith , 574 U.S. 1  (2014)(per curiam); \nMarshall v. Rodgers, 569 U.S. 58, 64 (2013)(per curiam).  However, \u201can appellate panel may, in \n \n9 Several times in his pleadings, Petitioner asserts he \u201cestablished\u201d during trial that he could not have committed the \noffenses alleged because he was not at the place or there at  the time alleged.  Facts are not established finally during \nthe course of trial absent a stipulation or mid-trial dismissal.  The Magistrate Judge therefore reads Petitioner\u2019s use of \nthe word \u201cestablished\u201d as meaning Pe titioner had presented evidence which he believed was convincing on certain \ndates and places, forcing the prosecutors to shift focus or make amendments.   \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 60 of 79  PAGEID #: 1511761 \n \naccordance with its usual law-of-the-circuit proce dures, to ascertain whethe r it has already held \nthat the particular point in issue is clearly established by Supreme Cour t precedent, see, e.g., \nTolliver v. Sheets, 594 F.3d 900, 916, n.6 (\u201cWe are bound by pr ior Sixth Circuit determinations \nthat a rule has been clearly established\u201d); Chambers v. McDaniel, 549 F.3d 1191, 1199 (9 th Cir. \n2008); it may not canvass circuit decisions to deter mine whether a particular rule of law is so \nwidely accepted among the Federal Circuits that it w ould, if presented to this Court, be accepted \nas correct.  See Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. 37 (2012); Renico v. Lett, 559 U.S. 766, 778-779 \n(2010).\u201d  Marshall, 569 U.S. 58, 64 (2013).    \n The Valentine Court did not limit itself  to the question whether the rule it adopted was \nclearly established by Supreme Court precedent.  Instead, it opined,  \n[T]he \u201cclearly established Fede ral law\u201d relevant under AEDPA \nencompasses \u201cthe governing legal principle or principles set forth \nby the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its \ndecision.\u201d See Lockyer v. Andrade,  538 U.S. 63, 71\u201372, 123 S.Ct. \n1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). The Supreme Court has established \na clear and consistent path for th e courts regarding the due process \nsufficiency of criminal charges, and the Ohio Court of Appeals has \nstrayed so far from that path as to warrant habeas relief. See id. at \n72, 123 S.Ct. 1166. \n \nValentine, 395 F.3d at 638 (Emphasis supp lied).  This formulation is  inconsistent with later \nSupreme Court precedent requiring a tighter fit between Supreme Court holdings and the rule \nsought to be enforced in habeas. \n In Valentine itself, the court held \u201cthat a court is permitted to review the indictment, the \nbill of particulars, and the evidence presented at  trial to determine whether any defects in the \nindictment are cured.\u201d 395 F. 3d at 634. \n In addition to not receiving from the indictment the notice to which he claims he is entitled, \nPetitioner also asserts the indictment provides insufficient double jeopardy protection.  The Double \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 61 of 79  PAGEID #: 1511862 \n \nJeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution affords a defendant \nthree basic protections: \nIt protects against a second pros ecution for the same  offense after \nacquittal.  It protects against a second prosecution for the same \noffense after conviction.  And it protects against multiple \npunishments for the same offense. \n \nBrown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977), quoting North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 717  \n(1969).  The Double Jeopardy Clause was held to be applicable to the States through the Fourteenth \nAmendment in Benton v. Maryland,  395 U.S. 784, 794 (1969).  The State of Ohio has not re-\nindicted Petitioner for any sexual misconduct a llegedly occurring within the span of years \neventually covered by this prosecution; no such i ndictment is threatened and its content is purely \nspeculative.  It is clear that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohib its a second trial and not just a \nsecond conviction   for the same offense.  Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651 (1977).  For that \nreason, a double jeopardy claim is cognizable in federal habeas corpus prior to the \u201csecond\u201d trial.  \nJustices of the Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, 466 U.S. 294 (1984); Reimnitz v. State\u2019s Attorney \nof Cook County,  761 F.2d 405, 408 (7 th Cir. 1985); Malinovsky v. Court of Common Pleas of \nLorain County, 7 F.3d 1263 (6 th Cir. 1993).  To put it another way, a habeas petitioner with a \ndouble jeopardy claim is not required to exhaust the remedy of direct appeal from a verdict at a \nsecond trial before invoking our ha beas jurisdiction.  Should a new indictment be filed, a habeas \ncourt would compare both the indictment in this case and the evidence adduced at trial to determine \nwhether the Double Jeopardy Clause was being violated.  The Supreme Court has never held that \na state indictment must be so precise as to preclude a second indictment while examining only the \nface of the first indictment.  Valentine, which reaches that conclusion, is not Supreme Court \nprecedent and has never been followed by the Sixth Circuit itself in a habeas corpus case.  Lawwill \nv. Pineda, 2011 WL 1882456 (N.D. Ohio 2011). \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 62 of 79  PAGEID #: 1511963 \n \nRespecting jury unanimity, Armengau argues \u201c[a] jury has a duty to unanimously agree to \na particular state of facts . . . .  A jury must be unanimous in wh at facts are being considered to \ndetermine guilt.\u201d  (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14042, citing United States v. Echeverry, 698 F.2d \n375 (9th Cir. 1983)).  At numerous points in hi s Reply, Petitioner argues that no court has been \nable to tell him what facts the jury relied upon to convict him of which offenses. \n Petitioner is correct that the United States  Constitution requires that jury verdicts in \ncriminal cases be unanimous.  Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, 140 S. Ct. 1390, 206 L. Ed. 2d \n583 (2020).  However Ramos does not apply retroactively to cas es on collateral review, such as \nthis one.  Edwards v. Vannoy, 593 U.S. ___, 141 S. Ct. 1547 (2021).  Prior to Ramos, the Supreme \nCourt had held nonunanimous verd icts were permissible.  Apodaca v. Oregon , 406 U.S. 404 \n(1972).  These cases, however, involved States (Oregon and Louisiana) which expressly allowed \nmajority verdicts. \nPetitioner, however, insists on something more:  unanimity on th e facts supporting a \nverdict.  How would a State achieve such a result?   A possibility would be to sever counts of an \nindictment and try them one at a time, but Peti tioner does not suggest that is constitutionally \nrequired, nor does he claim he ever asked for severance in the trial court.   \nWe instruct a jury that its ve rdict on each count must be una nimous and we enforce that \nrequirement by requiring each juror to sign the verdict and allowing jurors to be polled in open \ncourt on their vote.  In this case the verdicts of the jury were returned and read in open court on \nJuly 7, 2014 (Transcript, State Court Record, ECF No. 72-2, PageID 13702, et seq.).  In each case \nthe bailiff announced that the fo rm was signed by all jurors.  Wh en the reading was complete, \nPetitioner\u2019s trial counsel asked that the jury be polled and they were, all answering that the verdicts \nas read were verdicts they had voted for and signed.  Id. Thus the usual methods of ensuring jury \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 63 of 79  PAGEID #: 1512064 \n \nunanimity were employed and the jurors affirmed their verdicts. \nIn Echeverry, the Ninth Circuit disapproved an ambi guous jury instruc tion in a federal \nconspiracy case which left the jury free to convict  if they found a conspiracy existed \u201cfor some \nperiod of time\u201d when the evidence would have permitted a finding that there had been both a \nDecember and a June conspiracy, but did not requi re a unanimous finding as to either one.   \nNothing in the case suggests that the defendant c ould have, after the fact, required the jury or an \nappellate court to tell him what facts they found unanimously.  To  put it somewhat differently, a \nstate criminal trial is not like a federal civil jury trial where a jury can be required to return special \nverdicts.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 49.  Much less can a state appellate court be compelled, in the interest \nof jury unanimity, to make such separate findings.   \nFinally, Petitioner\u2019s jury unanimity claim is  procedurally defaul ted because it was not \npresented to the Tenth District as a federal constitutional claim.  The Tenth District noted that this \nclaim had been presented as a jury unanimity claim under Ohio R. Crim. P. 31(A). \n{\u00b6 62} Finally, appellant argues th at the complex, and allegedly \nmismatched, assemblage of fact s, testimony, indictment, and \namendments of the bill of particul ars allowed the jury to produce a \n\u201cpatchwork\u201d verdict in violation of Ohio's requirement of jury \nunanimity, under Crim.R. 31(A). Pursuant to that rule, jurors must \nunanimously agree not only on the defendant's guilt, but as to proof \nas to each element of the crime. \n \nPetitioner\u2019s Third Ground for Relief should therefore be dismissed. \n \nGround Four:  Erroneous Jury Instructions \n \n In his Fourth Ground for Relief, Armengau asserts he was denied due process of law when \nthe trial court \u201cdenied a requested unanimity instruction and the instructions allowed a non-unanimous \nverdict and a verdict upon uncharged alleged conduct.\u201d  (Second Amended Petition, ECF No. 70, \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 64 of 79  PAGEID #: 1512165 \n \nPageID 4067). \n Respondent asserts this claim is procedurally defaulted.  The procedural default doctrine in \nhabeas corpus is described by the Supreme Court as follows: \nIn all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims \nin state court pursuant to an adequate and independent state \nprocedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless \nthe prisoner can demonstrate ca use of the default and actual \nprejudice as a result of the alle ged violation of federal law; or \ndemonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a \nfundamental miscarriage of justice. \n \nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991); see also Simpson v. Jones , 238 F.3d 399, 406 \n(6th Cir. 2000).  That is, a petitioner may not raise on federal habeas a federal constitutional rights \nclaim he could not raise in state court because of procedural default. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. \n72 (1977); Engle v. Isaac , 456 U.S. 107, 110 (1982).  \u201cAbsent cause and prejudice, \u2018a federal \nhabeas petitioner who fails to comply with a State\u2019s rules of procedure waives his right to federal \nhabeas corpus review.\u2019\u201d  Boyle v. Million, 201 F.3d 711, 716 (6 th Cir. 2000), quoting Gravley v. \nMills, 87 F.3d 779, 784-85 (6 th Cir. 1996); Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 485 (1986); Engle, \n456 U.S. at 110; Wainwright, 433 U.S. at 87.   \n[A] federal court may not review federal claims that were \nprocedurally defaulted in state court\u2014that is, claims that the state \ncourt denied based on an adequate and independent state procedural \nrule. E.g., Beard v. Kindler , 558 U.S. 53, 55, 130 S.Ct. 612, 175 \nL.Ed.2d 417 (2009).  This is an important \u201ccorollary\u201d to the \nexhaustion requirement. Dretke v. Haley , 541 U.S. 386, 392, 124 \nS.Ct. 1847, 158 L.Ed. d 659 (2004).  \u201cJust as in those cases in which \na state prisoner fails to exhaust state remedies, a habeas petitioner \nwho has failed to meet the State\u2019s procedural requirements for \npresenting his federal claims has deprived the state courts of an \nopportunity to address\u201d the merits  of \u201cthose claims in the first \ninstance.\u201d  Coleman [v. Thompson], 501 U.S. [722,] 731-732, 111 \nS.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 [(1991)].   The procedural default \ndoctrine thus advances the same  comity, finalit y, and federalism \ninterests advanced by the exhaustion doctrine.  See McCleskey v. \nZant, 499 U.S. 467, 493, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991). \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 65 of 79  PAGEID #: 1512266 \n \n \nDavila v.

Ct. 2058, 2064 (2017)). \n The Sixth Circuit Court of A ppeals requires a four-part analysis when the State alleges a \nhabeas claim is preclude d by procedural default . Barton v. Warden, S.  Ohio Corr. Facility,  786 \nF.3d 450, 464 (6 th Cir. 2015), Guilmette v. Howes,  624 F.3d 286, 290 (6 th Cir. 2010)( en banc); \nEley v. Bagley , 604 F.3d 958, 965 (6 th Cir. 2010); Reynolds v.

Mohr, 265 F.3d 407, 417 (6th Cir. 2001). \nFirst the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule \nthat is applicable to the petiti oner's claim and th at the petitioner \nfailed to comply with the rule. \n  . . . . \nSecond, the court must decide whet her the state courts actually \nenforced the state procedural sanction, citing County Court of Ulster \nCounty v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 149, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 \n(1979).  \n \nThird, the court must decide whether the state procedural forfeiture \nis an \"adequate and independent\" state ground on which the state \ncan rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim. \n \nOnce the court determines that a state procedural  rule was not \ncomplied with and that the rule was an adequate and independent \nstate ground, then the petitioner must demonstrate under Sykes that \nthere was \"cause\" for him to not follow the procedural rule and that \nhe was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.  \n \nMaupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986); accord, Hartman v. Bagley, 492 F.3d 347, 357 \n(6th Cir. 2007), quoting Monzo v. Edwards, 281 F.3d 568, 576 (6th Cir. 2002).    \n Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel requested a particular instruction on unanimity which was not given.  \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 66 of 79  PAGEID #: 1512367 \n \nHowever, he \u201cdid not object to the jury  instructions as given.\u201d Armengau I at \u00b6 64.  The Tenth \nDistrict therefore reviewed Armengau\u2019s jury instruction claims under a plain error standard.  Id. \n Petitioner does not dispute that Ohio has a proc edural rule that requires a litigant to preserve \nan alleged jury instruction error by objecting to the instruction as given nor does he dispute the \nTenth District\u2019s factual finding that no such objection was made here.  Instead he asserts the Tenth \nDistrict did not enforce the rule.   \nPetitioner respectfully suggests to this Court that the Court of \nAppeals did not rely on the \"pro cedural bar\" and in any event, \nnotwithstanding defense counsel's failure to lodge an objection, \nnotwithstanding the denial of his requested instruction, the Court of \nAppeals proceeded to analyze the issue in the same manner it would \nhave had an objection been made. \n \n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14082, citing Keeton v.

Ohio, Sept. 8, 2006)).  \nIn Keeton Magistrate Judge Veccharelli analyzed proce dural default differentially as to different \nclaims.  As to the claim referenced in footnote seven, cited by Petitioner, she found the Ohio Court of \nAppeals had not actually enforced the relevant procedural rule.  But as to Ground Three regarding \nexcuse of jurors, she wrote: \nIn dismissing this claim, the Co urt of Appeals indicated that \nKeeton's trial counsel did not obj ect to the dismissal of the \nprospective jurors for cause and re viewed the claim for plain error. \nThe Court of Appeals held that th e trial court did not commit plain \nerror. \n \nThe Court of Appeals expressly relied upon and enforced the \ncontemporaneous objection rule, a st ate procedural bar, to dismiss \nthis claim. The Court of Appeals' plain error review does not excuse \nthe court's reliance on the state procedural rule in dismissing the \nclaims. See Scott, 209 F.3d at 868. Further, the Sixth Circuit has held \nthe contemporaneous objection rule is an \"adequate and \nindependent\" state ground. Id. at 869. \n \n2006 U.S. Dist.

Armengau I at \u00b6 64.  As Judge Veccharelli noted, the \nSixth Circuit has frequently recognized that Ohio\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule is an adequate \nand independent stat e ground of decision.  Wogenstahl v.

(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14083, citing Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103 \n(1990)).  In Osborne the Supreme Court enfor ced a procedural default consisting of failure to \nobject to omission of a scienter instruction, but disregarded a similar default on an instruction on \n\u201clewdness\u201d because trial counsel had sufficiently pushed the issue of over breadth to satisfy the \nstate interest in giving the state courts a fair oppo rtunity to correct constitutional error.  495 U.S. \nat 123-24.  Thus the Supreme Court found an excusabl e default in the factual complexities of the \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 68 of 79  PAGEID #: 1512569 \n \nOsborne case and did not announce a general rule which would apply here. \n Respondent asserts Armengau furt her procedurally defaulted this jury instruction claim by \nfailing to present it to the Supreme Court of Oh io as a federal constitutional claim (Return, ECF \nNo. 73, PageID 13896).  Petitioner responds by asserting: \nWith regard to Respondent's claim that the jury instruction issue was \nnot fairly presented, a claim of defective indictment, patchwork and \nnon-unanimous verdict and a double  jeopardy claim, by necessity, \nimplicates a jury instruction issue.   \n \nJury instructions are directly related to the sufficiency evaluation for \nan indictment, evidence and corresponding notice issues and these \nissue [sic] were raised in Propositions I and VI to the Ohio Supreme \nCourt (Doc. 72, PageID 8046-8047, 8053-8058, PageID 610-622). \nThose issues by necessity extend to the jury instructions. \n \n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14082-83). \n \n The referenced Propositions of Law read: \nFirst Proposition of Law:  This Court's decision in Hampton docs \nnot allow a defendant to be convicted of a crime when the indictment \nasserts the criminal conduct occurred in a specific county, and does \nnot reference R.C. 2901.12, and all evidence presented demonstrates \nthat the crime occurred in a different county than that named in the \nindictment. RC. 2901.12; State v. Hampton,  134 Ohio St.3d 447, \n2012-0hio-5688, 983 N.E.2d 324 \n \nSixth P roposition of Law: When th e S tate cannot pr ovide a \ndefendant wi th accurate  information regarding the tim e frame in \nwhich the alleged criminal conduct occurred, where it occurred, or \nthe conduct at issue until its witness has testified at trial, a defendant \nis misled and prejudiced, and is entitled to a mistrial.  Crim. R. 7(D). \n \n(Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 13, PageID 8041-\n42).  Neither of these Propositions of Law mentions jury instructions at all or any provision of the \nUnited States Constitution.  Nor do the arguments on these propositions mention jury instructions \nor cite any federal law.  \n Because Petitioner did not fairly present his jury instruction claim to the Supreme Court of \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 69 of 79  PAGEID #: 1512670 \n \nOhio as a federal constitutional claim, it is procedurally defaulted on that basis as well. \n Because Petitioner\u2019s Fourth Ground for Relief is procedurally defaulted twice over, the \nCourt cannot reach the merits of the claim.  Davila, supra.  The jury instructions claim should be \ndismissed as procedurally defaulted. \n \nGround Five:  Prosecutorial Misconduct \n \n In his Fifth Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts he was deprived of due process and a fair \ntrial by prosecutorial misconduct when \u201ch e was tried, convicted, and resentenced for convictions \nupon the admission of other-act evidence that was unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed prior to trial \nand which was presented by prosecutors to intentionally circumvent the defenses to the actually \nindicted alleged crimes.\u201d \n Respondent asserts this Ground for Relief is procedurally defaulted because the admission of \nother acts evidence claim was presented to the Tenth District as an issue of trial court error rather than \nprosecutorial misconduct (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13896).  Petitioner\u2019s Reply asserts that the \nReturn did not address his claim of prosecutorial misconduct and therefore does not respond to this \ndefense (ECF No. 77, PageID 14147). \n The Magistrate Judge finds the defense well taken.  The relevant Assignment of Error on appeal \nargued trial court error, not prosecutorial misconduct.  Armengau I, \u00b6 68.    The Sixth Circuit has \narticulated the relevant standard for habeas claims of prosecutorial misconduct as follows: \n\u201cIn the evaluation of a claim for prosecutorial misconduct, it is not \nenough that the prosecutor's comme nts were improper, but \u2018[t]he \nrelevant question is whether the prosecutors' comments \u201cso infected \nthe trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial \nof due process.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Smith, 567 F.3d [246] at 255 [6 th Cir. 2009] \n(quoting Darden v.

In other \nwords, \u201c[i]n order to satisfy the standard for prosecutorial \nmisconduct, the conduct must be both improper and flagrant.\u201d \nBroom v. Mitchell, 441 F.3d 392, 412 (6th Cir.2006), cert. denied, \n549 U.S. 1255, 127 S.Ct. 1376, 167 L.Ed.2d 165 (2007). To \ndetermine whether improper conduct is flagrant, we consider four \nfactors: \n \n(1) the likelihood that the remarks of the prosecutor tended \nto mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether \nthe remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the \nremarks were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) the \ntotal strength of the evidence against the defendant.   \n \nBates v. Bell, 402 F.3d 635, 641 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 546 U.S. \n865, 126 S.Ct. 163, 163 L.Ed.2d 150 (2005). \n \nGoff v. Bagley, 601 F.3d 445, 480 (6th Cir. 2010).  See also LaMar v. Houk, 798 F.3d 405, 430 (6th \nCir., 2015).   \n The usual claim of prosecutorial misconduct involves a prosecutor\u2019s improper comment \non evidence, presentation of perjured testimony, or failure to comply with Brady v. Maryland, 373 \nU.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny.  Here the cla im is the prosecutors deliberately relied on \ninadmissible other acts evidence.  The first step in analyzing any claim of prosecutorial misconduct \nis to determine that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper.  Bowling v. Parker, 344 F.3d 487, 512-\n13 (6th Cir. 2003). Here the Tenth Di strict determined admission of  the other acts evidence was \nnot improper.  It cannot be improper conduct for a prosecutor to offer admissible evidence. \n Petitioner\u2019s Fifth Ground for Re lief should be denied as procedurally defaulted and without \nmerit. \n \n \n \n \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 71 of 79  PAGEID #: 1512872 \n \nGround Six:  Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction \n \n In his Sixth Ground for Relief, Petitioner argues the Franklin County Court of Common \nPleas never \u201cobtained\u201d subject matter jurisdiction to try his case (Amended Petition, ECF No. 70, \nPageID 7651).  As noted above , Armengau combined arguments  about Ground Six with his \narguments on Ground Three.  Other than the subject  matter jurisdiction cl aim, these issues are \ndealt with above under Ground Three. \n Respondent treats this claim as of a piece with Armengau\u2019 s other objections to the \nindictment and dismisses it with the assertion that there is no federal constitutional right to grand \njury indictment in state courts (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13881, citing, inter alia, Hurtado).  \nOther than adverting to the fact that he has a lleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction, Armengau \ndoes nothing in his Reply to argue the issue.  No r does it appear Armengau raised this issue on \ndirect appeal.   \n Lack of subject matter jurisdiction was a basis for granting habeas corpus relief long before \nthose bases were broadened to any constitutional error in Brown v. Allen , 344 U.S. 443 (1953).  \nSee Ex parte Lange , 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 163 (1873); Ex parte Siebold , 100 U.S. 371 (1880).  \nHowever, in Ohio, the common pleas courts are the courts with subject matter jurisdiction to try \nfelony criminal cases. See Ohio Rev. Code 2931.03; State v. Lauharn, 2012-Ohio-1572, \u00b6 22, 2012 \nOhio App. LEXIS 1382, **12 (2nd App. Dist. 2012); Leyman v. Bradshaw, 2015-Ohio-751, \u00b6 13, \n2015 Ohio App. LEXIS 699, **4 (5th App. Dist. 2015).  Petitioner has not pled or proved any basis \non which the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his \ncase.  Ground six should therefore be dismissed on the merits. \n \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 72 of 79  PAGEID #: 1512973 \n \nGround Seven:  Denial of Equal Protection \n \n In his Seventh Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he was denied his Fourteenth Amendment \nright to equal protection of the laws when the Tenth District Court of Appeals and the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio \u201cintentionally disregarded the law set by th eir respective courts and the United States \nSupreme Court in order to affirm the convictions.\u201d   His theory is that \u201c[t]he holdings and rulings in \nPetitioner's case are contrary to established precedent.\u201d \n Respondent asserts this claim is not cognizable in federal habeas corpus, arguing \u201d[a]leged errors \ninvolving a state court\u2019s interpretation of its own law or procedure are not cognizable in federal habeas \ncorpus review (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13889, citing Simpson v. Jones , 238 F.3d 399, 406-07 \n(6th Cir. 2000); Allen v. Morris, 845 F.2d 610, 614 (6th Cir. 1988)). \n Petitioner responds that  \nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is \nessentially a direction th at all persons similarl y situated should be \ntreated alike. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. \n432 (1985). The sine qua non  of an equal pr otection claim is \ndissimilar treatment of persons similarly situated. The Equal \nProtection Clause embodies a general rule that States must treat like \ncases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly. \n \n* * * \n \nPetitioner respectfully suggests that the case law he has cited \nthroughout his petition a nd this reply specifica lly identifies him as \nsimilarly situated to defendants who have obtained relief under \nidentical issues and material fact s and that the c ourt system has \ndisregarded the law they have established in order to affirm the \nconvictions. \n \n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14087-88).  He then pr oceeds to discuss at length other allegedly \nsimilarly-situated defendants who have obtained relief in similar circumstances. Id. at PageID \n14089-91.   \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 73 of 79  PAGEID #: 1513074 \n \n It is of course fundamental to our American system of case law that like cases should be \ndecided alike.  Garner, et al., The Law of Judicial Precedent \u00a7 A.1(2016).  Garner \u2019s treatise is \ndevoted to explicating the doctrine of preceden t which enables deciding like cases alike.  \nPetitioner\u2019s premise \u2013 that equa l protection doctrine must overla y the doctrine of precedent \u2013 \nseems an appropriate extension of the law in both of these areas.  The Magistrate Judge therefore \ndisagrees with Respondent\u2019s argument that only state law questions are involved.  If, for example, \na municipal judge intentionally applied a different standard to deciding red light cases depending \non the race of the defendant, it is not difficult to see the equal protection issue involved. \n At the same time, the entire doctrine of precedent cannot be cons titutionalized; such a \nsystem would not be administrable.  See Levine v. Torvik, supra.  The Supreme Court has stated \nthat the Equal Protection Clause \"embodies the general rule that States must treat like cases alike \nbut may treat unlike cases accordingly.\" Vacco v. Quill , 521 U.S. 793, 799 (1997).  The States \ncannot make distinctions which either burden a fundamental right, target  a suspect class, or \nintentionally treat a person differently from others similarly situated without any rational basis for \nthe difference. Id.; Village of Willowbrook v. Olech , 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per curiam); \nRadvansky v. City of Olmsted Falls, 395 F.3d 291, 312 (6th Cir. 2005).   \n Considering the general standards for estab lishment of an equal protection violation, \nPetitioner has not articulated, much less presented, a case which would support such a finding.  He \nnever presented a case to the Ohio courts for selective prosecution.  Indeed, his allegation is that \nthe Ohio appellate courts, not the prosecution, discriminated against him.  He does not suggest an \ninvidious basis such as race fo r deciding his case one way and other similarly-situated cases \ndifferently.  Although he claims there are other similarly-situated cases, what are the similarities?  \nAre there other men accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women who have not been \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 74 of 79  PAGEID #: 1513175 \n \nprosecuted because they were not successful criminal defense lawyers?  \n In sum, while the Magistrate Judge agrees that an intentional misapplication of the doctrine \nof precedent on an invidious basis could violat e the Equal Protection Cl ause, Armengau did not \npresent such a case to either the Tenth District or the Supreme Court of Ohio.  As with \u201cfair trial\u201d \nand \u201cdue process,\u201d mere recitation of the talismanic phrase \u201cequal protection\u201d is not an argument.  \nPetitioner\u2019s Seventh Ground for Re lief should be dismissed as pr ocedurally defaulted because \nnever fairly presented to the Ohio courts.  It is also without merit in the form presented to this \nCourt. \n \nGround Eight:  Actual Innocence \n \n In his Eighth Ground for Relief, Armengau claims he is actually innocent of the crimes of \nwhich he was convicted and is entitled to habeas corpus relief on that basis.  In habeas corpus \nparlance, this is denominated a \u201cstand alone\u201d actual innocence claim to distinguish it from the \n\u201cgateway\u201d actual innocence claim recognized by the Supreme Court in Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. \n298 (1995).   \nCase law in the Sixth Circuit establishes that  the Supreme Court of the United States has \nnever recognized a free-standing or substantive actual innocence claim. Cress v. Palmer, 484 F.3d \n844, 854 (6th Cir. 2007), citing Zuern v. Tate, 336 F.3d 478, 482, n.1 (6th Cir. 2003), and Staley \nv. Jones, 239 F.3d 769, 780, n.12 (6th Cir. 2001). \n Even if a stand-alone claim were to be recognized, Petiti oner has not submitted evidence \nof the quality required by Schlup to qualify.  \"To be credible, su ch a claim requires petitioner to \nsupport his allegations of cons titutional error with new reli able evidence -- whether it be \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 75 of 79  PAGEID #: 1513276 \n \nexculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence -- \nthat was not presented at trial.\" Souter v. Jones, 395 F.3d 577, 590 (6 th Cir. 2005), citing Schlup, \n513 U.S. at 324. \n The Supreme Court has also noted that \"actual innocence means factual innocence, not \nmere legal insufficiency.\" Bousley v. United States, 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998).  Having committed \nthe acts which the jury found to be sexual misc onduct in Marion County as opposed to Franklin \nCounty does not amount to a claim of factual innocence. \n Petitioner\u2019s  Eighth Ground for Relief should be  dismissed for failure to state a claim upon \nwhich habeas corpus relief can be granted.  \n \nGround Nine:  Lack of Jury Unanimity \n \n This claim has been dealt with under Ground Three above. \n \n \nGround Ten:  Denial of Right to Trial by Jury \n \n In his Tenth Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts he was denied his right to trial by jury \nbecause the factual bases of his convictions were  determined by the trial and appellate judges \ninstead of the jury.  As Petitioner made clear when moving to amend to add this claim, he believes \nhe suffered from a violation of the doctrine in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), where \nthe Supreme Court held \u201cunder th e Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice \nand jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (o ther than prior conviction) that \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 76 of 79  PAGEID #: 1513377 \n \nincreases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, \nand proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \n This is not a classic Apprendi case where some punishment beyond that authorized by the \nstatute of conviction can be im posed upon a separate finding by the trial judge.  For example, in \nApprendi the Supreme Court was dealing with a statut e which increased the penalties for a crime \nif the court determined it to be a \u201chate\u201d crime.  Nothing of that sort happened here. 10  Rather \nGround Ten is a variant on Petitioner\u2019s claim that facts found by the jury\u2019s general verdicts were \nreassigned by the Tenth District  upon resentencing.  Petitioner po ints to no clearly established \nSupreme Court precedent violated by what oc curred on re-sentencing.  His Tenth Ground for \nRelief should therefore be denied on the merits. \n \nAdditional Claims \n \n At the end of his Reply, Petitioner asserts that he has made other claims which Respondent has \nnot addressed, to wit, fair trial, prosecutorial misconduct, and constructive amendment (Reply, ECF \nNo. 72, PageID 14147). \n As noted in the analysis of Ground Five, the Respondent did address the specific \nprosecutorial misconduct claim made here by noting it had not been presented in that form to the \nTenth District, but rather as a claim of trial court error. \n Case law prohibiting constructiv e amendments of indictments during trial are designed to \nprotect a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to grand jury indictment.  A state defendant\u2019s grand jury \n \n10 Armengau was ordered to serve some sentences consecutively.  However, the Supreme Court has exempted the \nfindings which may be needed for consecutive sentences from the application of Apprendi.  Oregon v. Ice, 555 U.S. \n160 (2009). \nCase: 2:19-cv-01146-ALM-MRM Doc #: 97 Filed: 11/03/21 Page: 77 of 79  PAGEID #: 1513478 \n \nright is protected by the Ohio Constitution, but vi olations of the Ohio Constitution do not state a \nclaim for violating the federal Constitution, because there is no fe deral constitutional right to \nindictment in the state courts.  Hurtado, supra.  A federal defendant\u2019s grand jury right, protected \nby the Fifth Amendment, is protected by forbidding constructive amendments in federal trials.  All \nthe authority relied on by Petitioner in this sect ion of his Reply was enforcing the federal grand \njury right in federal cases.  Because the Fifth Amendment Grand Jury Clause has not been \nincorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, there is no federal constitutional prohibition on \nconstructive amendments in state trials. \n Petitioner has not pleaded a separate ground for relief based on his claim of denial of a fair \ntrial.   \n \nConclusion \n \n Based on the foregoing analysis, the Magi strate Judge respectfully recommends the \nPetition be dismissed with prej udice.  Reasonable jurists c ould disagree with the proposed \ndisposition of Grounds One (sufficiency of the evidence) and Three (double jeopardy); Petitioner \nshould therefore be granted a certificate of appealability as to those Grounds.  Because reasonable \njurists would not disagree with dismissal of the other Grounds for Relief, it is also recommended \nthat Petitioner be denied a certificate of appeal ability as to those Grounds .  Petitioner should be \npermitted to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis.  \n \nNovember 2, 2021. \n        s /  Michael R.

(Indictment, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Exhibit 1).\n\nThe case was tried from June 19 until July 7, 2014, when the trial jury found Petitioner guilty as to Count 2 (public indecency), Counts 3 and 8 (gross sexual imposition), Count 10 (rape), Count 14 (kidnapping), and Counts 15-18 (sexual battery)(State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Exhibit 5). Petitioner was acquitted on Counts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13 (Judgment Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 5).\n\nOn August 26, 2014, the trial court found that Counts 10 (rape) and 15 (sexual battery) merged under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2945.71 for the purposes of sentencing, with the State electing sentencing on Count 10. Armengau was then sentenced to concurrent sentences of fifteen months each in prison for Counts 3 and 8, nine years in prison for Count 10, four years in prison for Count 14, and thirty months each in prison for Counts 16, 17, and 18. Counts 10 and 14 were ordered to be served consecutively with all other sentences to be served concurrently, for an aggregate sentence of thirteen years in prison. Id. Petitioner was also sentenced to thirty days on the public indecency misdemeanor and credited with time served.1\n\nThrough new counsel, Petitioner appealed to the Ohio Tenth District Court of Appeals. That court overruled his first, second, fourth through seventh, and ninth assignments of error, sustained his third and eighth assignments of error, and remanded for re-sentencing on Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17.

Maleng v. Cook, 490 U.S. 488 (1989).\nI. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b6 2 During the period of the indicted offenses, appellant was an attorney licensed in Ohio, with a central Ohio general practice that over time became focused on criminal defense work. The women who accused him of sexual misconduct were clients or relatives of clients; two of the accusers also worked in appellant's law offices.\n\n\u00b6 3 Columbus police began investigating appellant in 2013 after one of the accusers, C.C., hired appellant to represent her son in criminal proceedings and complained of appellant's unwanted physical advances. After appellant's arrest at the termination of that investigation, other accusers began coming forth, leading to an 18-count indictment issued by the Franklin County Grand Jury alleging crimes victimizing five different women: Counts 1, 2, and 3 alleged kidnapping, public indecency, and gross sexual imposition involving accuser C.C., all occurring on or about April 4, 2013. Counts 4 and 5 alleged rape and kidnapping involving accuser L.G., arising out of a single incident occurring between August 1 and August 31, 2008. Counts 6 and 7 alleged sexual battery and gross sexual imposition involving accuser A.C., occurring between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2010. Count 8 alleged gross sexual imposition involving accuser K.R., occurring between August 8 and September 17, 2008. Counts 10 through 13 alleged rape involving accuser L.M. Count 14 alleged kidnapping involving L.M. in connection with one of the rape counts. Counts 15 through 18 alleged sexual battery against L.M. All the counts involving L.M. alleged conduct occurring between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. All counts involving all accusers alleged that the criminal conduct occurred in Franklin County, Ohio.\n\n\u00b6 4 The state provided a bill of particulars on June 1, 2014, amended it on the eve of trial on June 6, 2014, and further amended it at the close of the state's case on June 22, 2014. The state, over objection, also verbally amended the indictment during trial to conform to certain testimony. The specifics of these amendments are more extensively developed below in connection with appellant's first and sixth assignments of error (emphasis supplied).\n\nII. TRIAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n\u00b6 5 The prosecution relied chiefly on the testimony of the five accusers. In addition, three other similarly situated women testified as other-acts witnesses regarding events that did not give rise to further criminal charges. Two of these described appellant's conduct\nin connection with consensual sexual relationships, and one testified regarding appellant's offensive conduct or statements towards her.\n\n\u00b6 6 The first accuser that testified at trial was C.C. She stated that she hired appellant to represent her son in a criminal matter, and met with appellant at his office on South High Street in Columbus. On April 4, 2013, C.C. received a call from appellant's secretary asking her to come to appellant's Columbus office to discuss the upcoming trial. During the course of their interview, appellant retrieved a legal file and sat next to C.C., brushing up against her. Appellant then opened the file, C.C. testified, and when the file fell to the floor, he gripped C.C.'s left arm firmly and put his right arm down her shirt, pulling her bra away from her breasts. C.C. testified that she was unable to move during this episode because of appellant's physical restraint. C.C. then attempted to readjust her clothing, and realized that appellant had stood up and unzipped his pants, placing his penis before her face. C.C. was offended, and quickly left the office, calling a friend to pick her up. She later called her sister, K.C., to complain of the episode.\n\n\u00b6 7 K.C. herself testified to confirm the phone call from C.C. She described her sister as frantic during the call, which prompted K.C. to advise C.C. to call the police.\n\n\u00b6 8 After C.C. reported the incident to the Columbus police, investigators contacted C.C. and asked her to set up further meetings with appellant that could be recorded as evidence. She exchanged several recorded phone calls with appellant and eventually met him at a restaurant, where their conversation was recorded and observed by police. During this meeting, appellant again made unwanted advances towards C.C. by repeatedly putting his hand on her thigh, and did not deny his prior conduct during their meeting at his office. In the course of C.C.'s testimony, these recordings were played for the jury in open court.\n\n\u00b6 9 Officer Jeffrey Cain, of the Columbus Division of Police, testified that he went to C.C.'s apartment on April 4, 2013, to take the report of a sexual assault.\n\n\u00b6 10 Corporal Jeff Zech, of the Franklin County Sheriff's Office, testified regarding the technical aspects of the audio recording process used for the restaurant meeting between C.C. and appellant.\n\n\u00b6 11 Detective Jason Sprague, of the Columbus Division of Police, testified regarding the preparations for the restaurant meeting between C.C. and appellant. He was in the vicinity during\nthe meeting but had difficulty picking up the conversation because recording sound was poor. After appellant's arrest upon leaving the restaurant, Detective Sprague participated in a recorded interview with appellant at the police station.\n\n\u00b6 12 During Detective Sprague's testimony, the recording of appellant's post-arrest interview was played in open court. In this interview, appellant described in detail his recent meeting with C.C. at his office regarding her son's case. He denied any inappropriate conduct on his part towards C.C. on that or any other occasion. He professed to be baffled by some of C.C.'s text messages and phone calls that contained flirtatious or sexual references, and stated that he had previously asked her to refrain from such comments.\n\n\u00b6 13 Detective Jeffery Ackley, of the Columbus Division of Police, testified about his participation in the investigation. He acted as security backup and an observer during the restaurant meeting. His visual observations corroborated C.C.'s testimony regarding appellant's physical actions, although the ambient noise prevented him from overhearing their conversation directly. He was able to make a partial video recording of the meeting using his personal recording device, and this was later transferred to CD by investigators. The video was partially played for the jury but did not include any of appellant's alleged physical advances.\n\n\u00b6 14 On cross-examination of C.C., defense counsel played a video recording made in Columbus police facilities during a telephone conversation between C.C. and her incarcerated son, who was awaiting trial for aggravated murder and other charges. In the recorded conversation, C.C. several times assured her son that, due to the developing conflict with appellant, the son would receive not only new defense counsel but a different prosecutor and judge for his case. Upon further questioning, C.C. testified that she felt that these changes would benefit her son, because she was dismayed by the harsh 43-year sentence offered to her son in plea discussions, and doubted whether appellant had obtained the best available result.\n\n\u00b6 15 In his testimony at trial regarding C.C.'s accusations, appellant denied any inappropriate conduct towards C.C. He described his representation of her son against several extremely serious charges, including aggravated murder. Appellant testified that his primary contact was with other family members or his jailed client via telephone, because C.C., after two brief initial meetings, made herself unavailable. While other family members came to various court hearings, C.C. did not. After several months, in April\n2013, the trial date approached and appellant advised his client that the prosecution's 43\u2013year offer was preferable to trial and a life sentence. Appellant felt that the state had put together a very solid investigation and his client would have little chance in front of a jury, and a plea to the indictment without an agreed sentence would result in more time.\n\n\u00b6 16 Appellant testified that prior to the April 4 meeting, he instructed his assistant to contact C.C. and arrange a meeting to update C.C. regarding the case. The meeting was arranged for April 4, and C.C. arrived as agreed. Her behavior struck him as odd. He asked about an individual that she had previously introduced to him as her husband, and she laughed and stated that she had this individual arrested. They then discussed her son's case, and C.C. expressed extreme disappointment with the plea offer. Appellant explained the situation to her and showed her some of his case notes. He denied sitting next to her on the office couch or touching her in any way. He was taken aback when C.C., on leaving the office, asked if he would like to have dinner some time.\n\n\u00b6 17 Appellant testified that the next day he learned from his client, C.C.'s son, that the client no longer wanted to accept the plea deal. C.C. then called him, and, in one of the conversations that he later learned was recorded by her at police request, asked for a dinner meeting to further discuss her son's plea. During the phone call, C.C. made several flirtatious or sexually charged remarks, which appellant deflected. He was not particularly put off by this because he considered C.C. to be somewhat unstable or unpredictable, and in any case he had experienced flirtatious comments from other clients and could usually steer such conversations back to business without difficulty. Appellant then described the meeting with C.C. at the restaurant, and denied putting his hand on her thigh or touching her inappropriately.\n\n\u00b6 18 The defense called S.K., C.C.'s former roommate. She testified that, in March 2013, C.C. approached her about blackmailing appellant. C.C. appeared frustrated by appellant's representation and the poor plea offer made by the state in her son's murder case. C.C. was also upset about the amount of money she had paid appellant for her son's representation. C.C. told S.K. that she had lied regarding the sexual incident so that she could sue appellant and get a new attorney for her son. She promised to give S.K. a car if S.K. would participate in the blackmail scheme. S.K. refused to participate when she learned that appellant had been arrested, whereupon C.C. kicked S.K. out of their shared apartment.\n\u00b6 19 The second accuser to appear at trial was A.C. She testified that she began working for appellant in the late 1990's, during the time that appellant represented her in a custody dispute. Appellant's principal office at the time was in Marion, Ohio. A.C. worked for appellant for over seven years, and she eventually resided in one of his rental properties. Early in the working relationship, A.C. testified appellant approached her when she was working in his Marion office, rubbed her shoulders, put his hands down her shirt, and eventually requested that she perform oral sex. She acquiesced. These incidents went on for some time, including an incident when she was in his Columbus office during 2005 or 2006. She could provide no specific dates for any of the incidents except for one occurring on September 11, 2001. On direct and cross-examination, A.C. agreed that she has a lengthy history of disabling mental illness and experienced many civil and criminal legal difficulties as a result. She stated that the sexual activity with appellant was \u201cto an extent\u201d consensual, but that at the time she felt she had little choice but to comply with his demands. (Tr. at 834.)\n\n\u00b6 20 Appellant testified that he first met A.C., as she had testified, during representation of her in a custody matter in 1999. He agreed that she had worked for him off and on over the years and had rented a home from him. Appellant denied having any sexual relationship of any kind with A.C. He represented her on numerous legal matters, some arising from her mental health issues, which often led to run-ins with police. This legal representation ended when A.C. complained that appellant was taking too long obtaining a dissolution for her.\n\n\u00b6 21 The third accuser to testify was L.G., who testified that she met appellant in 2006 or 2007 when she retained appellant to represent her son in a legal matter. Their interactions began professionally, but she claimed appellant soon began acting inappropriately. She claimed that at one point, appellant demanded oral sex in exchange for a promise to help her son. On several occasions he stripped naked in front of her in his office and masturbated. Later, on the eve of her son's court appearance in September or October 2007, she went to appellant's office for a meeting. Appellant and another man were drinking in the office. L.G. claimed appellant offered her a drink and suggested that if she performed oral sex on both men, her son's case would have a better outcome. L.G. refused and left the office.\n\n\u00b6 22 L.G. testified that next day, while in court attending her son's sentencing hearing, she realized that the man she had seen the night before with appellant was, in fact, the judge in her son's case. She\nwas extremely upset when the judge imposed the maximum sentence on her son at this hearing. After the hearing, L.G. claimed appellant forced her to perform oral sex on him in an attorney conference room in the courthouse, physically restraining her from leaving. She claimed that after this, she was violently ill as she rejoined her family outside. L.G. testified that she had made a police report about the incident in 2009 and refiled it in 2013 when learning of appellant's arrest.\n\n\u00b6 23 Prosecution witness S.W. testified that she was L.G.'s aunt and had observed interaction between L.G. and appellant. She advanced some funds for appellant's fees in the defense of L.G.'s son and later took L.G. to retrieve paperwork from appellant's office after L.G. had terminated the attorney-client relationship on behalf of her son. S.W. observed a heated confrontation between L.G. and appellant, prompted in part by appellant's refusal to return the son's case file. At some point in the conversation, L.G. called appellant a rapist. From appellant's office, they drove to the Columbus police department, where L.G. went inside for at least two and one-half hours while S.W. remained in the car. On previous occasions, S.W. had accompanied L.G. for case conferences, and felt that appellant was upset that L.G. was not alone and would not come up to his office alone.\n\n\u00b6 24 Prosecution witness J.B. testified that she was L.G.'s de facto mother-in-law, as L.G. had lived with her son for 24 years even though the two were not married. She attended a meeting with L.G. at appellant's office in 2009 and observed an argument or scene in which L.G. called appellant a rapist. Thereafter, she rode in the car with L.G. and S.W. to the police station, and testified that L.G. was in the police station only 15 or 20 minutes. On another occasion, J.B. attended a hearing for her grandson at the courthouse and waited outside in the hall during proceedings. J.B. testified that, at some point, L.G. emerged from the courtroom and became violently ill. When J.B. asked what was the matter, L.G. replied \u201cif you only knew.\u201d (Tr. at 1291.)\n\n\u00b6 25 On cross-examination of L.G., the defense offered the dates and results of L.G.'s son's criminal cases, and the dates of appellant's representation in those cases, to impeach her testimony. In particular, the defense introduced court records indicating that her son had received only community control, rather than prison, in his appearance before the trial judge she identified as associating with appellant.\n\u00b6 26 In his testimony regarding his contact with L.G., appellant agreed that he had represented her son in a criminal case. He also noted that he had represented her personally in several criminal cases in 2006, as well as her other son during the same period. Appellant denied all allegations by L.G. regarding sexual conduct. He testified that his representation of her son ended when the son received probation in the cases on which appellant worked, but that she asked him to appear at sentencing involving the son's other case. On that occasion, appellant spoke briefly with L.G. before leaving after the son's current counsel, a public defender, arrived.\n\n\u00b6 27 Attorney Emily Huddleson testified for the defense regarding L.G.'s accusations. She stated that she was the public defender who represented L.G.'s son at the sentencing hearing in question. She testified that after sentencing, she and L.G. walked out in the lobby together, were met by an older woman, and the three discussed the sentence and the reasoning behind it for 20 or 30 minutes. Despite the fact that Huddleson was assigned counsel for all four cases involving L.G.'s son that day, L.G. complained to Huddleson that she had paid appellant a lot of money and felt he should still be there. Huddleson testified that appellant was initially present at the hearing but not there for the conclusion when the judge imposed a prison sentence on L.G.'s son. Huddleson described L.G. as furious after her son received prison time. Huddleson did not observe L.G. crying, being sick to her stomach, or going into a courthouse conference room with appellant or anyone else after the hearing.\n\n\u00b6 28 The fourth accuser to testify was K.R. K.R. testified that appellant represented K.R.'s boyfriend in a case in which he had been accused of domestic violence against K.R. Despite being the victim of the domestic violence at issue, K.R. met with appellant to pursue dropping the charges. Appellant subsequently represented K.R. in a criminal matter of her own. Before her trial in September 2008, K.R. testified they met in appellant's Marion office, where he offered her a drink, rubbed her shoulders, and began feeling her breasts. K.R. refused to have sex with appellant, whereupon appellant began masturbating in front of her. K.R. told her mother about the incident, and reported the incident to the bar association, police, and a judge of the Marion County common pleas court. After the incident, she obtained new representation. Despite the statement that she gave to police and court, she heard nothing more from local authorities. Her own criminal case concluded with a guilty plea and a one-year sentence in prison. The Columbus Bar Association referred her complaint to the Supreme Court of Ohio, and a representative of the Supreme Court interviewed her regarding her allegations. To her knowledge, nothing came of the matter. After\nlearning of appellant's 2013 arrest involving similar allegations, she contacted a detective with the Columbus police to renew her allegations in the matter.\n\n\u00b6 29} Regarding K.R., appellant testified that he recalled representing her in 2008, when they disagreed about a plea offer from the prosecution. She terminated representation when he refused to seek a continuance on what he felt were unwarranted medical grounds. He was later summoned to court for a pretrial and was requested by the prosecution and the judge to arrive early. When he arrived, the judge and prosecutor informed him that K.R. had reported a sexual assault. He withdrew from her case, and a new lawyer was appointed. Appellant denied any sexual misconduct with K.R.\n\n\u00b6 30} The final accuser to testify was L.M., who described a long history of coerced sexual relations with appellant. Her testimony with regard to dates was generally vague, and often established only by reference to the age of her young daughter, born in 1997, during the various incidents described.\n\n\u00b6 31} L.M. described her background as an immigrant from Venezuela with limited English. She came to America with her Venezuelan fianc\u00e9, and after they married in Florida he took a job in Ohio. She testified that she first retained appellant in late 1998 or early 1999 to represent her in divorce proceedings. She selected him based on his ability to communicate in Spanish. She also had difficulties with her immigration status, which was solely based on her then-husband's student visa, and appellant advised her to delay the divorce while dealing with these immigration issues. As a result, the divorce action went on for a considerable time, and L.M. met many times with appellant. She traveled from her home in Groveport, in southeast Franklin County, to appellant's office in Marion for these meetings, which appellant usually scheduled for Friday afternoon or Saturday. At first she brought her infant daughter along, but approximately three months after taking the case appellant requested that she not bring the child to meetings.\n\n\u00b6 32} The first incident she claimed occurred about four or five months after she retained appellant. She testified that during an office conference at appellant's Marion office, appellant offered L.M. a cup of coffee, and thereafter she lost consciousness. She awoke alone on appellant's office couch with her clothes in disarray and indications that she had experienced sexual intercourse. She felt confused, as if drugged or drunk. After a short time, appellant\nreturned to the room and told her she had fainted. As a result of this incident, L.M. avoided seeing appellant for the next two months.\n\n\u00b6 33 L.M. resumed contact with appellant after a series of phone calls from him in which he advised that she was at risk of deportation and would lose custody of her daughter. Around this time in 1999, appellant provided a tenant reference that helped L.M. move from Groveport to an apartment in Dublin, in northern Franklin County and thus closer to Marion. She claimed that she met again with appellant in his Marion office at this time, and another assault occurred. After briefly discussing her case, appellant suddenly approached her and pulled down his pants. Appellant threatened a poor result in her legal matters if she did not perform oral sex. He placed his hands behind her head, thereby \u201crestraining [her] head against his penis,\u201d told her to \u201cdo it,\u201d and forced his penis into her mouth. (Tr. at 1483.)\n\n\u00b6 34 L.M. testified that after that incident sexual conduct between appellant and L.M. was frequent over approximately the next three years, always under the implied threat that if he dropped her case she would lose her immigration status and custody of her daughter. These events first took place at appellant's Marion office, where appellant eventually hired her to do office work to help pay her legal bills. Later appellant kept a residential apartment in Marion and took her there. Some incidents also took place at her apartment in Dublin, where appellant would ask L.M. to lock her daughter in another room. Although L.M.\u2019s testimony did not provide details of any specific instances for most of the abuse occurring after the two specific incidents described above, she did testify in more detail about later events that formed the basis for two of the rape charges: sometime in 2000 or 2001, appellant drove L.M. in a white truck from his Marion office to a rural field where he forced her to have vaginal sex. Six months later, he repeated the offense.\n\n\u00b6 35 L.M. testified that around the time that her daughter was three and one-half or four years old, L.M. became pregnant by appellant and appellant insisted that she have an abortion. The last time she claimed she had sexual contact with appellant was 2003. This was the year in which she obtained her permanent U.S. residency, and with her immigration status settled she no longer felt compelled to submit to appellant's demands.\n\n\u00b6 36 L.M. learned of appellant's arrest in 2013 when her daughter emailed a link to a newspaper story. From this she learned that she was not the only person who claimed to suffer appellant's advances. After discovering this, L.M. called appellant to tell him that she was\nglad that the arrest would prevent him from taking advantage of other women. L.M. then contacted the Columbus police detective named in the news story to complain of the past incidents.\n\n\u00b6 37 On cross-examination, L.M. denied that appellant had ceased representing her in her divorce case by 2001. Defense counsel offered docket items to establish that a different attorney appeared on her behalf in the domestic action after that time. L.M. responded that many attorneys had represented her in different matters through this time, but she felt certain that appellant continued to act on her behalf. She acknowledged that her original divorce action was dismissed and she eventually divorced under a new case filed in 2003 by another attorney. She also acknowledged that, despite her professed hatred for appellant arising from past abuse, she had often approached appellant for informal assistance with legal or practical matters over the years during and after the abusive conduct. She stated that she viewed this assistance as repayment for past abuse: \u201cI wanted to take advantage of him because he abused me so\u2014for so long. * * * So he abusing [me] so long, so he has to do it for me.\u201d (Tr. at 1645.)\n\n\u00b6 38 Generally, appellant testified that he had a long-standing professional relationship with L.M., beginning when L.M. approached him for representation in a divorce matter. Even after his representation of her in her divorce matter terminated in approximately 2001, appellant testified L.M. repeatedly sought his assistance in several legal and non-legal matters. Regarding the duration of his legal representation, appellant testified that he filed L.M.\u2019s divorce paperwork in December 1999 and withdrew from representation in 2001. Other attorneys took her case thereafter. In 2004, appellant and his wife separated briefly, and appellant and L.M. dated for about two weeks. Appellant denied ever having any type of sexual contact with L.M. at any other time during their relationship. Their brief dating relationship ended abruptly when L.M. told appellant she was pregnant, and appellant, who had undergone a vasectomy, understood that she had been seeing other men. He denied arranging an abortion for her.\n\n\u00b6 39 The next witness was L.L., who was not the object of any indicted offenses, but testified as to appellant's conduct when he represented her in 2009 as she faced a murder charge. The defense objected unsuccessfully to this \u201cother acts\u201d evidence.\n\n\u00b6 40 L.L. testified that during one of her pre-trial meetings with appellant in a jailhouse conference room, appellant illustrated his views on witness credibility by stating that \u201che could rape [her] in\nthe room and it would be [her] word against his and nobody would be the wiser.\u201d (Tr. at 1794.) Appellant also stated on that occasion that L.L. could crawl under the table and perform oral sex on him because there were no correction officers around, and it would be only her word against his if she complained.\n\n\u00b6 41 In his testimony, appellant denied making any such comments to L.L.\n\n\u00b6 42 M.H. was another witness offered by the prosecution for \u201cother acts\u201d testimony, again over objection. M.H. testified that appellant represented her as her attorney for over a decade, beginning when she was 17 years old and incarcerated in the juvenile detention facility. Upon initial release, she and appellant met at his Marion office, went to dinner, and went back and had sex in his office. Over the ensuing 12 years, appellant represented M.H. on multiple cases but she never paid him. They continued to have sex during this time, and M.H. accompanied appellant on a vacation to Florida.\n\n\u00b6 43 Appellant testified that he met M.H. at the very beginning of his legal career, when he substituted for an attorney who had failed to appear at the Marion County Juvenile Center. M.H. was 17 and charged with a felony. She later approached appellant for representation in a divorce. Rather than going on a dinner date followed by sex, as described by M.H., appellant recalled that they had dinner with M.H.'s stepfather and mother, and he left that dinner meeting alone. Appellant adamantly denied ever having sex with M.H. He agreed that he continued to represent her in various criminal matters for 12 years after the initial case.\n\n\u00b6 44 C.P. testified over objection as the third and final \u201cother acts\u201d witness. She testified that she met appellant about handling her divorce. He did not do so because she eventually proceeded with a dissolution in another state. She then retained him to represent her boyfriend in a criminal case. C.P. acted as a liaison between the boyfriend and appellant while the boyfriend was incarcerated. During one jail call, which was recorded, C.P. told the boyfriend that appellant had slapped her buttocks while she was leaving appellant's office one day. Appellant learned of this conversation and told her he was upset about this both because it would create friction with his client and because he knew that all jailhouse calls were recorded. Later, after appellant was removed from the boyfriend's case because he was a potential witness, C.P. and appellant began a consensual sexual relationship. This continued intermittently until just prior to appellant's trial.\n\u00b6 45} Appellant's testimony with respect to C.P. denied any sexual conduct between them. He testified that in the course of his criminal defense practice, his office routinely obtained and reviewed audio discs of recorded jailhouse phone conversations involving many of his clients. After reviewing the recorded jailhouse phone call in which C.P. told her boyfriend that appellant had slapped or groped her buttocks, appellant asked for a meeting to explain why she would make such a false statement to his client. She stated that she was upset by reports of the boyfriend's past infidelity and merely wished to make the boyfriend jealous. He then advised her to be cautious with such conversations.\n\n\u00b6 46} In addition to his testimony addressing the specific accusations presented by the state's witnesses, appellant testified in his case-in-chief regarding his background. He stated that he graduated from Capital Law School in 1998 as an older, non-traditional student with a growing family. He clerked with an experienced criminal defense attorney in Marion, Ohio, during law school, and shared space in that office for one year after passing the bar. He then secured his own space and began his own practice in Marion and, eventually, in Columbus, Mansfield, and Cleveland. His practice, general at first, eventually focused on criminal defense with a smaller proportion of domestic and civil litigation. He testified that he believed the accusations against him were the result of a coordinated campaign by the Franklin County Prosecutor's Office, the Attorney General, and the Columbus police to remove him from the practice of law because of his effective advocacy in criminal cases.\n\n\u00b6 47} The defense presented testimony from several current or former female employees and clients of appellant's practice. These witnesses testified that they had never experienced or witnessed any misconduct by appellant. The defense also sought to attack the credibility of the accusers by introducing testimony, photographs, and documentary evidence that conflicted with the accuser's descriptions of appellant's office locations and interior furnishings.\n\n\u00b6 48} With respect to the charges involving L.M., the jury returned guilty verdicts on Count 10 of the indictment (rape), Count 14 of the indictment (kidnapping), and Counts 15, 16, 17, and 18 of the indictment (sexual battery). The court merged Counts 15 and 10 of the indictment for sentencing purposes, and the prosecution elected to sentence on Count 10 of the indictment for rape. The court declined to merge any other counts involving L.M., in particular,\nfinding that the rape and kidnapping counts, although arising out of the same transaction, were driven by a separate animus.\n\n\u00b6 49 The jury returned a guilty verdict on Count 2, public indecency, involving C.C. The trial court addressed this in a separate misdemeanor sentencing entry imposing 30 days jail time with full credit for time served.\n\nArmengau I, supra.\n\nUnder 28 U.S.C. 2254(e)(1) as enacted by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214)(the \"AEDPA\"), these findings of fact by the Tenth District are presumed to be correct by this Court unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. Warren v. Smith, 161 F.3d 358, 360-61 (6th Cir. 1998).\n\nIn evaluating state court findings of fact, this Court is limited to considering the evidence that was before the state courts. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170 (2011). On the basis of the Pinholster decision, the Magistrate Judge has excluded a number of exhibits tendered by Petitioner, all of them portions of indictments in other cases, which were not presented to the Ohio courts (See ECF Nos. 54, 55, 63, 71). Petitioner has objected (ECF No. 78), but Chief Judge Marbley has not yet resolved those Objections. Having reviewed the Objections, the Magistrate Judge notes that they argue Petitioner\u2019s case on the merits, but do not address the Pinholster bar. Petitioner offers the distinction that \u201cPinholster dealt with the petitioner's personal records that weren't demonstrative or comparative but rather related directly to the personal defense of the petitioner that would have been admissible in trial through testimony.\u201d However, the rule in Pinholster is not limited to the particular kinds of extra-record facts Pinholster tried to introduce in habeas, but applies broadly to all extra-record evidence.\n\nIn the course of these proceedings, Petitioner has often referred to the dissent of Judge Gary\nTyack\\(^2\\) in *Armengau I*. The Magistrate Judge notes that Judge Tyack dissented on issues of law and not from any of these findings of fact.\n\nOn August 7, 2015, Petitioner filed a motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial (State Court Record, ECF No. 77, Ex. 22). The trial court denied leave on a finding that Petitioner had not shown he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the new evidence he wished to present. *Id.* at Ex. 25. The Tenth District affirmed and the Supreme Court of Ohio denied review. *Id.* at Exs. 33, 36.\n\nOn September 19, 2017, Petitioner filed another motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial. *Id.* at Ex. 55. The trial court denied the motion, the Tenth District again affirmed, and the Supreme Court of Ohio again denied review. *Id.* at Exs. 58, 62, 65.\n\nOn January 16, 2018, prior to re-sentencing on remand, Petitioner moved to dismiss Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 29, arguing that he was convicted of crimes that were never presented to a grand jury and that he was actually innocent. (Presentence Motion for Dismissal, State Court Record, ECF No. 72-1, Ex. 70, PageID 9204-15). The trial court denied the motion. *Id.* at Ex. 72. The Tenth District affirmed.\\(^3\\) *State v. Armengau*, 2019-Ohio-101 (10th Dist. Mar. 21, 2019)(\u201c*Armengau II*\u201d), appellate jurisdiction declined, 157 Ohio St.3d 1405 (2019).\n\nOn March 27, 2018, pursuant to the Tenth District\u2019s remand, the trial court found that Counts 14 (kidnapping) and 17 (sexual battery) merged with Count 10 (rape) for the purposes of sentencing. The trial court imposed a four-year prison term for Count 15 (sexual battery) to run consecutively with Count 10. Armengau\u2019s previously imposed concurrent sentences of fifteen months each in prison for Counts 3 and 8, and thirty months each in prison for Counts 16 and 18 were ordered to remain in full force and effect. *Id.* at Ex. 77.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Return points out that Gary Tyack is now the elected prosecutor of Franklin County, Ohio. He will, however, be referred to in this Report as \u201cJudge Tyack,\u201d the capacity in which he was involved with this case.\n\n\\(^3\\) The panel on Armengau\u2019s first direct appeal were Judges Klatt, Sadler, and Tyack (dissenting); the panel on this second appeal were Judges Dorrian, Brown, and Luper Schuster.\nOn appeal, the Tenth District overruled Armengau\u2019s second assignment of error and determined that Armengau\u2019s third assignment of error was barred by the doctrines of res judicata and law of the case. The appellate court sustained Armengau\u2019s first assignment of error and remanded the matter to the trial court for resentencing on Count 15. *State v. Armengau*, 2020-Ohio-3552 (Ohio App. 10th Dist., Jun. 30, 2020) (*Armengau II*), appellate jurisdiction declined, 2020-Ohio-4811 (2020). That re-sentencing remains pending, but Magistrate Judge Deavers earlier decided that did not prevent the case from being ripe (ECF No. 40).\n\nPetitioner avers he placed his Petition in the prison mailing system on March 14, 2019 (Petition, ECF No. 1, PageID 126). This counts as the filing date. *Houston v. Lack*, 487 U.S. 266 (1988); *Cook v. Stegall*, 295 F.3d 517, 521 (6th Cir. 2002). Petitioner filed of right an Amended Petition on April 11, 2019 (ECF No. 7), and a Second Amended Petition with court permission on June 13, 2021 (ECF No. 70).\n\n**Positions of the parties:**\n\n**The Second Amended Petition**\n\nIn his Second Amended Petition (ECF No. 70), Petitioner pleads the following grounds for relief:\n\n**Ground One:** Petitioner was denied his Constitutional Rights to Due process and Fundamental Fairness when he was convicted, sentenced and resentenced upon insufficient evidence and convicted and resentenced for unindicted and uncharged alleged conduct in Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 in violation of the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and contrary to the United States Supreme Court's holding in *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307 (1979) and the Ohio Supreme Court's holdings in *State v. Hampton*, 2012-Ohio-5688 [footnote omitted; official citation 134 Ohio St.3d 44], *Knight v. State*, 54 Ohio St. 365 (1896), and *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St. 3d 259.\nSupporting Facts: Petitioner was indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged incidents that occurred in Columbus, Ohio (Franklin County) on unknown dates but sometime between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2008. During trial Petitioner established that he did not commit the indicted crimes. Prosecutors then, mid-trial, added three (3) years of unindicted and uncharged allegations to the indictment by amendment to circumvent the defense. After adding three (3) years to the indictment, Petitioner was able to establish that he could not have committed any of the indicted alleged crimes because by the relevant part of the expanded time frame, Petitioner had never been to the locations where the \"victims\" first claimed the indicted crimes occurred. Prosecutors then, mid-trial, changed the locations to Marion, Ohio, to circumvent the defense. No evidence was presented as to the elements of the factual incidents supporting the indictment.\n\nGround Two: Petitioner was denied his right to due process of law and notice of the specific offenses (charges) for which he was required to defend and for which he was convicted, sentenced and resentenced in Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Petitioner's Constitutional rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution were further violated where the charging document/instrument failed to adequately inform him of the specific crime for which he was indicted and for which he would be tried, convicted, sentenced and resentenced in Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.\n\nSupporting Facts: Petitioner was indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged incidents that occurred in Columbus, Ohio on unknown dates but sometime between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. During trial Petitioner established that he did not commit the indicted crimes. Prosecutors then added three (3) years of unindicted allegations to the indictment to circumvent the defense. After adding three years to the indictment, Petitioner was able to establish that he could not have committed any of the indicted alleged crimes because by the relevant part of the expanded time frame, Petitioner had never been to the locations where the alleged victims initially claimed the incidents occurred. Prosecutors then changed the locations to Marion, Ohio, mid-trial, to circumvent the defense. The indictment, jury instruction nor the verdict forms identify any specific factual basis for conviction. During trial prosecutors were substituting 404(B) and \"other act\" evidence for the charged crimes that were never mentioned prior to trial. Petitioner was ultimately being tried for factual bases that were not part of the indictment. During resentencing the trial court didn't know what factual basis was applied by prosecutors to any of the counts subject to resentencing and couldn't determine what incidents the jury considered and thereafter resentenced Petitioner to\nprison for alleged incidents that never resulted in conviction and which even prosecutors never asked the jury to consider. The Court of Appeals in 14 AP 679 confirmed that the alleged crimes for which Petitioner has supposedly been convicted were not the crimes for which he was indicted (\u00b6 56-61, June 22, 2017 decision). With regard to Counts 2 and 3, evidence was introduced which if believed allowed the jury to convict for an allegation that was \"other-act\" evidence. This alleged incident was not noticed in the indictment or bills of particulars. That claim was alleged to have occurred on April 10, 2013, at a different location. The probability that for Count 2 and 3 the jury considered the unindicted other-act of April 10, 2013 is supported by several facts. The jury acquitted Petitioner of the kidnapping with respect to the April 4th incident.\n\nAlthough legally not dispositive, logically and factually, the acquittal rendered the conviction for the April 4th alleged Gross Sexual Imposition an impossibility as the acquittal for the kidnapping negated the proof beyond a reasonable doubt required for \"force\" or \"threat of force\". In light of this fact, Petitioner's testimony, Jennifer Young's testimony, Leslie Todd's testimony and Shirley Koval's testimony, acknowledging that the alleged \"victim\" admitted her claims were untrue, the jury may have rejected the April 4th alleged incident and considered the April 10th allegation where the alleged \"victim\" testified that Petitioner squeezed her thigh several times and where Detective Jeff Ackley testified to witnessing and video-taping the incident. Ackley testified that while he video-taped the entire incident, due to a malfunction, the part where Petitioner was supposedly touching the alleged \"victim\" was not recorded. The indictment in Petitioner's case informed him of alleged offenses that he would not have to defend. Another fact that confirms the lack of constitutionally required notice, lack of unanimity, and violation of Petitioner's Sixth Amendment Apprendi claim is the material disagreement between what the Court of Appeals claims are the facts supporting Count 16 and the facts prosecutors assert support Count 16. The Court of Appeals claims that Count 16 is an alleged unspecified incident that occurred in Franklin County and prosecutors who indicted and tried the case assert that the incident supporting Count 16 occurred in Marion County, Ohio.\n\n**Ground Three:** Petitioner was denied his right to due process of law and protections against double jeopardy as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when the court allowed the state to constructively amend the indictment to add unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed conduct and where the trial court refused a requested unanimity instruction and failed to instruct the jury that the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard had to be applied to one factual incident and where after resentencing, Petitioner remains unable to plead a conviction or acquittal to Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 and where the factual basis for\nconviction cannot be determined as decided by the jury and where Petitioner has been resentenced for alleged crimes with which he was never charged and in several counts with crimes for which he wasn't even convicted.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** Petitioner was indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged incidents that occurred in Columbus, Ohio on unknown dates but sometime between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. The alleged \"victim\" in Counts 9-18 couldn't provide a date, week, month or year for any alleged assault. During trial Petitioner established that he did not commit the indicted crimes. Prosecutors then added three (3) years of unindicted allegations to the indictment to circumvent the defense. After adding three (3) years to the indictment, Petitioner was able to establish that he could not have committed any of the indicted alleged crimes because by the relevant part of the expanded time frame, Petitioner had never been to the locations where the \"victim\" initially claimed the indicted crimes occurred. Prosecutors then changed the locations to Marion, Ohio, rather than Columbus, Ohio, to circumvent the defense. The indictment, jury instructions nor the verdict forms identify any specific factual basis for conviction. During trial prosecutors were substituting other-act evidence for the charged crimes. The Court of Appeals confirmed that Petitioner was ultimately being tried for factual bases that were not part of the indictment. As Petitioner was able to present facts to defend the accusations, prosecutors simply kept amending the indictment and bill of particulars mid-trial to circumvent the defense. After trial and even after resentencing, Petitioner does not know what alleged facts resulted in conviction for any count for which Petitioner is imprisoned, according to the jury's findings. The Court of Appeals confirmed that the crimes for which Petitioner was convicted were not the alleged crimes for which he was indicted or charged. Petitioner was acquitted on Count 11, which is an identical charge to Count 10; Count 14 was indicted as the restraint involved in Count 9. The Court of Appeals confirmed that no evidence was presented of the indicted Count 9 and Count 14 incident. The trial court permitted prosecutors to arbitrarily reassign the Count 14 kidnapping to Count 10. Petitioner was not indicted with any kidnapping related to Count 10. The indictment in Petitioner's case informed him of alleged offenses that he would not have to defend. At resentencing on March 27, 2018, the trial court sentenced Petitioner on Count 15 to a consecutive term of imprisonment while Count 15 was represented by prosecutors to the jury in closing and the instructions as being the same incident as Count 18 for which the sentence had already been fully completed. After the serial amendments, the alleged victim in Counts 9-18 was still unable to assign a date, week, month, or even year to any of her allegations. The alleged \"victim\" in Counts 9-18, who first claimed to being raped repeatedly in Columbus, Ohio, between 2002 and 2008 (3 times per week for years), then changing her story mid-trial to being raped in Marion, Ohio, in 1998, 1999, or 2000, after being confronted with her\nown emails conceded she was initiating contact with Petitioner throughout the years and after moving to California in 2010, contacted Petitioner to provide him with her updated contact information. The alleged victim in Counts 9-18, in 2012 requested Petitioner go [to] California and offered for Petitioner to stay at her residence. Petitioner respectfully declined all of Ms. Melean's offers. On Count 8, the alleged victim was forced to change her initial story and the accusation to Marion, Ohio, rather than as indicted.\n\n**Ground Four:** Petitioner was denied his right to due process of law and protections against double jeopardy as guaranteed under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when the court failed to instruct the jury that the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard had to be applied to one factual incident and the jury instructions were constitutionally defective as they permitted the jury to consider and convict Petitioner of alleged crimes for which he was never charged, indicted or noticed [other-act] and where due to the defective instructions the trial court has resentenced Petitioner for alleged crimes for which no factual basis can be determined but that were clearly unindicted and in several counts for alleged crimes for which Petitioner wasn't even convicted.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** When Petitioner established that he did not commit any of the indicted crimes, prosecutors mid-trial changed not only the date range of the indictment to circumvent the defense, but then changed the locations to completely different locations after Petitioner established that he could not have committed the indicted alleged crimes because by the newly argued time frame, Petitioner had never been to the locations where the alleged crimes were supposedly committed according to the initial accounts provided by their \"victims.\" As Petitioner was able to present facts to defend the accusations, prosecutors simply kept amending the indictment and bill of particulars to circumvent the defense. After trial and even after resentencing, Petitioner does not know what alleged facts resulted in conviction for any count for which Petitioner is imprisoned. Whatever they may have been, the Court of Appeals confirmed that the crimes for which Petitioner was convicted were not the alleged crimes for which he was indicted or charged. While the trial court may have invoked jurisdiction for the specific offenses contained in the indictment for Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, none of the specific crimes in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, for which it obtained jurisdiction were ever presented to the jury. The trial court denied a requested unanimity instruction and the instructions allowed a non-unanimous verdict and a verdict upon uncharged alleged conduct.\n\n**Ground Five:** Petitioner was denied his rights to due process of law in violation of his state and federal constitutional rights as guaranteed to him by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when he was denied a fundamentally fair trial due\nto prosecutorial misconduct and where he was tried, convicted, and resented for convictions upon the admission of other-act evidence that was unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed prior to trial and which was presented by prosecutors to intentionally circumvent the defenses to the actually indicted alleged crimes.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** When Petitioner established that he did not commit the indicted crimes, prosecutors mid-trial changed not only the date range of the indictment to circumvent the defense but then changed the locations to completely different locations after Petitioner established that he could not have committed the indicted alleged crimes because by the newly argued time frame Petitioner had never been to the locations where the alleged victims claimed initially claimed the assaults were supposedly committed. As Petitioner was able to present facts to defend the accusations, prosecutors simply kept amending the indictment and bill of particulars throughout trial. Prosecutors continuously inserted allegations that were never disclosed, never indicted, or charged and allegations they confirmed in trial they never heard of until two weeks into trial. At one point in trial prosecutors advised the court and defense counsel that Petitioner would not have to defend a certain charge and later, after failing to present evidence on what they indicted, claimed the incident they acknowledged Petitioner didn't have to defend, was in fact one of the counts for consideration. After trial and even after resentencing, Petitioner does not know what alleged set of facts resulted in conviction for any crime for which Petitioner is imprisoned. None of the jury instructions identify or are confined to one factual incident. The jury instructions are devoid of any identifying fact for the jury to determine which alleged incident pertained to any count. The Court of Appeals confirmed prosecutors were substituting unindicted and uncharged allegations for alleged crimes that were indicted. To this day, prosecutors are unable to determine the alleged incidents for which Petitioner is imprisoned. In closing argument, prosecutors told the jury that Counts 15 through 18 were \"alternate\" theories of other counts. In their sentencing memorandum prosecutors told the jury the court that they \"did not rely on a single act to support multiple convictions.\". The conflicting statements confirms their inability to determine the alleged incident pertaining to any count and due to the prosecution\u2019s need to plug-in unindicted allegations to convict Petitioner, Petitioner was denied a fair trial as guaranteed under the United States Constitution as his counsel did not know what facts supported the counts in the indictment. Counsel repeatedly moved for a mistrial and advised the trial court that he was unprepared to defend any allegation prior to 2002 for Counts 9-18.\n\n**Ground Six:** Petitioner was denied his rights to due process of law as guaranteed to him under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when he was tried and convicted for crimes for which he was never charged or indicted or noticed and for\nwhich the court failed to obtain subject matter jurisdiction for alleged crimes that were never presented to the grand jury and that were never presented to Petitioner in any charging document.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** Petitioner was specifically indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged crimes that specifically occurred in Columbus, Ohio. Petitioner was not indicted or charged with any crime occurring anywhere else. As of the start of trial Petitioner was defending allegations that occurred in Columbus, Ohio, between 2002-2008. Once Petitioner proved he did not commit any of the charged and noticed crimes, prosecutors mid-trial inserted never alleged allegations of incidents each occurring at a different time and place than those indicted. The grand jury never heard of any of the alleged incidents for which Petitioner is imprisoned and Petitioner was never charged by any instrument for the alleged crimes for which he is now imprisoned. The indictment contained and informed Petitioner of specific offenses that he would not have to defend. The Court of Appeals confirmed the indicted offenses were not the offenses for which Petitioner stood trial and was convicted. Prosecutors midtrial conceded with respect to several counts that the alleged crimes they would later argue for conviction were unknown to them until after the case was indicted.\n\n**Ground Seven:** Petitioner was denied his right to Equal Protection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution when the Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court intentionally disregarded the law set by their respective courts and the United States Supreme Court in order to affirm the convictions and for which now after resentencing Petitioner is imprisoned for crimes for which he never committed and was never charged or noticed until midway through his trial and in several counts for which he wasn't even convicted.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** The state failed to prove that the crimes occurred in the County and State as alleged in the indictment for Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, which is a required element to be proven for conviction under Ohio law. The state did not prove that the alleged crimes occurred \"within the time frame alleged in the indictment\" which is also a requirement under Ohio law. State statutes and case-law set the elements to be proven and then the state is required to prove each of those elements. The state also changed the dates and locations of the charges after Petitioner established that he could not have committed the crimes for which he was indicted. The trial court failed to instruct the jury that they had to agree on one specific set of alleged facts for each count, notwithstanding counsel requesting the instruction. Prosecutors amended the indictment to add three (3) years of unindicted and uncharged conduct which is impermissible. Due to the Equal Protection challenge, Petitioner must reference at least in this section that state law and federal law as applied to other defendants\nunder identical facts has never allowed what has been permitted to occur in Petitioner's case. The holdings and rulings in Petitioner's case are contrary to established precedent. Any court that allows a defendant to be imprisoned for alleged crimes with which he was never charged or for which he was never convicted must violate a defendant's rights to equal protection as a matter of law.\n\n**Ground Eight:** Petitioner, an actually innocent prisoner, is imprisoned as a result of violations of state and federal law and his rights guaranteed by the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitutions.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** Regarding Counts 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, Petitioner was indicted for specific and then identifiable alleged crimes that occurred in Columbus, Ohio, between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. For every single referenced count, the state at trial presented absolutely no evidence related to the accusations identified in the indictment. Under the facts of Petitioner's case, Petitioner believes that when evidence of a specific crime that is identified in the indictment cannot be produced at trial, the failure to present any evidence of each indicted and charged crime must represent an accused's actual innocence. With regard to Counts 2 & 3, prosecutors inserted a second alleged incident that was unrelated to any alleged conduct occurring at a different location and at a different time after they realized that their corroborating witness, Shirley Koval, decided to testify for the defense. Based on the jury instructions, it cannot be determined which set of facts the jury elected to apply to Counts 2 and 3. This is not a case where the indictment reflected typographical errors or clerical mistakes. The Court of Appeals confirmed the state was permitted to substitute other-act 404(B) evidence for the indicted crimes they couldn't prove.\n\n**Ground Nine:** Petitioner was denied his right to a unanimous jury verdict in Counts 2, 3, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 when the trial court denied a requested jury instruction on unanimity and thereafter instructed the jury in a manner where individual jurors could select different alleged incidents for conviction that were uncharged and were admitted as other-act evidence. Unanimity independently affected Petitioner's resentencing as Petitioner has now been resentenced to prison for alleged crimes for which the jury never convicted and for which prosecutors didn't even request of the jury that it consider.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** Prosecutors were permitted to introduce without limitation as many other-act allegations as they needed and then select what \"other-acts\" they wished to apply to any count for which they were unable to prove the factual bases for the indicted crimes. Count 9 and Count 14, for example, were indicted as one factual incident. The Court of Appeals confirmed that no evidence was presented of the entire alleged incident. With no evidence presented at all of the indicted\nincident, Petitioner must be legally and factually innocent of that specific charge. Prosecutors mid-trial claimed that Count 9 was a never before mentioned \"drugging rape\". When defense counsel objected, the Court sustained the objection. At that juncture, prosecutors advised the Court that the \"drugging\" rape was not part of the indictment and was other-act evidence. Prosecutors notified the Court and defense counsel that the defense did not need to defend that charge. However, later in trial, when they were unable to procure any testimony of the underlying indicted incident for Count[s] 9 and 14, the trial court allowed prosecutors to then substitute the \"drugging\" rape incident, that prosecutors already acknowledged was not part of the indictment and Petitioner did not need to defend, for the count they couldn't prove based upon the evidence upon which Petitioner was indicted. With Count 10, the Court of Appeals confirmed that no factual incident was provided in the indictment.\n\nThe only facts regarding Count 10 were that the factual incident occurred in Franklin County and during 2002 and 2008. The Court of Appeals confirmed the factual basis for Count 10 changed from whatever had been indicted to an alleged incident in Marion, Ohio in either 1998, 1999, or 2000. The Court of Appeals confirmed Petitioner was not convicted of what originally supported Count 10. During resentencing on March 27, 2018, the trial court could not determine from the trial transcripts, opening, closing, jury instructions or verdict forms, which factual incidents applied to the respective counts for which Petitioner was being resentenced. The trial court actually resentenced Petitioner on Counts 15 and 18, for two incidents, when prosecutors argued to the jury in closing that Counts 15 and 18 were one incident. On Count 15 and 18, the trial court resentenced Petitioner for two incidents, supposedly occurring in Marion, Ohio, for which Petitioner was never convicted. In fact, prosecutors never requested of the jury that it consider the alleged incidents the court used to resentence Petitioner. A review of the indictment, opening statement, closing argument, jury instructions and verdict forms, the only parts of the record to which the jury had access, will confirm for this court that the factual incident(s) used by the Court to resentence Petitioner appear nowhere. Petitioner was resentenced on Count 10 for what the Court of Appeals confirmed was an uncharged factual basis. Comparing Counts 10 and 11, the jury may have acquitted Petitioner for whatever factual basis anyone believes resulted in conviction for Count 10. For Count 16, a review of the indictment, opening, closing, jury instructions and verdict forms confirms that prosecutors never even assigned an actual factual basis to that count. Perhaps confirming Petitioner's unanimity and due process argument, the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors don't agree on what facts support Count 16. The Court of Appeals believes that Count 16 was a factual incident that occurred in Franklin County while prosecutors believe Count 16 is a different incident that occurred in Marion County. Petitioner respectfully suggests that when the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors who are the ones who indicted\nand tried the case can't agree on what factual basis supports any count, there is clearly a due process, sufficiency, notice, double jeopardy, fair trial, and unanimity problem. A review of the same documents will further confirm that for Count 17, whatever the jury elected to apply to that count cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. The lack of unanimity impacted Petitioner's resentencing, notwithstanding any effort by the state courts to find that the jury's verdicts were unanimous. With Counts 8 through 18, Petitioner was indicted only with alleged crimes that occurred in Franklin County, Ohio, between 2002 and 2008. After what Court of Appeals coined \"Serial Amendments\", prosecutors then sought conviction for alleged \"other-acts\" that occurred in Marion County, Ohio, between 1998 and 2001. Defense counsel repeatedly sought a mistrial as he acknowledged being unprepared to defend any allegation prior to 2002 in Marion, Ohio. Petitioner had witnesses under subpoena for the locations and time frames identified in the indictment. Then Court of Appeals Judge Gary Tyack [footnote omitted] during oral arguments stated:\n\n\"So, that's part of what ties in here. Counsel has to prepare for a major trial based on what's in the indictment and bills of particulars. And, in this particular situation, all of a sudden you're mid-trial and the prosecution is throwing four (4) years of additional allegations in front of the jury and then arguing that the mere number of allegations is why this guy should be guilty of something . . . part of what you run into is you have no chance to create, to even investigate an alibi defense . . . for times that aren't alleged in the whole thing, you don't have a chance to tie down and bring in other witnesses . . . to contradict these folks. You just all of a sudden, you're in the middle of trial and the name of the game has changed . . . \". (Oral Arguments, August 23, 2016, 14 AP 679).\n\n**Ground Ten:** Petitioner was denied his right to trial by jury guaranteed under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution whereby facts forming the basis for conviction [footnote omitted] and sentence must be conclusively determined by a trial jury and where in Petitioner's case those facts were determined by trial and appellate judges.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** Prior to Petitioner's resentencing on March 27, 2018, Petitioner filed a motion with the trial court in advance of the proceedings requesting of the court that it confirm the factual incidents pertaining to the counts for which Petitioner was to be resentenced (10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18). The Court denied the motion. Since resentencing was to address allied offenses, Mr. Benton made the same request prior to the start of the hearing since in order to argue allied offenses the defense needed to know what facts the trial court was considering for each count. The court again denied the request. The court then resentenced Petitioner to\nprison for counts where the court could not determine the facts decided by the jury. Ultimately, the court sentenced Petitioner to prison for alleged crimes that were never even presented to the jury for conviction. Prosecutors were permitted to introduce without limitation as many other-act allegations as they needed and then select what \"other-acts\" they wished to apply to any count for which they were unable to prove the factual bases for the indicted crimes. Count 9 and Count 14, for example, were indicted as one factual incident. The Court of Appeals confirmed that no evidence was presented of the entire alleged incident. Prosecutors mid-trial claimed that Count 9 was a never before mentioned \"drugging rape\". However, earlier in trial, when defense counsel objected to that evidence, the Court sustained the objection. At that juncture, prosecutors advised the Court that the \"drugging\" rape was not part of the indictment and was other-act evidence. Prosecutors notified the Court and defense counsel that the defense did not need to defend that charge. Later in trial, when they were unable to procure any testimony of the underlying indicted incident for Count 9 and 14, the trial court allowed prosecutors to then substitute the \"drugging\" rape incident, that prosecutors already acknowledged was not part of the indictment for what they couldn't prove. With Count 10, the Court of Appeals confirmed that no factual incident was provided in the indictment. The only facts regarding Count 10 were that the factual incident occurred in Franklin County and during 2002 and 2008. The Court of Appeals confirmed the factual basis for Count 10 changed from whatever had been indicted to an alleged incident in Marion, Ohio, in either 1998, 1999 or 2000. During resentencing on March 27, 2018, the trial court could not determine from the trial transcripts, opening, closing, jury instructions, or verdict forms, which factual incidents applied to the respective counts for which Petitioner was being resentenced. The trial court actually resentenced Petitioner on Counts 15 and 18, for two incidents, when prosecutors argued to the jury in closing that Counts 15 and 18 were one incident. On Count 15 and 18, the trial court resentenced Petitioner for two incidents, supposedly occurring in Marion, Ohio, for which Petitioner was never convicted. In fact, the record confirms that prosecutors never requested of the jury that it consider the alleged incidents the court used to resentence Petitioner. A review of the indictment, opening statement, closing argument, jury instructions and verdict forms, the only parts of the record to which the jury had access, will confirm for this court that the factual incident(s) used by the Court to resentence Petitioner appear nowhere. Petitioner was resentenced on Count 10 for what the Court of Appeals confirmed was an uncharged factual basis. Comparing Counts 10 and 11, the jury may have acquitted Petitioner for whatever factual basis anyone believes resulted in conviction for Count 10. For Count 16, a review of the indictment, opening, closing, jury instructions, and verdict forms confirms that\nprosecutors never even assigned an actual factual basis to that count. Perhaps confirming Petitioner's unanimity, *Apprendi* and due process argument, the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors don't agree on what facts support Count 16. The Court of Appeals believes that Count 16 was a factual incident that occurred in Franklin County while prosecutors believe Count 16 occurred in Marion County. Petitioner respectfully suggests that when the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors who are the ones who indicted and tried the case can't agree on what factual basis supports any count, there is clearly a due process, sufficiency, notice, double jeopardy, fair trial, unanimity, and *Apprendi* problem. A review of the same documents will further confirm that for Count 17, whatever the jury elected to apply to that count cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. The lack of unanimity impacted Petitioner's resentencing, notwithstanding any effort by the state courts to find that the jury's verdicts were unanimous. With Counts 8 through 18, Petitioner was indicted only with alleged crimes that occurred in Franklin County, Ohio between 2002 and 2008. After what Court of Appeals coined \"Serial Amendments\", prosecutors then sought conviction for alleged \"other-acts\" that occurred in Marion County, Ohio between 1998 and 2001.\n\nSecond Amended Petition, ECF No. 70, PageID 7639-62.\n\n**The Warden\u2019s Return**\n\n**Non-Cognizable Claims**\n\n**Venue**\n\nThe Warden asserts that, to the extent Petitioner is complaining of the venue of trial (Franklin County), his claim is not cognizable under the United States Constitution (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13877-80). In this same section, the Warden argues \u201cArmengau had no federal constitutional right to prove [sic] \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 that the crimes for which he was convicted were committed in Franklin County, Ohio.\u201d *Id.* at PageID 13879.\n\n**Other Acts Evidence**\n\nTo the extent Petitioner claims \u201cother acts\u201d evidence was improperly admitted against him,\nthe Warden asserts this claim is also not cognizable. *Id.* at PageID 13880-81.\n\n**Improper Indictment**\n\nThe Warden notes Petitioner\u2019s claim in Grounds Two and Six that the indictment in this case \u201cfailed to inform him of the nature of the charges, and the trial court failed to obtain subject matter jurisdiction for crimes were never presented to the grand jury or in any charging instrument.\u201d (ECF No. 73, PageID 13881, quoting Second Amended Petition, ECF No. 70, PageID 8641-42 and 7651-52). Noting that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s grand jury guarantee does not apply to the States, the Warden asserts this claim is non-cognizable. (ECF No. 73, PageID 13881, citing *Hurtado v. California*, 110 U.S. 516, 537-538 (1884); and *Branzburg v. Hayes*, 408 U.S. 665 (1972)).\n\n**Lack of Specificity in the Indictment**\n\nThe Warden asserts Petitioner\u2019s claim of lack of specificity in the indictment is also not cognizable (ECF No. 73, PageID 13883-87).\n\n**Jury Instruction Error**\n\nThe Warden notes Petitioner claims in his Fourth Ground for Relief that the trial court committed error in instructing the jury and asserts jury instruction error is not ordinarily cognizable in habeas (ECF No. 73, PageID 13887-89).\n\n**State Law Claims**\n\nThe Warden notes \u201cIn his seventh ground for relief, Armengau alleges an equal protection violation when the Ohio courts \u201cintentionally disregarded the law set by their respective Courts.\u201d\n(ECF No. 73, PageID 13889, quoting Second Amended Petition, ECF No. Doc. No. 70, PageID 7653-54). The Warden argues this claim is also not cognizable in habeas. *Id.* at PageID 13889-90.\n\n**Actual Innocence**\n\nThe Warden asserts Petitioner\u2019s actual innocence claim in Ground for Relief Eight is not cognizable in habeas. *Id.* at PageID 13890-91.\n\n**Affirmative Defenses**\n\n**Procedural Default**\n\nThe Warden asserts Armengau has procedurally defaulted claims in Ground One related to Counts 2 and 16 because they were not fairly presented to the state courts as federal constitutional claims (ECF No. 73, PageID 13896). He makes the same assertion as to Ground Two respecting Counts 2, 3, and 8. Regarding \u201cother acts\u201d evidence, the Warden asserts that claim was presented to the state courts as a trial court error, but is presented here as a prosecutorial misconduct claim. *Id.*\n\nThe Warden further asserts Armengau\u2019s jury instructions claim in Ground Four is procedurally defaulted for failure to make a contemporaneous objection. *Id.* at PageID 13898-902.\n\nPetitioner asserts he raised Grounds One through Seven and Ground Nine in his postconviction motion for dismissal. The Tenth District held these claims were barred, at least in part, by Ohio\u2019s doctrine of *res judicata* in criminal cases. The Warden asserts this procedural default as a bar (ECF No. 73, PageID 13902-04).\n\nAs to Ground Nine on jury unanimity, the Warden asserts it is procedurally defaulted by Armengau\u2019s failure to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio from denial of the claim by the Tenth\nDistrict (ECF No. 73, PageID 13904-05).\n\nRespondent reads Ground Ten as alleging \u201cthat the facts purporting to form the factual basis for his conviction and sentence were determined by judicial fact-finding and not by the jury.\u201d (ECF No. 73, PageID 13906, citing ECF No. 70, PageID 7661-62). Respondent asserts this claim is also barred by res judicata. Id.\n\nThe Warden also responds on the merits to Petitioner\u2019s first, seventh, ninth, and tenth grounds for relief (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13907-21).\n\n**Petitioner\u2019s Reply**\n\n**Fair Presentation**\n\nPetitioner first argues that he has fairly presented all his claims to the Ohio courts (ECF No. 77, PageID 13929-32). As relevant precedent for what constitutes \u201cfair presentation,\u201d he relies repeatedly on *Gartrell v. Lynaugh*, 833 F. 2d 527 (5th Cir. 1987). There is, however, published precedent from the Sixth Circuit which is thirty years newer than *Gartrell* and holds a claim is fairly presented if the petitioner\n\n(1) relied upon federal cases employing constitutional analysis; (2) relied upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis; (3) phrased the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional right; or (4) alleged facts well within the mainstream of constitutional law.\n\n*Hand v. Houk*, 871 F.3d 390, 418 (6th Cir. 2017).\n\nPetitioner complains that the record is incomplete:\n\n---\n\n4 Petitioner timely filed his Reply on July 27, 2021 (ECF No. 77). Because of its extraordinary length (226 pages), the Court granted Petitioner leave to file a summary which he did on August 2, 2021 (ECF No. 81). These two documents will be read together as Petitioner\u2019s Reply.\nthe docket (PageID 6914-6921) establishes that Petitioner filed multiple Notices of Supplemental Authority and Motions for Leave to File Supplemental Authority, all which were granted. From what Petitioner has received, none of those documents are in the record filed with this Court.\n\n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13928, n. 2). Magistrate Judge Deavers\u2019 Order for Answer required the Warden to file an answer conforming to the requirements of Rule 5 of the Rules Governing \u00a7 2254 Cases (ECF No. 8, PageID 239). Rule 5 does not require the Respondent to file in the habeas court a copy of everything filed in the state courts. To the extent that something is omitted which a petitioner believes is necessary for decision of the case, a petitioner may move to expand the record under Habeas Rule 7.\n\nPetitioner complains that \u201cseveral documents from the record appear not to have been filed or provided to Petitioner pursuant to this Court's May 27th and/or 28th, 2021 Order (Doc. 61, 62).\u201d Actually ECF No. 61 strikes the appearance of attorney John Gonzalez who purported to be appearing in a capacity not permitted by this Court\u2019s Local Rules. Petitioner cites a number of additional documents he says he has not received (ECF No. 77, PageID 13929), but the record had not been ordered expanded to include those documents as of the time the Reply was filed. Regarding these documents, the Magistrate Judge has ordered either that the record be expanded to include them or that Respondent provides reference to where they appear (ECF No. 86) and the Warden has responded as ordered (ECF No. 92).\n\n**Petitioner\u2019s Statement of Facts**\n\nThe Reply next contains a Statement of Facts, which appears to be an argumentative summary of the evidence from Petitioner\u2019s perspective (ECF No. 77, PageID 13932-46). With\nrespect to findings of fact, this habeas Court is bound by state court findings, including those made by the Tenth District Court of Appeals, unless Petitioner shows those findings to be in error by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e). That showing must be made from evidence already of record in the state court proceedings. Pinholster, supra. That is to say, this habeas court cannot make a de novo determination of the facts.\n\nRepeatedly in his Statement of Facts, Petitioner makes assertions of fact with no record reference. This violates Magistrate Judge Deavers\u2019 Order for Answer which requires \u201cAll papers filed in the case thereafter [after filing of the State Court Record] by each party shall include record references to the PAGEID number.\u201d (ECF No. 8, PageID 240). At PageID 13935-36, Petitioner purports to repeat comments made to the media by a Major Randy Caryer of the Marion Police. At PageID 13937, n.8, he purports to present facts that occurred September 17, 2008, in a court in Marion, Ohio, involving accuser K.R. At PageID 13938, n. 11, he asserts that \u201c[d]uring multiple pretrial hearings prosecutors repeatedly affirmed that all the alleged incidents with regards to these counts occurred in Petitioner's Columbus Office.\u201d On the same page he asserts that accuser L.M.\u2019s account of her referral to him is incorrect. At PageID 13939, he asserts accuser L.M. \u201cwas charged criminally for beating her young daughter in 2003 (Trial Exhibit H-5, Case No. 2003 CRB 8472, Domestic Violence Case Number).\u201d Whether this is a reference to a trial exhibit in this case or in the domestic violence case, the exhibit is not in the record. Petitioner also relies on an affidavit by a Diane Caldwell attached to his Petition (ECF No. 1, Ex. D. This Affidavit was not part of the State Court Record and this Court is therefore barred from considering it by Pinholster.\nNon-Cognizable Claims\n\nPetitioner asserts that he submitted his sufficiency of the evidence claim on direct appeal and the Tenth District elected instead to decide that claim as if it were about venue. Petitioner argues his case \u201crepresents an unreasonable application of federal and state law and an unreasonable determination of facts based on the record. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254 (d)(1) and (d)(2)\u201d (ECF No. 77, PageID 13949). That is not the correct standard. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), the state courts\u2019 decisions on claims of federal constitutional violations are entitled to deference unless they are contrary to or objectively unreasonable applications of United States Supreme Court precedent. On the other hand, we do not sit as an appellate court to decide whether any state court committed an error of state law. Instead, we are bound by state court determinations of state law. Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U.S. 74 (2005).\n\nPetitioner then, under this heading of Non-Cognizable Claims argues the merits of his Grounds for Relief for 159 pages as follows: Ground One at PageID 13948-14005; Ground Two at PageID 14005-36; Grounds Three and Six, argued together at PageID 14036-81; Ground Four at PageID 14081-86; Ground Seven at PageID 14087-91; Ground Eight at PageID 14091-95; Ground Nine at PageID 14095-104; and Ground Ten at PageID 14105-07.\n\n5 Throughout these 50+ pages, Petitioner repeatedly cites to the exhibits attached to ECF No. 54. The Magistrate Judge has twice held these exhibits cannot be added to the record (ECF Nos. 64 and 71, based on Pinholster, supra.) Petitioner has objected to both of those decisions. S. D. Ohio Civ. R. 72.3 provides \u201cWhen an objection is filed to a Magistrate Judge\u2019s ruling on a non-case dispositive motion, the ruling remains in full force and effect unless and until it is (1) stayed by the Magistrate Judge or a District Judge, or (2) overruled by a District Judge.\u201d Since the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Pinholster ruling remains in effect, the exhibits will not be considered in rendering this Report.\nExhaustion, Procedural Default, and Waiver\n\nPetitioner argues that he has exhausted all available state court remedies and that he has neither procedurally defaulted nor waived any of his claims (ECF No. 77, PageID 14107-33).\n\nResentencing\n\nPetitioner contends that \u201cwhatever may have been used to determine the facts for the counts upon which Petitioner was resentenced, was obtained from uncharged other-acts\u201d (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14133).\n\nIt appears that the trial court at resentencing considered facts for each count that were different from the facts considered by the Court at the time of sentencing and which were different than the facts considered by the jury for conviction. A court is without jurisdiction to impose a sentence for an offense not charged in the indictment. United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 [(2002)].\n\nId. at PageID 14134. And again\n\nAt resentencing on March 27, 2018, the defense requested the Court provide the parties with the underlying factual basis for each count for which Appellant was convicted so that the defense could properly argue the respective sentencing issues (Doc. 28-3, PageID 6541, Tp. 15). The trial court refused the request and failed to provide the facts underlying each count.\n\nId. at PageID 14142.\n\nClaims and Issues Assertedly Not Challenged or Addressed by Respondent\n\nPetitioner asserts there are some claims he has made which Respondent has not addressed. \u201cAside from some general reference Respondent does not appear to provide any specific analysis\nto Petitioner's claims of Fair Trial, Prosecutorial Misconduct, or constructive amendment of the charging document.\u201d (ECF No. 77, PageID 14147).\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe following table sets forth the relationships, as the Magistrate Judge understands them, between accusers, counts of the Indictment and the verdicts.\n\n| Accuser | Counts Charged | Verdict |\n|---------|----------------|---------|\n| CC      | 1, 2, 3        | Guilty on Count 2 \u2013 sentenced to time served Acquitted on Counts 1 & 3 |\n| LG      | 4, 5           | Acquitted |\n| AC      | 6, 7           | Acquitted |\n| KR      | 8              | convicted |\n| LM      | 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 | Guilty on 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 & 18 (5 & 10 merged) \u00b6 48 Acquitted on 9, 11, 12, 13 |\n\n**Ground One: Conviction on Insufficient Evidence**\n\nIn his First Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he was convicted on insufficient evidence on Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. As noted above, because Petitioner\u2019s custody on Count 2 ended before he filed his Petition, any claims regarding that count are no longer cognizable in habeas corpus and Count Two will not be considered further. *Maleng v. Cook*, 490 U.S. 488 (1989).\n\nAn allegation that a verdict was entered upon insufficient evidence states a claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307 (1979); *In re Winship*, 397 U.S. 358 (1970); *Johnson v. Coyle*, 200 F.3d\n987, 991 (6th Cir. 2000); Bagby v. Sowders, 894 F.2d 792, 794 (6th Cir. 1990)(en banc). In order for a conviction to be constitutionally sound, every element of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship, 397 U.S. at 364.\n\n[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt . . . . This familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\n\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. at 319; Smith v. Nagy, 962 F.3d 192, 205 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Jackson). This standard \u201cmust be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.\u201d Id. (quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 324). This rule was recognized in Ohio law at State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St. 3d 259 (1991). Of course, it is state law which determines the elements of offenses; but once the state has adopted the elements, it must then prove each of them beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship, supra.\n\nIn cases such as Petitioner\u2019s challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and filed after enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214)(the \u201cAEDPA\u201d), two levels of deference to state decisions are required:\n\nIn an appeal from a denial of habeas relief, in which a petitioner challenges the constitutional sufficiency of the evidence used to convict him, we are thus bound by two layers of deference to groups who might view facts differently than we would. First, as in all sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges, we must determine whether, viewing the trial testimony and exhibits in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979). In doing so, we do not reweigh the evidence, re-evaluate the credibility of witnesses, or substitute our judgment for that of the jury. See United States v. Hilliard, 11 F.3d 618, 620 (6th Cir. 1993). Thus, even though we might have not voted to convict a defendant had we participated in jury deliberations, we must uphold\nthe jury verdict if any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty after resolving all disputes in favor of the prosecution. Second, even were we to conclude that a rational trier of fact could not have found a petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, on habeas review, we must still defer to the state appellate court's sufficiency determination as long as it is not unreasonable. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2).\n\nBrown v. Konteh, 567 F.3d 191, 205 (6th Cir. 2009). In a sufficiency of the evidence habeas corpus case, deference should be given to the trier-of-fact's verdict under Jackson v. Virginia and then to the appellate court's consideration of that verdict, as commanded by AEDPA. Tucker v. Palmer, 541 F.3d 652 (6th Cir. 2008); accord Davis v. Lafler, 658 F.3d 525, 531 (6th Cir. 2011)(en banc); Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. 37, 43 (2012).\n\nWe have made clear that Jackson claims face a high bar in federal habeas proceedings because they are subject to two layers of judicial deference. First, on direct appeal, \"it is the responsibility of the jury -- not the court -- to decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial. A reviewing court may set aside the jury's verdict on the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could have agreed with the jury.\" Cavazos v. Smith, 565 U. S. 1, ___, 132 S. Ct. 2, 181 L. Ed. 2d 311, 313 (2011) (per curiam). And second, on habeas review, \"a federal court may not overturn a state court decision rejecting a sufficiency of the evidence challenge simply because the federal court disagrees with the state court. The federal court instead may do so only if the state court decision was 'objectively unreasonable.'\" Ibid. (quoting Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___, 130 S. Ct. 1855, 176 L. Ed. 2d 678 (2010)).\n\nColeman v. Johnson, 566 U.S. 650, 651, (2012)(per curiam); Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. 37, 43 (2012) (per curiam). The federal courts do not make credibility determinations in reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims. Brooks v. Tennessee, 626 F.3d 878, 887 (6th Cir. 2010). Thompson v. Skipper, 981 F.3d 476 (6th Cir., 2020). \u201cTo evaluate a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, we consider \u2018whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 Smith v. Nagy, 962 F.3d 192, 205 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia,\n443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979)). This standard \u201cmust be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.\u201d Id. (quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 324).\u201d\n\nThe state court\u2019s application \u201cmust be \u2018objectively unreasonable,\u2019 not merely wrong; even \u2018clear error\u2019 will not suffice.\u201d Nagy, 962 F.3d at 199 (quoting White v. Woodall, 572 U.S. 415, 419 (2014)). In other words, \u201crelief is available under \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2019s unreasonable-application clause if, and only if, it is so obvious that a clearly established rule applies to a given set of facts that there could be no \u2018fairminded disagreement\u2019 on the question.\u201d Woodall, 572 U.S. at 427 (quoting Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 103 (2011)).\n\nTogether, Jackson and AEDPA\u2019s two layers of deference dictate that \u201ca federal court\u2019s \u2018review of a state-court conviction for sufficiency of the evidence is very limited.\u2019\u201d Tackett v. Trierweiler, 956 F.3d 358, 367 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Thomas v. Stephenson, 898 F.3d 693, 698 (6th Cir. 2018)).\n\nA habeas court cannot consider post-trial evidence in deciding a Jackson v. Virginia claim. McDaniel v. Brown, 558 U.S. 120 (2010).\n\nIn order to demonstrate that the state court's decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts under \u00a7 2254(d)(2), a petitioner must both establish the \"unreasonable determination\" and show \"that the resulting state court decision was 'based on' that unreasonable determination.\"\n\nTitlow v. Burt, 680 F.3d 577, 585 (6th Cir. 2012)(rev\u2019d on another issue Burt v. Titlow, 571 U.S. 12, 20 (2013). quoting Rice v. White, 660 F.3d 242, 250 (6th Cir. 2011).\n\nPetitioner does not state in the Second Amended Petition itself what elements of the convicted crimes were not supported by sufficient evidence. However, in his Reply he claims the State failed to prove that the location of the offenses with which he was charged was in Franklin\nCounty, Ohio, as alleged in the Indictment (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13949). He asserts the Tenth District Court of Appeals, in order \u201cto avoid reversing the convictions, . . . simply ignored the sufficiency issue raised by Petitioner.\u201d Further, he claims, the \u201clocation of the crime charged is a material \"fact\" that the state is required to prove.\u201d *Id.* citing *Knight v. State*, 54 Ohio State 365 (1896) [the location of the crime is an essential fact and essential element that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt because it is the place of the commission of the offense charged].\n\nPetitioner correctly notes that it is state law which determines the elements of a crime which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to satisfy the *Jackson* standard (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13950, citing *In re Winship*, 397 U.S. 358 (1970)).\n\nPetitioner asserts he presented this location-of-the-crime claim to the Tenth District on direct appeal, but that court decided a different claim, a location-of-the-trial claim (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13950-52).\n\nOn appeal Armengau presented the relevant sufficiency of the evidence claim as Assignment of Error VI:\n\n[VI.] The trial court erred in denying Javier Armengau's Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, and violated his rights to due process and a fair trial when, in the absence of sufficient evidence, it convicted him of counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18.\n\n*Armengau I* at \u00b6 53, quoting Armengau\u2019s appellate brief (State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 8).\n\nThe Brief sets forth the following Issue Presented for Review as to this Assignment of Error: \u201cIs a conviction based upon insufficient evidence when venue is not proved beyond a reasonable doubt as charged in the indictment?\u201d *Id.* at PageID 7730. Thus Petitioner himself (through counsel) characterized the issue presented as one of \u201cvenue.\u201d\n\nIn arguing Assignment of Error VI, Petitioner made it clear that his objection was that the State had presented no evidence that the offenses alleged in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18\nwere committed in Franklin County as alleged in the indictment. *Id.* at PageID 7857. That was because, he claimed, \"'Venue'\" has two applications-locale and element. Locale venue is governed by R.C. 2901.12. But that statute has no impact on element venue. Element venue is controlled by the indictment and the evidence,\" *Id.* at PageID 7859, relying on *State v. Hampton*, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24 (2012).\n\nThe Tenth District decided Assignment of Error VI as follows:\n\n**Venue**\n\n\u00b6 104 Appellant's sixth assignment of error asserts that appellant's convictions under Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the indictment must be reversed because the state failed to present evidence to support venue for those crimes as charged in the indictment, and the trial court accordingly erred in denying appellant's Crim.R. 29 motion made after the state rested. We disagree.\n\n\u00b6 105 Under Crim.R. 29(A), a court \u201cshall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses * * * if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.\u201d Because a Crim.R. 29 motion questions the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c[w]e apply the same standard of review to Crim.R. 29 motions as we use in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence.\u201d *State v. Hernandez*, 10th Dist. No. 09AP-125, 2009-Ohio-5128, 2009 WL 3090423, \u00b6 6; *State v. Tenace*, 109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-Ohio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, \u00b6 37; *State v. Hubbard*, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-945, 2013-Ohio-2735, 2013 WL 3341171, \u00b6 16. \u201cSufficiency of the evidence is a legal standard that tests whether the evidence introduced at trial is legally sufficient to support a verdict.\u201d *State v. Cassell*, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-1093, 2010-Ohio-1881, 2010 WL 1731238, \u00b6 36, citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must determine \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. Where the evidence, \u201cif believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d it is sufficient to sustain a conviction. *Id.; see also State v. Neil*, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-981, 2016-Ohio-4762, 2016 WL 3574549, \u00b6 94;\n1. Legal Standards\n\n{\u00b6 106} Venue commonly refers to the appropriate place of trial for a criminal prosecution within a state. \u201c[J]urisdiction and venue are not the same, as the former denotes the power of the court to hear the case and the latter denotes the situs of trial.\u201d State v. Giffin, 62 Ohio App.3d 396, 403, 575 N.E.2d 887 (10th Dist. 1991), citing State v. Loucks, 28 Ohio App.2d 77, 274 N.E.2d 773 (4th Dist. 1971). Proper venue insures that \u201cthe state [does not] indiscriminately [seek] a favorable location for trial or [select] a site that might be an inconvenience or disadvantage to the defendant.\u201d State v. Meridy, 12th Dist. No. CA2003-11-091, 2005-Ohio-241, 2005 WL 123993, \u00b6 12, quoting State v. Gentry, 61 Ohio Misc.2d 31, 34, 573 N.E.2d 220 (1990). The fact that venue is not a restriction on territorial jurisdiction is underscored by the provisions of Crim. R. 18(B) and R.C. 2901.12(K), which provide for a change of venue if the trial court finds that a fair and impartial jury cannot be seated in the court where the action is pending.\n\n{\u00b6 107} Because venue is neither a jurisdictional nor a material element of a criminal offense, the indictment is only required to contain an allegation that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the court. State v. Andrews, 148 Ohio App.3d 92, 772 N.E.2d 167 (10th Dist. 2002). Even when multiple offenses are alleged in an indictment, an indictment is not rendered invalid where the \u201cplace has been stated once therein.\u201d State v. Williams, 53 Ohio App.3d 1, 557 N.E.2d 818 (10th Dist. 1988). While venue is not a material element of the offense as charged, it is a fact that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt unless waived by a criminal defendant. State v. Hampton, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, 2012-Ohio-5688, 983 N.E.2d 324, \u00b6 22; State v. Birt, 2013-Ohio-1379, 5 N.E.3d 1000, \u00b6 27. \u201cVenue need not be proven in express terms; it may be established either directly or indirectly by all the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d State v. Jackson, 141 Ohio St.3d 171, 2014-Ohio-3707, 23 N.E.3d 1023, \u00b6 144.\n\n{\u00b6 108} The indictment in the present case alleged for each count that the criminal conduct occurred \u201cwithin the county of Franklin.\u201d (May 20, 2013 Indictment, Counts 1 through 18.) Appellant argues that for all but three of the counts for which he was convicted, the state failed to prove venue because it introduced no evidence at all that the crimes occurred in Franklin County: for Counts 8 (gross sexual imposition, K.R.), 10 (rape, L.M.), 14 (kidnapping, L.M.),\nand 15, 17, and 18 (sexual battery, L.M.), the only evidence heard placed the offenses in Marion County. In contrast, for Counts 2 and 3 (public indecency and gross sexual imposition, C.C.), and Count 16 (sexual battery, L.M.), appellant concedes on appeal that the evidence supported venue in Franklin County. At the close of the state's case, the defense moved, unsuccessfully, for a Crim.R. 29 acquittal for those incidents for which the evidence established the location as Marion County. Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his Crim.R. 29 motion.\n\n\u00b6 109 The state responds that any deficiency in the indictment was cured by subsequent amendment of either the indictment or the bill of particulars. We disagree. It is the language of the indictment that defines the venue for which the state bears the burden of proof. Hampton, supra, at \u00b6 23. As stated above, the original indictment specified Franklin County as venue for all crimes. The state never amended the venue allegation in the indictment. Therefore, the state had to prove that venue was proper in Franklin County.\n\n\u00b6 110 The state also argues that all crimes took place as part of a course of criminal conduct across several jurisdictions, including Franklin County, establishing venue in Franklin County under the course of criminal conduct terms of R.C. 2901.12(H). We conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence to prove venue under the course of criminal conduct provisions in R.C. 2901.12(H).\n\n2. Venue and Course of Criminal Conduct\u2013R.C. 2901.12(H)\n\n\u00b6 111 When an offender, as part of a course of criminal conduct, commits offenses in different jurisdictions, the offender may be tried for all of those offenses in any jurisdiction in which one of those offenses or any element of one of those offenses occurred. R.C. 2901.12(H). To establish a course of criminal conduct, the statute provides in relevant part:\n\n(H) * * * Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the course of criminal conduct, any of the following is prima-facie evidence of a course of criminal conduct:\n(1) The offenses involved the same victim, or victims of the same type or from the same group.\n(2) The offenses were committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, or capacity, or relationship to another.\n(3) The offenses were committed as part of the same transaction or chain of events, or in furtherance of the same purpose or objective.\n(4) The offenses were committed in furtherance of the same conspiracy.\n(5) The offenses involved the same or a similar modus operandi.\n(6) The offenses were committed along the offender's line of travel in this state, regardless of the offender's point of origin or destination.\n\nR.C. 2901.12(H).\n\n\u00b6 112 \u201cR.C. 2901.12(G) and (H) are statutory reflections of the modern mobility of criminals to perform unlawful deeds over vast geographical boundaries.\u201d State v. Draggo, 65 Ohio St.2d 88, 90, 418 N.E.2d 1343 (1981). Consistent with this multi-county venue, \u201ca grand jury of one county has authority to indict on offenses occurring in other counties provided that those offenses are part of a course of criminal conduct.\u201d State v. Ahmed, 8th Dist. No. 84220, 2005-Ohio-2999, 2005 WL 1406282, \u00b6 11. The Supreme Court of Ohio confirmed the law as stated in Ahmed when it decided Jackson at \u00b6 131:\n\nThere is no constitutional or statutory provision that prohibited the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury from indicting Jackson for offenses that occurred in Erie and Lorain Counties as part of a course of criminal conduct that included crimes within Cuyahoga County. R.C. 2901.11 and 2901.12 permit a grand jury to indict an offender for offenses that occurred outside the county, provided that the offenses are part of the same course of criminal conduct that took place in the county in which the grand jury resides.\n\n\u00b6 113 The present case involves a series of offenses that fit four of the criteria enumerated in R.C. 2901.12(H). The victims were \u201cof the same type, or from the same group\u201d under R.C. 2901.12(H)(1), because they are associated with appellant's law practice as clients, relatives of clients, or employees. The offenses were committed \u201cin the offender's same employment, or capacity, or relationship to another\u201d under R.C. 2901.12(H)(2), again based on the centrality of appellant's law practice in his selection of victims. The offenses involved \u201cthe same or similar modus operandi\u201d under R.C. 2901.12(H)(5), based on the grooming and exploitation of vulnerable female clients or relatives of clients. Finally, the offenses\nwere committed in furtherance of the same purpose or objective (sexual gratification). R.C. 2901.12(H)(3).\n\n\u00b6 114 A similar case involving abuse of clients in a professional practice is persuasively on point. In Ahmed, the defendant, a licensed obstetrician and gynecologist, operated medical offices in several counties. The grand jury in Cuyahoga County returned an indictment charging him with multiple counts of rape, sexual imposition, and sexual battery involving 37 former patients. The indictment specified that the offenses occurred at Ahmed's offices in Cuyahoga, Summit, and Geauga counties. After disposing of the preliminary question of whether the grand jury could return an indictment addressing the out-of-county crimes, the Eighth District Court of Appeals found that trial venue in Cuyahoga County for all offenses was appropriate: \u201cThe evidence at trial revealed that all of the victims were Ahmed's patients, all of the offenses occurred at his medical offices while the victims were seeking medical care from him, and while situated in a vulnerable position. Further, each victim identified the office location where the offense(s) occurred. Based on this evidence, we find that the State adequately proved that venue was proper.\u201d Ahmed at \u00b6 18.\n\n\u00b6 115 Ahmed presented the same type of course of criminal conduct that the state alleges here. Based on this precedent and analysis of the applicable statutes governing venue, we conclude that the state proved venue was proper in Franklin County for Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the indictment.\n\n\u00b6 116 Citing Hampton, appellant argues that because the indictment alleged the conduct associated with Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 occurred in Franklin County, the state could only establish venue by proving that the alleged conduct occurred in Franklin County. We do not read Hampton so restrictively. Hampton involved a situation where all of the alleged criminal conduct occurred outside the county where the case was venued. Therefore, R.C. 2901.12(H) was not applicable. Moreover, the Hampton court noted that \u201c[t]he General Assembly has given the state considerable flexibility with respect to establishing venue,\u201d citing R.C. 2901.12(G) as an example. Hampton at \u00b6 23. See also State v. Young, 2017-Ohio-1400, 89 N.E.3d 175, \u00b6 15\u201316 (finding no authority for proposition that an indictment must include \u201ccourse of conduct\u201d language when the state intends to proceed under R.C. 2901.12(H)). Lastly, appellant was on notice that the state would establish venue by proving the conduct occurred in Franklin County \u201cor otherwise properly venued under R.C. 2901.12, the defendant, as part of a criminal course of conduct as defined in R.C.\n2901.12(H)(1), which encompassed at least, Franklin and Marion Counties, Ohio.\u201d (June 1, 2014 Bill of Particulars at 6.) As previously noted, the indictment alleged and the state proved, that some of the alleged criminal conduct occurred in Franklin County and that the other offenses in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 were committed pursuant to a course of criminal conduct as defined in R.C. 2901.12(H).\n\n3. Conclusion\n\n\u00b6 117 For all of these reasons, we overrule appellant's sixth assignment of error.\n\nArmengau I, supra.\n\nArmengau appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio from this decision, represented by the same Assistant State Public Defender who had represented him before the Tenth District. He pleaded two relevant Propositions of Law:\n\nFirst Proposition of Law: This Court's decision in Hampton does not allow a defendant to be convicted of a crime when the indictment asserts the criminal conduct occurred in a specific county, and does not reference R.C. 2901.12, and all evidence presented demonstrates that the crime occurred in a different county than that named in the indictment. RC. 2901.12; State v. Hampton, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, 2012-Ohio-5688, 983 N.E.2d 324.\n\nSecond Proposition of Law: Revised Code 2901.12(1-1) is unconstitutional and violates Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution which requires that a criminal act be tried in the county in which it occurred. R.C. 2901.12(H); Article I, Section 10, Ohio Constitution.\n\n(Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 13, PageID 8041).\n\nArmengau admitted that the Ohio \u201cintermediate appellate courts remain vexed by the import of Hampton and the precise requirements and legal effects set forth therein\u201d and that the Tenth District had held Armengau\u2019s argument was \u201ctoo restrictive a reading of Hampton.\u201d Id. at PageID 8046. He asked the Supreme Court of Ohio \u201caccept this issue to determine whether an indictment that unequivocally represents a crime occurred in one county can be cured by R.C.2901.12.\u201d As\nan alternative he asked the court to declare Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.12(H) as interpreted by the Tenth District to be a violation of the Ohio Constitution. *Id.* at PageID 8047-48. The Ohio Supreme Court denied review in a form entry, *State v. Armengau*, 151 Ohio St. 3d 1511 (2018). (State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 14).\n\nPetitioner presented this issue again to a different panel of the Tenth District on appeal from denial of his Presentence Motion for Acquittal on Resentencing. The Tenth District again denied relief based on *res judicata*, law of the case, and the failure of Armengau to persuade the appellate court that its prior decision on \u201cvenue\u201d was in error. It noted that:\n\n{\u00b6 16} These are issues appellant could have raised in a motion to reconsider in *Armengau*, 2017-Ohio-4452. Appellant did not file a motion to reconsider this court's decision in *Armengau*, 2017-Ohio-4452.\n\n{\u00b6 17} Appellant did, however, file an appeal with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court did not accept his appeal for review. See *State v. Armengau*, 2018-Ohio-365. The Supreme Court also denied appellant's subsequent motion requesting reopening of appeal. See *State v. Armengau*, 2018-Ohio-1600. The Supreme Court denied another motion filed by appellant on April 30, 2018. Finally, the Supreme Court denied appellant's July 2, 2018 motion requesting the court grant motion and supplemental notice.\n\n{\u00b6 18} Finally, we note appellant has made another attempt to raise the same issues raised in this appeal and in his direct appeal in his appeal of the resentencing now pending before this court in *State v. Armengau*, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-300.\n\n*Armengau II.* To the extent Petitioner believes *Armengau I* is a misinterpretation of *Hampton*, he has offered both the Tenth District and the Ohio Supreme Court ample opportunity to accept his view, without any success. This Court is therefore bound by the Tenth District\u2019s interpretation of *Hampton*. *Bradshaw*, supra.\n\n\u201cVenue\u201d is a term that has, in recent years, come into common usage in American English to denote where some event has occurred or will occur. Thus Americans discuss \u201csports venues\u201d\nor \u201cconcert venues\u201d in common parlance. Brian Garner writes that the word in legal usage means \u201c(1) originally the neighborhood from which a jury had to be selected; (2) the county or other territorial unit over which a trial court had jurisdiction; or (3) the proper or a possible place for the trial of a lawsuit.\u201d Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 2nd, at 916 (Oxford Univ. Press 1995). None of these meanings fits comfortably with the claims Petitioner makes in his First Ground for Relief. Indeed, he criticizes the Tenth District for deciding what it labeled as a venue issue, but it was the same issue he had himself labeled \u201cvenue\u201d in his appellate brief.\n\nInstead of arguing about venue in any of these senses, Armengau is arguing about venue in the sense of location of the offense. In sum, he claims that the location of the offense as charged in the indictment is a material or substantive element which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no dispute that the conduct charged as criminal in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 occurred (if at all\\(^6\\)) in Marion County, Ohio, and not in Franklin County, Ohio. Nor is there any dispute that the indictment charged this conduct occurred in Franklin County and was never amended. The State did provide an amended bill of particulars prior to trial that alleged conduct in Marion County, but did not amend the indictment.\n\nUnder *Jackson v. Virginia, supra*, the State must prove all the substantial or material elements of a charged crime by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioner correctly asserts that it is state law which determines what are the elements. (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13950, citing *Winship*).\n\nArmengau relies principally on *State v. Hampton*, 134 Ohio St.3d 447 (2012). Hampton was indicted on charges he committed a home invasion and inflicted serious injuries in Franklin\n\n---\n\n\\(^6\\) The jury found, applying the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, that the conduct occurred. Petitioner does not concede that point and the Magistrate Judge respects his denial with the phrase \u201cif at all.\u201d It is not an expression of personal doubt, which would be inappropriate.\nCounty, Ohio. During the State\u2019s case in chief, the lead detective testified \u201che had just learned that these offenses had occurred in Fairfield County, not in Franklin County.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 5. The court took a motion for acquittal under Ohio R. Crim P. 29 under advisement, but granted it after defense rested without presenting evidence, holding the State had failed to prove \u201cvenue.\u201d The State appealed, but the Tenth District held the State had no right to appeal a judgment of acquittal. The Supreme Court of Ohio granted review on three propositions of law proposed by the State and decided:\n\n\u00b6 18 In the state's second proposition of law, the state suggests that lack of venue cannot result in an \u201cacquittal\u201d under Crim.R. 29 because motions under that rule are limited to claims of lack of proof of one or more material elements of the offense. Venue, the state argues, is not a material element of the offense.\n\n\u00b6 19 The Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10 provides an accused the right to \u201ca speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county in which the offense is alleged to have been committed.\u201d We have stated, \u201cSection 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution fixes venue, or the proper place to try a criminal matter * * *.\u201d *State v. Headley*, 6 Ohio St.3d 475, 477, 453 N.E.2d 716 (1983). We have also stated, \u201cA conviction may not be had in a criminal case where the proof fails to show that the crime alleged in the indictment occurred in the county where the indictment was returned.\u201d *State v. Nevius*, 147 Ohio St. 263, 71 N.E.2d 258 (1947), paragraph three of the syllabus. We have also stated that \u201cit is not essential that the venue of the crime be proven in express terms, provided it be established by all the facts and circumstances in the case, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime was committed in the county and state as alleged in the indictment.\u201d *State v. Dickerson*, 77 Ohio St. 34, 82 N.E. 969 (1907), paragraph one of the syllabus.\n\n\u00b6 20 Under Article I, Section 10 and R.C. 2901.12, evidence of proper venue must be presented in order to sustain a conviction for an offense. *Headley* at 477, 453 N.E.2d 716, citing *State v. Draggo*, 65 Ohio St.2d 88, 90, 418 N.E.2d 1343 (1981); *State v. Gribble*, 24 Ohio St.2d 85, 263 N.E.2d 904 (1970); *Nevius*, 147 Ohio St. 263, 71 N.E.2d 258.\n\n\u00b6 21 In *Nevius*, we affirmed the decision of the court of appeals as it related to the finding of insufficient evidence relating to venue,\nbut we then reversed the order of the court of appeals remanding the matter for a new trial, instead ruling that the trial court should have granted a directed verdict in favor of the defendant on count four of the indictment, and we discharged the defendant accordingly on that count. *Id.* at 266\u2013267, 287, 71 N.E.2d 258. This common-law concept of a directed verdict has now been memorialized through Crim.R. 29.\n\n{\u00b6 22} In arguing that insufficient proof of venue does not justify acquittal, the state would limit application of Crim.R. 29 to situations in which the elements of the offense have not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The plain language of the rule itself does not distinguish between \u201cmaterial\u201d elements and \u201cimmaterial\u201d elements. Instead, the plain language of the rule itself simply indicates that a judgment of acquittal is appropriate when \u201cthe evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.\u201d If the state fails to produce evidence of proper venue, then the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses. But, as stated above, Crim.R. 29 does not limit itself to elements or \u201cmaterial\u201d elements of the offense. The question is whether \u201cthe evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Most jurisdictions place some burden upon the state to prove venue\u2014whether it be beyond a reasonable doubt, by a preponderance of the evidence, or by some evidence\u2014because it is a fact of the crime. See 4 LaFave, *Criminal Procedure*, Section 16.1(c), at 714 (3d Ed.2007). And Ohio has required proof of venue beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction. *Knight v. State*, 54 Ohio St. 365, 377, 43 N.E. 995 (1896); *Dickerson*, 77 Ohio St. 34, 82 N.E. 969, paragraph one of the syllabus; *Nevius*, 147 Ohio St. 263, 71 N.E.2d 258.\n\n{\u00b6 23} Crim.R. 29 is clear and straightforward and does not limit its application to elements of the offense alone\u2014the trial judge may grant an acquittal when there is a failure of proof to sustain a conviction. Nothing in the Constitution, statutes, or rules requires a defendant to raise the issue of venue before trial. The state has the obligation to ensure the proper venue within the indictment, for the indictment puts the defendant on notice and the state to its proof. The General Assembly has given the state considerable flexibility with respect to establishing venue when the state cannot determine the precise location at which the offense took place. See, e.g., R.C. 2901.12(G), which allows for an offense that was committed in any of two or more jurisdictions to be charged in any of those jurisdictions.\nOver a century of well-established jurisprudence clearly mandates that a motion for judgment of acquittal must be granted when the evidence is insufficient for reasonable minds to find that venue is proper. Here, it is undisputed that all of the events in question occurred in Fairfield County, not Franklin County, as alleged in the indictment. Under Headley, Crim.R. 29, R.C. 2901.12, and the well-established common-law rule set forth in cases like Nevius, a judgment of acquittal may be entered when the state has failed at trial to prove the venue of the offense as alleged in the indictment.\n\nHampton, supra.\n\nHampton conflates under the label \u201cvenue\u201d the questions of the proper place for trial and location of the offense, but does hold location of the offense as alleged in the indictment must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. On the other hand, it does recognize the General Assembly, presumably constitutionally, \u201chas given the state considerable flexibility with respect to establishing venue when the state cannot determine the precise location at which the offense took place.\u201d The opinion provides no discussion of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.12(H), the statute relied on by the Tenth District in this case.\n\nWhat is the proper application of Hampton to this case? That is a question of Ohio, not federal, law and on questions of state law, federal habeas courts are bound by state court rulings. Bradshaw, supra. The Tenth District plainly understood Hampton as relevant binding precedent, but did not believe the decision should be read as narrowly as Armengau insisted. It noted the Hampton court had recognized the flexibility the General Assembly had given counties in complying with the Ohio Constitution in course-of-conduct/multiple county situations and found Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.12(H) applied in this case. It also noted that Hampton was a one offense indictment, not involving course of conduct, where all the charged misconduct occurred in a county other than the county of indictment.\n\nHampton was in part an enforcement of the Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10 which\nprovides an accused the right to \u201ca speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county in which the offense is alleged to have been committed.\u201d While the speedy and public trial and impartial jury requirements are embodied in the Sixth Amendment and all of these are made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, the U.S. Constitution says nothing about trial in the same county where the offenses are alleged to have occurred. Nor can Armengau\u2019s argument be successfully construed as a federal right to grand jury indictment for state crimes, because no such right exists. The Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not applicable to the States. Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516 (1884); Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 687-88 n. 25 (1972); Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103 (1975); Williams v. Haviland, 467 F.3d 527 (6th Cir. 2006) (Apprendi does not change this result).\n\nPetitioner has no federal due process right to have this Court enforce his Ohio Article I, \u00a7 10, right. Failure to abide by state law is not itself a constitutional violation. Roberts v. City of Troy, 773 F.2d 720 (6th Cir. 1985). Violation by a State of its own procedural rules does not necessarily constitute a violation of due process. Bates v. Sponberg, 547 F.2d 325 (6th Cir. 1976); Ryan v. Aurora City Bd. of Educ., 540 F.2d 222, 228 (6th Cir. 1976). \u201cA state cannot be said to have a federal due process obligation to follow all of its procedures; such a system would result in the constitutionalizing of every state rule, and would not be administrable.\u201d Levine v. Torvik, 986 F.2d 1506, 1515 (6th Cir. 1993).\n\nThere is no federal constitutional right to be tried for a crime in the same county where a grand jury charges the crime occurred. Armengau\u2019s First Ground for Relief should be dismissed as not cognizable in federal habeas corpus.\n\n---\n\n7 The Vicinage Clause requires that federal criminal trials be held in the judicial district in which they are alleged to have occurred and that those districts be determined in advance.\nGround Two: Lack of Notice of Crimes Charged\n\nIn his Second Ground for Relief in the Second Amended Petition, Armengau claims he was denied due process of law when the indictment did not adequately inform him of the \u201cspecific crimes\u201d he was charged with committing in that the prosecutors changed the date range and the location(s) of the offense(s).\n\nIn the Reply, however, Armengau labels Ground Two as being about \u201cNotice, Defective Indictment & Other Acts\u201d (ECF No. 77, PageID 14005). He argues\n\nWhat Ohio law doesn't permit is the use of \"other acts\" to form the factual basis of any charged crime. By Respondent's own admission, the convictions in Petitioner's case cannot stand as the factual basis for each crime was established by the introduction and substitution of \"other act\" evidence.\n\n* * *\n\nRespondent fails to note for this Court where Petitioner was provided notice that he would have to defend allegations for Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 that occurred in Marion, Ohio or that for counts 10 and 14 through 18, that he would have to defend allegations in 1998, 1999 or 2000.\n\nId.\n\nPetitioner begins his argument in the Reply on this claim by alleging he was subjected to a constructive amendment of the indictment (ECF No. 77, PageID 14006). He asserts that under both Ohio law and the United States Constitution, constructive amendments are forbidden. This argument misses an important distinction. The Ohio Constitution requires a grand jury indictment for state felonies to be tried in Ohio courts. Likewise the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution requires grand jury indictment for federal felonies to be tried in federal courts. The\n\n---\n\n8 Petitioner gives no record reference for this alleged admission.\nprohibition against constructive amendment enforces the grand jury requirement in each set of courts. However, the Fifth Amendment grand jury clause is not applicable to the States. *Hurtado v. California*, 110 U.S. 516 (1884); *Branzburg v. Hayes*, 408 U.S. 665, 687-88 n. 25 (1972); *Gerstein v. Pugh*, 420 U.S. 103 (1975); *Williams v. Haviland*, 467 F.3d 527 (6th Cir. 2006) (*Apprendi* does not change this result). Nor is the Ohio grand jury requirement enforceable in habeas corpus. Federal habeas corpus is available only to correct federal constitutional violations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); *Wilson v. Corcoran*, 562 U.S. 1 (2010); *Lewis v. Jeffers*, 497 U.S. 764, 780 (1990); *Smith v. Phillips*, 455 U.S. 209 (1982), *Barclay v. Florida*, 463 U.S. 939 (1983). Armengau\u2019s constructive amendment argument is not cognizable because constructive amendments do not violate any federal right to and jury indictment in state courts.\n\nPetitioner notes that his \u201cother acts\u201d argument under this Ground for Relief is not about the use of such evidence to convict a defendant by proving he has a bad character or has a propensity to crime, the usual argument against \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. Rather, his claim here is that \u201cother act\u201d evidence was substituted mid-trial for evidence of the crimes charged in the indictment (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14008-36).\n\nRespondent asserts Armengau has procedurally defaulted in presenting Ground Two as a federal constitutional claim to the Supreme Court of Ohio (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13896). Petitioner responds that \u201c[t]he \u2018other-act\u2019 issues were raised in Propositions III, IV, V and VI to the Ohio Supreme Court.\u201d (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14007). Those propositions of law as pleaded are as follows:\n\n**Third Proposition of Law:** If the purpose for which 404(B) evidence is sought to be introduced is already established by properly admitted evidence in the State's case-in-chief, then Evid.R. 403 precludes admission of those prior bad acts. R.C. 2945.59; Evid.R. 404(13); Evid.R. 403(H); *State v. Lowe*, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 530, 1994-Ohio-345, 63 N.E.2d 616; *State v. Burson*, 38 Ohio St.2d\nFourth Proposition of Law: Strictly construing prior bad acts evidence against admissibility does not allow the admission of testimony or evidence regarding non-criminal, consensual sexual encounters, absent highly specific, idiosyncratic facts such as those presented in Williams. R.C. 2945.59; Evid.R. 404(B); Evid.R. 403(8); State v. Lowe, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 530, 1994-Ohio-345, 634 N.E.2d 616; State v. Burson, 38 Ohio St.2d 157, 158, 311 N.E.2d 526 (1974); State v. Hector, 19 Ohio St.2d 167, 249 N.E.2d 912 (1969); State v. DeMarco, 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 194, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987); State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278.\n\nFifth Proposition of Law: Strictly construing prior bad acts evidence against admissibility does not allow the admission of testimony or evidence regarding non-criminal, consensual sexual encounters, absent highly specific, idiosyncratic facts such as those presented in Williams. R.C. 2945.59; Evid.R. 404(B); Evid.R. 403(8); State v. Lowe, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 530, 1994-Ohio-345, 634 N.E.2d 616; State v. Burson, 38 Ohio St.2d 157, 158, 311 N.E.2d 526 (1974); State v. Hector, 19 Ohio St.2d 167, 249 N.E.2d 912 (1969); State v. DeMarco, 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 194, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987); State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278.\n\nSixth Proposition of Law: When the State cannot provide a defendant with accurate information regarding the timeframe in which the alleged criminal conduct occurred, where it occurred, or the conduct at issue until its witness has testified at trial, a defendant is misled and prejudiced, and is entitled to mistrial. Crim.R. 7(D).\n\n(Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 13, PageID 8041-42). On their face, these Propositions of Law do not present federal constitutional claims. Instead, they exhibit the usual objections to other acts evidence, to wit, that it is \u201cpropensity\u201d evidence, used to convict a defendant because of his or her bad character. All of the case law cited is Ohio case law. In the body of his Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, Armengau argued\nPropositions of Law Three, Four, and Five together. *Id.* at PageID 8048-53. Nowhere in that argument does he claim the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence was substituted for the indicted conduct. Instead, the argument is all in terms of the propensity impact of other acts evidence. The Federal Constitution is not mentioned at all nor are any federal cases cited.\n\nIn arguing the Sixth Proposition of Law, Armengau states \u201c[i]n his direct appeal, Mr. Armengau asserted that this course of litigation functioned to deny him his rights to a fair trial, due process of law, and double jeopardy protections.\u201d *Id.* at PageID 8056. Nowhere else in this argument does he mention any federal right or cite any federal case law or state case law referencing the United States Constitution.\n\nTo preserve a federal constitutional claim for presentation in habeas corpus, the claim must be \"fairly presented\" to the state courts in a way which provides them with an opportunity to remedy the asserted constitutional violation, including presenting both the legal and factual basis of the claim. *Williams v. Anderson*, 460 F.3d 789, 806 (6th Cir. 2006); *Levine v. Torvik*, 986 F.2d 1506, 1516 (6th Cir.), *cert. denied*, 509 U.S. 907 (1993), overruled in part on other grounds by *Thompson v. Keohane*, 516 U.S. 99 (1995); *Riggins v. McMackin*, 935 F.2d 790, 792 (6th Cir. 1991). The claim must be fairly presented at every stage of the state appellate process. *Wagner v. Smith*, 581 F.3d 410, 418 (6th Cir. 2009).\n\nA claim is fairly presented if the petitioner\n\n(1) relied upon federal cases employing constitutional analysis; (2) relied upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis; (3) phrased the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional right; or (4) alleged facts well within the mainstream of constitutional law.\n\n*Hand v. Houk*, 871 F.3d 390, 418 (6th Cir. 2017); *Franklin v. Rose*, 811 F.2d 322, 326 (6th Cir. 1987); accord, *Whiting v. Birt*, 395 F.3d 602 (6th Cir. 2005); *McMeans v. Brigano*, 228 F.3d 674,\nMerely using talismanic constitutional phrases like \u201cfair trial\u201d or \u201cdue process of law\u201d does not constitute raising a federal constitutional issue. *Slaughter v. Parker*, 450 F.3d 224, 236 (6th Cir. 2006); *Franklin v. Rose*, 811 F.2d 322, 326 (6th Cir. 1987); *McMeans v. Brigano*, 228 F.3d 674, 681 (6th Cir. 2000), citing *Petrucelli v. Coombe*, 735 F.2d 684, 688-89 (2nd Cir. 1984). Mere use of the words \u201cdue process and a fair trial by an impartial jury\u201d are insufficient. *Slaughter v. Parker*, 450 F.3d 224, 236 (6th Cir. 2006); *Blackmon v. Booker*, 394 F.3d 399, 400 (6th Cir. 2004)(same). \u201cA lawyer need not develop a constitutional argument at length, but he must make one; the words \u2018due process\u2019 are not an argument.\u201d *Riggins v. McGinnis*, 50 F.3d 492, 494 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\nPetitioner did not fairly present his convicted-on-other-acts evidence claim as a federal constitutional claim to the Supreme Court of Ohio. The claim is therefore procedurally defaulted and Ground Two should be dismissed.\n\n**Ground Three: Denial of Due Process and Double Jeopardy Protection by Allowing Constructive Amendment and Refusing Unanimity Instruction**\n\nIn his Third Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he was denied due process and double jeopardy protection when the trial court allowed constructive amendment of the indictment and refused a requested unanimity instruction. Those are at least the issues on the face of Ground Three in the Second Amended Petition. In the Reply, however, Armengau argues Ground Three together with Ground Six. In the Sixth Ground for Relief he claims he was denied due process \u201cwhen he was tried and convicted for crimes for which he was never charged or indicted or noticed and for which the court failed to obtain subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d To make matters more confusing, he argues both Grounds for Relief under the label \u201cConstructive Amendment, Double Jeopardy, Jury\nInstructions, Defective Indictment & Notice\u201d and then asserts \u201cThis issue is inextricably related to the sufficiency [of the evidence] arguments set-forth above.\u201d (ECF No. 77, PageID 14036).\n\nThe combined argument on these two Grounds for Relief then occupies forty-five pages of the Reply (PageID 14036-81). He begins with an argument about a criminal defendant\u2019s entitlement to notice of the \u201capproximate time frame and at minimum, the general location as to where the crime(s) occurred. A defendant must also be advised of what he did (conduct)\u201d Id. at PageID 14036. Armengau asserts it is not only the indictment which is defective, but that no court has given him notice of the facts upon which he was convicted. \u201cPetitioner has been deprived of his Constitutional right to notice before trial, during trial, during sentencing and after resentencing.\u201d Id. at PageID 14041.\n\nPetitioner then switches to his jury unanimity argument:\n\nA jury has a duty to unanimously agree to a particular set of facts. United States v. Echeverry, 698 F.2d 375 (9th Cir. 1983). The U.S. Constitution does require a unanimous verdict in state prosecutions. A jury must be unanimous in what facts are being considered to determine guilt. Respondent does not dispute that as of today no one knows what \"act or incident\" constitutes any of the crimes for which Petitioner is imprisoned.\n\n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14042). Petitioner then argues the bill of particulars was insufficient to provide notice. Id. at PageID 14045-51. He then switches back to a jury instruction argument. At PageID 14067, et seq., he raises double jeopardy issues. Then, without any notice of a change of direction, Petitioner turns back to notice issues. Id.\n\nReturning to the double jeopardy claim, Armengau asserts:\n\nUnited States Supreme Court decisions are clear that the charging document itself must, on its face, protect a defendant from double jeopardy. Such holdings confirm that the federal constitutional requirement of double jeopardy protection is preemptive and must be reflected in the charging document.\n\n* * *\nClearly established federal law requires the protection be provided at the inception of the filing of the criminal charge.\n\n*Id.* at PageID 14079. However instead of citing any Supreme Court decisions, he cites instead to *State v. Freeman*, 2010-Ohio-3714 (Ohio App. 8th Dist. 2010), and *Isaac v. Grider*, 211 F.3d 1269 (6th Cir. 2000). In a single line at the conclusion of this section of the Reply, he asserts without any cited authority \u201cThe trial court in Petitioner's case never had jurisdiction for any alleged crime in Marion, Ohio[,] in 1998, 1999 or 2000 because the state never charged Petitioner with any such crime.\u201d PageID 14081.\n\n\u201c[T]here is no constitutional right in a state prosecution to a grand jury indictment with particular specificity.\u201d *Williams v. Haviland*, 467 F.3d 527, 534 (6th Cir. 2006) citing *Rose v. Mitchell*, 443 U.S. 545, 557, n. 7 (1979). \u201cDue process mandates only that the indictment provide the defendant with \u2018fair notice of the charges against him to permit adequate preparation of his defense.\u2019\u201d *Williams* at 535, quoting *Koontz v. Glossa*, 731 F.2d 365, 369 (6th Cir. 1984).\n\n*Russell v. United States*, 369 U.S. 749 (1962), holds the sufficiency of a federal indictment is to be measured by the following criteria:\n\n> These criteria are, first, whether the indictment \"contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, 'and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet,'\" and, secondly, \"'in case any other proceedings are taken against him for a similar offense whether the record shows with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction.'\"\n\n369 U.S. at 763-64. While the right to grand jury indictment has not been extended to the States, the Sixth Circuit has held these criteria are applicable as a matter of due process. *Valentine v. Konteh*, 395 F.3d 626, 631 (6th Cir. 2005). In *Valentine* the defendant faced twenty carbon-copy counts of rape of a minor and twenty carbon-copy counts of gross sexual imposition. Judge Merritt wrote for the court:\nThe problem in this case is not the fact that the prosecution did not provide the defendant with exact times and places. If there had been singular counts of each offense, the lack of particularity would not have presented the same problem. Instead, the problem is that within each set of 20 counts, there are absolutely no distinctions made. Valentine was prosecuted for two criminal acts that occurred twenty times each, rather than for forty separate criminal acts. In its charges and in its evidence before the jury, the prosecution did not attempt to lay out the factual bases of forty separate incidents that took place. Instead, the 8\u2013year\u2013old victim described \u201ctypical\u201d abusive behavior by Valentine and then testified that the \u201ctypical\u201d abuse occurred twenty or fifteen times. Outside of the victim's estimate, no evidence as to the number of incidents was presented.\n\nId. at 632-33.\n\nThis is not a case like Valentine. Armengau was charged with separate incidents involving separate victims, dates, and places. Testimony at trial varied from the dates and places in the indictment. Some of the variations in date were dealt with by amendment to the indictment at trial; the difference in location had been dealt with by an amended bill of particulars. As the Tenth District noted, Petitioner was not presenting alibi or impossibility defenses which would have been defeated by date changes.9\n\nThus Valentine does not read directly on the indictment in this case. More importantly, Valentine is not \u201cclearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d The Supreme Court has held, since Valentine, that a circuit court may not use circuit precedent \u201cto refine or sharpen a general rule of Supreme Court jurisprudence into a specific rule that\u201d the Supreme Court has not announced. Lopez v. Smith, 574 U.S. 1 (2014)(per curiam); Marshall v. Rodgers, 569 U.S. 58, 64 (2013)(per curiam). However, \u201can appellate panel may, in\n\n---\n\n9 Several times in his pleadings, Petitioner asserts he \u201cestablished\u201d during trial that he could not have committed the offenses alleged because he was not at the place or there at the time alleged. Facts are not established finally during the course of trial absent a stipulation or mid-trial dismissal. The Magistrate Judge therefore reads Petitioner\u2019s use of the word \u201cestablished\u201d as meaning Petitioner had presented evidence which he believed was convincing on certain dates and places, forcing the prosecutors to shift focus or make amendments.\naccordance with its usual law-of-the-circuit procedures, to ascertain whether it has already held that the particular point in issue is clearly established by Supreme Court precedent, see, e.g., *Tolliver v. Sheets*, 594 F.3d 900, 916, n.6 (\u201cWe are bound by prior Sixth Circuit determinations that a rule has been clearly established\u201d); *Chambers v. McDaniel*, 549 F.3d 1191, 1199 (9th Cir. 2008); it may not canvass circuit decisions to determine whether a particular rule of law is so widely accepted among the Federal Circuits that it would, if presented to this Court, be accepted as correct. See *Parker v. Matthews*, 567 U.S. 37 (2012); *Renico v. Lett*, 559 U.S. 766, 778-779 (2010).\u201d *Marshall*, 569 U.S. 58, 64 (2013).\n\nThe *Valentine* Court did not limit itself to the question whether the rule it adopted was clearly established by Supreme Court precedent. Instead, it opined,\n\n> [T]he \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d relevant under AEDPA encompasses \u201cthe governing legal principle or principles set forth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its decision.\u201d See *Lockyer v. Andrade*, 538 U.S. 63, 71\u201372, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). The Supreme Court has established a clear and consistent path for the courts regarding the due process sufficiency of criminal charges, and the Ohio Court of Appeals has strayed so far from that path as to warrant habeas relief. See id. at 72, 123 S.Ct. 1166.\n\n*Valentine*, 395 F.3d at 638 (Emphasis supplied). This formulation is inconsistent with later Supreme Court precedent requiring a tighter fit between Supreme Court holdings and the rule sought to be enforced in habeas.\n\nIn *Valentine* itself, the court held \u201cthat a court is permitted to review the indictment, the bill of particulars, and the evidence presented at trial to determine whether any defects in the indictment are cured.\u201d 395 F. 3d at 634.\n\nIn addition to not receiving from the indictment the notice to which he claims he is entitled, Petitioner also asserts the indictment provides insufficient double jeopardy protection. The Double\nJeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution affords a defendant three basic protections:\n\n- It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.\n- It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction.\n- And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\n\n*Brown v. Ohio*, 432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977), quoting *North Carolina v. Pearce*, 395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969). The Double Jeopardy Clause was held to be applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment in *Benton v. Maryland*, 395 U.S. 784, 794 (1969). The State of Ohio has not re-indicted Petitioner for any sexual misconduct allegedly occurring within the span of years eventually covered by this prosecution; no such indictment is threatened and its content is purely speculative. It is clear that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a second trial and not just a second conviction for the same offense. *Abney v. United States*, 431 U.S. 651 (1977). For that reason, a double jeopardy claim is cognizable in federal habeas corpus prior to the \u201csecond\u201d trial. *Justices of the Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon*, 466 U.S. 294 (1984); *Reimnitz v. State\u2019s Attorney of Cook County*, 761 F.2d 405, 408 (7th Cir. 1985); *Malinovsky v. Court of Common Pleas of Lorain County*, 7 F.3d 1263 (6th Cir. 1993). To put it another way, a habeas petitioner with a double jeopardy claim is not required to exhaust the remedy of direct appeal from a verdict at a second trial before invoking our habeas jurisdiction. Should a new indictment be filed, a habeas court would compare both the indictment in this case and the evidence adduced at trial to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause was being violated. The Supreme Court has never held that a state indictment must be so precise as to preclude a second indictment while examining only the face of the first indictment. *Valentine*, which reaches that conclusion, is not Supreme Court precedent and has never been followed by the Sixth Circuit itself in a habeas corpus case. *Lawwill v. Pineda*, 2011 WL 1882456 (N.D. Ohio 2011).\nRespecting jury unanimity, Armengau argues \u201c[a] jury has a duty to unanimously agree to a particular state of facts . . . . A jury must be unanimous in what facts are being considered to determine guilt.\u201d (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14042, citing United States v. Echeverry, 698 F.2d 375 (9th Cir. 1983)). At numerous points in his Reply, Petitioner argues that no court has been able to tell him what facts the jury relied upon to convict him of which offenses.\n\nPetitioner is correct that the United States Constitution requires that jury verdicts in criminal cases be unanimous. Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, 140 S. Ct. 1390, 206 L. Ed. 2d 583 (2020). However Ramos does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, such as this one. Edwards v. Vannoy, 593 U.S. ___, 141 S. Ct. 1547 (2021). Prior to Ramos, the Supreme Court had held nonunanimous verdicts were permissible. Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972). These cases, however, involved States (Oregon and Louisiana) which expressly allowed majority verdicts.\n\nPetitioner, however, insists on something more: unanimity on the facts supporting a verdict. How would a State achieve such a result? A possibility would be to sever counts of an indictment and try them one at a time, but Petitioner does not suggest that is constitutionally required, nor does he claim he ever asked for severance in the trial court.\n\nWe instruct a jury that its verdict on each count must be unanimous and we enforce that requirement by requiring each juror to sign the verdict and allowing jurors to be polled in open court on their vote. In this case the verdicts of the jury were returned and read in open court on July 7, 2014 (Transcript, State Court Record, ECF No. 72-2, PageID 13702, et seq.). In each case the bailiff announced that the form was signed by all jurors. When the reading was complete, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel asked that the jury be polled and they were, all answering that the verdicts as read were verdicts they had voted for and signed. Id. Thus the usual methods of ensuring jury\nunanimity were employed and the jurors affirmed their verdicts.\n\nIn *Echeverry*, the Ninth Circuit disapproved an ambiguous jury instruction in a federal conspiracy case which left the jury free to convict if they found a conspiracy existed \u201cfor some period of time\u201d when the evidence would have permitted a finding that there had been both a December and a June conspiracy, but did not require a unanimous finding as to either one. Nothing in the case suggests that the defendant could have, after the fact, required the jury or an appellate court to tell him what facts they found unanimously. To put it somewhat differently, a state criminal trial is not like a federal civil jury trial where a jury can be required to return special verdicts. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 49. Much less can a state appellate court be compelled, in the interest of jury unanimity, to make such separate findings.\n\nFinally, Petitioner\u2019s jury unanimity claim is procedurally defaulted because it was not presented to the Tenth District as a federal constitutional claim. The Tenth District noted that this claim had been presented as a jury unanimity claim under Ohio R. Crim. P. 31(A).\n\nFinally, appellant argues that the complex, and allegedly mismatched, assemblage of facts, testimony, indictment, and amendments of the bill of particulars allowed the jury to produce a \u201cpatchwork\u201d verdict in violation of Ohio's requirement of jury unanimity, under Crim.R. 31(A). Pursuant to that rule, jurors must unanimously agree not only on the defendant's guilt, but as to proof as to each element of the crime.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s Third Ground for Relief should therefore be dismissed.\n\n**Ground Four: Erroneous Jury Instructions**\n\nIn his Fourth Ground for Relief, Armengau asserts he was denied due process of law when the trial court \u201cdenied a requested unanimity instruction and the instructions allowed a non-unanimous verdict and a verdict upon uncharged alleged conduct.\u201d (Second Amended Petition, ECF No. 70,\nRespondent asserts this claim is procedurally defaulted. The procedural default doctrine in habeas corpus is described by the Supreme Court as follows:\n\nIn all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an adequate and independent state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause of the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law; or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\n\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991); see also Simpson v. Jones, 238 F.3d 399, 406 (6th Cir. 2000). That is, a petitioner may not raise on federal habeas a federal constitutional rights claim he could not raise in state court because of procedural default. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72 (1977); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 110 (1982). \u201cAbsent cause and prejudice, \u2018a federal habeas petitioner who fails to comply with a State\u2019s rules of procedure waives his right to federal habeas corpus review.\u2019\u201d Boyle v. Million, 201 F.3d 711, 716 (6th Cir. 2000), quoting Gravley v. Mills, 87 F.3d 779, 784-85 (6th Cir. 1996); Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 485 (1986); Engle, 456 U.S. at 110; Wainwright, 433 U.S. at 87.\n\n[A] federal court may not review federal claims that were procedurally defaulted in state court\u2014that is, claims that the state court denied based on an adequate and independent state procedural rule. E.g., Beard v. Kindler, 558 U.S. 53, 55, 130 S.Ct. 612, 175 L.Ed.2d 417 (2009). This is an important \u201ccorollary\u201d to the exhaustion requirement. Dretke v. Haley, 541 U.S. 386, 392, 124 S.Ct. 1847, 158 L.Ed. d 659 (2004). \u201cJust as in those cases in which a state prisoner fails to exhaust state remedies, a habeas petitioner who has failed to meet the State\u2019s procedural requirements for presenting his federal claims has deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address\u201d the merits of \u201cthose claims in the first instance.\u201d Coleman [v. Thompson], 501 U.S. [722,] 731-732, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 [(1991)]. The procedural default doctrine thus advances the same comity, finality, and federalism interests advanced by the exhaustion doctrine. See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 493, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991).\nDavila v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 2058, 2064 (2017). \u201c[A] federal court may not review federal claims that were procedurally defaulted in state courts.\u201d Theriot v. Vashaw, 982 F.3d 999 (6th Cir. 2020), citing Maslonka v. Hoffner, 900 F.3d 269, 276 (6th Cir. 2018) (alteration in original) (quoting Davila v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 2058, 2064 (2017)).\n\nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals requires a four-part analysis when the State alleges a habeas claim is precluded by procedural default. Barton v. Warden, S. Ohio Corr. Facility, 786 F.3d 450, 464 (6th Cir. 2015), Guilmette v. Howes, 624 F.3d 286, 290 (6th Cir. 2010)(en banc); Eley v. Bagley, 604 F.3d 958, 965 (6th Cir. 2010); Reynolds v. Berry, 146 F.3d 345, 347-48 (6th Cir. 1998), citing Maupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986); accord Lott v. Coyle, 261 F.3d 594, 601-02 (6th Cir. 2001); Jacobs v. Mohr, 265 F.3d 407, 417 (6th Cir. 2001).\n\nFirst the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner's claim and that the petitioner failed to comply with the rule.\n\nSecond, the court must decide whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction, citing County Court of Ulster County v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 149, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979).\n\nThird, the court must decide whether the state procedural forfeiture is an \"adequate and independent\" state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim.\n\nOnce the court determines that a state procedural rule was not complied with and that the rule was an adequate and independent state ground, then the petitioner must demonstrate under Sykes that there was \"cause\" for him to not follow the procedural rule and that he was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.\n\nMaupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986); accord, Hartman v. Bagley, 492 F.3d 347, 357 (6th Cir. 2007), quoting Monzo v. Edwards, 281 F.3d 568, 576 (6th Cir. 2002).\n\nPetitioner\u2019s trial counsel requested a particular instruction on unanimity which was not given.\nHowever, he \u201cdid not object to the jury instructions as given.\u201d *Armengau I* at \u00b6 64. The Tenth District therefore reviewed Armengau\u2019s jury instruction claims under a plain error standard. *Id.*\n\nPetitioner does not dispute that Ohio has a procedural rule that requires a litigant to preserve an alleged jury instruction error by objecting to the instruction as given nor does he dispute the Tenth District\u2019s factual finding that no such objection was made here. Instead he asserts the Tenth District did not enforce the rule.\n\nPetitioner respectfully suggests to this Court that the Court of Appeals did not rely on the \"procedural bar\" and in any event, notwithstanding defense counsel's failure to lodge an objection, notwithstanding the denial of his requested instruction, the Court of Appeals proceeded to analyze the issue in the same manner it would have had an objection been made.\n\n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14082, citing *Keeton v. Bradshaw*, 2006 U.S. Dist.LEXIS 102076 (fn7)(N.D. Ohio, Jul. 20, 2006), adopted, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64342 (N.D. Ohio, Sept. 8, 2006)).\n\nIn *Keeton* Magistrate Judge Veccharelli analyzed procedural default differentially as to different claims. As to the claim referenced in footnote seven, cited by Petitioner, she found the Ohio Court of Appeals had not actually enforced the relevant procedural rule. But as to Ground Three regarding excuse of jurors, she wrote:\n\nIn dismissing this claim, the Court of Appeals indicated that Keeton's trial counsel did not object to the dismissal of the prospective jurors for cause and reviewed the claim for plain error. The Court of Appeals held that the trial court did not commit plain error.\n\nThe Court of Appeals expressly relied upon and enforced the contemporaneous objection rule, a state procedural bar, to dismiss this claim. The Court of Appeals' plain error review does not excuse the court's reliance on the state procedural rule in dismissing the claims. See *Scott*, 209 F.3d at 868. Further, the Sixth Circuit has held the contemporaneous objection rule is an \"adequate and independent\" state ground. *Id.* at 869.\n\n2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102076 *16.\nIn this case the Tenth District did as the appellate court had in *Keeton*: it noted the failure to object and then reviewed for plain error. *Armengau I* at \u00b6 64. As Judge Veccharelli noted, the Sixth Circuit has frequently recognized that Ohio\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule is an adequate and independent state ground of decision. *Wogenstahl v. Mitchell*, 668 F.3d 307, 334 (6th Cir. 2012), citing *Keith v. Mitchell*, 455 F.3d 662, 673 (6th Cir. 2006); *Goodwin v. Johnson*, 632 F.3d 301, 315 (6th Cir. 2011); *Smith v. Bradshaw*, 591 F.3d 517, 522 (6th Cir. 2010); *Nields v. Bradshaw*, 482 F.3d 442 (6th Cir. 2007); *Biros v. Bagley*, 422 F.3d 379, 387 (6th Cir. 2005); *Mason v. Mitchell*, 320 F.3d 604 (6th Cir. 2003), citing *Hinkle v. Randle*, 271 F.3d 239, 244 (6th Cir. 2001); *Scott v. Mitchell*, 209 F.3d 854 (6th Cir. 2000), citing *Engle v. Isaac*, 456 U.S. 107, 124-29 (1982). See also *Seymour v. Walker*, 224 F.3d 542, 557 (6th Cir. 2000); *Goodwin v. Johnson*, 632 F.3d 301, 315 (6th Cir. 2011); *Smith v. Bradshaw*, 591 F.3d 517, 522 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 562 U.S. 876 (2010).\n\nThe Sixth Circuit has also held that Ohio appellate review for plain error is enforcement of the contemporaneous objection rule and not a waiver of it. *Wogenstahl v. Mitchell*, 668 F.3d 307, 337 (6th Cir. 2012); *Jells v. Mitchell*, 538 F.3d 478, 511 (6th Cir. 2008); *Lundgren v. Mitchell*, 440 F.3d 754, 765 (6th Cir. 2006); *White v. Mitchell*, 431 F.3d 517, 525 (6th Cir. 2005); *Biros v. Bagley*, 422 F.3d 379, 387 (6th Cir. 2005); *Hinkle v. Randle*, 271 F.3d 239 (6th Cir. 2001).\n\nPetitioner also asserts that the failure to object does not prevent this Court from considering his constitutional claim. (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14083, citing *Osborne v. Ohio*, 495 U.S. 103 (1990)). In *Osborne* the Supreme Court enforced a procedural default consisting of failure to object to omission of a *sciente* instruction, but disregarded a similar default on an instruction on \u201clewdness\u201d because trial counsel had sufficiently pushed the issue of overbreadth to satisfy the state interest in giving the state courts a fair opportunity to correct constitutional error. 495 U.S. at 123-24. Thus the Supreme Court found an excusable default in the factual complexities of the\nOsborne case and did not announce a general rule which would apply here.\n\nRespondent asserts Armengau further procedurally defaulted this jury instruction claim by failing to present it to the Supreme Court of Ohio as a federal constitutional claim (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13896). Petitioner responds by asserting:\n\nWith regard to Respondent's claim that the jury instruction issue was not fairly presented, a claim of defective indictment, patchwork and non-unanimous verdict and a double jeopardy claim, by necessity, implicates a jury instruction issue.\n\nJury instructions are directly related to the sufficiency evaluation for an indictment, evidence and corresponding notice issues and these issue [sic] were raised in Propositions I and VI to the Ohio Supreme Court (Doc. 72, PageID 8046-8047, 8053-8058, PageID 610-622). Those issues by necessity extend to the jury instructions.\n\n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14082-83).\n\nThe referenced Propositions of Law read:\n\n**First Proposition of Law:** This Court's decision in Hampton does not allow a defendant to be convicted of a crime when the indictment asserts the criminal conduct occurred in a specific county, and does not reference R.C. 2901.12, and all evidence presented demonstrates that the crime occurred in a different county than that named in the indictment. RC. 2901.12; State v. Hampton, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, 2012-Ohio-5688, 983 N.E.2d 324\n\n**Sixth Proposition of Law:** When the State cannot provide a defendant with accurate information regarding the time frame in which the alleged criminal conduct occurred, where it occurred, or the conduct at issue until its witness has testified at trial, a defendant is misled and prejudiced, and is entitled to a mistrial. Crim. R. 7(D).\n\n(Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 13, PageID 8041-42). Neither of these Propositions of Law mentions jury instructions at all or any provision of the United States Constitution. Nor do the arguments on these propositions mention jury instructions or cite any federal law.\n\nBecause Petitioner did not fairly present his jury instruction claim to the Supreme Court of\nOhio as a federal constitutional claim, it is procedurally defaulted on that basis as well.\n\nBecause Petitioner\u2019s Fourth Ground for Relief is procedurally defaulted twice over, the Court cannot reach the merits of the claim. Davila, supra. The jury instructions claim should be dismissed as procedurally defaulted.\n\n**Ground Five: Prosecutorial Misconduct**\n\nIn his Fifth Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts he was deprived of due process and a fair trial by prosecutorial misconduct when \u201che was tried, convicted, and resentenced for convictions upon the admission of other-act evidence that was unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed prior to trial and which was presented by prosecutors to intentionally circumvent the defenses to the actually indicted alleged crimes.\u201d\n\nRespondent asserts this Ground for Relief is procedurally defaulted because the admission of other acts evidence claim was presented to the Tenth District as an issue of trial court error rather than prosecutorial misconduct (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13896). Petitioner\u2019s Reply asserts that the Return did not address his claim of prosecutorial misconduct and therefore does not respond to this defense (ECF No. 77, PageID 14147).\n\nThe Magistrate Judge finds the defense well taken. The relevant Assignment of Error on appeal argued trial court error, not prosecutorial misconduct. Armengau I, \u00b6 68. The Sixth Circuit has articulated the relevant standard for habeas claims of prosecutorial misconduct as follows:\n\n\u201cIn the evaluation of a claim for prosecutorial misconduct, it is not enough that the prosecutor's comments were improper, but '[t]he relevant question is whether the prosecutors' comments \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Smith, 567 F.3d [246] at 255 [6th Cir. 2009] (quoting Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986)) (quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416\nU.S. 637, 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)). In other words, \u201c[i]n order to satisfy the standard for prosecutorial misconduct, the conduct must be both improper and flagrant.\u201d Broom v. Mitchell, 441 F.3d 392, 412 (6th Cir.2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1255, 127 S.Ct. 1376, 167 L.Ed.2d 165 (2007). To determine whether improper conduct is flagrant, we consider four factors:\n\n(1) the likelihood that the remarks of the prosecutor tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) the total strength of the evidence against the defendant.\n\nBates v. Bell, 402 F.3d 635, 641 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 865, 126 S.Ct. 163, 163 L.Ed.2d 150 (2005).\n\nGoff v. Bagley, 601 F.3d 445, 480 (6th Cir. 2010). See also LaMar v. Houk, 798 F.3d 405, 430 (6th Cir., 2015).\n\nThe usual claim of prosecutorial misconduct involves a prosecutor\u2019s improper comment on evidence, presentation of perjured testimony, or failure to comply with Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny. Here the claim is the prosecutors deliberately relied on inadmissible other acts evidence. The first step in analyzing any claim of prosecutorial misconduct is to determine that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper. Bowling v. Parker, 344 F.3d 487, 512-13 (6th Cir. 2003). Here the Tenth District determined admission of the other acts evidence was not improper. It cannot be improper conduct for a prosecutor to offer admissible evidence.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s Fifth Ground for Relief should be denied as procedurally defaulted and without merit.\nGround Six: Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\nIn his Sixth Ground for Relief, Petitioner argues the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas never \u201cobtained\u201d subject matter jurisdiction to try his case (Amended Petition, ECF No. 70, PageID 7651). As noted above, Armengau combined arguments about Ground Six with his arguments on Ground Three. Other than the subject matter jurisdiction claim, these issues are dealt with above under Ground Three.\n\nRespondent treats this claim as of a piece with Armengau\u2019s other objections to the indictment and dismisses it with the assertion that there is no federal constitutional right to grand jury indictment in state courts (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13881, citing, inter alia, Hurtado). Other than adverting to the fact that he has alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction, Armengau does nothing in his Reply to argue the issue. Nor does it appear Armengau raised this issue on direct appeal.\n\nLack of subject matter jurisdiction was a basis for granting habeas corpus relief long before those bases were broadened to any constitutional error in Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443 (1953). See Ex parte Lange, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 163 (1873); Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371 (1880). However, in Ohio, the common pleas courts are the courts with subject matter jurisdiction to try felony criminal cases. See Ohio Rev. Code 2931.03; State v. Lauharn, 2012-Ohio-1572, \u00b6 22, 2012 Ohio App. LEXIS 1382, **12 (2nd App. Dist. 2012); Leyman v. Bradshaw, 2015-Ohio-751, \u00b6 13, 2015 Ohio App. LEXIS 699, **4 (5th App. Dist. 2015). Petitioner has not pled or proved any basis on which the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his case. Ground six should therefore be dismissed on the merits.\nGround Seven: Denial of Equal Protection\n\nIn his Seventh Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he was denied his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws when the Tenth District Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Ohio \u201cintentionally disregarded the law set by their respective courts and the United States Supreme Court in order to affirm the convictions.\u201d His theory is that \u201c[t]he holdings and rulings in Petitioner's case are contrary to established precedent.\u201d\n\nRespondent asserts this claim is not cognizable in federal habeas corpus, arguing \u201c[a]lleged errors involving a state court\u2019s interpretation of its own law or procedure are not cognizable in federal habeas corpus review (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13889, citing Simpson v. Jones, 238 F.3d 399, 406-07 (6th Cir. 2000); Allen v. Morris, 845 F.2d 610, 614 (6th Cir. 1988)).\n\nPetitioner responds that\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432 (1985). The sine qua non of an equal protection claim is dissimilar treatment of persons similarly situated. The Equal Protection Clause embodies a general rule that States must treat like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly.\n\n* * *\n\nPetitioner respectfully suggests that the case law he has cited throughout his petition and this reply specifically identifies him as similarly situated to defendants who have obtained relief under identical issues and material facts and that the court system has disregarded the law they have established in order to affirm the convictions.\n\n(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14087-88). He then proceeds to discuss at length other allegedly similarly-situated defendants who have obtained relief in similar circumstances. Id. at PageID 14089-91.\nIt is of course fundamental to our American system of case law that like cases should be decided alike. Garner, et al., The Law of Judicial Precedent \u00a7 A.1(2016). Garner\u2019s treatise is devoted to explicating the doctrine of precedent which enables deciding like cases alike. Petitioner\u2019s premise \u2013 that equal protection doctrine must overlay the doctrine of precedent \u2013 seems an appropriate extension of the law in both of these areas. The Magistrate Judge therefore disagrees with Respondent\u2019s argument that only state law questions are involved. If, for example, a municipal judge intentionally applied a different standard to deciding red light cases depending on the race of the defendant, it is not difficult to see the equal protection issue involved.\n\nAt the same time, the entire doctrine of precedent cannot be constitutionalized; such a system would not be administrable. See Levine v. Torvik, supra. The Supreme Court has stated that the Equal Protection Clause \"embodies the general rule that States must treat like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly.\" Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793, 799 (1997). The States cannot make distinctions which either burden a fundamental right, target a suspect class, or intentionally treat a person differently from others similarly situated without any rational basis for the difference. Id.; Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per curiam); Radvansky v. City of Olmsted Falls, 395 F.3d 291, 312 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\nConsidering the general standards for establishment of an equal protection violation, Petitioner has not articulated, much less presented, a case which would support such a finding. He never presented a case to the Ohio courts for selective prosecution. Indeed, his allegation is that the Ohio appellate courts, not the prosecution, discriminated against him. He does not suggest an invidious basis such as race for deciding his case one way and other similarly-situated cases differently. Although he claims there are other similarly-situated cases, what are the similarities? Are there other men accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women who have not been\nprosecuted because they were not successful criminal defense lawyers?\n\nIn sum, while the Magistrate Judge agrees that an intentional misapplication of the doctrine of precedent on an invidious basis could violate the Equal Protection Clause, Armengau did not present such a case to either the Tenth District or the Supreme Court of Ohio. As with \u201cfair trial\u201d and \u201cdue process,\u201d mere recitation of the talismanic phrase \u201cequal protection\u201d is not an argument. Petitioner\u2019s Seventh Ground for Relief should be dismissed as procedurally defaulted because never fairly presented to the Ohio courts. It is also without merit in the form presented to this Court.\n\n**Ground Eight: Actual Innocence**\n\nIn his Eighth Ground for Relief, Armengau claims he is actually innocent of the crimes of which he was convicted and is entitled to habeas corpus relief on that basis. In habeas corpus parlance, this is denominated a \u201cstand alone\u201d actual innocence claim to distinguish it from the \u201cgateway\u201d actual innocence claim recognized by the Supreme Court in *Schlup v. Delo*, 513 U.S. 298 (1995).\n\nCase law in the Sixth Circuit establishes that the Supreme Court of the United States has never recognized a free-standing or substantive actual innocence claim. *Cress v. Palmer*, 484 F.3d 844, 854 (6th Cir. 2007), citing *Zuern v. Tate*, 336 F.3d 478, 482, n.1 (6th Cir. 2003), and *Staley v. Jones*, 239 F.3d 769, 780, n.12 (6th Cir. 2001).\n\nEven if a stand-alone claim were to be recognized, Petitioner has not submitted evidence of the quality required by *Schlup* to qualify. \"To be credible, such a claim requires petitioner to support his allegations of constitutional error with new reliable evidence -- whether it be\nexculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence -- that was not presented at trial.\" *Souter v. Jones*, 395 F.3d 577, 590 (6th Cir. 2005), citing *Schlup*, 513 U.S. at 324.\n\nThe Supreme Court has also noted that \"actual innocence means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.\" *Bousley v. United States*, 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998). Having committed the acts which the jury found to be sexual misconduct in Marion County as opposed to Franklin County does not amount to a claim of factual innocence.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s Eighth Ground for Relief should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which habeas corpus relief can be granted.\n\n**Ground Nine: Lack of Jury Unanimity**\n\nThis claim has been dealt with under Ground Three above.\n\n**Ground Ten: Denial of Right to Trial by Jury**\n\nIn his Tenth Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts he was denied his right to trial by jury because the factual bases of his convictions were determined by the trial and appellate judges instead of the jury. As Petitioner made clear when moving to amend to add this claim, he believes he suffered from a violation of the doctrine in *Apprendi v. New Jersey*, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), where the Supreme Court held \u201cunder the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that\nincreases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nThis is not a classic Apprendi case where some punishment beyond that authorized by the statute of conviction can be imposed upon a separate finding by the trial judge. For example, in Apprendi the Supreme Court was dealing with a statute which increased the penalties for a crime if the court determined it to be a \u201chate\u201d crime. Nothing of that sort happened here. Rather Ground Ten is a variant on Petitioner\u2019s claim that facts found by the jury\u2019s general verdicts were reassigned by the Tenth District upon resentencing. Petitioner points to no clearly established Supreme Court precedent violated by what occurred on re-sentencing. His Tenth Ground for Relief should therefore be denied on the merits.\n\nAdditional Claims\n\nAt the end of his Reply, Petitioner asserts that he has made other claims which Respondent has not addressed, to wit, fair trial, prosecutorial misconduct, and constructive amendment (Reply, ECF No. 72, PageID 14147).\n\nAs noted in the analysis of Ground Five, the Respondent did address the specific prosecutorial misconduct claim made here by noting it had not been presented in that form to the Tenth District, but rather as a claim of trial court error.\n\nCase law prohibiting constructive amendments of indictments during trial are designed to protect a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to grand jury indictment. A state defendant\u2019s grand jury\n\n---\n\n10 Armengau was ordered to serve some sentences consecutively. However, the Supreme Court has exempted the findings which may be needed for consecutive sentences from the application of Apprendi. Oregon v. Ice, 555 U.S. 160 (2009).\nright is protected by the Ohio Constitution, but violations of the Ohio Constitution do not state a claim for violating the federal Constitution, because there is no federal constitutional right to indictment in the state courts. *Hurtado, supra.* A federal defendant\u2019s grand jury right, protected by the Fifth Amendment, is protected by forbidding constructive amendments in federal trials. All the authority relied on by Petitioner in this section of his Reply was enforcing the federal grand jury right in federal cases. Because the Fifth Amendment Grand Jury Clause has not been incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, there is no federal constitutional prohibition on constructive amendments in state trials.\n\nPetitioner has not pleaded a separate ground for relief based on his claim of denial of a fair trial.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the Magistrate Judge respectfully recommends the Petition be dismissed with prejudice. Reasonable jurists could disagree with the proposed disposition of Grounds One (sufficiency of the evidence) and Three (double jeopardy); Petitioner should therefore be granted a certificate of appealability as to those Grounds. Because reasonable jurists would not disagree with dismissal of the other Grounds for Relief, it is also recommended that Petitioner be denied a certificate of appealability as to those Grounds. Petitioner should be permitted to proceed on appeal *in forma pauperis.*\n\nNovember 2, 2021.\n\ns/ Michael R. Merz\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\nNOTICE REGARDING OBJECTIONS\n\nPursuant to Fed. R.

Bridges, pro se.   \n \n \nMARY EILEEN KILBANE, J.: \n \n Defendant-appellant, Andrey L. Bridges (\u201cBridges\u201d), appeals the \ndenial of his postconviction motion to proceed with findings of fact and conclusions \nof law.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the trial court.  \nPrior Procedural History \n Bridges has an extensive history with this court stemming from \nnumerous appeals in regards to his 2013 conviction for murder.  We have \nsummarized that history before as follows: \nIn November 2013, a jury convicted Bridges of murder, felonious \nassault, tampering with evidence, and abuse of a corpse in relation to \nthe death of Carl Acoff.  The trial court sentenced Bridges to an \naggregate term of life in prison with the possibility of parole after 18 \nyears and six months.  Bridges filed a direct appeal, arguing his \nconvictions for murder and felonious assault were against the manifest \nweight of the evidence and the evidence was insufficient to sustain a \nconviction for tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse.  We \naffirmed Bridges\u2019s convictions.  State v. Bridges, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga \nNo. 100805, 2014-Ohio-4570 (\u201cBridges I\u201d); see State v. Bridges, 8th \nDist. Cuyahoga No. 100805, 2015-Ohio-1447 (denying Bridges's \napplication for reopening his appeal). \nIn July 2014, Bridges filed a petition for postconviction relief, arguing \nineffective assistance of counsel, his convictions were not supported by \nsufficient evidence, and prosecutorial misconduct.  While Bridges\u2019s \ndirect appeal was pending, the trial court denied his petition for \npostconviction relief without a hearing and issued findings of fact and \nconclusions of law supporting the denial.  Bridges appealed these \nrulings in two cases, both of which were dismissed for failure to file the \nrecord.  State v. Bridges , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 101938 (Oct. 1, \n2014), and 101942 (Oct. 31, 2014). \nIn March 2015, Bridges filed a petition to vacate or set aside his \njudgment of conviction or sentence, arguing ineffective assistance of \ncounsel, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, speedy trial \nviolations, and prosecutorial misconduct.  The trial court denied \nBridges\u2019s petition without a hearing.  In May 2015, Bridges filed a \nmotion for new trial, arguing his convictions were not supported by \nsufficient evidence, the trial court abused its discretion by admitting \nprejudicial photographic evidence, and his $5 million bond was \nunconstitutional.  The trial court denied Bridges\u2019s motion without a \nhearing. \nBridges appealed these two rulings, and in December 2015, we affirmed \nthe same.  State v. Bridges , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 102930 and  \n103090, 2015-Ohio-5428 (\u201cBridges II\u201d).  In affirming the trial court's \njudgment, we determined that Bridges\u2019s motion for new trial was \nuntimely and not based on newly discovered evidence.  In addition, we \nconcluded that the claims asserted in Bridges\u2019s postconviction motion \nto vacate or set aside judgment of conviction or sentence were barred \nby res judicata.  Id. \nIn August 2015, while his appeal in Bridges II was pending, Bridges \nfiled a motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial.  In May \n2016, Bridges filed a \u201cmotion for leave with memorandum in support \nto correct error R.C. 2903.02(A) conviction due to insufficient \nevidence\u201d (\u201cmotion to correct error\u201d).  The trial court denied both \nmotions without a hearing.  Bridges appealed the trial court\u2019s rulings, \nand in October 2016, we affirmed the trial court.  State v. Bridges, 8th \nDist. Cuyahoga Nos. 103634 and 104506, 2016-Ohio-7298 (\u201c Bridges \nIII\u201d). \nIn Bridges III, we sua sponte consolidated Bridges\u2019s appeal in Appeal  \nNo. 103634 and found that the journal entries from which Bridges had \nappealed were not final, appealable orders.  Id. at \u00b6 10-12.  In affirming \nthe trial court's denial of Bridges\u2019s motion for leave to file a delayed \nmotion for new trial, we found Bridges failed to provide any new \nevidence supporting his ineffective assistance, actual innocence, and \nerror of law claims that was not previously known or available to him \nduring his trial or during the time period immediately following his \nconviction, and nevertheless, his claims are barred by res judicata.  Id. \nat \u00b6 24-28.  Additionally, we found Bridges\u2019s motion to correct error \nwas barred by res judicata.  Id. at \u00b6 38. \nState v. Bridges, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106653, 2018-Ohio-4113, \u00b6 2-7 (\u201cBridges \nIV\u201d). \n In December 2017, Bridges filed a motion to leave to file void or \nvoidable judgment, arguing that the trial court considered the status of the victim as \ntransgender and this consideration rendered his sentence contrary to law.  He also \nclaimed that this consideration violated his due process rights.  The trial court \ndenied Bridges\u2019s motion and Bridges appealed.  In Bridges IV, we affirmed the trial \ncourt, finding that Bridges\u2019s motion was an untimely petition for postconviction  \nrelief, and that, even if it were not untimely, his claims were barred by res judicata.  \nId.  \nThe present case \n On April 8, 2019, Bridges filed a \u201cmotion to rebut violent offender \ndatabase and duties and raise factual innocence.\u201d  The trial court denied that motion \non April 24, 2019.  Bridges did not appeal.  On June 26, 2019, Bridges filed a motion \nto proceed with findings of fact and conclusions of law arguing that the court was \nrequired to provide reasons for denying his April 8 motion.  The trial court denied \nhis motion for findings of fact and conclusions of law on July 16, 2019.  Bridges now \nappeals that denial.  He provides two assignments of error for our review. \nAssignment of Error I  \n \nAppellant is denied his Equal Protection and Due process of Law of the \n14th Amendment, to the United States Constitution and Article 1, \nSection 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution and he is in fact-Factual \nInnocent of the Crime, Elements and Conviction \nAssignment of Error II  \n \nThe trial court committed error by not issuing a complete finding of fact \nand conclusion of law setting forth the reason why relief is denied. \n Both assignments can be addressed together.  \nSuccessive Petition \n Bridges motion is a successive petition for postconviction relief; as a \nresult, the trial court was not required to issue findings of fact and conclusions of \nlaw.  \n Bridges titled his motion \u201cA motion to rebut violent offender database \nand duties and raise factual innocence.\u201d  This is a motion to correct or vacate his \nsentence and should be treated as a postconviction petition as a result.  \u201c[A] vaguely \ntitled motion to correct or vacate a sentence may be construed as a petition for post-\nconviction relief where the motion was filed subsequent to a direct appeal, claimed \na denial of constitutional rights, sought to render the judgment void, and asked for \na vacation of the judgment and sentence.\u201d  State v. Meincke, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. \n96407, 2011-Ohio-6473, quoting State v. Caldwell, 3d Dist. Paulding No. 11-05-07, \n2005-Ohio-5375, citing State v. Reynolds , 79 Ohio St.3d 158, 679 N.E.2d 1131 \n(1997), syllabus.  Bridges\u2019s motion meets all four requirements. \n Because Bridges has filed prior petitions for postconviction relief, this \npetition is deemed a successive petition.  The Ohio Supreme Court has held that a \ntrial court \u201chas no duty to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law on successive \nor untimely petitions for post-conviction relief.\u201d  State ex rel.

Basinger, 99 Ohio St.3d 303, 2003-Ohio-3631, 791 N.E.2d 459, \u00b6 6-7.  \nAs a result, the trial court acted within its discretion to not issue findings of fact and  \nconclusions of law.  See State v. Williamson, 8th Dist.

Bridges (\u201cBridges\u201d), appeals the denial of his postconviction motion to proceed with findings of fact and conclusions of law. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the trial court.\nPrior Procedural History\n\nBridges has an extensive history with this court stemming from numerous appeals in regards to his 2013 conviction for murder. We have summarized that history before as follows:\n\nIn November 2013, a jury convicted Bridges of murder, felonious assault, tampering with evidence, and abuse of a corpse in relation to the death of Carl Acoff. The trial court sentenced Bridges to an aggregate term of life in prison with the possibility of parole after 18 years and six months. Bridges filed a direct appeal, arguing his convictions for murder and felonious assault were against the manifest weight of the evidence and the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse. We affirmed Bridges's convictions. State v. Bridges, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100805, 2014-Ohio-4570 (\u201cBridges I\u201d); see State v. Bridges, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100805, 2015-Ohio-1447 (denying Bridges\u2019s application for reopening his appeal).\n\nIn July 2014, Bridges filed a petition for postconviction relief, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel, his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence, and prosecutorial misconduct. While Bridges\u2019s direct appeal was pending, the trial court denied his petition for postconviction relief without a hearing and issued findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the denial. Bridges appealed these rulings in two cases, both of which were dismissed for failure to file the record. State v. Bridges, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 101938 (Oct. 1, 2014), and 101942 (Oct. 31, 2014).\n\nIn March 2015, Bridges filed a petition to vacate or set aside his judgment of conviction or sentence, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, speedy trial violations, and prosecutorial misconduct. The trial court denied Bridges\u2019s petition without a hearing. In May 2015, Bridges filed a motion for new trial, arguing his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence, the trial court abused its discretion by admitting prejudicial photographic evidence, and his $5 million bond was unconstitutional. The trial court denied Bridges\u2019s motion without a hearing.\n\nBridges appealed these two rulings, and in December 2015, we affirmed the same. State v. Bridges, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 102930 and\n103090, 2015-Ohio-5428 (\"Bridges II\"). In affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment, we determined that Bridges\u2019s motion for new trial was untimely and not based on newly discovered evidence. In addition, we concluded that the claims asserted in Bridges\u2019s postconviction motion to vacate or set aside judgment of conviction or sentence were barred by res judicata. *Id.*\n\nIn August 2015, while his appeal in *Bridges II* was pending, Bridges filed a motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial.

The trial court denied both motions without a hearing. Bridges appealed the trial court\u2019s rulings, and in October 2016, we affirmed the trial court. *State v. Bridges*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 103634 and 104506, 2016-Ohio-7298 (\"Bridges III\").\n\nIn *Bridges III*, we sua sponte consolidated Bridges\u2019s appeal in Appeal No. 103634 and found that the journal entries from which Bridges had appealed were not final, appealable orders. *Id.* at \u00b6 10-12. In affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of Bridges\u2019s motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial, we found Bridges failed to provide any new evidence supporting his ineffective assistance, actual innocence, and error of law claims that was not previously known or available to him during his trial or during the time period immediately following his conviction, and nevertheless, his claims are barred by res judicata. *Id.* at \u00b6 24-28.

He also claimed that this consideration violated his due process rights. The trial court denied Bridges\u2019s motion and Bridges appealed. In *Bridges IV*, we affirmed the trial court, finding that Bridges\u2019s motion was an untimely petition for postconviction\nrelief, and that, even if it were not untimely, his claims were barred by res judicata.\n\nId.\n\nThe present case\n\nOn April 8, 2019, Bridges filed a \u201cmotion to rebut violent offender database and duties and raise factual innocence.\u201d The trial court denied that motion on April 24, 2019. Bridges did not appeal. On June 26, 2019, Bridges filed a motion to proceed with findings of fact and conclusions of law arguing that the court was required to provide reasons for denying his April 8 motion. The trial court denied his motion for findings of fact and conclusions of law on July 16, 2019. Bridges now appeals that denial.

Dixon filed a timely \nnotice of appeal with this Court on April 6, 2018. \n{\u00b6 2} Initially, we note that following his original conviction in 2006, Dixon filed an \nunsuccessful direct appeal.  Dixon has also unsuccessfully pursued post-conviction \nrelief. See State v. Dixon, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21823, 2008-Ohio-755 (Dixon I); State \nv. Dixon, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23592, 2010-Ohio-2635 (Dixon II); State v. Dixon, 2d \nDist. Montgomery No. 26873, 2016-Ohio-5538 ( Dixon II); and State v. Dixon , 2d Dist. \nMontgomery No. 27652, 2018-Ohio-192 (Dixon IV).    \n{\u00b6 3} Because they are interrelated, Dixon\u2019s assignments of error will be discussed \ntogether. \nTHE COURT VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION, STATUTE, AND \nLAW, DIXON\u2019S RIGHTS TO LIBERTY AND DUE PROCESS, BY \nIMPOSING A SENTENCE OUTSIDE STATUTE. \nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY IMPOSING A VOID ILLEGAL \nSENTENCE WHICH IS CONTRARY TO LAW, STATUTES AND \nVIOLATES THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS \n5TH, 6TH, 8TH, AND 14TH \u2013 U.S.C.A.  \n-3- \nALLIED OFFENSE ISSUE.  THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED [ITS] \nDISCRETION AND FAILED TO GRANT CONSTITUTIONAL DUE \nPROCESS, WHICH VIOLATED THE OHIO CONSTITUTION AND THE \nU.S. CONSTITUTION OF THE 5TH, 6TH, 8TH, AND 14TH \nAMENDMENTS. \nTHE TRIAL COURT ABUSED [ITS] DISCRETION BY IMPOSING A \nFACT NOT IN EVIDENCE OR ON RECORD TO GIVE A PERSONAL BIAS \nRETAINED FALSELY OUTSIDE THE RECORD \u2013 HATE CRIME \nACCUSATION \u2013 WITH NO PRIOR NOTICE OR SUPPORTING FACTS \nWHICH LED TO ILLEGAL SENTENCE, THIS VIOLATED THE OHIO \nCONSTITUTION AND UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. 5TH, 6TH, 8TH, \nAND 14TH AMENDMENTS. DISPARITY IN PENALTIES R.C. 2953.21. \nTHE COURT VIOLATED THE 8TH AMENDMENT AND OTHER \nDUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS BASED ON IMPOSING A SENTENCE OUT \nOF PROPORTION. EXCESSIVE BASED ON DISPARITY IN SENTENCE \nR.C. 2953.08(A)(5) \u2013 ALSO PRESUMED GUILT BY THE COURT [R.C.] \n2901.05(A). \nTRIAL COUNSEL AND APPELLATE COUNSEL BOTH WAS \nINEFFECTIVE WHICH DEPRIVED DIXON OF A FAIR CONSTITUTIONAL \nTRIAL AND APPEAL. \nDIXON WAS DEPRIVED [OF] LIBERTY, DUE PROCESS, AND \nEQUAL PROTECTION BY DENIAL TO CONSIDER MERITS OF ALLIED \nOFFENSES \u2013 WHEN DIXON REPEATEDLY TRIED TO PRO SE OBJECT  \n-4- \nAND MOVE THE COURT, PRE-TRIAL AND POST-TRIAL, COUNSEL \nREFUSED TO PROPERLY RAISE ISSUE \u2013 ALSO DIXON BELIEVES \nCOMPLICITY NEEDS TO BE ESTABLISHED PROPERLY FOR ALLIED \nOFFENSE, AS IT STANDS ITS CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS TO \nIMPOSE CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES ON ONE ACT OF COMPLICITY.        \nTHE APPEALS COURT AND TRIAL COURT ALL HAVE VIOLATED \nDIXON[\u2018]S RIGHTS OF DUE PROCESS, EQUAL PROTECTION AND \nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO CONVICTION AND SENTENCE \u2013 \nIMPOSED BY STATUTE. \nDIXON WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS FAIR TRIAL BY ABUSE OF \nDISCRETION BY DISPARITY IN SENTENCE PRESUMED GUILT AND \nBIAS JUDGE ISSUES WHICH VIOLATED 5TH, 6TH, 8TH, AND 14TH \nAMENDMENTS. \nTHE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF FAIR TRIAL, DUE PROCESS, \nAND EQUAL PROTECTION WAS DEPRIVED BY PROSECUTOR \nMISCONDUCT, WHICH VIOLATED THE 5TH, 6TH, 8TH, AND 14TH \nAMENDMENTS. \n{\u00b6 4} In the instant appeal, Dixon contends that the trial court erred in failing to \nmerge allied offenses when it sentenced him in 2006 to an aggregate 21-year prison term \nfor complicity to commit aggravated robbery, complicity to commit aggravated burglary, \nand complicity to commit felonious assault, all with firearm specifications.  Dixon also \nargues that the trial court erred when it imposed consecutive sentences.  Furthermore \nDixon contends that his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to properly  \n-5- \nraise the sentencing issues at trial and on direct appeal.  Dixon also argues that the \nevidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support his convictions for complicity.  \nLastly, Dixon argues that the State committed prosecutorial misconduct at trial.  \n{\u00b6 5} Post-conviction relief is governed by R.C. 2953.21.  The statute provides, in \npertinent part, that: \nAny person who has been convicted of a criminal offense * * * and who \nclaims that there was such a denial or infringement of the person's rights as \nto render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the \nConstitution of the United States, * * * may file a petition in the court that \nimposed sentence, stating the grounds for relief relied upon, and asking the \ncourt to vacate or set aside the judgment or sentence or to grant other \nappropriate relief. The petitioner may file a supporting affidavit and other \ndocumentary evidence in support of the claim for relief. \nR.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a). \n{\u00b6 6} \u201cA post[-]conviction proceeding is not an appeal of a criminal conviction, but, \nrather, a collateral civil attack on the judgment.\u201d State v. Steffen, 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410, \n639 N.E.2d 67 (1994). See also State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, \n860 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 48.  To prevail on a petition for post-conviction relief, the defendant \nmust establish a violation of his constitutional rights which renders the judgment of \nconviction void or voidable. R.C. 2953.21.  The instant appeal represents Dixon\u2019s fourth \nmotion for post-conviction relief.   \n{\u00b6 7} Upon review, we see no error in the trial court's ruling. As we stated in Dixon \nIV, any allied-offense sentencing error would have rendered Dixon's sentence voidable,  \n-6- \nnot void.  Thus, res judicata precludes him from raising an allied-offense issue in post-\nconviction proceedings when the issue could have been raised on direct appeal. State v. \nByrd, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26700, 2015-Ohio-5293, \u00b6 10 (\u201cThe failure to merge allied \noffenses does not render a judgment void, but voidable. * * * Consequently, challenges \nto the trial court's failure to merge allied offenses are barred by the doctrine of res judicata \nif they could have been, but were not, raised on direct appeal.\u201d); see also State v. Haynes, \n2d Dist. Clark No. 2013 CA 90, 2014-Ohio-2675, \u00b6 14 (\u201c[T]he issues raised in Haynes's \nassignments of error could have been raised on direct appeal, and are barred by res \njudicata, regardless of whether they might be characterized as plain error.\u201d); State v. \nDominguez, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26853, 2016-Ohio-5051, \u00b6 11 (\u201cBecause \nDominguez could have raised the allied-offense issue in a direct appeal, the trial court \ncorrectly concluded that res judicata applied to his post-conviction motions.\u201d).  Here we \nsee no reason why Dixon could not have raised an allied-offense argument on direct \nappeal, and he has not identified any such reason.  Accordingly, Dixon\u2019s allied offenses \nclaims are barred by res judicata. \n{\u00b6 8} Furthermore, we find that res judicata bars Dixon\u2019s remaining assignments \nof error.  In Dixon I, Dixon II, and Dixon III, Dixon raised ineffective assistance claims.  \nAfter initially finding no ineffective assistance in his direct appeal, we subsequently held \nthe issue was barred by res judicata. Dixon I at \u00b6 53; Dixon II at \u00b6 23; and Dixon III at \u00b6 \n34.  In assignments of error I and II, Dixon argues that the trial court erred when it \nimposed consecutive sentences.  Dixon, however, raised the same argument in his \ndirect appeal, wherein we affirmed the trial court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences. \nDixon I at \u00b6 18.  Additionally, we find that Dixon previously raised arguments regarding  \n-7- \nthe sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence in Dixon I and Dixon II.  Thus, those \narguments are barred by res judicata. \n{\u00b6 9} In his fourth assignment, Dixon argues that the trial court was biased against \nhim because it falsely believed that he was anti-Semitic based upon a statement made \nduring sentencing; however; this issue could have been raised on direct appeal and is \nnow barred by res judicata.  Res judicata also bars Dixon\u2019s argument regarding a \nsentencing disparity between himself and his co-defendants.

Third Street, 5th Floor, Dayton, OH 45422\nAttorney for Plaintiff-Appellee\n\nWILLIAM DIXON, #529-169, P.O. Box 80033, Toledo, OH 43608\nDefendant-Appellant, Pro Se\nDONOVAN, J.\n\n\u00b6 1 Defendant-appellant William Dixon appeals pro se a judgment of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division, overruling his \u201cmotion to vacate a void sentence pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B)\u201d and his \u201cmotion to supplement case law and standard for pending rule 52(B).\u201d Specifically, the trial court found that Dixon\u2019s arguments regarding the failure of the sentencing court to merge allied offenses and the imposition of consecutive sentences were barred by res judicata. Dixon filed a timely notice of appeal with this Court on April 6, 2018.\n\n\u00b6 2 Initially, we note that following his original conviction in 2006, Dixon filed an unsuccessful direct appeal. Dixon has also unsuccessfully pursued post-conviction relief. See State v. Dixon, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21823, 2008-Ohio-755 (Dixon I); State v. Dixon, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23592, 2010-Ohio-2635 (Dixon II); State v. Dixon, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26873, 2016-Ohio-5538 (Dixon III); and State v. Dixon, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27652, 2018-Ohio-192 (Dixon IV).\n\n\u00b6 3 Because they are interrelated, Dixon\u2019s assignments of error will be discussed together.\n\nTHE COURT VIOLATED THE CONSTITUTION, STATUTE, AND LAW, DIXON\u2019S RIGHTS TO LIBERTY AND DUE PROCESS, BY IMPOSING A SENTENCE OUTSIDE STATUTE.\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY IMPOSING A VOID ILLEGAL SENTENCE WHICH IS CONTRARY TO LAW, STATUTES AND VIOLATES THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS 5TH, 6TH, 8TH, AND 14TH \u2013 U.S.C.A.\nALLIED OFFENSE ISSUE. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED [ITS] DISCRETION AND FAILED TO GRANT CONSTITUTIONAL DUE PROCESS, WHICH VIOLATED THE OHIO CONSTITUTION AND THE U.S. CONSTITUTION OF THE 5TH, 6TH, 8TH, AND 14TH AMENDMENTS.\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ABUSED [ITS] DISCRETION BY IMPOSING A FACT NOT IN EVIDENCE OR ON RECORD TO GIVE A PERSONAL BIAS RETAINED FALSELY OUTSIDE THE RECORD \u2013 HATE CRIME ACCUSATION \u2013 WITH NO PRIOR NOTICE OR SUPPORTING FACTS WHICH LED TO ILLEGAL SENTENCE, THIS VIOLATED THE OHIO CONSTITUTION AND UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. 5TH, 6TH, 8TH, AND 14TH AMENDMENTS. DISPARITY IN PENALTIES R.C. 2953.21.\n\nTHE COURT VIOLATED THE 8TH AMENDMENT AND OTHER DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS BASED ON IMPOSING A SENTENCE OUT OF PROPORTION. EXCESSIVE BASED ON DISPARITY IN SENTENCE R.C. 2953.08(A)(5) \u2013 ALSO PRESUMED GUILT BY THE COURT [R.C.] 2901.05(A).\n\nTRIAL COUNSEL AND APPELLATE COUNSEL BOTH WAS INEFFECTIVE WHICH DEPRIVED DIXON OF A FAIR CONSTITUTIONAL TRIAL AND APPEAL.\n\nDIXON WAS DEPRIVED [OF] LIBERTY, DUE PROCESS, AND EQUAL PROTECTION BY DENIAL TO CONSIDER MERITS OF ALLIED OFFENSES \u2013 WHEN DIXON REPEATEDLY TRIED TO PRO SE OBJECT\nAND MOVE THE COURT, PRE-TRIAL AND POST-TRIAL, COUNSEL REFUSED TO PROPERLY RAISE ISSUE \u2013 ALSO DIXON BELIEVES COMPLICITY NEEDS TO BE ESTABLISHED PROPERLY FOR ALLIED OFFENSE, AS IT STANDS ITS CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS TO IMPOSE CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES ON ONE ACT OF COMPLICITY.\n\nTHE APPEALS COURT AND TRIAL COURT ALL HAVE VIOLATED DIXON\u2019S RIGHTS OF DUE PROCESS, EQUAL PROTECTION AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO CONVICTION AND SENTENCE \u2013 IMPOSED BY STATUTE.\n\nDIXON WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS FAIR TRIAL BY ABUSE OF DISCRETION BY DISPARITY IN SENTENCE PRESUMED GUILT AND BIAS JUDGE ISSUES WHICH VIOLATED 5TH, 6TH, 8TH, AND 14TH AMENDMENTS.\n\nTHE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF FAIR TRIAL, DUE PROCESS, AND EQUAL PROTECTION WAS DEPRIVED BY PROSECUTOR MISCONDUCT, WHICH VIOLATED THE 5TH, 6TH, 8TH, AND 14TH AMENDMENTS.\n\n\u00b6 4 In the instant appeal, Dixon contends that the trial court erred in failing to merge allied offenses when it sentenced him in 2006 to an aggregate 21-year prison term for complicity to commit aggravated robbery, complicity to commit aggravated burglary, and complicity to commit felonious assault, all with firearm specifications. Dixon also argues that the trial court erred when it imposed consecutive sentences. Furthermore Dixon contends that his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to properly\nraise the sentencing issues at trial and on direct appeal. Dixon also argues that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support his convictions for complicity. Lastly, Dixon argues that the State committed prosecutorial misconduct at trial.\n\n\u00b6 5 Post-conviction relief is governed by R.C. 2953.21. The statute provides, in pertinent part, that:\n\nAny person who has been convicted of a criminal offense * * * and who claims that there was such a denial or infringement of the person's rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States, * * * may file a petition in the court that imposed sentence, stating the grounds for relief relied upon, and asking the court to vacate or set aside the judgment or sentence or to grant other appropriate relief. The petitioner may file a supporting affidavit and other documentary evidence in support of the claim for relief.\n\nR.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a).\n\n\u00b6 6 \u201cA post[-]conviction proceeding is not an appeal of a criminal conviction, but, rather, a collateral civil attack on the judgment.\u201d State v. Steffen, 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410, 639 N.E.2d 67 (1994). See also State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 48. To prevail on a petition for post-conviction relief, the defendant must establish a violation of his constitutional rights which renders the judgment of conviction void or voidable. R.C. 2953.21. The instant appeal represents Dixon's fourth motion for post-conviction relief.\n\n\u00b6 7 Upon review, we see no error in the trial court's ruling. As we stated in Dixon IV, any allied-offense sentencing error would have rendered Dixon's sentence voidable,\nnot void. Thus, res judicata precludes him from raising an allied-offense issue in post-conviction proceedings when the issue could have been raised on direct appeal. * * * Consequently, challenges to the trial court\u2019s failure to merge allied offenses are barred by the doctrine of res judicata if they could have been, but were not, raised on direct appeal.\u201d); see also State v. Haynes, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2013 CA 90, 2014-Ohio-2675, \u00b6 14 (\u201c[T]he issues raised in Haynes\u2019s assignments of error could have been raised on direct appeal, and are barred by res judicata, regardless of whether they might be characterized as plain error.\u201d); State v. Dominguez, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26853, 2016-Ohio-5051, \u00b6 11 (\u201cBecause Dominguez could have raised the allied-offense issue in a direct appeal, the trial court correctly concluded that res judicata applied to his post-conviction motions.\u201d). Here we see no reason why Dixon could not have raised an allied-offense argument on direct appeal, and he has not identified any such reason. Accordingly, Dixon\u2019s allied offenses claims are barred by res judicata.\n\nFurthermore, we find that res judicata bars Dixon\u2019s remaining assignments of error. In Dixon I, Dixon II, and Dixon III, Dixon raised ineffective assistance claims. After initially finding no ineffective assistance in his direct appeal, we subsequently held the issue was barred by res judicata. Dixon I at \u00b6 53; Dixon II at \u00b6 23; and Dixon III at \u00b6 34. In assignments of error I and II, Dixon argues that the trial court erred when it imposed consecutive sentences. Dixon, however, raised the same argument in his direct appeal, wherein we affirmed the trial court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences. Dixon I at \u00b6 18. Additionally, we find that Dixon previously raised arguments regarding\nthe sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence in Dixon I and Dixon II. Thus, those arguments are barred by res judicata.\n\n\u00b6 9 In his fourth assignment, Dixon argues that the trial court was biased against him because it falsely believed that he was anti-Semitic based upon a statement made during sentencing; however, this issue could have been raised on direct appeal and is now barred by res judicata. Res judicata also bars Dixon\u2019s argument regarding a sentencing disparity between himself and his co-defendants. Lastly, Dixon\u2019s claim regarding prosecutorial misconduct was argued and thoroughly addressed by this Court in Dixon III, and is therefore barred by res judicata.\n\n\u00b6 10 Dixon\u2019s assignments of error are overruled.\n\n\u00b6 11 All of Dixon's assignments of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\nWELBAUM, P.

Bender (\u201cBender\u201d) appeals the judgment of the Union \nCounty Court of Common Pleas, alleging that the trial court erred in dismissing his \npetition for post-conviction relief.  For the reasons set forth below, the judgment of \nthe trial court is affirmed.  \nFacts and Procedural History \n{\u00b62} On July 13, 2018, Bender was indicted on one count of felonious assault \nin violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), a felony of the second degr ee; one count of \nkidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3), a felony of the first degree; one \ncount of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), a felony of t he first degree; and \none count of having weapon while under disability in violation of R.C. \n2923.13(A)(2), a felony of the third degree.  Doc. 1.  After his trial, the jury returned \nverdicts of guilty on all of the charges against Bender on Apri l 24, 2019.  Doc. 78-\n81.   \n{\u00b63} On May 29, 2019, the trial court sentenced Bender.  Doc. 87.  B ender \nthen filed his notice of appeal on June 18, 2019.  Doc. 93.  On  September 9, 2019, \nthe trial transcript was filed for his direct appeal.  Doc. 114 .  On his direct appeal, \nhe raised three assignments of error, including an ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaim.  State v. Bender, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-19-22, 2020-Ohio-722, \u00b6 6, 19.  On  \nCase No. 14-21-01 \n \n \n \n-3- \n \nMarch 2, 2020, this Court issued a decision that overruled his assignments of error \nand affirmed the judgment of the trial court.  Id. at \u00b6 37. \n{\u00b64} On December 1, 2020, Bender filed a petition for post-conviction relief \npro se.  Doc. 116.  In this petition, Bender raised an ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaim and a prosecutorial misconduct claim.  Doc. 116.  On Janu ary 20, 2021, the \ntrial court dismissed Bender\u2019s petition without a hearing becau se this petition was \nnot timely filed.  Doc. 124.  Bender filed his notice of appeal  on February 1, 2021.  \nDoc. 126.  On appeal, Bender raises the following assignments of error: \nFirst Assignment of Error \nTrial Court erred when it determined that Appellant\u2019s Post \nConviction Relief Petition was barred by the statute of limitations. \n \nSecond Assignment of Error \nTrial Court erred by stating that Appellant\u2019s Post-Conviction \ngrounds for relief were addressed during direct appeal.  \n \nThird Assignment of Error \nThe denial of Appellant\u2019s petition was principally grounded on \nthe basis of judicial bias, and not the facts within the eviden ce \nsubmitted to support the petition.   \n \nFirst Assignment of Error \n{\u00b65} Bender asserts that his petition for post-conviction relief was  t i m e l y  \nfiled because the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s order tolling time requirements in response \nto the COVID-19 pandemic extended the applicable deadline. \n   \nCase No. 14-21-01 \n \n \n \n-4- \n \nLegal Standard \n{\u00b66} \u201cR.C. 2953.21 governs petitions for post-conviction relief.\u201d  State v. \nWine, 3d Dist. Auglaize No. 2-15-07, 2015-Ohio-4726, \u00b6 10.  \u201cPostco nviction \nreview is not a constitutional right, but is a collateral civil attack on a judgment that \nis governed solely by R.C. 2953.21.\u201d  State v. Keith, 176 Ohio App.3d 260, 2008-\nOhio-741, 891 N.E.2d 1191, \u00b6 24 (3d Dist.).  R.C. 2953.21(A)(1) (a)(i) states that a \npetition for post-conviction relief may be filed by  \n[a]ny person who has been convicted of a criminal offense or \nadjudicated a delinquent child and who claims that there was \nsuch a denial or infringement of the person\u2019s rights as to rend er \nthe judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the \nConstitution of the United States[.] \n \nR.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a)(i).  In general, to be timely filed, a pe tition for post-\nconviction relief must be filed with the trial court \u201cno later than three hundred sixty-\nfive days after the date on which the trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals in \nthe direct appeal of the judgment of conviction * * *.\u201d  R.C. 2953.21(A)(2)(a).   \n{\u00b67} \u201cA trial court lacks jurisdiction to entertain an untimely or s uccessive \npetition for postconviction relief unless the petitioner establ ishes that one of the \nexceptions in R.C. 2953.23(A) applies.\u201d  State v. Cunningham, 2016-Ohio-3106, 65 \nN.E.3d 307, \u00b6 13 (3d Dist.), quoting State v. Chavis, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 15AP-\n557, 2015-Ohio-5549, \u00b6 14.  Under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1), a trial c ourt may consider \na petition for post-conviction that was filed after timeframe s et forth in R.C. \n2953.21(A) if both of the following criterion apply:  \nCase No. 14-21-01 \n \n \n \n-5- \n \n[1] Either the petitioner shows that the petitioner was \nunavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which the \npetitioner must rely to present the claim for relief, or, subsequent \nto the period prescribed in division (A)(2) of section 2953.21 of the \nRevised Code or to the filing of an earlier petition, the Unite d \nStates Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that \napplies retroactively to persons in the petitioner\u2019s situation,  and \nthe petition asserts a claim based on that right. \n \n[2] The petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that,  \nbut for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder  \nwould have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which the \npetitioner was convicted or, if the claim challenges a sentence  of \ndeath that, but for constitutional error at the sentencing hear ing, \nno reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner eligib le \nfor the death sentence. \n \nR.C. 2953.23(A).   \nThus, unless the defendant alleges a new federal or state right has \nbeen recognized, the defendant must prove (1) that he was \nunavoidably prevented from discovery of facts upon which his \nsuccessive petition for postconviction relief rests and (2) tha t he \nwould not have been convicted at trial by a reasonable factfinder \nbut for the constitutional error. \n \nState v. Workman , 3d Dist. Auglaize No. 2-17-12, 2017-Ohio-7364, \u00b6 18, citing \nR.C. 2953.23(A)(1).  A petitioner is not entitled to an evident iary hearing simply \nbecause he or she filed a petition for post-conviction relief.  State v. Lewis, 3d Dist. \nLogan No. 8-19-08, 2019-Ohio-3031, \u00b6 11.   \n{\u00b68} On appeal, \u201c[w]e review the trial court\u2019s dismissal of a post-conviction \npetition without a hearing for abuse of discretion.\u201d  State v.

Sullivan, 2017-Ohio-8937, 102 N.E.3d 86, \u00b6 20 (3d Dist.).  \n\u201cRather, an abuse of discretion is present where the trial cour t\u2019s decision was \narbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious.\u201d  State v. Kleman, 3d Dist. Hardin No. 6-19-\n01, 2019-Ohio-4404, \u00b6 18, quoting State v. Howton , 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-16-35, \n2017-Ohio-4349, \u00b6 23.  \nLegal Analysis  \n{\u00b69} In this case, the trial transcript was filed on September 9, 20 19 for \nBender\u2019s direct appeal.  Doc. 114.  Bender filed his petition f or post-conviction \nrelief on December 1, 2020.  Doc. 116.  Thus, Bender\u2019s petition for post-conviction \nrelief was filed more than three hundred and sixty-five days after the trial transcript \nwas filed for his direct appeal.  However, Bender asserts that his petition was, in \nfact, timely filed when legislation that tolled statutory time requirements in response \nto the COVID-19 pandemic is taken into account.    \n[O]n March 27, 2020, the Governor of Ohio signed into law \nAm.Sub.H.B. No. 197, which immediately tolled, retroactive to \nMarch 9, 2020, all statutes of limitation, time limitations, an d \ndeadlines in the Ohio Revised Code and the Ohio Administrative \nCode until the expiration of Executive Order 2020-01D or July 30, \n2020, whichever is sooner[.]  \n \nIn re Tolling of Time Requirements Imposed by Rules Promulgated by Supreme \nCourt & Use of Technology , 158 Ohio St.3d 1447, 2020-Ohio-1166, 141 N.E.3d \n974, 974-975.  The Supreme Court subsequently issued guidance f or applying this \ntolling legislation that explained the following:    \nCase No. 14-21-01 \n \n \n \n-7- \n \nThe legislation and Supreme Court order toll only time \nrequirements set to expire during the emergency period.  Time \nrequirements that are set to expire after the emergency period are \nnot tolled. \n \n(Emphasis sic.) The Supreme Court of Ohio, Assessing Impact of Tolling \nLegislation and Supreme Court Order upon Specific Time Requirements  \nhttps://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/coronavirus/resources/tollingAnalysis040220.\npdf (accessed May 25, 2021). \n{\u00b610} In this case, the deadline for timely filing a petition for post-conviction \nrelief was September 9, 2020, which did not fall in between March 9, 2020 and July \n30, 2020.  Doc. 114.  Since the deadline fell after the emergen cy period ended on \nJuly 30, 2020, the law tolling statutory time requirements does  not apply in this \nsituation.  Thus, Bender had three hundred and sixty-five days from the date on \nwhich the transcripts were filed for his direct appeal to timel y file his motion for \npost-conviction relief.  Since he did not file his petition wit hin this timeframe, his \npetition was not timely filed.   \n{\u00b611} Finally, in his petition for post-conviction relief, Bender doe s not \nestablish that one of the exceptions listed in R.C. 2953.23(A) is applicable in this \ncase.  For these reasons, the trial court did not err in dismissing his petition for post-\nconviction relief.  As such, Bender\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.   \n   \nCase No. 14-21-01 \n \n \n \n-8- \n \nSecond Assignment of Error \n{\u00b612} Bender argues that the trial court erred in determining that is sues \nraised in his petition for post-conviction relief could have be en raised in his direct \nappeal. \nLegal Standard \n{\u00b613} \u201cAlthough a defendant may challenge his conviction and sentence  by \neither a direct appeal or a petition for postconviction relief,  any claims raised in a \npostconviction relief petition will be barred by res judicata w here the claim was or \ncould have been raised on direct appeal.\u201d  State v. Schwieterman, 3d Dist. Mercer \nNo. 10-09-12, 2010-Ohio-102, \u00b6 23.   \nUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction \nbars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from \nraising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from \nthat judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process \nthat was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the \ntrial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or on an \nappeal from that judgment. \n \nState v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 39 O.O.2d 189 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph \nnine of the syllabus.  In other words, \u201c[a] postconviction reli ef proceeding is not to \nbe utilized as an alternative to or substitute for a direct app eal.\u201d  State v. Lee , 6th \nDist. Lucas No. L-08-1207, 2008-Ohio-6177, \u00b6 5.   \nHowever, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a petiti on \nfor postconviction relief is only barred by res judicata where the \ndefendant was represented by new counsel on direct appeal, and \nwhere appellate counsel was in no way enjoined from asserting \nineffective assistance of trial counsel.  \nCase No. 14-21-01 \n \n \n \n-9- \n \n \nSchwieterman, at \u00b6 23, citing State v. Bradley, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-08-27, 2008-\nOhio-6071, \u00b6 8. \nLegal Analysis  \n{\u00b614} In his petition for post-conviction relief, Bender raises an in effective \nassistance of counsel claim and a prosecutorial misconduct clai m.  In support of \nthese claims, Bender points to a video-recorded interview that the State disclosed to \nthe Defense during discovery.  Doc. 116.  In its brief in this appeal, the State \nvigorously contests the merits of the arguments that Bender bas es on this recorded \ninterview.  But we need not reach the merits of these arguments since both of these \nclaims could have been raised on direct appeal.   \n{\u00b615} Because the arguments in his petition for post-conviction relief rest on \nevidence that the Defense had before trial, these arguments cou ld have been raised \nat his trial and on direct appeal.  Since these arguments were available to him at the \ntime of his direct appeal, the claims raised in his petition fo r post-conviction relief \nare subject to res judicata.  Further, as to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, \nwe note that Bender was represented by different attorneys duri ng his trial and on \nhis direct appeal.  Doc. 107.  See Schwieterman, supra, at \u00b6 24.  Bender even raised \nan unsuccessful ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his prior direct appeal.  \nBender, supra, at \u00b6 22-25.    \nCase No. 14-21-01 \n \n \n \n-10- \n \n{\u00b616} In conclusion, Bender could have raised both of the claims asse rted \nhis petition for post-conviction relief during his direct appea l.  Thus, even if his \npetition for post-conviction relief had been timely filed, thes e claims would still \nhave been barred under the doctrine of res judicata.  For these  reasons, Bender\u2019s \nsecond assignment of error is overruled.   \nThird Assignment of Error \n{\u00b617} Bender asserts that his petition for post-conviction relief was  denied \nbecause of judicial bias.   \nLegal Standard \n{\u00b618} R.C. 2701.03(A) addresses the issue of judicial bias for a judge of the \ncourt of common pleas and reads as follows: \nIf a judge of the court of common pleas allegedly is interested  in \na proceeding pending before the court, allegedly is related to or \nhas a bias or prejudice for or against a party to a proceeding \npending before the court or a party\u2019s counsel, or allegedly \notherwise is disqualified to preside in a proceeding pending before \nthe court, any party to the proceeding or the party\u2019s counsel may \nfile an affidavit of disqualification with the clerk of the sup reme \ncourt in accordance with division (B) of this section. \n \nR.C. 2701.03(A).  Thus, \u201c[t]he determination of a claim that a common pleas judge \nis biased or prejudiced is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court of Ohio, or h[er] designee.\u201d  (Emphasis sic.)

Wieser, 3d Dist. Allen \nNo. 1-18-15, 2018-Ohio-3619, \u00b6 23.   \nJudicial bias has been described by the Supreme Court of Ohio as \n\u2018a hostile feeling or spirit of ill will or undue friendship or  \nfavoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with th e \nformation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the \njudge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which \nwill be governed by the law and the facts.\u2019 \n \nWieser at \u00b6 23, quoting State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt , 164 Ohio St. 463, 58 O.O. \n315, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956), paragraph four of the syllabus. \nLegal Analysis  \n{\u00b620} In this case, Bender did not avail himself of the statutory pro cess to \naddress allegations of judicial bias as set forth in R.C. 2701.03(A).  Further, Bender \nhas not raised any evidence that suggests his due process right s were violated.  See \nState v. Dendinger, 3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-18-38, 2019-Ohio-2158, \u00b6 23; State v. \nCorchado, 2017-Ohio-4390, 93 N.E.3d 150 (7th Dist.).  In this case, the  basis for \nBender\u2019s claim of judicial bias is only that his petition was d ismissed.  See State v. \nSmith, 10th Dist.

Bender Appellant\n\nSamantha Hobbs for Appellee\nWILLAMOWSKI, P.J.\n\nAlthough originally placed on our accelerated calendar, we have elected pursuant to Loc.R. 12(5) to issue a full opinion in lieu of a summary judgment entry. Defendant-appellant Jason G. Bender (\u201cBender\u201d) appeals the judgment of the Union County Court of Common Pleas, alleging that the trial court erred in dismissing his petition for post-conviction relief. For the reasons set forth below, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\nFacts and Procedural History\n\nOn July 13, 2018, Bender was indicted on one count of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), a felony of the second degree; one count of kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3), a felony of the first degree; one count of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), a felony of the first degree; and one count of having weapon while under disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(2), a felony of the third degree. Doc. 1. After his trial, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all of the charges against Bender on April 24, 2019. Doc. 78-81.\n\nOn May 29, 2019, the trial court sentenced Bender. Doc. 87. Bender then filed his notice of appeal on June 18, 2019. Doc. 93. On September 9, 2019, the trial transcript was filed for his direct appeal. Doc. 114. On his direct appeal, he raised three assignments of error, including an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. State v. Bender, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-19-22, 2020-Ohio-722, \u00b6 6, 19. On\nMarch 2, 2020, this Court issued a decision that overruled his assignments of error and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. *Id.* at \u00b6 37.\n\n{\u00b64} On December 1, 2020, Bender filed a petition for post-conviction relief *pro se*. Doc. 116. In this petition, Bender raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and a prosecutorial misconduct claim. Doc. 116. On January 20, 2021, the trial court dismissed Bender\u2019s petition without a hearing because this petition was not timely filed. Doc. 124. Bender filed his notice of appeal on February 1, 2021. Doc. 126. On appeal, Bender raises the following assignments of error:\n\n**First Assignment of Error**\n\nTrial Court erred when it determined that Appellant\u2019s Post Conviction Relief Petition was barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n**Second Assignment of Error**\n\nTrial Court erred by stating that Appellant\u2019s Post-Conviction grounds for relief were addressed during direct appeal.\n\n**Third Assignment of Error**\n\nThe denial of Appellant\u2019s petition was principally grounded on the basis of judicial bias, and not the facts within the evidence submitted to support the petition.\n\n**First Assignment of Error**\n\n{\u00b65} Bender asserts that his petition for post-conviction relief was timely filed because the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s order tolling time requirements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic extended the applicable deadline.\nLegal Standard\n\n{\u00b66} \u201cR.C. 2953.21 governs petitions for post-conviction relief.\u201d State v. Wine, 3d Dist. Auglaize No. 2-15-07, 2015-Ohio-4726, \u00b6 10. \u201cPostconviction review is not a constitutional right, but is a collateral civil attack on a judgment that is governed solely by R.C. 2953.21.\u201d State v. Keith, 176 Ohio App.3d 260, 2008-Ohio-741, 891 N.E.2d 1191, \u00b6 24 (3d Dist.). R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a)(i) states that a petition for post-conviction relief may be filed by\n\n[a]ny person who has been convicted of a criminal offense or adjudicated a delinquent child and who claims that there was such a denial or infringement of the person\u2019s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States[.]\n\nR.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a)(i). In general, to be timely filed, a petition for post-conviction relief must be filed with the trial court \u201cno later than three hundred sixty-five days after the date on which the trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals in the direct appeal of the judgment of conviction * * *.\u201d R.C. 2953.21(A)(2)(a).\n\n{\u00b67} \u201cA trial court lacks jurisdiction to entertain an untimely or successive petition for postconviction relief unless the petitioner establishes that one of the exceptions in R.C. 2953.23(A) applies.\u201d State v. Cunningham, 2016-Ohio-3106, 65 N.E.3d 307, \u00b6 13 (3d Dist.), quoting State v. Chavis, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 15AP-557, 2015-Ohio-5549, \u00b6 14. Under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1), a trial court may consider a petition for post-conviction that was filed after timeframe set forth in R.C. 2953.21(A) if both of the following criterion apply:\n[1] Either the petitioner shows that the petitioner was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which the petitioner must rely to present the claim for relief, or, subsequent to the period prescribed in division (A)(2) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code or to the filing of an earlier petition, the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons in the petitioner\u2019s situation, and the petition asserts a claim based on that right.\n\n[2] The petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted or, if the claim challenges a sentence of death that, but for constitutional error at the sentencing hearing, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner eligible for the death sentence.\n\nR.C. 2953.23(A).\n\nThus, unless the defendant alleges a new federal or state right has been recognized, the defendant must prove (1) that he was unavoidably prevented from discovery of facts upon which his successive petition for postconviction relief rests and (2) that he would not have been convicted at trial by a reasonable factfinder but for the constitutional error.\n\nState v. Workman, 3d Dist. Auglaize No. 2-17-12, 2017-Ohio-7364, \u00b6 18, citing R.C. 2953.23(A)(1). A petitioner is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing simply because he or she filed a petition for post-conviction relief. State v. Lewis, 3d Dist. Logan No. 8-19-08, 2019-Ohio-3031, \u00b6 11.\n\n{\u00b68} On appeal, \u201c[w]e review the trial court\u2019s dismissal of a post-conviction petition without a hearing for abuse of discretion.\u201d State v. Liles, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-16-33, 2017-Ohio-240, \u00b6 10, quoting State v. Jeffers, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 10AP-1112, 2011-Ohio-3555, \u00b6 23. \u201cAn abuse of discretion is not merely an error\nof judgment.\u201d State v. Sullivan, 2017-Ohio-8937, 102 N.E.3d 86, \u00b6 20 (3d Dist.). \u201cRather, an abuse of discretion is present where the trial court\u2019s decision was arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious.\u201d State v. Kleman, 3d Dist. Hardin No. 6-19-01, 2019-Ohio-4404, \u00b6 18, quoting State v. Howton, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-16-35, 2017-Ohio-4349, \u00b6 23.\n\nLegal Analysis\n\n{\u00b69} In this case, the trial transcript was filed on September 9, 2019 for Bender\u2019s direct appeal. Doc. 114. Bender filed his petition for post-conviction relief on December 1, 2020. Doc. 116. Thus, Bender\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief was filed more than three hundred and sixty-five days after the trial transcript was filed for his direct appeal. However, Bender asserts that his petition was, in fact, timely filed when legislation that tolled statutory time requirements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is taken into account.\n\n[O]n March 27, 2020, the Governor of Ohio signed into law Am.Sub.H.B. No. 197, which immediately tolled, retroactive to March 9, 2020, all statutes of limitation, time limitations, and deadlines in the Ohio Revised Code and the Ohio Administrative Code until the expiration of Executive Order 2020-01D or July 30, 2020, whichever is sooner[.]\n\nIn re Tolling of Time Requirements Imposed by Rules Promulgated by Supreme Court & Use of Technology, 158 Ohio St.3d 1447, 2020-Ohio-1166, 141 N.E.3d 974, 974-975. The Supreme Court subsequently issued guidance for applying this tolling legislation that explained the following:\nThe legislation and Supreme Court order toll only time requirements set to expire during the emergency period. Time requirements that are set to expire after the emergency period are not tolled.\n\n(Emphasis sic.) The Supreme Court of Ohio, Assessing Impact of Tolling Legislation and Supreme Court Order upon Specific Time Requirements https://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/coronavirus/resources/tollingAnalysis040220.pdf (accessed May 25, 2021).\n\n{\u00b610} In this case, the deadline for timely filing a petition for post-conviction relief was September 9, 2020, which did not fall in between March 9, 2020 and July 30, 2020. Doc. 114. Since the deadline fell after the emergency period ended on July 30, 2020, the law tolling statutory time requirements does not apply in this situation. Thus, Bender had three hundred and sixty-five days from the date on which the transcripts were filed for his direct appeal to timely file his motion for post-conviction relief. Since he did not file his petition within this timeframe, his petition was not timely filed.\n\n{\u00b611} Finally, in his petition for post-conviction relief, Bender does not establish that one of the exceptions listed in R.C. 2953.23(A) is applicable in this case. For these reasons, the trial court did not err in dismissing his petition for post-conviction relief. As such, Bender\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.\nSecond Assignment of Error\n\n\u00b612 Bender argues that the trial court erred in determining that issues raised in his petition for post-conviction relief could have been raised in his direct appeal.\n\nLegal Standard\n\n\u00b613 \u201cAlthough a defendant may challenge his conviction and sentence by either a direct appeal or a petition for postconviction relief, any claims raised in a postconviction relief petition will be barred by res judicata where the claim was or could have been raised on direct appeal.\u201d State v. Schwieterman, 3d Dist. Mercer No. 10-09-12, 2010-Ohio-102, \u00b6 23.\n\nUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.\n\nState v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 39 O.O.2d 189 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph nine of the syllabus. In other words, \u201c[a] postconviction relief proceeding is not to be utilized as an alternative to or substitute for a direct appeal.\u201d State v. Lee, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-08-1207, 2008-Ohio-6177, \u00b6 5.\n\nHowever, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a petition for postconviction relief is only barred by res judicata where the defendant was represented by new counsel on direct appeal, and where appellate counsel was in no way enjoined from asserting ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\nLegal Analysis\n\n{\u00b614} In his petition for post-conviction relief, Bender raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and a prosecutorial misconduct claim. In support of these claims, Bender points to a video-recorded interview that the State disclosed to the Defense during discovery. Doc. 116. In its brief in this appeal, the State vigorously contests the merits of the arguments that Bender bases on this recorded interview. But we need not reach the merits of these arguments since both of these claims could have been raised on direct appeal.\n\n{\u00b615} Because the arguments in his petition for post-conviction relief rest on evidence that the Defense had before trial, these arguments could have been raised at his trial and on direct appeal. Since these arguments were available to him at the time of his direct appeal, the claims raised in his petition for post-conviction relief are subject to res judicata. Further, as to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we note that Bender was represented by different attorneys during his trial and on his direct appeal. Doc. 107. See Schwieterman, supra, at \u00b6 24. Bender even raised an unsuccessful ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his prior direct appeal. Bender, supra, at \u00b6 22-25.\nIn conclusion, Bender could have raised both of the claims asserted in his petition for post-conviction relief during his direct appeal. Thus, even if his petition for post-conviction relief had been timely filed, these claims would still have been barred under the doctrine of res judicata. For these reasons, Bender\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\nThird Assignment of Error\n\nBender asserts that his petition for post-conviction relief was denied because of judicial bias.\n\nLegal Standard\n\nR.C. 2701.03(A) addresses the issue of judicial bias for a judge of the court of common pleas and reads as follows:\n\nIf a judge of the court of common pleas allegedly is interested in a proceeding pending before the court, allegedly is related to or has a bias or prejudice for or against a party to a proceeding pending before the court or a party\u2019s counsel, or allegedly otherwise is disqualified to preside in a proceeding pending before the court, any party to the proceeding or the party\u2019s counsel may file an affidavit of disqualification with the clerk of the supreme court in accordance with division (B) of this section.\n\nR.C. 2701.03(A). Thus, \u201c[t]he determination of a claim that a common pleas judge is biased or prejudiced is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio, or h[er] designee.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) State v. Holdcroft, 3d Dist. Wyandot No. 16-10-04, 2010-Ohio-6262, \u00b6 25.\nHowever, a due process issue may still exist because a \u201ccriminal trial before a biased judge is fundamentally unfair * * *.\u201d *State v.

For the following reasons, the trial\ncourt's judgment will be affirmed.\n{\u00b6 2} In April 2008, after a jury trial, Clemmons was\nconvicted of rape of a child under the age of ten. The trial court\nsentenced him to 15 years to life in prison and designated\nhim a Tier III sex offender. The judgment entry included\na notification that Clemmons \u201cwill be supervised by the\nParole Board for a period of FIVE years Post-Release Control\nafter the defendant's release from imprisonment.\u201d (Emphasis\nsic.) We affirmed Clemmons's conviction on direct appeal.\nState v. Clemmons, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22747, 2009-\nOhio-2066.\n{\u00b6 3} In 2009, Clemmons sought post-conviction relief,\nwhich was denied. Clemmons appealed that decision, but\nthe appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute the matter.\nState v. Clemmons , 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23629 (Jan.\n25, 2010) . Clemmons subsequently sought post-conviction\nDNA testing, which was denied. We affirmed that decision.\nState v. Clemmons, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24377, 2011-\nOhio-4474.\n{\u00b6 4} In December 2013, Clemmons filed motions to vacate\nhis sentence, which were not resolved by the trial court.\nOn August 18, 2017, Clemmons filed a \u201cmotion to correct\nan illegal sentence,\u201d claiming that the trial court failed to\nproperly notify him that he was subject to post-release control.\nClemmons argued that his post-release control obligation was\nincluded in the judgment entry, but he was not notified of that\nobligation at sentencing.\n{\u00b6 5} On September 19, 2017, the trial court held a sentencing\nhearing to address post-release control. At the hearing, the\ncourt informed Clemmons that the resentencing was on post-\nrelease control only and that he had already been sentenced\non the rape offense. The court allowed Clemmons to make\na statement on his own behalf, and Clemmons expressed\nthat the State used false testimony to obtain his conviction.\nClemmons stated that there were \u201cseven different versions\u201d\nof the accusation against him, and he asserted that the jurors\nwould not have convicted him had they known about the\nmultiple versions.\n{\u00b6 6} The trial court responded to Clemmons that the hearing\nwas for resentencing on post-release control only, that \u201call of\nthe arguments and statements you have made today have been\nissues that you have raised previously,\u201d that his conviction\nhad been affirmed on appeal, and that the issues raised by\nhim were barred by res judicata. The court then informed\nClemmons that, following his release from prison, he would\nbe required to serve a mandatory period of post-release\ncontrol for five years. The court also told Clemmons the\nconsequences should he violate post-release control.Millman, Jake 2/6/2023\nFor Educational Use Only\nState v. Clemmons, Not Reported in N.E. Rptr. (2018)\n2018-Ohio-2747\n \u00a9 2023 Thomson Reuters.

For the following reasons, the trial court's judgment will be affirmed.\n\nIn April 2008, after a jury trial, Clemmons was convicted of rape of a child under the age of ten. The trial court sentenced him to 15 years to life in prison and designated him a Tier III sex offender. The judgment entry included a notification that Clemmons \u201cwill be supervised by the Parole Board for a period of FIVE years Post-Release Control after the defendant's release from imprisonment.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) We affirmed Clemmons's conviction on direct appeal. State v. Clemmons, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22747, 2009-Ohio-2066.\n\nIn 2009, Clemmons sought post-conviction relief, which was denied. Clemmons appealed that decision, but the appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute the matter. State v. Clemmons, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23629 (Jan. 25, 2010). Clemmons subsequently sought post-conviction DNA testing, which was denied. We affirmed that decision. State v. Clemmons, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24377, 2011-Ohio-4474.\n\nIn December 2013, Clemmons filed motions to vacate his sentence, which were not resolved by the trial court. On August 18, 2017, Clemmons filed a \u201cmotion to correct an illegal sentence,\u201d claiming that the trial court failed to properly notify him that he was subject to post-release control. Clemmons argued that his post-release control obligation was included in the judgment entry, but he was not notified of that obligation at sentencing.\n\nOn September 19, 2017, the trial court held a sentencing hearing to address post-release control. At the hearing, the court informed Clemmons that the resentencing was on post-release control only and that he had already been sentenced on the rape offense. The court allowed Clemmons to make a statement on his own behalf, and Clemmons expressed that the State used false testimony to obtain his conviction. Clemmons stated that there were \u201cseven different versions\u201d of the accusation against him, and he asserted that the jurors would not have convicted him had they known about the multiple versions.\n\nThe trial court responded to Clemmons that the hearing was for resentencing on post-release control only, that \u201call of the arguments and statements you have made today have been issues that you have raised previously,\u201d that his conviction had been affirmed on appeal, and that the issues raised by him were barred by res judicata. The court then informed Clemmons that, following his release from prison, he would be required to serve a mandatory period of post-release control for five years. The court also told Clemmons the consequences should he violate post-release control.\nOn September 21, 2017, the trial court entered an amended judgment entry which again included Clemmons's mandatory five-year post-release control obligation.\n\nClemmons appeals from the amended judgment entry. He raises five assignments of error, namely that (1) the prosecutor engaged in misconduct at trial, (2) the indictment was insufficient to put him on fair notice of the charges against him, (3) the State failed to disclose prior inconsistent statements by his accuser, (4) the court erred in relying on \u201cperjured testimony of Detective Dix\u201d in denying Clemmons's motion to suppress, and (5) the trial court erred when it denied him the opportunity to present evidence of other possible perpetrators.\n\nIf the defendant has committed an offense subject to post-release control under R.C. 2967.28, the trial court must notify the defendant at sentencing of the post-release control requirement and the consequences if the defendant violates post-release control. R.C. 2929.19; State v. Qualls, 131 Ohio St.3d 499, 2012-Ohio-1111, 967 N.E.2d 718, \u00b6 18.

(1) The trial court erred in proceeding to trial without holding a \nhearing or obtaining an evaluation as to Newman\u2019s competency to represent \nhimself.

(4) His convictions generally were not \nsupported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the \nevidence.

Cuyahoga No. 109182. \n2 This court notes that in a bench trial, the judge dismissed 15 counts and found \nNewman not guilty on two other counts.  \n3 Newman\u2019s appellate counsel argued the following assignments of error:  (1) The \ntrial court committed error when it abused its discretion by permitting a likely \nincompetent person to be a pro se litigant and (2) Newman\u2019s convictions are against the \nmanifest weight of the evidence.  \nMarch 16, 2021, application was filed approximately 140 days after this court\u2019s \nOctober 29, 2020 decision.

See State v. Boler , 4th Dist. Athens No. 09CA24, \n2010-Ohio-3344.  In our decision, we affirmed appella nt\u2019s convictions and sentence, finding: (1) no \nprosecutorial misconduct during closing argument, (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by \nallowing certain challenged evidence, and (3) the cumulative error doctrine did not apply.  To \nsupplement the facts and procedural history from Boler I , we add some relevant milestones and \nsubsequent history.   \n{\u00b6 3} The record reflects that on February 20, 2009, an Athens County grand jury returned an ATHENS, 18CA2  \n \n3\nindictment that charged appellant with (1) one count of aggravated  robbery in violation of R.C. \n2911.01(A)(3), a first-degree felony, and (2) one count  of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B), an \nunspecified felony with the pred icate offense being a ggravated robbery.  Both counts contained \nfirearm specifications.  The stat e issued a Bill of Particulars on April 1, 2009, and amended it on \nJune 17, 2009, to add that the underlying theft offens e to the aggravated robbe ry was attempted theft \nand/or burglary or an attempted burglary of 7467 New Marshfield Road.  \n{\u00b6 4} On June 19, 2009, a jury found appellant guilty  of complicity to aggravated robbery \nand complicity to murder, both with firearm specifi cations.  On June 22, 2009, the trial court issued \nan entry to indicate that appellant was convi cted of aggravated robbery [2911.01(A)(3)] and \ncomplicity to murder [2903.02(B)], but on July 1, 2009 the court issued a nunc pro tunc judgment to \ncorrect the June 22, 2009 judgment in which \u201cthe amount of money seized from Defendant during this \ninvestigation lists the wrong amount.  Also, the prev ious entry stated that defendant was found guilty \nof Count One, Aggravated Robbery which should actually be Complicity to Aggravated Robbery. * * \n*\u201d  On September 22, 2009, the trial court issued another nunc pro tunc  entry, this time to indicate \nonce again that appellant was convicted of aggr avated robbery and complicity to murder.  On \nOctober 2, 2009, the trial court issu ed another nunc pro tunc entry to state that appellant was \nconvicted of complicity to aggravated robbery and complicity to murder.    \n{\u00b6 5} On May 5, 2010, and again on May 21, 2010, appella nt filed motions for disclosure of \ngrand jury transcripts.  On May 21, 2010, appellant also  filed his first petition for postconviction \nrelief and asked the trial court to dismiss the defective indictment \u201cdo [sic] to lack of Sufficient \nSubject Matter, and Court have [sic] no Jurisdiction to hear such indictment, since the indictment \ndoes not have the necessary ingredience [sic] to create the required elements to display the initial ATHENS, 18CA2  \n \n4\ncharge.\u201d  On May 25, 2010, the trial court dismissed appellant\u2019s motions for disclosure of grand jury \ntranscripts and his petition for postconviction relief.  A ppellant did not appeal the decision.   \n{\u00b6 6} As noted above, on July 12, 2010 this court a ffirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment of \nconviction.  See Boler, 4th Dist. Athens App. No. 09CA24, 2010-Ohio-3344.  On September 13, \n2010, appellant filed a pro se App.R. 26(B) application to reopen the appeal.  On November 1, 2010, \nappellant filed a motion for leave to file an am ended application to reopen.  On November 22, 2010, \nthis court denied appellant\u2019s application and concluded that \u201chis motion does not show that a \u2018genuine \nissue\u2019 exists as to whether he was deprived the effective assistance of appellate counsel.\u201d   \n{\u00b6 7} On August 26, 2011, appellant filed an App.R . 26(A) application for reconsideration \nand argued that the offenses should have merged, as did the convictions of a co-defendant.  On \nDecember 22, 2011, this court denied appellant\u2019s delayed application for reconsideration, finding \nappellate counsel not ineffective and finding that aggravated robbery and felony murder are not allied \noffenses of similar import under the test in effect when appellant filed his direct appeal.  \n{\u00b6 8} On January 11, 2012, appellant filed a sec ond motion to reconsider, or in the \nalternative, to certify a conflict.  On March 5, 2012, this court denied appe llant\u2019s application for \nreconsideration and denied the untimely motion to certify a conflic t.  On March 16, 2012, appellant \nagain filed a motion to reconsider this court\u2019s March 5, 2012 decision to deny appellant\u2019s January 11, \n2012 application to reconsider or to certify a conflict.  On May 1, 2012, this court denied appellant\u2019s \napplication for reconsideration.   \n{\u00b6 9} On April 9, 2013, appellant file d a request for a re-sentencing hearing.  On April 16, \n2013, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s request for resentencing, finding that the aggravated robbery \nrelated to Osbourne and that the individual murdered was Donnie Pu tnam, therefore as two victims ATHENS, 18CA2  \n \n5\nwere involved, the crimes were committed separately or with a separate animus as to each.   \n{\u00b6 10} On May 2, 2013, appellant filed a second notice of appeal (13CA19) to appeal the trial \ncourt\u2019s April 16, 2013 decision that denied his motion for resentencing.  On June 13, 2013, appellant \nfiled a corrected notice of appeal, and on June 20, 2013, this court (13CA19)  dismissed appellant\u2019s \nappeal because the trial court\u2019s Ap ril 16, 2013 entry is not a final appeal able order.  In this court\u2019s \nruling, we also held: \u201cBoler coul d have raised the issue concerning whether the trial court sentenced \nhim on allied offenses of similar import in his sentencing on his direct appeal, but failed to do so.  \nThe doctrine of res judicata bars not only the re-litigation of previous claims, but also bars a litigant \nfrom raising any issue, claim or defense that could have been previously raised but was not.  (citation \nomitted).  The allied offenses argument was available to Boler on direct appeal.  Having failed to \nraise the issue then, Boler is bared by the doctrine of res judicata from raising it at this time.\u201d     \n{\u00b6 11} On September 14, 2014, appellant filed a moti on to vacate a void judgment (09CA24) \nand raised the same issue he raises here.  On October 7, 2014, the magistrate\u2019s order denied \nappellant\u2019s motion to vacate a void judgment and stated \u201c[t]his Court finds nothing in Boler\u2019s current \nmotion that has not or could not have been raised in his direct appeal.  Th e doctrine of res judicata \nbars the consideration of errors th at could have been raised on direct  appeal, but were not.  (Citation \nomitted).  Moreover, Boler has not demonstrated that any of these errors would have rendered the \ntrial court\u2019s judgment void; therefore, they would also not render this Court\u2019s judgment void.  \nBoler\u2019s motion to vacate a void judgment is hereby DENIED.\u201d  \n{\u00b6 12} On October 15, 2014 (09CA24) , appellant filed a motion for a judgment on the \npleadings.  On October 29, 2014, the magistrate\u2019s or der denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment on \nthe pleadings as moot because no pleadings were currently before the court.  On November 25, 2014 ATHENS, 18CA2  \n \n6\n(09CA24), appellant f iled a second motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that his \nfour-year-old motion for leave to file amended application on reopening from November 1, 2010 was \nstill pending before the court.  On January 23, 2015, this court denied appellant\u2019s motion, concluding \nthat appellant\u2019s November 1, 2010 motion was untimely filed and implicitly denied by the Court, and \nthus, the motion was no longer pending. \n{\u00b6 13} On July 17, 2017, appellant filed his second petition for postconviction relief, a motion \nto vacate a void judgment \u201cdue to fraud upon the court\u201d in 09CR0091.  On August 3, 2017, appellant \nfiled a motion for judgment on the pleadings in the trial court, and on August 15, 2017, the court \ndenied appellant\u2019s motion to vacate a void judgment due to fraud upon the court, construing it as \u201can \nuntimely, as well as successive, R.C. 2953.21 petition fo r postconviction relief, and therefore denies \nthe motion for want of jurisdiction.\u201d  The trial court cited appellant\u2019s May 21, 2010 \u201cmotion to void \njudgment\u201d as appellant\u2019s first mo tion for postconviction relief.  Appe llant did not appeal the trial \ncourt\u2019s decision the motions on May 25, 2010.  The court dismissed appellant\u2019s July 17, 2017 motion \nfor want of jurisdiction and conc luded that the dismissal mooted  appellant\u2019s August 3, 2017 motion \nfor judgment on the pleadings.  Appe llant did not appeal that decision. \n{\u00b6 14} On December 22, 2017, appellant filed his third motion fo r postconviction relief and \nreasserted the claims that th e trial court denied on August 15, 2017.  On January 2, 2018, the trial \ncourt denied appellant\u2019s  motion for postconviction relief and not ed that appellant\u2019s motion is \u201can \nuntimely, as well as successive, R.C. 2953.21 petition for post-conviction relie f, and is therefore \ndenied for want of jurisdicti on.\u201d  The trial court cited appellant\u2019s May 21, 2010 \u201cmotion to void \njudgment\u201d as appellant\u2019s first motion for postc onviction relief, denied  on May 25, 2010, and cited \nappellant\u2019s July 17, 2017 \u201cmotion to vacate a voi d judgment due to fraud upon the court\u201d as ATHENS, 18CA2  \n \n7\nappellant\u2019s second petition, also de nied August 15, 2017.  The trial court correctly observed that \nappellant did not appeal either d ecision.  The trial court held that (1) this is another untimely and \nsuccessive postconviction petition, (2 ) the matter is barred by res judicata, (3) the mid-trial \namendment to the bill of particulars is appropriate, (4) the amendment did not change the name of the \noffense or the identity of the crime, and (5) appellant\u2019s conviction for complicity, the offenses for \nwhich he was indicted, is proper.  Thus, the trial court dismissed th e December 22, 2017 motion for \nwant of jurisdiction.  Further, on January 18, 2018, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s January 16, \n2018 \u201cdemand for a hearing on the merits\u201d as moot.  This appeal followed.  \n II. \n{\u00b6 15} Postconviction relief is a civ il collateral attack on a judgme nt, not an appeal of that \njudgment.  State v. Calhoun , 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999).  A petition for \npostconviction relief allows  a petitioner to present constitutional issues that would otherwise be \nunreviewable on direct appeal becau se the evidence supporting those i ssues is not contained in the \nrecord of the criminal conviction, but a postc onviction relief petition doe s not provide a second \nopportunity to litigate the conviction.  State v. Jones, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 16AP-803, 2017-Ohio \n5529, \u00b6 6. \n{\u00b6 16} Postconviction relief is governed by R.C. 2953.21 which provides: \n(A)(1)(a) Any person who has been convicted of a criminal offens e or adjudicated a \ndelinquent child and who claims that there was such a denial or infringement of the \nperson\u2019s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution \nor the Constitution of the United States * * * may file a petition in the court that \nimposed sentence, stating the grounds for relief relied upon, and as king the court to \nvacate or set aside the judgment or sentence or to grant other appropriate relief.  The \npetitioner may file a supporting affidavit and other documentary evidence in support of \nthe claim for relief. \n ATHENS, 18CA2  \n \n8\n\u201c[A] trial court\u2019s decision granting or denyin g a postconviction petition f iled pursuant to R.C. \n2953.21 should be upheld absent an abuse of discre tion; a reviewing court should not overrule the \ntrial court\u2019s finding on a petition for posconviction relief that is suppor ted by competent and credible \nevidence.\u201d  State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 58.  Also, see \nCalhoun at 284 (postconviction relief \u201csta tute clearly calls for discreti on in determining whether to \ngrant a hearing\u201d).   \n{\u00b6 17} For purposes of clarity, we first address a ppellant\u2019s third assign ment of error.  \nAppellant asserts that his motion for postconviction relief should not be barred by res judicata \u201cwhere \nhe raised issues of jurisdictional defects that rendered the judgment of conviction void ab initio,\u201d and \ncontends a denial of \u201chis rights.\u201d \n{\u00b6 18} We first point out that the version of R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) in effect prior to March 2015, \nthe time window for appellant\u2019s petition, limited the filing of a petition to  no later than 180 days after \nthe filing of the transcript.  Appellant was ordered to file his transcript in his direct appeal on or \nbefore October 12, 2009, but a notification on the clerk of courts\u2019 record indicates that a \u201cNotice of \nSupplemental Transmission of Reco rd\u201d filed on October 13, 2009.  Thus , appellant file d his latest \npetition for postconviction relief mo re than eight years after th e notation of the supplemental \ntransmission of record was filed.  \u201c[A] court may not entertain a petition filed after the expiration of \nthe period prescribed in division (A) of that section or a second petition or  successive petitions for \nsimilar relief on behalf of a petitioner unless division (A)(1) or (2) of this section applies[.]\u201d \n(Emphasis added.)  R.C. 2953.23(A).  Here, neither secti on applies.  Appellant  does not (1) claim \nthat he was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which he must rely to present the \nclaim for relief [R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a)], (2) claim th at subsequent to the deadline or his earlier ATHENS, 18CA2  \n \n9\npetition that the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies \nretroactively [R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a)], (3) argue that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable \nfactfinder would have found him guilty of the offense of which he was convicted, [R.C. \n2953.23(A)(1)(b)], and (4) claim that he has submitted DNA evidence to show his \u201cactual innocence\u201d \n[R.C. 2953.23(A)(2)].  Thus, appellant untimely filed his petition for postconviction relief.  \n{\u00b6 19} In addition to being untimely, a trial court may also dismiss a petition when the claims \nare barred by the doctrine of res judicata.  See State v. Szefcyk , 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 671 N.E.2d 233 \n(1996), syllabus.  Res judicata is applicable  in all postconviction relief proceedings.  Szefcyk at 95.  \n\u201cUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgme nt of conviction bars a convicted defendant who \nwas represented by counsel from ra ising and litigating in any proceeding, except an appeal from that \njudgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by \nthe defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment of convi ction, or on an appeal from that \njudgment.\u201d  Id. at syllabus.  Thus, to avoid application of res judicata, a petitioner must assert a \nclaim that was not raised, or could not have been raised, at the time of trial or on direct appeal, and \nsupport such claim with competent, relevant, and material evidence out side the record.  Further, the \nSupreme Court of Ohio held that a trial court properly denies a R.C. 2953.21 petition for \npostconviction relief and issues proper findings of fact and conclusions of law when such findings are \ncomprehensive and pertinent to the issues presented, the findings demonstrate the basis for the trial \ncourt\u2019s decision, and the evidence supports the findings.  Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d at 292.   \n{\u00b6 20} In the case sub judice, the issues appellant  raised in his untimely, successive petition \nfor postconviction relief could have been raised in his direct app eal, but were not.  \u201cThe doctrine of \nres judicata bars not only the re-litigation of previous claims, but also bars a litigant from raising any ATHENS, 18CA2  \n \n10\nissue, claim or defense that could have been previously raised but was not.  See State v. Chafin, 10th \nDist. No. 06AP-1108, 2007-Ohio- 1840, at paragraph 11.\u201d  State v. Boler, 4th Dist. Athens App. No. \n13CA19, Decision and Judgment, June 20, 2013, p. 2.  Conversely, the state is correct that the \ndoctrine of res judicata bars the consideration of this matter because appellant has raised the issues on \nfive previous occasions.  Moreover, this court has denied appellant\u2019s request multiple times to \nconsider arguments regarding the amendment of the indictment and complicity.  As we wrote in \nBoler, 4th Dist. Athens No. 09CA24, 2010-Ohio-3344:  \nThis Court finds nothing in Boler\u2019s current motion that has not or could not have been \nraised in his direct appeal.  The doctrine of res judicata bars the consideration of errors \nthat could have been raise don direct appeal, but were not.   State v. Beach , 4th Dist. \nGallia App. No. 11CA4, 2012-Ohio-1630.  Moreover, Boler has not demonstrated that \nany of these errors would have rendered the trial court\u2019s judgment void; therefore, they \nwould also not render this Court\u2019s judgment void.  Boler\u2019s motion to vacate a void \njudgment is hereby DENIED.  Id. at p. 2.   \n \nThe issues appellant raises in the case sub judice are the same issues raised in his September 14, 2014 \nmotion.  These matters are barred and the trial court properly dismissed th e postconviction relief \npetition.  Generally, the valid ity and sufficiency of an indictment must be raised on direct appeal.  \nPayne v. Jeffreys, 109 Ohio St.3d 239, 2006-Ohio-2288, 846 N.E.2d 1248, \u00b6 5.  Even if a trial court\u2019s \namendment of an indictment is improper, at most the judgment  may have been voidable and a \ndefendant would be required to raise this issue on direct appeal.   \n{\u00b6 21} Consequently, we overrule appellant\u2019s third assignment of error. \n III. \n{\u00b6 22} In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the mid-trial amendment to the \nbill of particulars included a ne w theory of conduct and changed the name and identity of R.C. \n2911.01(A)(3), aggravated robbery and R.C. 2903.02(B)  murder as charged in the indictment.  ATHENS, 18CA2  \n \n11\nAppellant cites State v. Vitale , 96 Ohio App.3d 695, 645 N.E.2d 1277 (8th Dist.1994) and State v. \nWilkinson, 178 Ohio App.3d 99, 2008-Ohio-4400, 896 N.E.2d 1027, for the proposition that a \ncriminal defendant has an inalienable right to be tried on the same essential facts (conduct) on which \nthe grand jury found probable cause (to return the i ndictment) and is constituti onally guaranteed that \nthe essential facts (conduc t) constituting the offense for which he is tried will be found in the \nindictment of the grand jury.      \n{\u00b6 23} The state responds that assuming, arguendo, appellant could appeal  the trial court\u2019s \ndecision, the amendment to the Bill of Particulars is appropriate and did not  change the name or \nsection under which appellant was indicted.  Crim.R. 7(E) addresses a Bill of Particulars, and states: \n\u201cWhen the defendant makes a written request * * * the prosecuting attorney shall furnish the \ndefendant with a bill of particulars setting up specifically the nature of the offense charge[d] and of \nthe conduct of the defendant alleged to constitute the offens e.  A bill of particulars may be amended \nat any time subject to such conditions as justice requires.   (Emphasis added).  Further, Crim.R. 7(D) \nprovides: \u201cThe court may at any time before, during, or after  a trial amend the indictment, \ninformation, complaint or bill of particulars * * * provided no change is  made in the name or identity \nof the crime charged.\u201d  (Emphasis added.) \n{\u00b6 24} The state notes that the Bill of Particulars (1) was amended in a timely manner, and (2) \nonly specified the predicate offense(s) for aggravat ed burglary, so made no change to the name or \nidentity of the crime.  The theft offense predi cate-offense element of aggravated robbery was \nspecified to name \u201cattempted theft, burglary or attempted burglary.\u201d  The burglary element was an \nelement of the aggravated robbery charge, not an independent count.  Moreover, the factual \nallegations in the original and amended Bills of Particulars did not change.  Thus, neither the name or ATHENS, 18CA2  \n \n12\nidentity of either crime charged was changed.   \n{\u00b6 25} Therefore, appellant\u2019s first proposed assignment of error has no merit. \n IV. \n{\u00b6 26} In appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, he argues: \u201cCoul d it be said that Appellant \nwas convicted of complicity to the very offenses for which he was indicted  where the trial court \npermitted a mid-trial amendment, to the bill of pa rticulars, that included a new theory of conduct \nfound subsequently to the filing of the indictment, contrary to  R.C. 2941.03(E)?\u201d  Seemingly, \nappellant argues that he was i ndicted for murder (in violation of R.C. 2903.02) but convicted of \ncomplicity to murder (in violation of R.C. 2923.03), a nd that he was indicted for aggravated robbery \n(in violation of R.C. 2911.01) but convicted of complic ity to aggravated robbery (in violation of R.C. \n2923.03).  However, \u201c[a] charge of complicity may be stated in terms of [R.C. 2923.03, the \ncomplicity statute], or in terms of the princi pal offense.\u201d  R.C. 2923.03(F).  Thus, \u201cR.C. 2923.03(F) \nadequately notifies defendants that the jury may be instructed on complicity, even when the charge is \ndrawn in terms of the principal offense.  See State v. Keenan  (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 133, 151, 689 \nN.E.2d 929, 946, citing Hill v. Perini  (C.A.6, 1986), 788 F.2d 406, 407-408.\u201d  State v. Herring , 94 \nOhio St.3d 246, 251, 2002-Ohio-796, 762 N.E.2d 940.  Because appellant was indicted for \naggravated robbery and murder, and convicted of co mplicity to aggravated robbery and complicity to \nmurder, which is permissible, a ppellant\u2019s argument fails and we overrule his second assignment of \nerror.   \n{\u00b6 27} For all of the reasons above, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment to dismiss appellant\u2019s \nuntimely, successive petition for postconviction relief.  \nJUDGMENT AFFIRMED.  ATHENS, 18CA2  \n \n13\n \n \nJUDGMENT ENTRY \nIt is ordered that the judgment be affirmed and that appellee recover of appellant the costs \nherein taxed.    \n \nThe Court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal. \n \nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this Court directing the Athens County \nCommon Pleas Court to carry this judgment into execution. \n \nIf a stay of execution of sentence and release upon bail has been previously granted by the trial \ncourt or this court, it is temporarily continued for a period not to exceed sixty days upon the bail \npreviously posted.  The purpose of a continued stay is to allow appellant to file with the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio an application for a stay during the pendency of proceedings in that court.  If a stay is \ncontinued by this entry, it will terminate at the earlier of the expiration of the sixty-day period, or the \nfailure of the appellant to file a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio.  Additionally, if the \nSupreme Court of Ohio dismisses the appeal prior to expiration of sixty days, the stay will terminate \nas of the date of such dismissal. \n \nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute that mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of \nAppellate Procedure. \n \nHarsha, J. & McFarland, J.: Concur in Judgment & Opinion \n \nFor the Court \n \n \n \n \n \nB Y :                                               \n                            P e t e r  B .

See State v. Boler, 4th Dist. Athens No. 09CA24, 2010-Ohio-3344. In our decision, we affirmed appellant\u2019s convictions and sentence, finding: (1) no prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument, (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing certain challenged evidence, and (3) the cumulative error doctrine did not apply. To supplement the facts and procedural history from Boler I, we add some relevant milestones and subsequent history.\n\n\u00b6 3 The record reflects that on February 20, 2009, an Athens County grand jury returned an\nindictment that charged appellant with (1) one count of aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(3), a first-degree felony, and (2) one count of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B), an unspecified felony with the predicate offense being aggravated robbery. Both counts contained firearm specifications. The state issued a Bill of Particulars on April 1, 2009, and amended it on June 17, 2009, to add that the underlying theft offense to the aggravated robbery was attempted theft and/or burglary or an attempted burglary of 7467 New Marshfield Road.\n\n\u00b6 4 On June 19, 2009, a jury found appellant guilty of complicity to aggravated robbery and complicity to murder, both with firearm specifications. On June 22, 2009, the trial court issued an entry to indicate that appellant was convicted of aggravated robbery [2911.01(A)(3)] and complicity to murder [2903.02(B)], but on July 1, 2009 the court issued a nunc pro tunc judgment to correct the June 22, 2009 judgment in which \u201cthe amount of money seized from Defendant during this investigation lists the wrong amount. Also, the previous entry stated that defendant was found guilty of Count One, Aggravated Robbery which should actually be Complicity to Aggravated Robbery. * * *\u201d On September 22, 2009, the trial court issued another nunc pro tunc entry, this time to indicate once again that appellant was convicted of aggravated robbery and complicity to murder. On October 2, 2009, the trial court issued another nunc pro tunc entry to state that appellant was convicted of complicity to aggravated robbery and complicity to murder.\n\n\u00b6 5 On May 5, 2010, and again on May 21, 2010, appellant filed motions for disclosure of grand jury transcripts. On May 21, 2010, appellant also filed his first petition for postconviction relief and asked the trial court to dismiss the defective indictment \u201cdo [sic] to lack of Sufficient Subject Matter, and Court have [sic] no Jurisdiction to hear such indictment, since the indictment does not have the necessary ingredience [sic] to create the required elements to display the initial\ncharge.\u201d On May 25, 2010, the trial court dismissed appellant\u2019s motions for disclosure of grand jury transcripts and his petition for postconviction relief. Appellant did not appeal the decision.\n\n\u00b6 6 As noted above, on July 12, 2010 this court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction. See Boler, 4th Dist. Athens App. No. 09CA24, 2010-Ohio-3344. On September 13, 2010, appellant filed a pro se App.R. 26(B) application to reopen the appeal. On November 1, 2010, appellant filed a motion for leave to file an amended application to reopen. On November 22, 2010, this court denied appellant\u2019s application and concluded that \u201chis motion does not show that a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 exists as to whether he was deprived the effective assistance of appellate counsel.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 7 On August 26, 2011, appellant filed an App.R. 26(A) application for reconsideration and argued that the offenses should have merged, as did the convictions of a co-defendant. On December 22, 2011, this court denied appellant\u2019s delayed application for reconsideration, finding appellate counsel not ineffective and finding that aggravated robbery and felony murder are not allied offenses of similar import under the test in effect when appellant filed his direct appeal.\n\n\u00b6 8 On January 11, 2012, appellant filed a second motion to reconsider, or in the alternative, to certify a conflict. On March 5, 2012, this court denied appellant\u2019s application for reconsideration and denied the untimely motion to certify a conflict. On March 16, 2012, appellant again filed a motion to reconsider this court\u2019s March 5, 2012 decision to deny appellant\u2019s January 11, 2012 application to reconsider or to certify a conflict. On May 1, 2012, this court denied appellant\u2019s application for reconsideration.\n\n\u00b6 9 On April 9, 2013, appellant filed a request for a re-sentencing hearing. On April 16, 2013, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s request for resentencing, finding that the aggravated robbery related to Osbourne and that the individual murdered was Donnie Putnam, therefore as two victims\nwere involved, the crimes were committed separately or with a separate animus as to each.\n\n\u00b6 10 On May 2, 2013, appellant filed a second notice of appeal (13CA19) to appeal the trial court\u2019s April 16, 2013 decision that denied his motion for resentencing. On June 13, 2013, appellant filed a corrected notice of appeal, and on June 20, 2013, this court (13CA19) dismissed appellant\u2019s appeal because the trial court\u2019s April 16, 2013 entry is not a final appealable order. In this court\u2019s ruling, we also held: \u201cBoler could have raised the issue concerning whether the trial court sentenced him on allied offenses of similar import in his sentencing on his direct appeal, but failed to do so. The doctrine of res judicata bars not only the re-litigation of previous claims, but also bars a litigant from raising any issue, claim or defense that could have been previously raised but was not. (citation omitted). The allied offenses argument was available to Boler on direct appeal. Having failed to raise the issue then, Boler is bared by the doctrine of res judicata from raising it at this time.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 11 On September 14, 2014, appellant filed a motion to vacate a void judgment (09CA24) and raised the same issue he raises here. On October 7, 2014, the magistrate\u2019s order denied appellant\u2019s motion to vacate a void judgment and stated \u201c[t]his Court finds nothing in Boler\u2019s current motion that has not or could not have been raised in his direct appeal. The doctrine of res judicata bars the consideration of errors that could have been raised on direct appeal, but were not. (Citation omitted). Moreover, Boler has not demonstrated that any of these errors would have rendered the trial court\u2019s judgment void; therefore, they would also not render this Court\u2019s judgment void. Boler\u2019s motion to vacate a void judgment is hereby DENIED.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 12 On October 15, 2014 (09CA24), appellant filed a motion for a judgment on the pleadings. On October 29, 2014, the magistrate\u2019s order denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings as moot because no pleadings were currently before the court. On November 25, 2014\n(09CA24), appellant filed a second motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that his four-year-old motion for leave to file amended application on reopening from November 1, 2010 was still pending before the court. On January 23, 2015, this court denied appellant\u2019s motion, concluding that appellant\u2019s November 1, 2010 motion was untimely filed and implicitly denied by the Court, and thus, the motion was no longer pending.\n\n\u00b6 13 On July 17, 2017, appellant filed his second petition for postconviction relief, a motion to vacate a void judgment \u201cdue to fraud upon the court\u201d in 09CR0091. On August 3, 2017, appellant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in the trial court, and on August 15, 2017, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion to vacate a void judgment due to fraud upon the court, construing it as \u201can untimely, as well as successive, R.C. 2953.21 petition for postconviction relief, and therefore denies the motion for want of jurisdiction.\u201d The trial court cited appellant\u2019s May 21, 2010 \u201cmotion to void judgment\u201d as appellant\u2019s first motion for postconviction relief. Appellant did not appeal the trial court\u2019s decision the motions on May 25, 2010. The court dismissed appellant\u2019s July 17, 2017 motion for want of jurisdiction and concluded that the dismissal mooted appellant\u2019s August 3, 2017 motion for judgment on the pleadings. Appellant did not appeal that decision.\n\n\u00b6 14 On December 22, 2017, appellant filed his third motion for postconviction relief and reasserted the claims that the trial court denied on August 15, 2017. On January 2, 2018, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for postconviction relief and noted that appellant\u2019s motion is \u201can untimely, as well as successive, R.C. 2953.21 petition for post-conviction relief, and is therefore denied for want of jurisdiction.\u201d The trial court cited appellant\u2019s May 21, 2010 \u201cmotion to void judgment\u201d as appellant\u2019s first motion for postconviction relief, denied on May 25, 2010, and cited appellant\u2019s July 17, 2017 \u201cmotion to vacate a void judgment due to fraud upon the court\u201d as\nappellant\u2019s second petition, also denied August 15, 2017. The trial court correctly observed that appellant did not appeal either decision. The trial court held that (1) this is another untimely and successive postconviction petition, (2) the matter is barred by res judicata, (3) the mid-trial amendment to the bill of particulars is appropriate, (4) the amendment did not change the name of the offense or the identity of the crime, and (5) appellant\u2019s conviction for complicity, the offenses for which he was indicted, is proper. Thus, the trial court dismissed the December 22, 2017 motion for want of jurisdiction. Further, on January 18, 2018, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s January 16, 2018 \u201cdemand for a hearing on the merits\u201d as moot. This appeal followed.\n\nII.\n\n\u00b6 15 Postconviction relief is a civil collateral attack on a judgment, not an appeal of that judgment. State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999). A petition for postconviction relief allows a petitioner to present constitutional issues that would otherwise be unreviewable on direct appeal because the evidence supporting those issues is not contained in the record of the criminal conviction, but a postconviction relief petition does not provide a second opportunity to litigate the conviction. State v. Jones, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 16AP-803, 2017-Ohio 5529, \u00b6 6.\n\n\u00b6 16 Postconviction relief is governed by R.C. 2953.21 which provides:\n\n(A)(1)(a) Any person who has been convicted of a criminal offense or adjudicated a delinquent child and who claims that there was such a denial or infringement of the person\u2019s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States * * * may file a petition in the court that imposed sentence, stating the grounds for relief relied upon, and asking the court to vacate or set aside the judgment or sentence or to grant other appropriate relief. The petitioner may file a supporting affidavit and other documentary evidence in support of the claim for relief.\n\u201c[A] trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a postconviction petition filed pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 should be upheld absent an abuse of discretion; a reviewing court should not overrule the trial court\u2019s finding on a petition for postconviction relief that is supported by competent and credible evidence.\u201d State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 58. Also, see Calhoun at 284 (postconviction relief \u201cstatute clearly calls for discretion in determining whether to grant a hearing\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 17 For purposes of clarity, we first address appellant\u2019s third assignment of error. Appellant asserts that his motion for postconviction relief should not be barred by res judicata \u201cwhere he raised issues of jurisdictional defects that rendered the judgment of conviction void ab initio,\u201d and contends a denial of \u201chis rights.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 18 We first point out that the version of R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) in effect prior to March 2015, the time window for appellant\u2019s petition, limited the filing of a petition to no later than 180 days after the filing of the transcript. Appellant was ordered to file his transcript in his direct appeal on or before October 12, 2009, but a notification on the clerk of courts\u2019 record indicates that a \u201cNotice of Supplemental Transmission of Record\u201d filed on October 13, 2009. Thus, appellant filed his latest petition for postconviction relief more than eight years after the notation of the supplemental transmission of record was filed. \u201c[A] court may not entertain a petition filed after the expiration of the period prescribed in division (A) of that section or a second petition or successive petitions for similar relief on behalf of a petitioner unless division (A)(1) or (2) of this section applies[.]\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2953.23(A). Here, neither section applies. Appellant does not (1) claim that he was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which he must rely to present the claim for relief [R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a)], (2) claim that subsequent to the deadline or his earlier\npetition that the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively [R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a)], (3) argue that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty of the offense of which he was convicted, [R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b)], and (4) claim that he has submitted DNA evidence to show his \u201cactual innocence\u201d [R.C. 2953.23(A)(2)]. Thus, appellant untimely filed his petition for postconviction relief.\n\n\u00b6 19 In addition to being untimely, a trial court may also dismiss a petition when the claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata. See State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 671 N.E.2d 233 (1996), syllabus. Res judicata is applicable in all postconviction relief proceedings. Szefcyk at 95. \u201cUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding, except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.\u201d Id. at syllabus. Thus, to avoid application of res judicata, a petitioner must assert a claim that was not raised, or could not have been raised, at the time of trial or on direct appeal, and support such claim with competent, relevant, and material evidence outside the record. Further, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that a trial court properly denies a R.C. 2953.21 petition for postconviction relief and issues proper findings of fact and conclusions of law when such findings are comprehensive and pertinent to the issues presented, the findings demonstrate the basis for the trial court\u2019s decision, and the evidence supports the findings. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d at 292.\n\n\u00b6 20 In the case sub judice, the issues appellant raised in his untimely, successive petition for postconviction relief could have been raised in his direct appeal, but were not. \u201cThe doctrine of res judicata bars not only the re-litigation of previous claims, but also bars a litigant from raising any\nissue, claim or defense that could have been previously raised but was not. See State v. Chafin, 10th Dist. No. 06AP-1108, 2007-Ohio-1840, at paragraph 11.\u201d State v. Boler, 4th Dist. Athens App. No. 13CA19, Decision and Judgment, June 20, 2013, p. 2. Conversely, the state is correct that the doctrine of res judicata bars the consideration of this matter because appellant has raised the issues on five previous occasions. Moreover, this court has denied appellant\u2019s request multiple times to consider arguments regarding the amendment of the indictment and complicity. As we wrote in Boler, 4th Dist. Athens No. 09CA24, 2010-Ohio-3344:\n\nThis Court finds nothing in Boler\u2019s current motion that has not or could not have been raised in his direct appeal. The doctrine of res judicata bars the consideration of errors that could have been raised on direct appeal, but were not. State v. Beach, 4th Dist. Gallia App. No. 11CA4, 2012-Ohio-1630. Moreover, Boler has not demonstrated that any of these errors would have rendered the trial court\u2019s judgment void; therefore, they would also not render this Court\u2019s judgment void. Boler\u2019s motion to vacate a void judgment is hereby DENIED. Id. at p. 2.\n\nThe issues appellant raises in the case sub judice are the same issues raised in his September 14, 2014 motion. These matters are barred and the trial court properly dismissed the postconviction relief petition. Generally, the validity and sufficiency of an indictment must be raised on direct appeal. Payne v. Jeffreys, 109 Ohio St.3d 239, 2006-Ohio-2288, 846 N.E.2d 1248, \u00b65. Even if a trial court\u2019s amendment of an indictment is improper, at most the judgment may have been voidable and a defendant would be required to raise this issue on direct appeal.\n\n{\u00b6 21} Consequently, we overrule appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.\n\nIII.\n\n{\u00b6 22} In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the mid-trial amendment to the bill of particulars included a new theory of conduct and changed the name and identity of R.C. 2911.01(A)(3), aggravated robbery and R.C. 2903.02(B) murder as charged in the indictment.\nAppellant cites State v. Vitale, 96 Ohio App.3d 695, 645 N.E.2d 1277 (8th Dist.1994) and State v. Wilkinson, 178 Ohio App.3d 99, 2008-Ohio-4400, 896 N.E.2d 1027, for the proposition that a criminal defendant has an inalienable right to be tried on the same essential facts (conduct) on which the grand jury found probable cause (to return the indictment) and is constitutionally guaranteed that the essential facts (conduct) constituting the offense for which he is tried will be found in the indictment of the grand jury.\n\n\u00b6 23 The state responds that assuming, arguendo, appellant could appeal the trial court\u2019s decision, the amendment to the Bill of Particulars is appropriate and did not change the name or section under which appellant was indicted. Crim.R. 7(E) addresses a Bill of Particulars, and states: \u201cWhen the defendant makes a written request * * * the prosecuting attorney shall furnish the defendant with a bill of particulars setting up specifically the nature of the offense charge[d] and of the conduct of the defendant alleged to constitute the offense. A bill of particulars may be amended at any time subject to such conditions as justice requires. (Emphasis added). Further, Crim.R. 7(D) provides: \u201cThe court may at any time before, during, or after a trial amend the indictment, information, complaint or bill of particulars * * * provided no change is made in the name or identity of the crime charged.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n\n\u00b6 24 The state notes that the Bill of Particulars (1) was amended in a timely manner, and (2) only specified the predicate offense(s) for aggravated burglary, so made no change to the name or identity of the crime. The theft offense predicate-offense element of aggravated robbery was specified to name \u201cattempted theft, burglary or attempted burglary.\u201d The burglary element was an element of the aggravated robbery charge, not an independent count. Moreover, the factual allegations in the original and amended Bills of Particulars did not change. Thus, neither the name or\nidentity of either crime charged was changed.\n\n{\u00b6 25} Therefore, appellant\u2019s first proposed assignment of error has no merit.\n\nIV.\n\n{\u00b6 26} In appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, he argues: \u201cCould it be said that Appellant was convicted of complicity to the very offenses for which he was indicted where the trial court permitted a mid-trial amendment, to the bill of particulars, that included a new theory of conduct found subsequently to the filing of the indictment, contrary to R.C. 2941.03(E)?\u201d Seemingly, appellant argues that he was indicted for murder (in violation of R.C. 2903.02) but convicted of complicity to murder (in violation of R.C. 2923.03), and that he was indicted for aggravated robbery (in violation of R.C. 2911.01) but convicted of complicity to aggravated robbery (in violation of R.C. 2923.03). However, \u201c[a] charge of complicity may be stated in terms of [R.C. 2923.03, the complicity statute], or in terms of the principal offense.\u201d R.C. 2923.03(F). Thus, \u201cR.C. 2923.03(F) adequately notifies defendants that the jury may be instructed on complicity, even when the charge is drawn in terms of the principal offense. See State v. Keenan (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 133, 151, 689 N.E.2d 929, 946, citing Hill v. Perini (C.A.6, 1986), 788 F.2d 406, 407-408.\u201d State v. Herring, 94 Ohio St.3d 246, 251, 2002-Ohio-796, 762 N.E.2d 940. Because appellant was indicted for aggravated robbery and murder, and convicted of complicity to aggravated robbery and complicity to murder, which is permissible, appellant\u2019s argument fails and we overrule his second assignment of error.\n\n{\u00b6 27} For all of the reasons above, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment to dismiss appellant\u2019s untimely, successive petition for postconviction relief.\n\nJUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\nJUDGMENT ENTRY\n\nIt is ordered that the judgment be affirmed and that appellee recover of appellant the costs herein taxed.\n\nThe Court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this Court directing the Athens County Common Pleas Court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\nIf a stay of execution of sentence and release upon bail has been previously granted by the trial court or this court, it is temporarily continued for a period not to exceed sixty days upon the bail previously posted. The purpose of a continued stay is to allow appellant to file with the Supreme Court of Ohio an application for a stay during the pendency of proceedings in that court. If a stay is continued by this entry, it will terminate at the earlier of the expiration of the sixty-day period, or the failure of the appellant to file a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio. Additionally, if the Supreme Court of Ohio dismisses the appeal prior to expiration of sixty days, the stay will terminate as of the date of such dismissal.\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute that mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\nHarsha, J. & McFarland, J.: Concur in Judgment & Opinion\n\nFor the Court\n\nBY: ______________________\nPeter B. Abele, Judge\nNOTICE TO COUNSEL\n\nPursuant to Local Rule No. 14, this document constitutes a final judgment entry and the time period for further appeal commences from the date of filing with the clerk."}

DOWELL, #A733-547, P.O. Box 69, London, Ohio 43140 \n Defendant-Appellant, Pro Se \n \n. . . . . . . . . . . . . \n  \n \nDONOVAN, J. \n  \n-2- \n{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant Anthony C. Dowell appeals a judgment of the  M i a m i  \nCourt of Common Pleas overruling his petition to vacate or set aside judgment of \nconviction and his amended petition to vacate or set aside judg ment of conviction.  \nDowell filed a timely notice of appeal with this Court on July 29, 2019. \n{\u00b6 2} We set forth the history of the case in State v. Dowell , 2d Dist. Miami No. \n2017-CA-5, 2018-Ohio-4044, Dowell\u2019s direct appeal from his conviction, and we repeat it \nherein in pertinent part: \nDefendant-appellant Anthony Dowell appeals from his convictions on \ntwo counts of sexual battery. Dowell contends that the convictions were not \nsupported by the weight of the evidence and that the State did not present \nevidence sufficient to sustain the convictions. He further cont ends that \ncounsel was ineffective. Dowell also claims that his convictions violated his \nfundamental liberty interests and were, thus, unconstitutional.  Finally, he \nclaims that the trial court erred in sentencing. \n We conclude that there was sufficient, credible evidence upon which \na reasonable finder of fact could have relied in finding Dowell  guilty of the \ncharged offenses. We further find no merit to his claim that his constitutional \nrights were violated or that the trial court erred in sentencin g. Finally, we \ncannot conclude that counsel's failure to object to evidence re sulted in \nprejudice. \nId. at \u00b6 1-2.  We affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment on direct a ppeal. \n{\u00b6 3} On May 16, 2018, Dowell filed a petition to vacate or set aside his judgment \nof conviction, in which he asserted several claims regarding th e alleged ineffective  \n-3- \nassistance of his trial counsel; specifically, he alleged that his counsel failed to perform \nthe following actions: 1) failed to interview the victim prior to trial; 2) failed to interview and \nprepare to cross-examine State\u2019s witness Amy Behm; 3) failed to interview or call Amber \nBehm as a defense witness; 4) failed to interview or call Desti ny Powell as a defense \nwitness; 5) failed to interview or call Samantha Dowell as a de fense witness; 6) failed to \nconduct a proper pretrial investigation and failed to file a motion to dismiss the indictment; \nand 7) failed to conduct a thorough pretrial interview of Dowel l and ignored his demand \nto testify on his own behalf. \n{\u00b6 4} On June 7, 2019, Dowell filed an amended petition in which he s et forth \nadditional claims for post-conviction relief: 1) witness misconduct (regarding Amy Behm\u2019s \ntestimony); 2) witness misconduct (Detective Thomas\u2019s allegedly false testimony); and 3) \nprosecutorial misconduct.  On July 8, 2019, the trial court iss ued an order denying \nDowell\u2019s original petition and his amended petition to vacate or set aside his judgment of \nconviction without a hearing. \n{\u00b6 5} It is from this judgment that Dowell now appeals. \n{\u00b6 6} Because they are interrelated, Dowell\u2019s three assignments of er ror will be \ndiscussed together as follows: \n THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN MAKING FINDINGS OF FACT AND \nCONCLUSIONS OF LAW WHICH ARE IN CONFLICT WITH THE ACTUAL \nTRIAL RECORDS AND CONTRARY TO THE POST-CONVICTION \nRECORDS, WHEREBY, DENYING THE APPELLANT OF [sic] DUE \nPROCESS OF LAW. \n THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ABUSING ITS DISCRETION IN  \n-4- \nFAILING TO CONDUCT AN EVID ENTIARY HEARING ON THE \nAPPELLANT\u2019S PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF, WHERE \nTHE APPELLANT REQUESTED FOR SUCH A HEARING WITH \nSUFFICIENT EVIDENTIARY DOCUMENTATION WHICH WOULD HAVE \nREQUIRED SUCH A HEARING BY LAW. \n THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DECIDING THE MERITS OF THE \nAPPELLANT\u2019S CLAIMS WITHOUT FIRST CONDUCTING AN \nEVIDENTIARY HEARING, WHEREBY DEPRIVING THE APPELLANT \n[OF] THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP AND INDUCE FURTHER \nEVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF HIS CLAIMS. \n{\u00b6 7} In his first assignment, Dowell contends that he received ineff ective \nassistance because his trial counsel failed to do the following : 1) failed to interview the \nvictim prior to trial; 2) failed to interview and prepare to cr oss-examine State\u2019s witness, \nAmy Behm; 3) failed to interview or call Amber Behm as a defens e witness; 4) failed to \ninterview or call Destiny Powell as a defense witness; 5) faile d to interview or call \nSamantha Dowell as a defense witness; 6) failed to conduct a proper pretrial investigation \nand failed to file a motion to dismiss the indictment; and 7) f ailed to conduct a thorough \npretrial interview of Dowell and ignored his demand to testify on his own behalf.  In his \nsecond and third assignments, Dowell argues that the trial cour t abused its discretion \nwhen it denied his original petition and amended petition to va cate or set aside his \njudgment of conviction without first holding a hearing wherein he could have adduced \nadditional evidence regarding the following: 1) witness miscond uct (Amy Behm\u2019s \ntestimony); 2) witness misconduct (Detective Thomas\u2019s false tes timony); and 3)  \n-5- \nprosecutorial misconduct. \n{\u00b6 8} R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) provides that \u201c[a]ny person who has been convicted of \na criminal offense * * * may file a petition in the court that imposed sentence, stating the \ngrounds for relief relied upon, and asking the court to vacate or set aside the judgment or \nsentence or to grant other appropriate relief.\u201d  The statute fu rther provides that the \n\u201cpetitioner may file a supporting affidavit and other documenta ry evidence in support of \nthe claim for relief.\u201d  We review trial court decisions on peti tions for post-conviction relief \nunder an abuse of discretion standard.

State v. Howard, \n2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26060, 2014-Ohio-4602, \u00b6 8. \n{\u00b6 9} R.C. 2953.21(C) provides: \nThe court shall consider a petition that is timely filed under division (A)(2) of \nthis section even if a direct appeal of the judgment is pending .  Before \ngranting a hearing on a petition filed under division (A) of th is section, the \ncourt shall determine whether there are substantive grounds for  relief.  In \nmaking such a determination, the court shall consider, in addit ion to the \npetition, the supporting affidavits, and the documentary eviden ce, all the \nfiles and records pertaining to the proceedings against the pet itioner, \nincluding, but not limited to, the indictment, the court's jour nal entries, the \njournalized records of the clerk of the court, and the court re porter's \ntranscript. * * *  If the court dismisses the petition, it shal l make and file \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to such dismissal.  \n-6- \n{\u00b6 10} \u201cA post-conviction proceeding is not an appeal of a criminal conviction, but, \nrather, a collateral civil attack on the judgment.\u201d State v. Stefen, 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410, \n639 N.E.2d 67 (1994); see also State v. Gondor , 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, \n860 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 48.  To prevail on a petition for post-convict ion relief, the defendant \nmust establish a violation of his constitutional rights which r enders the judgment of \nconviction void or voidable. R.C. 2953.21. \n{\u00b6 11} The post-conviction relief statutes do \u201cnot expressly mandate a hearing for \nevery post-conviction relief petition and, therefore, a hearing  is not automatically \nrequired.\u201d State v. Jackson, 64 Ohio St.2d 107, 110, 413 N.E.2d 819 (1980).  Rather, in \naddressing a petition for post-conviction relief, a trial court plays a gatekeeping role as to \nwhether a defendant will receive a hearing. Gondor at \u00b6 51.  A trial court may dismiss a \npetition for post-conviction relief without a hearing \u201cwhere th e petition, the supporting \naffidavits, the documentary evidence, the files, and the record s do not demonstrate that \npetitioner set forth sufficient operative facts to establish su bstantive grounds for relief.\u201d \nState v. Calhoun , 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999), paragraph two of th e \nsyllabus; Gondor at \u00b6 51. \n{\u00b6 12} This court reviews alleged instances of ineffective assistance of trial counsel \nunder the two-pronged analysis set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 \nS.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and adopted by the Supreme C ourt of Ohio in State \nv. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).  These cases provid e that trial \ncounsel is entitled to a strong presumption that his or her con duct falls within the wide \nrange of reasonable assistance. Strickland at 689; Bradley at 142.  To reverse a \nconviction based on ineffective assistance of counsel, it must be demonstrated that trial  \n-7- \ncounsel's conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that his or her \nerrors were serious enough to create a reasonable probability that, but for the errors, the \nresult of the trial court proceeding would have been different. Bradley at 142. \n{\u00b6 13} With respect to Dowell\u2019s seven claims of ineffective assistance  o f  t r i a l  \ncounsel contained in his original petition to vacate or set aside his judgment of conviction, \nhis arguments are barred by res judicata because he was require d to raise those \narguments during his direct appeal. See State v. Reid, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25790, \n2014-Ohio-1282, \u00b6 7-9. In Reid, we stated the following:   \n\u201cPursuant to the doctrine of res judicata, a valid final judgment on the merits \nbars all subsequent actions based on any claim arising out of t he \ntransaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the pr evious \naction.\u201d State v. Collins, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25612, 2013-Ohio-3645, \n\u00b6 9, citing Grava v. Parkman Twp., 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 382, 653 N.E.2d 226 \n(1995).   \nId. at \u00b6 7. \n{\u00b6 14} All seven of Dowell\u2019s ineffective assistance claims in regard to trial counsel\u2019s \nperformance could and should have been raised in his direct app eal.  Significantly, we \nnote that Dowell did argue that he received ineffective assista nce of trial counsel in his \ndirect appeal, albeit for different reasons than the arguments advanced in his original \npetition to vacate or set aside his judgment of conviction.  Ad ditionally, Dowell has failed \nto produce any additional evidence from outside of the record in support of his claims that \nhe was denied the effective assistance of counsel.  All of the supporting materials \nsubmitted in his original petition contained information known to him at the time of trial  \n-8- \nand his direct appeal.  The materials submitted in support of h is original petition \ncontained no \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d upon which to base Dow ell\u2019s ineffective \nassistance claims.  Therefore, we conclude that Dowell\u2019s claims  are barred by res \njudicata.  \n{\u00b6 15} As previously stated, Dowell made the following arguments in his amended \npetition to vacate or set aside his judgment of conviction: 1) witness misconduct (Amy \nBehm\u2019s testimony); 2) witness misconduct (Detective Thomas\u2019s fa lse testimony); and \nprosecutorial misconduct.  Upon review, however, the supporting  documents Dowell \nattached to his amended petition focus on discovery materials provided to him before the \ntrial in the instant case.  In fact, Dowell acknowledged in a r eply brief filed with the trial \ncourt on June 7, 2019, that the documents attached to his amend ed petition were \nprovided to his trial counsel during the course of discovery pr ior to trial.  Therefore, the \nmaterials attached to his amended petition cannot be considered  \u201cnewly discovered \nevidence.\u201d   \n{\u00b6 16} Additionally, all of the documents that Dowell attached in supp ort of his \noriginal petition and his amended petition were in his possession and known to him at the \ntime of his direct appeal and could have been utilized at that time.  \u201cRes judicata also \nimplicitly bars a petitioner from \u2018repackaging\u2019 evidence or iss ues which either were, or \ncould have been, raised in the context of the petitioner's tria l or direct appeal.\u201d State v. \nQuinn, 98 N.E.3d 1184, 2017-Ohio-8107, \u00b6 35 (2d Dist.), quoting State v. Monroe, 10th \nDist. Franklin No. 04AP-658, 2005-Ohio-5242, \u00b6 9.  Here, all of  the issues raised by \nDowell in his petition for post-conviction relief were known to  him during discovery and  \nclearly could have been raised on direct appeal, since the info rmation was introduced at  \n-9- \ntrial.  Accordingly, his arguments were barred by res judicata.   Therefore, the trial court \ndid not err when it overruled Dowell\u2019s original petition and his amended petition to vacate \nor set aside his judgment of conviction without a hearing. \n{\u00b6 17} Dowell\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error are overruled. \n{\u00b6 18} All of Dowell\u2019s assignments of error having been overruled, the judgment of \nthe trial court is affirmed.   \n. . . . . . . . . . . . . \n \nT U C K E R ,  P .

DOWELL, #A733-547, P.O. Box 69, London, Ohio 43140\nDefendant-Appellant, Pro Se\n\nDONOVAN, J.\nDefendant-appellant Anthony C. Dowell appeals a judgment of the Miami Court of Common Pleas overruling his petition to vacate or set aside judgment of conviction and his amended petition to vacate or set aside judgment of conviction. Dowell filed a timely notice of appeal with this Court on July 29, 2019.\n\nWe set forth the history of the case in State v. Dowell, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2017-CA-5, 2018-Ohio-4044, Dowell\u2019s direct appeal from his conviction, and we repeat it herein in pertinent part:\n\nDefendant-appellant Anthony Dowell appeals from his convictions on two counts of sexual battery. Dowell contends that the convictions were not supported by the weight of the evidence and that the State did not present evidence sufficient to sustain the convictions. He further contends that counsel was ineffective. Dowell also claims that his convictions violated his fundamental liberty interests and were, thus, unconstitutional. Finally, he claims that the trial court erred in sentencing.\n\nWe conclude that there was sufficient, credible evidence upon which a reasonable finder of fact could have relied in finding Dowell guilty of the charged offenses. We further find no merit to his claim that his constitutional rights were violated or that the trial court erred in sentencing. Finally, we cannot conclude that counsel\u2019s failure to object to evidence resulted in prejudice.\n\nId. at \u00b6 1-2. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment on direct appeal.\n\nOn May 16, 2018, Dowell filed a petition to vacate or set aside his judgment of conviction, in which he asserted several claims regarding the alleged ineffective\nassistance of his trial counsel; specifically, he alleged that his counsel failed to perform the following actions: 1) failed to interview the victim prior to trial; 2) failed to interview and prepare to cross-examine State\u2019s witness Amy Behm; 3) failed to interview or call Amber Behm as a defense witness; 4) failed to interview or call Destiny Powell as a defense witness; 5) failed to interview or call Samantha Dowell as a defense witness; 6) failed to conduct a proper pretrial investigation and failed to file a motion to dismiss the indictment; and 7) failed to conduct a thorough pretrial interview of Dowell and ignored his demand to testify on his own behalf.\n\n\u00b6 4 On June 7, 2019, Dowell filed an amended petition in which he set forth additional claims for post-conviction relief: 1) witness misconduct (regarding Amy Behm\u2019s testimony); 2) witness misconduct (Detective Thomas\u2019s allegedly false testimony); and 3) prosecutorial misconduct. On July 8, 2019, the trial court issued an order denying Dowell\u2019s original petition and his amended petition to vacate or set aside his judgment of conviction without a hearing.\n\n\u00b6 5 It is from this judgment that Dowell now appeals.\n\n\u00b6 6 Because they are interrelated, Dowell\u2019s three assignments of error will be discussed together as follows:\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN MAKING FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW WHICH ARE IN CONFLICT WITH THE ACTUAL TRIAL RECORDS AND CONTRARY TO THE POST-CONVICTION RECORDS, WHEREBY, DENYING THE APPELLANT OF [sic] DUE PROCESS OF LAW.\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ABUSING ITS DISCRETION IN\nFAILING TO CONDUCT AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING ON THE APPELLANT\u2019S PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF, WHERE THE APPELLANT REQUESTED FOR SUCH A HEARING WITH SUFFICIENT EVIDENTIARY DOCUMENTATION WHICH WOULD HAVE REQUIRED SUCH A HEARING BY LAW.\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DECIDING THE MERITS OF THE APPELLANT\u2019S CLAIMS WITHOUT FIRST CONDUCTING AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING, WHEREBY DEPRIVING THE APPELLANT [OF] THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP AND INDUCE FURTHER EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF HIS CLAIMS.\n\n\u00b6 7 In his first assignment, Dowell contends that he received ineffective assistance because his trial counsel failed to do the following: 1) failed to interview the victim prior to trial; 2) failed to interview and prepare to cross-examine State\u2019s witness, Amy Behm; 3) failed to interview or call Amber Behm as a defense witness; 4) failed to interview or call Destiny Powell as a defense witness; 5) failed to interview or call Samantha Dowell as a defense witness; 6) failed to conduct a proper pretrial investigation and failed to file a motion to dismiss the indictment; and 7) failed to conduct a thorough pretrial interview of Dowell and ignored his demand to testify on his own behalf.

PageID #: 12832 \n \n In his petition, Harris raises six grounds for relief. 5 The State, in its return of the \nwrit, maintains that the petition should be dismissed in part  as non-cognizable and/or \nprocedurally defaulted and denied in pa rt on the merits after AEDPA review. 6 Harris has \nfiled a traverse.7 \n For the following reasons, I will recommend that the petiti on be dismissed in part \nand denied in part as is more fully set forth below. \nFacts and Proceedings in the Trial Court \n The Ohio appeals court ma de extensive background factual findings that can here \nbe more briefly stated.8 \n In the early afternoon of August 17, 20 14, Tyler Spaulding was riding a bus home \nafter work.9 Sitting in front of him were four people who Tyler believed were talking about \nrobbing him.10 Fearing for his safety, Tyler called his sister, told her what he was hearing, \nand asked her to have his brother Isaac meet him at the bus stop.11 \n \n5 ECF No. 1 at 8-15. \n6 ECF No. 6 at 19-50. \n7 ECF No. 12. \n8 Facts found by the state appeals court shall be presumed correct by the federal habeas \ncourt unless rebutted by the petitioner by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2254(e)(1). \n9 ECF No. 6 at 2 (quoting Ohio appeals court opinion). \n10 Id. \n11 Id. \nCase: 1:18-cv-02199-JZ  Doc #: 13  Filed:  07/23/21  2 of 31.  PageID #: 12843 \n \n Just prior to Tyler\u2019s stop, two of the me n who had been talking about a robbery got \noff the bus.12 When Tyler arrived at his stop he wa s met by his brother Isaac and a friend \nof his cousin\u2019s, with two additional persons then joining the group.13 Tyler told them that \nwhat happened on the bus was over and to leave it alone.14 \n Meanwhile on a nearby street, Martinez Hunt er was sitting on his front porch when \nhe also received a call from Mary that someone was trying to rob Tyler.15 As he was leaving \nhis residence to respond to Mary\u2019s call, Harris encountered three men who had been on the \nbus with Tyler \u2013 one of whom  was Harris and known to Martinez \u2013 walking toward East \n123rd Street in Cleveland where, unbeknownst to them, they were about to encounter Tyler \nand his group.16 \n When Tyler saw Harris and his group, he  pointed them out and James Parker, Jr., \none of Tyler\u2019s group, started yelling at Harris\u2019s group to stop.17 When Harris\u2019s group did \nnot stop but started walking fast er, Tyler\u2019s group pursued them. 18 During the chase, \nMartinez later testified that he saw Harris brandish a .38 gun.19 \n \n12 Id. \n13 Id. \n14 Id. \n15 Id. \n16 Id. at 3. \n17 Id. \n18 Id. \n19 Id. \nCase: 1:18-cv-02199-JZ  Doc #: 13  Filed:  07/23/21  3 of 31.  PageID #: 12854 \n \n As the two groups ran across a parking lo t and then down the middle of a street \nHarris began shooting at Martinez and Parker.20 Harris\u2019s second shot hit Parker in the hand, \ncausing Parker to retreat and take cover behind a tree. 21 Harris kept advancing toward \nParker and firing, hitting him th is time first in the arm and then finally and fatally in the \nchest, from a distance of only three or four feet.22 \n On September 13, 2014, Harris was indict ed on one count of aggravated murder \nplus counts of murder, felonious assault, discharge of a firearm on or near prohibited \npremises and having a weapon while under di sability, along with related firearms, prior \nconviction, and repeat offender specifications. 23 During the next several months in 2015, \nHarris filed multiple motions to either dismiss his court-appointed attorney or to be named \nco-counsel, which motions were later withdrawn,24 in one instance as the result of Harris\u2019s \ncounsel also moving to withdraw from the case.25 \n Prior to trial, the State dismissed on e charge of having a weapon while under \ndisability26 and Harris waived a jury  trial on the prior conv iction and repeat offender \nspecifications, choosing instead to  have these tried to the court. 27 All other counts were \ntried to the jury.28 After Harris\u2019s motion for acquittal on the charge of felonious assault was \ndenied,29 the jury, and the court found Harris guilty on all counts.30 \n \n20 Id. \n21 Id. \n22 Id. \n23 ECF No. 8, Attachment 2 (state court record) at 1-6. \n24 Id. at 9-23. \n25 Id. at 24, 38. \n26 Id. at 42. \n27 Id. at 43. \n28 Id. at 154. \n29 Id. at 642-46. \n30 Id. at 45. \nCase: 1:18-cv-02199-JZ  Doc #: 13  Filed:  07/23/21  4 of 31.

Ohio Court of Appeals \n On April 8, 2016, Harris, through new appointed counsel,32 timely33 appealed to the \nOhio appeals court.34 In his brief, Harris raised the following five assignments of error: \n 1. Appellant was deprived of his ri ght to due process under federal and \nstate law amounting to plain error when the jury as not properly instructed on \naccomplice liability, affecting the entire trial. \n 2. Insufficient evidence supported appellant\u2019s conviction for aggravated \nmurder by failing to present sufficient evidence that th e shooter acted with prior \ncalculation and design. \n 3. The manifest weight of the evid ence did not support a conviction for \nany offense, including those based on acco mplice liability, or for conviction as a \nprincipal offender. \n 4. Defense counsel provided constitu tionally ineffective assistance at \ntrial, failing to properly define \u201caccomp lice liability,\u201d or provide the affirmative \ndefense for the jury contained therein, or object to the state\u2019s inflammatory remarks \non closing. \n \n31 Id. at 51. \n32 Id. at 52. Rick Ferrara was appointed to represent Harris on appeal. Michael Cheselka \nrepresented him at trial.

The state committed prosecutori al misconduct by comparing its \npersonal experiences to the evidence at  trial into comments during closing \narguments.35  \n The State filed a brief in opposition. 36 On May 11, 2017, the Ohio appellate court \naffirmed the judgment of the trial court. 37 Harris, pro se, then sought 38 but, on July 17, \n2017, failed to obtain en banc review of this appeal.39 \nB. Supreme Court of Ohio   \n While the attempt to obtain en banc review of the direct appeal was still pending, \non June 16, 2017, Harris, pro se, timely40 filed a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court \nof Ohio.41 In his memorandum in support of jurisdiction, Harris set forth the following four \npropositions of law: \n 1. To prove aggravated murder with prior calculation and design the \naccused and the victim must have more than a superficial awareness of each other[;] \nalso[,] mere possession of a handgun does not prove the accused gave though[t] or \npreparation in choosing the weapon. \n 2. A defendant is deprived of his right to due process under federal and \nstate law amounting to plain error when the jury was not prop erly instructed on \naccomplice liability, affecting the entire trial. \n 3. Defense counsel provided constitu tionally ineffective assistance at \ntrial, failing to properly define acco mplice liability or prov ide the affirmative \n \n35 Id. at 63. \n36 Id. at 117. \n37 Id. at 152-88. \n38 Id. at 189, 192, 202. \n39 Id. at 206. \n40 Ohio Supreme Court Practice Rule 7.01(A)(1)(a)(i) states that an appeal must be filed \nwithin 45 days of the appellate judgment for which review is sought. Here, the appellate \ndecision was entered May 11, 2017 and the notice of appeal was filed with the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio on June 16, 2017 \u2013 36 days. \n41 ECF No. 6, Attachment 2 at 207. \nCase: 1:18-cv-02199-JZ  Doc #: 13  Filed:  07/23/21  6 of 31.

The state made improper statem ents to the jury during closing \narguments.42 \n The State did not file a responsive brie f and, on October 11,  2017, the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio declined  to accept jurisdiction. 43 The record does not indicate that Harris \nthen sought a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States. \nC. Rule 26(B) application to re-open the appeal  \n While his direct appeal was still pending in the Supreme Court of Ohio, Harris, pro \nse, on August 17, 201744 filed an application under Ohio Appellate Rule 26(B) to re-open \nhis appeal. 45 The State, in its brief in opposition, argued that  Harris\u2019s application was \nbeyond the 90-day deadline and also that he had also failed to file an affidavit attesting to \nhis appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.46 Harris replied arguing th at his application was \ntimely based on when he had placed it into the prison mail system.47 \n On March 7, 2017, the Ohio appeals court denied the application, ruling that it was \nuntimely filed and that Harris had not shown good cause for the late filing.48 Specifically, \nthe appeals court noted that, to be timely, Harris needed to have filed his application to re-\n \n42 Id. at 209. \n43 Id. at 264. \n44 Harris\u2019s application itself says he placed it into the prison mail system on August 4, \n2017.

On June 27, 2018, \nthe Supreme Court of Ohio declined to accept jurisdiction.53 \nD. Post-Conviction Proceedings \n Harris filed five post-conviction motions in the trial court: \n 1. October 24, 2016 \u2013 pro se motion challenging jurisdiction. 54 That motion \nwas denied55 and no appeal was filed. \n 2. January 4, 2017 \u2013 pro se motion for a new trial. 56 The State opposed the \nmotion.57 There is no record that the trial cour t ruled on the motion, but, for present \n \n49 Id.at 290. \n50 Id. \n51 Id. at 290-91. \n52 Id. at 301. \n53 Id. at 385. \n54 Id. at 319. \n55 Id. at 324. \n56 Id. at 325. \n57 Id. at 343. \nCase: 1:18-cv-02199-JZ  Doc #: 13  Filed:  07/23/21  8 of 31.

Warden, 2011 WL 335665, at *5-6 (S.D. Ohio Jan. 4, 2011) (R&R), adopted, \n2011 WL 332562 (S.D. Ohio Jan. 31, 2011). \n59 ECF No. 6, Attachment 2 at 346. \n60 Id. at 349. \n61 Id. at 352. \n62 Id. at 353. \n63 Harris states in the petition itself that he placed it into the prison mail system on \nSeptember 9, 2018. ECF No. 1 at 17. As is well-known, a federal habeas petition by an \nincarcerated pro se petitioner is deemed filed under the prison mailbox rule when it is \nplaced into the prison mail system for forwarding to the court. Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. \n266, 276 (1988). In addition, because Harris\u2019s conviction became final on October 11, \n2017 when the Supreme Court of Ohio declined jurisdiction over his direct appeal, the \nfiling of this petition on September 9, 2018 is within the one-year period set by 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(d)(1). \n64 ECF No. 1. \nCase: 1:18-cv-02199-JZ  Doc #: 13  Filed:  07/23/21  9 of 31.  PageID #: 129110 \n \nright under federal and state law amounti ng to \u201cplain error\u201d when the jury \nwas not properly instructed on accomplice liability affecting the entire trial. \n TWO:  Insufficient evidence supported petitioner\u2019s conviction \nfor aggravated murder by failing to present sufficient ev idence that the \nshooter acted with prior calculation and design. \n THREE: Petitioner\u2019s counse l provided constitutionally \nineffective assistance at trial [by] failing to properly define \u201caccomplice \nliability\u201d or provide the affirmative defense for the jury contained therein, or \nobject to the state\u2019s inflammatory re marks on closing, all] violating \npetitioner\u2019s 6th Amendment right of the United States Constitution. \n FOUR: The State committed pr osecutorial misconduct by \ncomparing its [sic] personal experience to the evidence at trial into comments \nduring closing argument violating the petitio ner[\u2019s] [rights under the] 14 th \nAmendment of the United States Constitution. \n FIVE:  The court abused its di scretion in violation of the 14 th \nAmendment of the United States Constitution due process and equal \nprotection clause[s] by refusing the petitioner the right to remove counsel at \na critical stage of the proceedings enforcing [ sic] a 6 th Amendment \nconstitutional violation do [sic] to ine ffective assistance of counsel and \nrefusing the petitioner of [ sic] his right to [ sic] the 6 th Amendment to have \nhis own counsel of choice[,] denying the petitioner a fair & just trial. \n SIX:  Petitioner was denied his 14 th and 6th Amendment right \nto due process & counsel of choice under state and federal law when \npetitioner filed his 26-B [application] timely and the Eighth District appellate \ncourt abused its discretion by refusing to accept th e petitioner\u2019s application \nfor 26-B application when the petitioner provided proof and a valid cash slip \nfrom the prisoner\u2019s account office the st ate still refuse[d] to accept the \napplication [as] timely [filed].65 \n \n The State, in its return of the writ, contends that: \n  Ground One  (failure to give jury instru ction as to accomplice liability) \nshould be dismissed as a non-cognizable  state law claim or, alternatively, as \nprocedurally defaulted.66 \n \n65 ECF No. 1 at 8-14. \n66 ECF No. 6 at 19-27. \nCase: 1:18-cv-02199-JZ  Doc #: 13  Filed:  07/23/21  10 of 31.  PageID #: 129211 \n \n Ground Two (insufficiency of the evidence as to aggravated murder) should \nbe denied after AEDPA review because th e Ohio appeals court decision in this \nregard is not an unreasonable application of the clearly established federal law of \nJackson v. Virginia.67 \n Ground Three (ineffective assistance of tria l counsel) should be denied on \nthe merits after AEDPA review because th e decision of the Ohio  appeals court in \nthis regard is not an unreasonable application of the clearly established federal law \nof Strickland v. Washington.68 \n Ground Four  (prosecutorial misconduct) should be dismissed as \nprocedurally defaulted.69 \n Ground Five (right to remove counsel) should be dismissed as procedurally \ndefaulted.70 \n Ground Six (dismissal of Rule 26(B) applica tion) should be dismissed as a \nnon-cognizable state law claim.71 \n  As noted above, Harris filed a traverse. 72 \nAnalysis \nA. Preliminary Observations  \n Before proceeding further, I make the following preliminary observations: \n 1. There is no dispute that Harris is currently in state custody as the result \nof his conviction and sentence by an Ohio court, and that he was so incarcerated at \nthe time he filed this petition. 73 Thus, he meets the in-c ustody requirement of the \nfederal statute conferring jurisdiction over this petition.74 \n \n67 Id. at 27-34 (applying Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979)).  \n68 Id. at 34-41 (applying Strickland v.

PageID #: 129312 \n \n 2. There is also no di spute, as detailed above, that the petition was timely \nfiled under the applicable statute.75 \n 3. In addition, Harris states, 76 and my own review of the docket \nconfirms, that this is not a second or successive petition for federal habeas relief as \nto this conviction and sentence.77 \n 4. Further, it appears that the claims here have been exhausted as that is \nunderstood in federal law.78 \n 5. Finally, Harris, who is proceeding pro se , has not requested the \nappointment of counsel,79 nor sought an evidentiary hearing.80 \n Standards of review  \nB. Standard of Review \n(1) Non-cognizable claims  \n A claim for relief based solely on a purporte d error of state law is not cognizable in \na federal habeas proceeding. 81 Error in the application of state law gives rise to a federal \nhabeas claim only if such an error renders  the underlying proceeding so fundamentally \nunfair as to deny the petitioner due process. 82 Lack of fundamental fairness is understood \n \n75 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).  \n76 ECF No. 1 at  \n77 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b). \n78 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254(b)(1), (c). \n79 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(h); Rule 8 (c), Rules Governing 2254 Cases.

PageID #: 129514 \n \npetitioner must fairly present those state courts with the same claim on the same theory as \nwhat is presented to the federal court.93 \n When the state asserts that a violation of  a state procedural rules is the reason why \na state court did not reach the substance of th e petitioner\u2019s claim, and so is the basis for a \nprocedural default, the Sixth Circuit has established a four-part test to determine if such a \nprocedural default will bar federal habeas review of the claim.94 \n To that end: \n 1. There must be a state procedural rule in place that was not followed; \n 2. The state court must have deni ed consideration of the claim on the \ngrounds of the petitioner\u2019s failure to follow that rule; \n 3. That state rule must be an \u201cadequate and independent\u201d state law \nground that is both \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed;\u201d \n 4. To avoid the default, the petitione r must demonstrate either cause for \nthe default and a resulting actual prejudice to him arising from the federal court not \naddressing his claim, or show that a failure  to consider his claim would result in a \nfundamental miscarriage of justice.95 \n To establish \u201ccause,\u201d the pe titioner must show that some  objective factor external \nto the defense impeded his efforts to co mply with the stat e procedural rule. 96 To show \n\u201cprejudice\u201d from upholding the default, a petitioner must sh ow that the alleged error \nworked to his actual and substantial disadvantage.97 \n \n93 Picard v.

Application of Standards \n(1) Ground One \n In Ground One, Harris contends that, under a plain error analysis, he was deprived \nof due process when the jury was not instructed as to accomplice liability.  \n The Ohio court, in considering the clai m on direct appeal, first noted that Harris \nfailed to object to the jury instructions at tr ial, thus any review on appeal was limited to \nplain error review.  This means that Harris bore the burden of showing that the outcome of \nthe trial would clearly have been different but for the claimed error. 106 The Ohio appeals \ncourt then stated that although the jury instruction here was not a verbatim recitation of the \ninstruction provided in Ohio Jury Instructions, a trial court need not match the instruction \nin the OJI, but must merely  communicate the relevant legal principles and the law to the \n \n103 Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 473 (2007). \n104 Harrington, 562 U.S. at 98. \n105 Early v. Packer, 537 U.S. 3, 8 (2002) (per curiam). \n106 ECF No. 6 at 20 (quoting record). \nCase: 1:18-cv-02199-JZ  Doc #: 13  Filed:  07/23/21  16 of 31.  PageID #: 129817 \n \njury.107 In that light, the Ohio appeals court concluded that the instruction here \u201cmirrored\u201d \nthe applicable complicity statute and so was not erroneous.108  \n The claim here concerning a failure to give  a jury instruction on accomplice liability \nis generally a non-cognizable claim of state law. 109 As the Sixth Circuit stated in Goff v. \nBagley, 110 \u201daccomplice instructions as a general matter are not required, and \u2026 a trial \ncourt does not violate a defendant\u2019s constitu tional rights by failing to give a specific \naccomplice instruction so long as  the jury instructions adeq uately informed the jury \nregarding the credibility of witness testim ony and alerted the jury to the various \nconsiderations that it should take into account in weighing testimony.\u201d111 \n Here, Harris raised no issues concerning th e adequacy of the instructions on witness \ncredibility and on weighing testim ony. Thus, under the teaching of Goff, the trial court\u2019s \nfailure to give a particular accomplice instruction does not implicate Harris\u2019s constitutional \nrights. \n Further, as the Ohio appeal s court noted, Harris failed to object to the instructions \nat trial. Under Ohio\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule, failure to object at trial to an alleged \ntrial error waives all but plain error review on appeal. 112 This rule is recognized as an \n \n107 Id. at 21-22 (quoting record). \n108 Id. \n109 Id. at 24. \n110 601 F.3d 854 (6th Cir. 2000). \n111 Id. at 469 (internal quotation and citation omitted). \n112 State v.

As to cause, the Ohio appeals court, as will be more \nextensively discussed below in Ground Three, rejected Harris\u2019 claim that trial counsel was \nineffective for failing to properly define accomplice liability. Read leniently as a claim that \ntrial counsel should have objected  to a jury instruction that did not explicitly instruct the \njury as to accomplice liability, the fact that the Ohio a ppeals court found no ineffective \nassistance on this point precludes Harris from no w claiming that ineffective assistance of \ntrial counsel can excuse the default here. Moreover, the Ohio appellate court\u2019s conclusion \nthat the instruction given was valid as a matter of Ohio law precludes Harris from \nestablishing prejudice from not having the federal habeas court review the claim. Finally, \nHarris has not claimed a miscarriage of justi ce, such as the conviction of one who is \nactually innocent. \n Accordingly, I recommend that Ground One be dismissed as non-cognizable and \nprocedurally defaulted. \n \n \n113 Osbourne v.

PageID #: 130019 \n \n(2) Ground Two \n In Ground Two, Harris main tains that his conviction for aggravated murder was not \nsupported by sufficient evidence. To that point, he contends , as detailed above, that the \nstate failed to present sufficient evidence that the shooter acted with prior calculation and \ndesign. \n As is well-known, in reviewing a clai m that a conviction was not supported by \nsufficient evidence, the relevant inquiry is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light \nmost favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential \nelements of the crime be yond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 115 In applying this test in a federal \nhabeas proceeding, deference is due to the jury\u2019s determination116 and also to the finding \nof the state appeals court that considered this issue.117 \n In this instance, th e Ohio appeals court began its an alysis by correctly citing the \nJackson standard as it is inco rporated into Ohio law. 118 The court then considered the \nelement of prior calculation and design in the context of aggravated murder, noting first \nthat prior calculation and desi gn is a distinct concept from \u201cpurpose\u201d and that the \nprosecution must prove both elements.119 \n \n115 Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979). \n116 Brown v.

PageID #: 130120 \n \n As to the \u201cprior calculation and design\u201d element that Harris specifically raised, the \nappeals court observed that the Ohio Suprem e Court has identified several factors that \nshould be considered. 120 It further noted that, in shor t duration emotional situations, \npursuing and killing a fleeing or incapacitated victim after an initial confrontation \u201cstrongly \nindicates prior calculation and design.\u201d121 To that point, the Ohio appeals court noted that \nthe Ohio Supreme Court has found that \u201c[p]rior calculation and design can be found even \nwhen the killer quickly conceived and executed the plan to kill within a few minutes.\u201d122 \n Here, the appeals court found, that the jury could reasonably infer that Harris\u2019 \ndecision to display a gun while running demo nstrated a choice of a murder weapon and \nthat his actions of pursuing and repeatedly firing at a re treating and wounded Parker \ndemonstrated that Harris was acting on a quickly conceived plan to kill Parker.123 \n After applying the relevant standards se t out above, I recommend finding that the \ndecision of the Ohio appeals court on this claim was not an unreasonable application of the \nclearly established federal law of Jackson. Therefore, I further recommend that Ground \nTwo be denied on the merits. \n(3) Ground Three \n In Ground Three, Harris argues that his trial counsel was ineffective by: (1) failing \nto properly define accompli ce liability; (2) failing to provide  the affirmative defense for \n \n120 Id. at 29-31. \n121 Id. at 31 (internal quotation omitted). \n122 Id.

PageID #: 130322 \n \ndid, there could be no error in Harris\u2019s tr ial counsel failing to object to that proper \ninstruction.129 \n Next, as to the claim that trial counsel was ineffective for not requesting instruction \nas to the affirmative defense of renunciation, the appellate court again found that there was \nno basis for Harris\u2019s trial counsel to have requested such an instruction.130 In particular, the \nappeals court noted that to show renunciati on Harris would have to have shown that he \n\u201cmanifested a complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.\u201d131 \n Harris contends that he manifested th at renunciation by r unning from the scene \nbefore the shooting took place and that he wasn\u2019t the shooter.132 While there was evidence \nsuggesting that Harris may have fled the scen e, there was other evidence that Harris was \nthe shooter in the midst of the scene, and the jury is charged with reconciling any conflict \nin testimony.133 \n Moreover, even if the jury  did not believe that Harris was the shooter, evidence was \npresented that Harris handed th e murder weapon to  the man he claimed was the shooter, \ndemonstrating that Harris was an accomplice to the shooting.134 The Ohio court then found, \n \n129 Id.

PageID #: 130423 \n \nunder Ohio law, that renunciation is not shown by flight to avoid apprehension for a crime \nalready committed.135 \n Finally, as to any ineffective assistan ce arising from a failure to object to \npurportedly improper comments by the prosec ution during closing argument, the Ohio \ncourt, citing to its analysis in a subseque nt section, observed th at the prosecutor\u2019s \ncomments did not constitute misconduct and so there was no basis for Harris\u2019s counsel to \nobject to them, and so no ineffective assistance.136 \n Accordingly, after analyzing this clai m under the relevant AEDPA standard, I \nrecommend finding first that the decision of the Ohio appeals court on this ground was not \nan unreasonable application of Strickland. I then further reco mmend denying Ground \nThree on the merits. \n(4) Ground Four  \n In Ground Four, Harris maintains that the prosecutor improperly injected his \npersonal opinions into closing argument a nd also improperly compared his personal \nexperience to the evidence at trial.  \n To prevail on a claim of pr osecutorial misconduct, the petitioner must show that the \nprosecutor\u2019s remarks \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting \nconviction a denial of due process.\u201d137 Even if the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was \u201cundesirable \n \n135 Id. at 39 (quoting record). \n136 Id.

Even if the 26(B) application were timely filed, the \ndefault on the underlying claim of the trial court\u2019s purported error, caused by the lack of a \ncontemporaneous objection, cannot be cured by later claiming that appellate counsel was \nineffective for not raising the issue on appeal.156 \n As with the earlier procedural defaults , I recommend finding that Harris has not \nexcused them with a showing of  either cause or prejudice. To that point, I note that the \nOhio appeals court that reject ed the Rule 26(B) application as untimely filed noted in a \nfootnote: \n Several times during the pretrial procee dings Harris filed motions to dismiss his \nattorney , and each time Harris withdrew his motion\u2026[At the last occasion Harris] \napologiz[ed] for his error and ask[ed] the cour t to void the motion to dismiss counsel.

It is understa ndable [on this record] how appellate counsel \ncould conclude in the exercise of professi onal judgment that such  a record would not \nsupport an argument for denial of counsel [by the trial court].157 \n This finding essentially stat es that there cannot be any prejudice to Harris from this \nfederal habeas court not addressing the merits of Ground Five because the factual basis for \nthe claim \u2013 that the trial court denied Harris\u2019s attempts to change his counsel \u2013 is incorrect. \nAs noted earlier, facts found by the state appeals court in its  review of the record are \npresume true by the federal habeas court.158 \n Accordingly, I recommend denying Grou nd Five as procedurally defaulted. \n(6) Ground Six \n In Ground Six Harris claims that he was denied due process on his choice of counsel \nclaim because the Ohio appeals court abused its  discretion in refusing to accept his Rule \n26(B) application as timely filed. \n The State claims that Gr ound Six is non-cognizable.159 \n Harris\u2019s argument here is that he filed th e 26(B) application on time and proved that \nby providing the prison mail room log.160 Essentially, Harris appears to have assumed that \nfiling a Rule 26(B) application was governed by the prison mailbox rule that is applicable \nto federal habeas filings.

That \ntimely filing rule for Rule 26(B)  applications is an adequate and independent state law \nground to foreclose consideration of the u nderlying claim by a federal habeas court. 163 \nFurther, the default is not waived because the state appeals court in a footnote recounted \nsome of the factual background of the cas e to determine if there are circumstances \npotentially warranting a review on the merits.164 \n As with the prior procedural defaults, Ha rris has not excused this default by showing \neither cause or prejudice. Indeed, he cannot show prejudice because of the facts shown by \nthe state appeals court do not show any merit to the underlying claim. \n Accordingly, I recommend dismissing Gr ound Six as procedurally defaulted. \n \n \n \n161 ECF No. 6, Attachment 2 at 299. \n162 Vroman v.

Harris asserts in his petition that he was incarcerated at the Mansfield Correctional Institution in Mansfield, Ohio at the time he filed the petition. ECF No. 1 at 1.\n\\(^4\\) See, ECF No. 6 at 7 (citing record).\nIn his petition, Harris raises six grounds for relief. The State, in its return of the writ, maintains that the petition should be dismissed in part as non-cognizable and/or procedurally defaulted and denied in part on the merits after AEDPA review. Harris has filed a traverse.\n\nFor the following reasons, I will recommend that the petition be dismissed in part and denied in part as is more fully set forth below.\n\n**Facts and Proceedings in the Trial Court**\n\nThe Ohio appeals court made extensive background factual findings that can here be more briefly stated.\n\nIn the early afternoon of August 17, 2014, Tyler Spaulding was riding a bus home after work. Sitting in front of him were four people who Tyler believed were talking about robbing him. Fearing for his safety, Tyler called his sister, told her what he was hearing, and asked her to have his brother Isaac meet him at the bus stop.\n\n---\n\n5 ECF No. 1 at 8-15.\n6 ECF No. 6 at 19-50.\n7 ECF No. 12.\n8 Facts found by the state appeals court shall be presumed correct by the federal habeas court unless rebutted by the petitioner by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).\n9 ECF No. 6 at 2 (quoting Ohio appeals court opinion).\n10 *Id.*\n11 *Id.*\nJust prior to Tyler\u2019s stop, two of the men who had been talking about a robbery got off the bus.\\textsuperscript{12} When Tyler arrived at his stop he was met by his brother Isaac and a friend of his cousin\u2019s, with two additional persons then joining the group.\\textsuperscript{13} Tyler told them that what happened on the bus was over and to leave it alone.\\textsuperscript{14}\n\nMeanwhile on a nearby street, Martinez Hunter was sitting on his front porch when he also received a call from Mary that someone was trying to rob Tyler.\\textsuperscript{15} As he was leaving his residence to respond to Mary\u2019s call, Harris encountered three men who had been on the bus with Tyler \u2013 one of whom was Harris and known to Martinez \u2013 walking toward East 123\\textsuperscript{rd} Street in Cleveland where, unbeknownst to them, they were about to encounter Tyler and his group.\\textsuperscript{16}\n\nWhen Tyler saw Harris and his group, he pointed them out and James Parker, Jr., one of Tyler\u2019s group, started yelling at Harris\u2019s group to stop.\\textsuperscript{17} When Harris\u2019s group did not stop but started walking faster, Tyler\u2019s group pursued them.\\textsuperscript{18} During the chase, Martinez later testified that he saw Harris brandish a .38 gun.\\textsuperscript{19}\n\n\\textsuperscript{12} Id.\n\\textsuperscript{13} Id.\n\\textsuperscript{14} Id.\n\\textsuperscript{15} Id.\n\\textsuperscript{16} Id. at 3.\n\\textsuperscript{17} Id.\n\\textsuperscript{18} Id.\n\\textsuperscript{19} Id.\nAs the two groups ran across a parking lot and then down the middle of a street Harris began shooting at Martinez and Parker. Harris\u2019s second shot hit Parker in the hand, causing Parker to retreat and take cover behind a tree. Harris kept advancing toward Parker and firing, hitting him this time first in the arm and then finally and fatally in the chest, from a distance of only three or four feet.\n\nOn September 13, 2014, Harris was indicted on one count of aggravated murder plus counts of murder, felonious assault, discharge of a firearm on or near prohibited premises and having a weapon while under disability, along with related firearms, prior conviction, and repeat offender specifications. During the next several months in 2015, Harris filed multiple motions to either dismiss his court-appointed attorney or to be named co-counsel, which motions were later withdrawn, in one instance as the result of Harris\u2019s counsel also moving to withdraw from the case.\n\nPrior to trial, the State dismissed one charge of having a weapon while under disability and Harris waived a jury trial on the prior conviction and repeat offender specifications, choosing instead to have these tried to the court. All other counts were tried to the jury. After Harris\u2019s motion for acquittal on the charge of felonious assault was denied, the jury, and the court found Harris guilty on all counts.\n\n20 Id.\n21 Id.\n22 Id.\n23 ECF No. 8, Attachment 2 (state court record) at 1-6.\n24 Id. at 9-23.\n25 Id. at 24, 38.\n26 Id. at 42.\n27 Id. at 43.\n28 Id. at 154.\n29 Id. at 642-46.\n30 Id. at 45.\nOn March 11, 2016, following a merger of the two charges of felonious assault and the two charges of discharge of a firearm on or near prohibited premises, Harris was sentenced to an aggregate term of 29-years-to life imprisonment.31\n\nState Appeals After Conviction\n\nA. Ohio Court of Appeals\n\nOn April 8, 2016, Harris, through new appointed counsel,32 timely33 appealed to the Ohio appeals court.34 In his brief, Harris raised the following five assignments of error:\n\n1. Appellant was deprived of his right to due process under federal and state law amounting to plain error when the jury as not properly instructed on accomplice liability, affecting the entire trial.\n\n2. Insufficient evidence supported appellant\u2019s conviction for aggravated murder by failing to present sufficient evidence that the shooter acted with prior calculation and design.\n\n3. The manifest weight of the evidence did not support a conviction for any offense, including those based on accomplice liability, or for conviction as a principal offender.\n\n4. Defense counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance at trial, failing to properly define \u201caccomplice liability,\u201d or provide the affirmative defense for the jury contained therein, or object to the state\u2019s inflammatory remarks on closing.\n\n31 Id. at 51.\n32 Id. at 52.

To prove aggravated murder with prior calculation and design the accused and the victim must have more than a superficial awareness of each other[;] also[,] mere possession of a handgun does not prove the accused gave though[t] or preparation in choosing the weapon.\n\n2.

Rule 26(B) application to re-open the appeal\n\nWhile his direct appeal was still pending in the Supreme Court of Ohio, Harris, \\textit{pro se}, on August 17, 2017\\textsuperscript{44} filed an application under Ohio Appellate Rule 26(B) to re-open his appeal.\\textsuperscript{45} The State, in its brief in opposition, argued that Harris\u2019s application was beyond the 90-day deadline and also that he had also failed to file an affidavit attesting to his appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.\\textsuperscript{46} Harris replied arguing that his application was timely based on when he had placed it into the prison mail system.\\textsuperscript{47}\n\nOn March 7, 2017, the Ohio appeals court denied the application, ruling that it was untimely filed and that Harris had not shown good cause for the late filing.\\textsuperscript{48} Specifically, the appeals court noted that, to be timely, Harris needed to have filed his application to re-\n\n\\textsuperscript{42} \\textit{Id.} at 209.\n\\textsuperscript{43} \\textit{Id.} at 264.\n\\textsuperscript{44} Harris\u2019s application itself says he placed it into the prison mail system on August 4, 2017. \\textit{Id.} at 277.

On June 27, 2018, the Supreme Court of Ohio declined to accept jurisdiction.\\textsuperscript{53}\n\n\\textbf{D.

May 31, 2017 \u2013 pro se petition to vacate/ set aside the conviction and sentence.59 The State opposed the petition as untimely filed and because it failed to state a ground for relief.60 The trial court denied the petition.61\n\n4. June 19, 2018 \u2013 motion for re-sentencing.62 The record does not show that the trial court ruled on this motion and so, as noted above, it is presumed to be overruled.\n\nFederal Habeas Corpus Petition\n\nOn October 11, 2018, Harris, pro se, timely63 filed the present petition for federal habeas relief.64 In the petition, Harris presents the following six grounds for habeas relief:\n\nONE: Petitioner was deprived of Fourteenth Amendment rights through the jury trial protection of the Sixth And Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, of petitioner\u2019s due process\n\n58 Curry v. Warden, 2011 WL 335665, at *5-6 (S.D. Ohio Jan. 4, 2011) (R&R), adopted, 2011 WL 332562 (S.D. Ohio Jan. 31, 2011).\n59 ECF No. 6, Attachment 2 at 346.\n60 Id. at 349.\n61 Id. at 352.\n62 Id. at 353.\n63 Harris states in the petition itself that he placed it into the prison mail system on September 9, 2018. ECF No. 1 at 17. As is well-known, a federal habeas petition by an incarcerated pro se petitioner is deemed filed under the prison mailbox rule when it is placed into the prison mail system for forwarding to the court. Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, 276 (1988). In addition, because Harris\u2019s conviction became final on October 11, 2017 when the Supreme Court of Ohio declined jurisdiction over his direct appeal, the filing of this petition on September 9, 2018 is within the one-year period set by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).\n64 ECF No. 1.\nright under federal and state law amounting to \u201cplain error\u201d when the jury was not properly instructed on accomplice liability affecting the entire trial.\n\nTWO: Insufficient evidence supported petitioner\u2019s conviction for aggravated murder by failing to present sufficient evidence that the shooter acted with prior calculation and design.\n\nTHREE: Petitioner\u2019s counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance at trial [by] failing to properly define \u201caccomplice liability\u201d or provide the affirmative defense for the jury contained therein, or object to the state\u2019s inflammatory remarks on closing, all] violating petitioner\u2019s 6th Amendment right of the United States Constitution.\n\nFOUR: The State committed prosecutorial misconduct by comparing its [sic] personal experience to the evidence at trial into comments during closing argument violating the petitioner[\u2019s] [rights under the] 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\nFIVE: The court abused its discretion in violation of the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution due process and equal protection clause[s] by refusing the petitioner the right to remove counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings enforcing [sic] a 6th Amendment constitutional violation do [sic] to ineffective assistance of counsel and refusing the petitioner of [sic] his right to [sic] the 6th Amendment to have his own counsel of choice[,] denying the petitioner a fair & just trial.\n\nSIX: Petitioner was denied his 14th and 6th Amendment right to due process & counsel of choice under state and federal law when petitioner filed his 26-B [application] timely and the Eighth District appellate court abused its discretion by refusing to accept the petitioner\u2019s application for 26-B application when the petitioner provided proof and a valid cash slip from the prisoner\u2019s account office the state still refuse[d] to accept the application [as] timely [filed].65\n\nThe State, in its return of the writ, contends that:\n\n*Ground One* (failure to give jury instruction as to accomplice liability) should be dismissed as a non-cognizable state law claim or, alternatively, as procedurally defaulted.66\n\n---\n\n65 ECF No. 1 at 8-14.\n66 ECF No. 6 at 19-27.\nGround Two (insufficiency of the evidence as to aggravated murder) should be denied after AEDPA review because the Ohio appeals court decision in this regard is not an unreasonable application of the clearly established federal law of Jackson v. Virginia.67\n\nGround Three (ineffective assistance of trial counsel) should be denied on the merits after AEDPA review because the decision of the Ohio appeals court in this regard is not an unreasonable application of the clearly established federal law of Strickland v. Washington.68\n\nGround Four (prosecutorial misconduct) should be dismissed as procedurally defaulted.69\n\nGround Five (right to remove counsel) should be dismissed as procedurally defaulted.70\n\nGround Six (dismissal of Rule 26(B) application) should be dismissed as a non-cognizable state law claim.71\n\nAs noted above, Harris filed a traverse.72\n\nAnalysis\n\nA. Preliminary Observations\n\nBefore proceeding further, I make the following preliminary observations:\n\n1. There is no dispute that Harris is currently in state custody as the result of his conviction and sentence by an Ohio court, and that he was so incarcerated at the time he filed this petition.73 Thus, he meets the in-custody requirement of the federal statute conferring jurisdiction over this petition.74\n\n---\n\n67 Id. at 27-34 (applying Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979)).\n68 Id. at 34-41 (applying Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984)).\n69 Id. at 41-46.\n70 Id. at 46-49.\n71 Id. at 49-50.\n72 ECF No. 12.\n73 As noted above, Harris was incarcerated at the Mansfield Correctional Institution at the time the petition was filed and has subsequently been transferred to the Richland Correctional Institution, where he is currently held.\n74 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a).\n2. There is also no dispute, as detailed above, that the petition was timely filed under the applicable statute.\\textsuperscript{75}\n\n3. In addition, Harris states,\\textsuperscript{76} and my own review of the docket confirms, that this is not a second or successive petition for federal habeas relief as to this conviction and sentence.\\textsuperscript{77}\n\n4. Further, it appears that the claims here have been exhausted as that is understood in federal law.\\textsuperscript{78}\n\n5. Finally, Harris, who is proceeding \\textit{pro se}, has not requested the appointment of counsel,\\textsuperscript{79} nor sought an evidentiary hearing.\\textsuperscript{80}\n\nStandards of review\n\nB. Standard of Review\n\n(1) Non-cognizable claims\n\nA claim for relief based solely on a purported error of state law is not cognizable in a federal habeas proceeding.\\textsuperscript{81} Error in the application of state law gives rise to a federal habeas claim only if such an error renders the underlying proceeding so fundamentally unfair as to deny the petitioner due process.\\textsuperscript{82} Lack of fundamental fairness is understood\n\n\\textsuperscript{75} 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).\n\\textsuperscript{76} ECF No. 1 at\n\\textsuperscript{77} 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b).\n\\textsuperscript{78} 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254(b)(1), (c).\n\\textsuperscript{79} 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(h); Rule 8 (c), Rules Governing 2254 Cases. I note here that while Harris has not sought an appointment of counsel for purposes of this habeas petition, he does include as a prayer for relief \u201ca new trial with new counsel.\u201d ECF No. 1 at 17.\n\\textsuperscript{80} 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (e)(2).\n\\textsuperscript{81} \\textit{Lewis v. Jeffers}, 497 U.S. 764, 780 (1990).\n\\textsuperscript{82} \\textit{Estelle v. McGuire}, 502 U.S. 62, 69-70 (1991).\n\u201cvery narrowly,\u201d as only those actions that violate those \u201cfundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions.\u201d\n\nThe petitioner bears the burden of showing a lack of fundamental fairness. In analyzing the claim, the federal habeas court is bound by the rulings of the state\u2019s highest court as to state law and may not second-guess a state court\u2019s interpretation of its own procedural rules.\n\n(2) Procedural Default\n\nA claim not adjudicated on the merits by a state court is not subject to AEDPA review in a federal habeas court. Such a claim is subject to dismissal by the federal court as procedurally defaulted if the petitioner failed to raise it in the state court when remedies were still available or the petitioner violated a state procedural rule when attempting to raise it. The petitioner must initially afford the state courts an \u201copportunity to pass upon and correct alleged violations of its prisoners\u2019 federal rights.\u201d This requires that a petitioner go through one complete round of the state\u2019s established appellate review procedure, presenting his claims to \u201ceach appropriate state court.\u201d\n\n---\n\n83 Dowling v.

There must be a state procedural rule in place that was not followed;\n2. The state court must have denied consideration of the claim on the grounds of the petitioner\u2019s failure to follow that rule;\n3. That state rule must be an \u201cadequate and independent\u201d state law ground that is both \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed;\u201d\n4. To avoid the default, the petitioner must demonstrate either cause for the default and a resulting actual prejudice to him arising from the federal court not addressing his claim, or show that a failure to consider his claim would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.95\n\nTo establish \u201ccause,\u201d the petitioner must show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded his efforts to comply with the state procedural rule.96 To show \u201cprejudice\u201d from upholding the default, a petitioner must show that the alleged error worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage.97\n\n93 Picard v.

Application of Standards\n\n(1) Ground One\n\nIn Ground One, Harris contends that, under a plain error analysis, he was deprived of due process when the jury was not instructed as to accomplice liability.\n\nThe Ohio court, in considering the claim on direct appeal, first noted that Harris failed to object to the jury instructions at trial, thus any review on appeal was limited to plain error review. This means that Harris bore the burden of showing that the outcome of the trial would clearly have been different but for the claimed error.\\textsuperscript{106} The Ohio appeals court then stated that although the jury instruction here was not a verbatim recitation of the instruction provided in \\textit{Ohio Jury Instructions}, a trial court need not match the instruction in the \\textit{OJI}, but must merely communicate the relevant legal principles and the law to the\n\n\\textsuperscript{103} \\textit{Schriro v. Landrigan}, 550 U.S. 465, 473 (2007).\n\\textsuperscript{104} \\textit{Harrington}, 562 U.S. at 98.\n\\textsuperscript{105} \\textit{Early v. Packer}, 537 U.S. 3, 8 (2002) (\\textit{per curiam}).\n\\textsuperscript{106} ECF No. 6 at 20 (quoting record).\njury. In that light, the Ohio appeals court concluded that the instruction here \u201cmirrored\u201d the applicable complicity statute and so was not erroneous.\n\nThe claim here concerning a failure to give a jury instruction on accomplice liability is generally a non-cognizable claim of state law. As the Sixth Circuit stated in *Goff v. Bagley*, accomplice instructions as a general matter are not required, and \u2026 a trial court does not violate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights by failing to give a specific accomplice instruction so long as the jury instructions adequately informed the jury regarding the credibility of witness testimony and alerted the jury to the various considerations that it should take into account in weighing testimony.\n\nHere, Harris raised no issues concerning the adequacy of the instructions on witness credibility and on weighing testimony. Thus, under the teaching of *Goff*, the trial court\u2019s failure to give a particular accomplice instruction does not implicate Harris\u2019s constitutional rights.\n\nFurther, as the Ohio appeals court noted, Harris failed to object to the instructions at trial. Under Ohio\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule, failure to object at trial to an alleged trial error waives all but plain error review on appeal. This rule is recognized as an\n\n---\n\n107 *Id.* at 21-22 (quoting record).\n108 *Id.*\n109 *Id.* at 24.\n110 601 F.3d 854 (6th Cir. 2000).\n111 *Id.* at 469 (internal quotation and citation omitted).\n112 *State v. Murphy*, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 532 (2001).\nadequate and independent state law ground to foreclose federal habeas relief.\\textsuperscript{113} Moreover, plain error review by the Ohio court does not constitute a waiver the procedural default, opening the claim to consideration by the federal habeas court.\\textsuperscript{114}\n\nFinally, Harris cannot excuse the procedural default here by showing cause, prejudice, or a miscarriage of justice. As to cause, the Ohio appeals court, as will be more extensively discussed below in Ground Three, rejected Harris\u2019 claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to properly define accomplice liability. Read leniently as a claim that trial counsel should have objected to a jury instruction that did not explicitly instruct the jury as to accomplice liability, the fact that the Ohio appeals court found no ineffective assistance on this point precludes Harris from now claiming that ineffective assistance of trial counsel can excuse the default here. Moreover, the Ohio appellate court\u2019s conclusion that the instruction given was valid as a matter of Ohio law precludes Harris from establishing prejudice from not having the federal habeas court review the claim. Finally, Harris has not claimed a miscarriage of justice, such as the conviction of one who is actually innocent.\n\nAccordingly, I recommend that Ground One be dismissed as non-cognizable and procedurally defaulted.\n\n\\textsuperscript{113} Osbourne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 124 (1990).\n\\textsuperscript{114} Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255, 257 (1989).\n(2) **Ground Two**\n\nIn Ground Two, Harris maintains that his conviction for aggravated murder was not supported by sufficient evidence. To that point, he contends, as detailed above, that the state failed to present sufficient evidence that the shooter acted with prior calculation and design.\n\nAs is well-known, in reviewing a claim that a conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence, the relevant inquiry is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\\(^{115}\\) In applying this test in a federal habeas proceeding, deference is due to the jury\u2019s determination\\(^{116}\\) and also to the finding of the state appeals court that considered this issue.\\(^{117}\\)\n\nIn this instance, the Ohio appeals court began its analysis by correctly citing the *Jackson* standard as it is incorporated into Ohio law.\\(^{118}\\) The court then considered the element of prior calculation and design in the context of aggravated murder, noting first that prior calculation and design is a distinct concept from \u201cpurpose\u201d and that the prosecution must prove both elements.\\(^{119}\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^{115}\\) *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979).\n\n\\(^{116}\\) *Brown v.

Therefore, I further recommend that Ground Two be denied on the merits.\n\n\\textbf{(3) Ground Three}\n\nIn Ground Three, Harris argues that his trial counsel was ineffective by: (1) failing to properly define accomplice liability; (2) failing to provide the affirmative defense for\n\n\\begin{footnotes}\n\\item[120] \\textit{Id.} at 29-31.\n\\item[121] \\textit{Id.} at 31 (internal quotation omitted).\n\\item[122] \\textit{Id.} (citation omitted).\n\\item[123] \\textit{Id.} at 32-33 (quoting record).\n\\end{footnotes}\nthe jury contained therein; and (3) failing to object to inflammatory remarks in the prosecution\u2019s closing argument.\\textsuperscript{124}\n\nTo establish ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner must show both that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that he suffered prejudice as a result.\\textsuperscript{125} To establish deficient performance, the petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and overcome the presumption that counsel\u2019s actions fell within a wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\\textsuperscript{126} To establish prejudice, the petitioner must prove that a \u201creasonable probability\u201d exists that, but for counsel\u2019s alleged errors, the result of the criminal proceeding would have been different.\\textsuperscript{127}\n\nIn reviewing this claim, the Ohio appeals court began by correctly stating the \\textit{Strickland} standard as applicable in this case.\\textsuperscript{128} The court then considered the three particular claims of ineffective assistance individually.\n\nFirst, as to the claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a different jury instruction as to accomplice liability, the Ohio appeals court observed that because, as was previously found, the trial court had not erred in giving the instruction it\n\n\\textsuperscript{124} I note again that Harris is limited here to same ineffective assistance claims as were presented to the Ohio courts. \\textit{Wong v. Money}, 142 F.3d 313, 322 (6th Cir. 1998).\n\\textsuperscript{125} \\textit{Strickland v.

I then further recommend denying Ground Three on the merits.\n\n\\textbf{(4) Ground Four}\n\nIn Ground Four, Harris maintains that the prosecutor improperly injected his personal opinions into closing argument and also improperly compared his personal experience to the evidence at trial.\n\nTo prevail on a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, the petitioner must show that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d\\textsuperscript{137} Even if the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was \u201cundesirable\n\n\\textsuperscript{135} \\textit{Id.} at 39 (quoting record).\n\\textsuperscript{136} \\textit{Id.} (quoting record).\n\\textsuperscript{137} \\textit{Donnelly v.

In the first instance, the Ohio court found that the prosecutor was\n\n\\textsuperscript{138} \\textit{Darden v. Wainwright}, 477 U.S. 168, 181 (1986).\n\\textsuperscript{139} \\textit{Smith v.

Even if the 26(B) application were timely filed, the default on the underlying claim of the trial court\u2019s purported error, caused by the lack of a contemporaneous objection, cannot be cured by later claiming that appellate counsel was ineffective for not raising the issue on appeal.\\(^{156}\\)\n\nAs with the earlier procedural defaults, I recommend finding that Harris has not excused them with a showing of either cause or prejudice. To that point, I note that the Ohio appeals court that rejected the Rule 26(B) application as untimely filed noted in a footnote:\n\n> Several times during the pretrial proceedings Harris filed motions to dismiss his attorney, and each time Harris withdrew his motion...[At the last occasion Harris] apologized for his error and ask[ed] the court to void the motion to dismiss counsel.

Mitchell*, 547 F.3d 297, 312 (6th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted).\nthe beginning of trial [], Harris\u2019s counsel affirmed that they were ready to proceed. Harris participated in this pretrial and never voiced dissatisfaction with his attorney or asked for a hearing concerning counsel. It is understandable [on this record] how appellate counsel could conclude in the exercise of professional judgment that such a record would not support an argument for denial of counsel [by the trial court].\n\nThis finding essentially states that there cannot be any prejudice to Harris from this federal habeas court not addressing the merits of Ground Five because the factual basis for the claim \u2013 that the trial court denied Harris\u2019s attempts to change his counsel \u2013 is incorrect. As noted earlier, facts found by the state appeals court in its review of the record are presume true by the federal habeas court.\n\nAccordingly, I recommend denying Ground Five as procedurally defaulted.\n\n(6) Ground Six\n\nIn Ground Six Harris claims that he was denied due process on his choice of counsel claim because the Ohio appeals court abused its discretion in refusing to accept his Rule 26(B) application as timely filed.\n\nThe State claims that Ground Six is non-cognizable.\n\nHarris\u2019s argument here is that he filed the 26(B) application on time and proved that by providing the prison mail room log. Essentially, Harris appears to have assumed that filing a Rule 26(B) application was governed by the prison mailbox rule that is applicable to federal habeas filings. However, as noted by the Ohio appeals court, the filing rules for\n\n157 ECF No. 6, Attachment 2 at 296, fn. 2.\n158 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).\n159 ECF No. 6 at 49-50.\n160 ECF No. 1 at 14.\n26(B) applications are strictly computed by reference to the time elapsing between the journalization of the appellate decision that the applicant wishes to re-open and the actual date the application to re-open is received by the clerk of that court.\\textsuperscript{161} The prison mailbox rule that applies in federal court \u201cdoes not apply in Ohio.\u201d\\textsuperscript{162}\n\nHere, the state appeals court enforced its procedural rule as to filing and so any substantive claim in that untimely Rule 26(B) application is procedurally defaulted. That timely filing rule for Rule 26(B) applications is an adequate and independent state law ground to foreclose consideration of the underlying claim by a federal habeas court.\\textsuperscript{163} Further, the default is not waived because the state appeals court in a footnote recounted some of the factual background of the case to determine if there are circumstances potentially warranting a review on the merits.\\textsuperscript{164}\n\nAs with the prior procedural defaults, Harris has not excused this default by showing either cause or prejudice. Indeed, he cannot show prejudice because of the facts shown by the state appeals court do not show any merit to the underlying claim.\n\nAccordingly, I recommend dismissing Ground Six as procedurally defaulted.\n\n\\textsuperscript{161} ECF No. 6, Attachment 2 at 299.\n\\textsuperscript{162} Vroman v.

Summit No. 28749, 2018-Ohio-1488, \u00b6 2-4, this Court \nsummarized Mr. Boware\u2019s numerous attempts to attack his 1993 co nviction for gross sexual \nimposition as follows:    \nThe instant appeal flows from [Mr.] Boware\u2019s 1993 conviction fo r gross sexual \nimposition. [Mr.] Boware received a one-year prison sentence that was suspended \nin favor of a two-year term of probation. \n \n[Mr.] Boware has attempted to attack his conviction numerous ti mes in recent \nyears. In 2013, [Mr.] Boware filed a group of motions in the trial court challenging \nhis conviction, including a petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court denied \nall of the motions and its judgment was affirmed on appeal. State v. Boware , 9th 2 \n          \n \nDist. Summit No. 26952, 2013-Ohio-5225, \u00b6 9. Thereafter, [Mr.] Boware filed \nanother set of motions in the trial court. [Mr.] Boware\u2019s filin gs included a second \npetition for post-conviction relief and two motions to vacate his plea. The trial court \nagain rejected [Mr.] Boware\u2019s challenges to his conviction. On appeal, this Court \naffirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment on the basis of res judicata. State v. Boware, 9th \nDist. Summit No. 27446, 2014-Ohio-5779, \u00b6 7. [Mr.] Boware subsequently filed a \nthird round of motions in the tr ial court, all of which were de nied. [Mr.] Boware \nappealed and this Court again c oncluded that his  challenges wer e barred by the \ndoctrine of res judicata. State v. Boware, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27975, 2016-Ohio-\n7024, \u00b6 7. \n \n[Mr.] Boware filed another group of motions in 2017. Therein, [ Mr.] Boware \nalleged numerous due process viol ations. The common thread that  ran through \n[Mr.] Boware\u2019s motions was that the State had manipulated and m ishandled the \nevidence in his case. [Mr.] Boware further argued that there was newly discovered \nevidence. Based on these allegations, [Mr.] Boware argued that he should be \npermitted to withdraw his plea and that the charge against him should be dismissed. \nOn August 11, 2017, the trial court issued a [J]ournal [E]ntry denying the motions \non the basis that [Mr.] Boware\u2019s claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. \n \nIn affirming the trial court\u2019s August 11, 2017 Journal Entry, this Court explained:  \n[Mr.] Boware\u2019s assignments of error are without merit. As noted  above, [Mr.] \nBoware has filed copious post- judgment motions challenging his conviction in \nrecent years, often alleging foul play by the State or the discovery of new evidence. \n[Mr.] Boware makes comparable arguments in his most recent set of motions filed \nin the trial court in 2017. With respect to [Mr.] Boware\u2019s claims pertaining to newly \ndiscovered evidence, we note that he expounded similar conspiratorial allegations \npertaining to exculpatory evidence in prior challenges to his conviction and he has \nnot explained how he was previously prevented from discovering the evidence upon \nwhich he now relies in his mos t recent round of motions. * * * Under these \ncircumstances, [Mr.] Boware is barred from raising these issues under the doctrine \nof res judicata.   \n \nBoware at \u00b6 8.   \nMr. Boware\u2019s October 26, 2020 Post-Conviction Motion  \n{\u00b63} On October 26, 2020, Mr. Boware filed a motion, pursuant to R.C. 2953.23, seeking \na new trial based upon \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence regarding his 1993 conviction for gross sexual \nimposition.  As in prior motions, Mr. Boware alleged the State withheld exculpatory evidence \nabout the State\u2019s witness, incl uding that the State\u2019s witness w as allegedly a \u201cconfidential 3 \n          \n \ninformant\u201d and \u201cprostitute,\u201d and the Akron police did not preserve \u201capparently exculpatory crime \nscene rape [] DNA evidence,\u201d thus creating a Brady violation.  See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. \n83 (1963).  Mr. Boware also claimed the victim, P.W., filed a false police report in 1993 indicating \nhe had \u201cfondled her breasts.\u201d             \n{\u00b64} In response, the State contended Mr. Boware\u2019s arguments are barred by the doctrine \nof res judicata, and the trial c ourt could not properly conside r Mr. Boware\u2019s motion because, \npursuant to R.C. 2953.23, Mr. Boware did not \u201cunearth\u201d new evidence.  As such, the State argued \nthe motion was fatally \u201cuntimely and successive,\u201d baseless as a  matter of law, and wholly \n\u201cfrivolous.\u201d  Moreover, the State indicated the newly discovere d evidence submitted by Mr. \nBoware \u201chas been in the public domain for more than the last tw o decades,\u201d and, thus, does not \nsatisfy the requirements of R.C. 2953.23.  The State also argued, because Mr. Boware voluntarily \nentered a plea of guilty, he is not entitled to the same rights  and constitutional guarantees as set \nforth in Brady, supra.  See U.S. v. Ruiz , 536 U.S. 622, 633 (2002) (\u201c[T]he Constitution does not \nrequire the Government to disclose material impeachment evidenc e prior to entering a plea \nagreement with a criminal defendant.)   \n{\u00b65} The trial court, in its December 15, 2020 Journal Entry, denied  M r .  B o w a r e \u2019 s  \nmotion, stating, in relevant part:  \n[Mr. Boware] has filed numerous motions over the years asserting reasons why his \nconviction should be overturned. On each occasion his motions have been denied.  \nThe Ninth District Court of App eals has repeatedly upheld the t rial court orders \ndenying the relief sought [by Mr. Boware].   \n \nIn this latest filing, [Mr. Boware] has again failed to assert any legitimate basis for \ngranting him a new trial.   His claims are precluded by the doctrine of res judicata.    \n 4 \n          \n \n{\u00b66} It is from this Journal Entry Mr. Boware appeals, raising two assignments of error \nfor our review.  Because our analysis of Mr. Boware\u2019s assignmen ts of error is identical, we \nconsolidate our discussion below.       \nII. \nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I \nTHE COMMON PLEAS COURT JUDGE ABUSED HER DISCRETION \nBECAUSE [] SHE WAS PRESENTED A SET OF FACTS THAT ARE \nMATERIALLY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A DECISION OF THE \nPRECEDENT CASE HAZEL-ATLAS GLASS CO.

Zhao, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 03CA008386, 2004-Ohio-3245, \u00b6 7, quoting State v. Meek, 9th \nDist. Lorain No. 03CA008315, 2004-Ohio-1981, \u00b6 9. Further, \u201c[t] o the extent that Mr. Boware \nchallenges the validity of his plea, we note that this Court has held that an offender may not raise \nissues in a successive motion to withdraw a guilty plea that co uld have been raised in the initial \nmotion.\u201d Boware, 2018-Ohio-1488, \u00b6 7. \n{\u00b68} Here, the documents purported to be \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence, attached to Mr. \nBoware\u2019s motion, are a June 7, 1993 offense or incident report for Gross Sexual Imposition made \nagainst Mr. Boware by victim, P .W., and a 1993 newspaper articl e regarding Mr. Boware being \ncharged with the rape of a woman while on duty as an Akron policeman.  Mr. Boware also attached \nto his motion: (1) an email from one of his former attorneys, w ith the June 7, 1993 offense or \nincident report attached; (2) a docket entry from 1994 regardin g the resolution of a Grand Theft \noffense against P.A., the alleged police informant and prostitute that Mr. Boware thought accused \nhim of rape; (3) the June 11, 1993 Complaint against Mr. Boware  signed by P.W. alleging Mr. \nBoware compelled her \u201cto submit by force or threat of force\u201d to  engage in sexual conduct in \nviolation of R.C. 2907.02; and (4) a June 15, 1993 Journal Entry requiring Mr. Boware to submit \nto DNA testing.   \n{\u00b69} Indeed, the above-listed documents were available to Mr. Boware  for purposes of \ndirect appeal or post-conviction relief.  Importantly, the June 7, 1993 offense or incident report for 6 \n          \n \nGross Sexual Imposition is a pub lic record, and the 1993 newspa per article was available in the \npublic domain for twenty-eight years.  Thus, because Mr. Boware could have litigated these issues \non direct appeal or in his initial post-conviction motion, his arguments are barred by res judicata.          \nIII. \n{\u00b610} For the reasons stated above, Mr. Boware\u2019s assignments of error are overruled and \nthe judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.  \nJudgment affirmed.   \n  \n \n There were reasonable grounds for this appeal. \n We order that a special mandate issue out of this Court, directing the Court of Common \nPleas, County of Summit, State o f Ohio, to carry this judgment into execution.

Boware, appeals the judgment of the Summit County Court of Common Pleas denying his most recent post-conviction arguments as barred by the doctrine of res judicata. For the reasons that follow, this Court affirms.\n\nI.\n\nMr. Boware\u2019s Previous Post-Conviction Motions and Appeals\n\n{\u00b62} In State v. Boware, 9th Dist. Summit No. 28749, 2018-Ohio-1488, \u00b6 2-4, this Court summarized Mr. Boware\u2019s numerous attempts to attack his 1993 conviction for gross sexual imposition as follows:\n\nThe instant appeal flows from [Mr.] Boware\u2019s 1993 conviction for gross sexual imposition. [Mr.] Boware received a one-year prison sentence that was suspended in favor of a two-year term of probation.\n\n[Mr.] Boware has attempted to attack his conviction numerous times in recent years. In 2013, [Mr.] Boware filed a group of motions in the trial court challenging his conviction, including a petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court denied all of the motions and its judgment was affirmed on appeal. State v. Boware, 9th\nDist. Summit No. 26952, 2013-Ohio-5225, \u00b6 9. Thereafter, [Mr.] Boware filed another set of motions in the trial court. [Mr.] Boware\u2019s filings included a second petition for post-conviction relief and two motions to vacate his plea. The trial court again rejected [Mr.] Boware\u2019s challenges to his conviction. On appeal, this Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment on the basis of res judicata. State v. Boware, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27446, 2014-Ohio-5779, \u00b6 7. [Mr.] Boware subsequently filed a third round of motions in the trial court, all of which were denied. [Mr.] Boware appealed and this Court again concluded that his challenges were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. State v. Boware, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27975, 2016-Ohio-7024, \u00b6 7.\n\n[Mr.] Boware filed another group of motions in 2017. Therein, [Mr.] Boware alleged numerous due process violations. The common thread that ran through [Mr.] Boware\u2019s motions was that the State had manipulated and mishandled the evidence in his case. [Mr.] Boware further argued that there was newly discovered evidence. Based on these allegations, [Mr.] Boware argued that he should be permitted to withdraw his plea and that the charge against him should be dismissed. On August 11, 2017, the trial court issued a Journal Entry denying the motions on the basis that [Mr.] Boware\u2019s claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n\nIn affirming the trial court\u2019s August 11, 2017 Journal Entry, this Court explained:\n\n[Mr.] Boware\u2019s assignments of error are without merit. As noted above, [Mr.] Boware has filed copious post-judgment motions challenging his conviction in recent years, often alleging foul play by the State or the discovery of new evidence. [Mr.] Boware makes comparable arguments in his most recent set of motions filed in the trial court in 2017. With respect to [Mr.] Boware\u2019s claims pertaining to newly discovered evidence, we note that he expounded similar conspiratorial allegations pertaining to exculpatory evidence in prior challenges to his conviction and he has not explained how he was previously prevented from discovering the evidence upon which he now relies in his most recent round of motions. * * * Under these circumstances, [Mr.] Boware is barred from raising these issues under the doctrine of res judicata.\n\nBoware at \u00b6 8.\n\nMr. Boware\u2019s October 26, 2020 Post-Conviction Motion\n\n\u00b63 On October 26, 2020, Mr. Boware filed a motion, pursuant to R.C. 2953.23, seeking a new trial based upon \u201cnewly discovered\u201d evidence regarding his 1993 conviction for gross sexual imposition. As in prior motions, Mr. Boware alleged the State withheld exculpatory evidence about the State\u2019s witness, including that the State\u2019s witness was allegedly a \u201cconfidential\ninformant\u201d and \u201cprostitute,\u201d and the Akron police did not preserve \u201capparently exculpatory crime scene rape [] DNA evidence,\u201d thus creating a Brady violation. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). Mr. Boware also claimed the victim, P.W., filed a false police report in 1993 indicating he had \u201cfondled her breasts.\u201d\n\n{\u00b64} In response, the State contended Mr. Boware\u2019s arguments are barred by the doctrine of res judicata, and the trial court could not properly consider Mr. Boware\u2019s motion because, pursuant to R.C. 2953.23, Mr. Boware did not \u201cunearth\u201d new evidence. As such, the State argued the motion was fatally \u201cuntimely and successive,\u201d baseless as a matter of law, and wholly \u201cfrivolous.\u201d Moreover, the State indicated the newly discovered evidence submitted by Mr. Boware \u201chas been in the public domain for more than the last two decades,\u201d and, thus, does not satisfy the requirements of R.C. 2953.23. The State also argued, because Mr. Boware voluntarily entered a plea of guilty, he is not entitled to the same rights and constitutional guarantees as set forth in Brady, supra. See U.S. v.

Rick Ferrara, 2077 East Fourth Street, Second Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, for \nDefendant-Appellant. \n   \nDated:  \nOctober 31, 2018   \u2013 2 \u2013 \nCase No. 16 MA 0105 \n   \n   \nPER CURIAM.   \n \n{\u00b61} Defendant-appellant, Bryan Dotson, has filed an application for reopening \nof his direct appeal from his conviction of tampering with vehicle identifying numbers. \nState v. Dotson, 7th Dist. No. 16 MA 0105, 2018-Ohio-2481. For the following reasons, \nthe application is denied. \n{\u00b62}  An application to reopen an appeal must be filed \u201cwithin ninety days from \njournalization of the appellate judgment unless the applicant shows good cause for filing \nat a later time.\u201d App.R. 26(B). Our judgment in this case was filed on June 22, 2018. \nAppellant filed this application on September 7, 2018. Thus, it was timely filed.  \n{\u00b63}  When considering an application for reopening pursuant to App.R. 26(B), \nwe must first determine, based upon appellant\u2019s application, affidavits, and portions of \nthe record before us, whether appellant has set forth a colorable claim of ineffective \nassistance of appellate counsel. See e.g. State v. Milburn , 10th Dist. No. 89AP-655, \n1993 WL 339900 (Aug. 24, 1993); State v. Burge, 88 Ohio App.3d 91, 623 N.E.2d 146 \n(10th Dist.1993). In order to show ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, appellant \nmust prove that his counsel was deficient for failing to raise the issues he now presents \nand that there was a reasonable probability of success had he presented those claims \non appeal. State v. Goff , 98 Ohio St.3d 327, 2003-Ohio-1017, 784 N.E.2d 700, \u00b6 5, \n(explaining that the Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984), test \nis used to determine if appellate counsel was ineffective).  \n{\u00b64}  In his direct appeal, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that: his motion to \nsuppress should have been granted, multiple pieces of evidence were admitted \nimproperly, his motion to dismiss should have been granted, his trial counsel was \nineffective, his convictions were insufficient as a matter of law, his convictions were \nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence, the state committed prosecutorial \nmisconduct, and his sentence was unauthorized by law.  \n{\u00b65}  Appellant asserts his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise \nadditional arguments. Appellant first argues:    \u2013 3 \u2013 \nCase No. 16 MA 0105 \n APPELLATE COUNSEL FAILED TO EFFECTIVELY ARGUE \nTHAT THE OFFICER LACKED PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE STOP OF \nAPPELLANT\u2019S VEHICLE.  \n{\u00b66}  Appellant claims that his appellate counsel failed to properly argue that \nthere was insufficient probable cause to justify the initial stop of his vehicle for failure to \ndisplay a front end license plate. Appellant claims that evidence in the record shows that \nhis front end license plate was present on the dashboard of his truck. \n{\u00b67}  Appellant\u2019s allegations are unfounded. First, only reasonable suspicion is \nrequired to initiate a traffic stop, not probable cause. State v. Mays, 119 Ohio St.3d 406, \n2008-Ohio-4539, 894 N.E.2d 1204, \u00b6 7-8. Second, appellant\u2019s own application defeats \nhis argument. Appellant claims that his front end license plate was not on the front end \nof his car but rather on his dashboard. R.C. 4503.21(A)(1) requires the license plate to \nbe in plain view on the front and rear ends of a motor vehicle. Based on this, the \ntroopers had reasonable suspicion to initiate a traffic stop.  \n{\u00b68}  Therefore, appellate counsel was not deficient for failing to raise this \nargument. There was no reasonable probability of success had this argument been \npresented on appeal.  \n{\u00b69}  Second, appellant asserts:  \n APPELLATE COUNSEL FAILED TO EFFECTIVELY ARGUE THE \nVIN THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY RELATED TO A STOLEN VEHICLE \nWAS NOT FACTUALLY VALID AND THAT TRIAL COUNSEL WAS \nINEFFECTIVE.  \n{\u00b610}  Appellant claims that the state\u2019s witnesses presented a factually \ninaccurate VIN from his vehicle which linked his vehicle to a vehicle that was stolen. He \nclaims that the VIN supposedly retrieved from his vehicle was eight digits and that the \ntype of vehicle he was driving would not have had an eight digit VIN.  \n{\u00b611}  Appellant\u2019s allegations here are also unfounded. The argument appellant \nraises here goes directly to his conviction for receiving stolen property in the form of a \nvehicle. We held that his conviction for receiving stolen property in the form of a vehicle   \u2013 4 \u2013 \nCase No. 16 MA 0105 \nwas based on inadmissible evidence, reversed this conviction, and vacated the \nsentence related to this conviction. Dotson, 2018-Ohio-2481, at \u00b6 47, 57, 104. \n{\u00b612}  Therefore, appellate counsel was not deficient for failing to raise this \nargument.  \n{\u00b613}  Third, appellant argues:  \n APPELLATE COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE FOR FAILING TO \nEFFECTIVELY ARGUE THAT APPELLANT DID NOT PURPOSELY \nCONCEAL THE VIN NUMBERS IN HIS VEHICLE.  \n{\u00b614}  Appellant claims the evidence in the record was insufficient to show he \nintended to conceal or destroy any VIN on his vehicle. He also claims that the two VINs \nthat were concealed were able to be easily read by the troopers in this case.  \n{\u00b615}  Appellant\u2019s allegations here are also unfounded. Appellate counsel\u2019s \nfourth assignment of error in the direct appeal challenged, in part, the sufficiency of his \ntampering with vehicle identifying numbers conviction. Specifically, the assignment of \nerror challenged the lack of evidence as to the element of intent. Dotson, 2018-Ohio-\n2481, at \u00b6 66-68. We held that the surrounding facts and circumstances of appellant \nspray painting his vehicle black and the black spray paint covering two VINs on the \nvehicle were sufficient to show intent. Id. at \u00b6 67-68. \n{\u00b616}  Appellant also claims that one of the concealed VINs on his vehicle \nshould not have been considered because the troopers were able to scrape away the \nspray paint in order to read the VIN. This does not negate the fact that the VIN appellant \nclaims should not be considered was still covered with black spray paint. Also, it does \nnot negate the fact that a second VIN was covered with black spray paint.  \n{\u00b617}  Therefore, appellate counsel was not deficient for failing to raise this \nargument. \n{\u00b618}  Finally, appellant argues:  \n APPELLATE COUNSEL FAILED TO EFFECTIVELY ARGUE THE \nISSUE OF THE DASHCAM VIDEO OF THE OFFICER WHO MADE THE \nINITIAL STOP.    \u2013 5 \u2013 \nCase No. 16 MA 0105 \n{\u00b619}  There was over a year between appellant\u2019s stop and his indictment. \nAppellant argues he was denied the ability to make a specific and immediate request for \nthe dashcam video of his stop. Appellant claims that his appellate counsel failed to \neffectively argue the assignment of error concerning this video.  \n{\u00b620}  Appellant\u2019s allegations here are also unfounded. We held that there was \nno evidence in the record about the contents of the erased video tape. It was appellant\u2019s \nburden to show that the contents of the video were material, favorable to him, and that \nthe tape had a reasonable probability to affect the outcome. This was not done. \nAppellant now claims that the tape would have shown that the entire truck had black \noverspray, not just over the VINs of his truck. Even if appellant\u2019s claims are true, they do \nnot negate the fact that two VINs on appellant\u2019s truck were concealed and the VINs on \nthe truck did not match the true VIN. We held that there were sufficient facts to show \nintent to conceal the identity of the truck. Therefore, counsel was not deficient for failing \nto raise this argument.  \n{\u00b621}  For the reasons stated above, appellant\u2019s application to reopen his \nappeal is hereby denied.  \n  \n \n \nJUDGE GENE DONOFRIO, Concurs \n \nJUDGE CHERYL L.

Ralph Rivera, Assistant Prosecutor, Mahoning County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, 21 West Boardman Street, 6th Floor, Youngstown, Ohio 44503, for Plaintiff-Appellee, and\n\nAtty. Rick Ferrara, 2077 East Fourth Street, Second Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, for Defendant-Appellant.\n\nDated:\nOctober 31, 2018\nPER CURIAM.\n\n{\u00b61} Defendant-appellant, Bryan Dotson, has filed an application for reopening of his direct appeal from his conviction of tampering with vehicle identifying numbers. State v. Dotson, 7th Dist. No. 16 MA 0105, 2018-Ohio-2481. For the following reasons, the application is denied.\n\n{\u00b62} An application to reopen an appeal must be filed \u201cwithin ninety days from journalization of the appellate judgment unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later time.\u201d App.R. 26(B). Our judgment in this case was filed on June 22, 2018. Appellant filed this application on September 7, 2018. Thus, it was timely filed.\n\n{\u00b63} When considering an application for reopening pursuant to App.R. 26(B), we must first determine, based upon appellant\u2019s application, affidavits, and portions of the record before us, whether appellant has set forth a colorable claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. See e.g. State v. Milburn, 10th Dist. No. 89AP-655, 1993 WL 339900 (Aug. 24, 1993); State v. Burge, 88 Ohio App.3d 91, 623 N.E.2d 146 (10th Dist.1993). In order to show ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, appellant must prove that his counsel was deficient for failing to raise the issues he now presents and that there was a reasonable probability of success had he presented those claims on appeal. State v. Goff, 98 Ohio St.3d 327, 2003-Ohio-1017, 784 N.E.2d 700, \u00b6 5, (explaining that the Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984), test is used to determine if appellate counsel was ineffective).\n\n{\u00b64} In his direct appeal, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that: his motion to suppress should have been granted, multiple pieces of evidence were admitted improperly, his motion to dismiss should have been granted, his trial counsel was ineffective, his convictions were insufficient as a matter of law, his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence, the state committed prosecutorial misconduct, and his sentence was unauthorized by law.\n\n{\u00b65} Appellant asserts his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise additional arguments. Appellant first argues:\nAPPELLATE COUNSEL FAILED TO EFFECTIVELY ARGUE THAT THE OFFICER LACKED PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE STOP OF APPELLANT'S VEHICLE.\n\n{\u00b66} Appellant claims that his appellate counsel failed to properly argue that there was insufficient probable cause to justify the initial stop of his vehicle for failure to display a front end license plate. Appellant claims that evidence in the record shows that his front end license plate was present on the dashboard of his truck.\n\n{\u00b67} Appellant's allegations are unfounded. First, only reasonable suspicion is required to initiate a traffic stop, not probable cause. State v. Mays, 119 Ohio St.3d 406, 2008-Ohio-4539, 894 N.E.2d 1204, \u00b6 7-8. Second, appellant's own application defeats his argument. Appellant claims that his front end license plate was not on the front end of his car but rather on his dashboard. R.C. 4503.21(A)(1) requires the license plate to be in plain view on the front and rear ends of a motor vehicle. Based on this, the troopers had reasonable suspicion to initiate a traffic stop.\n\n{\u00b68} Therefore, appellate counsel was not deficient for failing to raise this argument. There was no reasonable probability of success had this argument been presented on appeal.\n\n{\u00b69} Second, appellant asserts:\n\nAPPELLATE COUNSEL FAILED TO EFFECTIVELY ARGUE THE VIN THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY RELATED TO A STOLEN VEHICLE WAS NOT FACTUALLY VALID AND THAT TRIAL COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE.\n\n{\u00b610} Appellant claims that the state's witnesses presented a factually inaccurate VIN from his vehicle which linked his vehicle to a vehicle that was stolen. He claims that the VIN supposedly retrieved from his vehicle was eight digits and that the type of vehicle he was driving would not have had an eight digit VIN.\n\n{\u00b611} Appellant's allegations here are also unfounded. The argument appellant raises here goes directly to his conviction for receiving stolen property in the form of a vehicle. We held that his conviction for receiving stolen property in the form of a vehicle\nwas based on inadmissible evidence, reversed this conviction, and vacated the sentence related to this conviction. *Dotson*, 2018-Ohio-2481, at \u00b6 47, 57, 104.\n\n\u00b612 Therefore, appellate counsel was not deficient for failing to raise this argument.\n\n\u00b613 Third, appellant argues:\n\nAPPELLATE COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE FOR FAILING TO EFFECTIVELY ARGUE THAT APPELLANT DID NOT PURPOSELY CONCEAL THE VIN NUMBERS IN HIS VEHICLE.\n\n\u00b614 Appellant claims the evidence in the record was insufficient to show he intended to conceal or destroy any VIN on his vehicle. He also claims that the two VINs that were concealed were able to be easily read by the troopers in this case.\n\n\u00b615 Appellant\u2019s allegations here are also unfounded. Appellate counsel's fourth assignment of error in the direct appeal challenged, in part, the sufficiency of his tampering with vehicle identifying numbers conviction. Specifically, the assignment of error challenged the lack of evidence as to the element of intent. *Dotson*, 2018-Ohio-2481, at \u00b6 66-68. We held that the surrounding facts and circumstances of appellant spray painting his vehicle black and the black spray paint covering two VINs on the vehicle were sufficient to show intent. *Id.* at \u00b6 67-68.\n\n\u00b616 Appellant also claims that one of the concealed VINs on his vehicle should not have been considered because the troopers were able to scrape away the spray paint in order to read the VIN. This does not negate the fact that the VIN appellant claims should not be considered was still covered with black spray paint. Also, it does not negate the fact that a second VIN was covered with black spray paint.\n\n\u00b617 Therefore, appellate counsel was not deficient for failing to raise this argument.\n\n\u00b618 Finally, appellant argues:\n\nAPPELLATE COUNSEL FAILED TO EFFECTIVELY ARGUE THE ISSUE OF THE DASHCAM VIDEO OF THE OFFICER WHO MADE THE INITIAL STOP.\nThere was over a year between appellant\u2019s stop and his indictment. Appellant argues he was denied the ability to make a specific and immediate request for the dashcam video of his stop. Appellant claims that his appellate counsel failed to effectively argue the assignment of error concerning this video.\n\nAppellant\u2019s allegations here are also unfounded. We held that there was no evidence in the record about the contents of the erased video tape. It was appellant\u2019s burden to show that the contents of the video were material, favorable to him, and that the tape had a reasonable probability to affect the outcome. This was not done. Appellant now claims that the tape would have shown that the entire truck had black overspray, not just over the VINs of his truck. Even if appellant\u2019s claims are true, they do not negate the fact that two VINs on appellant\u2019s truck were concealed and the VINs on the truck did not match the true VIN. We held that there were sufficient facts to show intent to conceal the identity of the truck. Therefore, counsel was not deficient for failing to raise this argument.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, appellant\u2019s application to reopen his appeal is hereby denied.\n\nJUDGE GENE DONOFRIO, Concurs\nJUDGE CHERYL L.

DEVAUGHNS, #A525-249, P.O. Box 69, London, Ohio 43140 \n Attorney for Defendant-Appellant \n \n. . . . . . . . . . . . . \n  \nDONOVAN, J. \n \n  \n-2- \n Christopher A. DeVaughns appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of three \nmotions that he had filed pro se, which generally related to th e existence of plain error, \nwitnesses\u2019 competency, and a presentence investigation.  We aff irm the judgment of the \ntrial court. \n The facts surrounding DeVaughns\u2019s convictions were set forth in  o u r  \nprevious opinion in State v. DeVaughns,  2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21654, 2007-Ohio-\n3455, \u00b6 1-4.  Therein, we affirmed DeVaughns\u2019s convictions for felonious assault and \nkidnapping, but we remanded the matter for resentencing because  the court had not \nafforded DeVaughns an opportunity to speak on his own behalf at  sentencing.  Id. at \n\u00b6 36.  The trial court imposed an aggregate sentence of 18 year s. \n On December 8, 2020, DeVaughns filed a motion in the trial cour t asserting \nerror at trial as follows: \n* * * [T]he attached documents (Exhibits 1-7 of the attached \nappendix) are of the Defendant\u2019s misbeliefs that the Identity of the \u201cBLOOD \nON IT\u201d evidence to convict had already been identified; however , the \nidentity whatof [sic], in violation of Crim.R. 16, is being wit hheld.  To wit: \nDiscovered at time of Recent appeal 2020-CA-283701 \n* * * For reasons of gross ineffective assistance of appointed \nappellate counsel, at [the] time of Defendant\u2019s direct appeal *  *  *  T h e  \nDefendant is asking this Court to find that appointed counsel, many years \nexperienced, allowed the State\u2019s \u201cBlood on it\u201d evidence inadmissible, to be \npresented to the Defendant\u2019s Trial Jury; resulting, pursuant Cr im.R. 52(B) \n \n1 State v. DeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28370, 2020-Ohio-2850.  \n-3- \nPLAIN ERROR \u2013 REVERSIBLE ERROR. \n On December 9, 2020, DeVaughns filed a motion asking the trial court, \n\u201cpursuant to Evid.R. 601(A): to find that the testimony given w hile experiencing heavy \ninfluences of heroin and crack-cocaine, self-admittedly, of the  State\u2019s sole Plaintiff, \nLynelle V. Moore, to be inadmissible pursuant Ohio Evid. R. 601  ( A ) . \u201d   W e  n o t e  t h a t  \nEvid.R. 601 sets forth a general rule of competency for witnesses.   \n Finally, on January 5, 2021, DeVaughns filed a \u201cmotion to remand,\u201d asserting \nthat, at his resentencing on remand, his trial and appellate co unsel \u201cwere self-made \nunavailable to the trial court and to the Defendant.\u201d  He seemed to ask to be resentenced \nagain, with defense counsel required to appear.  DeVaughns\u2019s mo tion relied on R.C. \n2951.03(B)(2), which provides: \u201cPrior to sentencing, the court shall permit the defendant \nand the defendant's counsel to comment on the presentence investigation report and, in \nits discretion, may permit the defendant and the defendant's co unsel to introduce \ntestimony or other information that relates to any alleged factual inaccuracy contained in \nthe report.\u201d  Devaughns attached a portion of our opinion in State v. DeVaughns, 2d Dist. \nMontgomery No. 22349, 2008-Ohio-4010.  In that appeal from DeVa ughns\u2019s \nresentencing, we held that \u201cno reasonable argument can be made that the trial court erred \nby proceeding with the re-sentencing hearing, because the recor d reflects that \nDevaughns voluntarily chose to proceed with [an associate of hi s original appellate \ncounsel] representing him at the hearing.\u201d  Id. at \u00b6 30.   \n In its decision overruling all of DeVaughns\u2019s motions, the tria l court simply \nstated that the motions were \u201cnot well taken.\u201d \n DeVaughns asserts two issues for review in his brief.  In his f irst argument,  \n-4- \nhe asserts that one of the witnesses at his trial, Lynelle Moor e, was under the influence \nof drugs when she testified against him, that her testimony was accordingly inadmissible, \nand that he received ineffective assistance of appellate counse l.  In his second \nargument, DeVaughns asserts that, at the time of the kidnapping  of which he was \nconvicted, \u201celse where\u201d and had an exculpatory alibi. 2  DeVaughns does not raise any \nargument with respect to the denial of his first motion. \n The State responds that DeVaughns\u2019s claims in this appeal are barred by res \njudicata and by the law of the case.  The State directs our att ention to State v. \nDeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24631, 2012-Ohio-5791, and State v. DeVaughns, \n2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27727, 2018-Ohio-1421.  We agree with t he State. \n In State v. Devaughns , 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24631, 2012-Ohio-5791, \n\u00b6 8, we stated: \n* * * Devaughns herein for the first time asserts multiple argu ments \nrelated to his trial.  For examp le, his second, third, fourth, eighth and tenth \nassigned errors are directed to the trial testimony of the vict im \nherein, Lynelle Moore, and her sister, Katrina Moore, whose cre dibility \nDevaughns contests.3  Devaughns' fifth assignment of error is addressed \nto the trial court's failure to instruct the jury regarding his purported alibi.  In \nhis seventh assigned error, he asserts that \u201cblood samples\u201d admitted at trial \n \n2 We note that DeVaughns did not raise the issue of his alleged a libi defense in the \nmotions he filed in the trial court. \n \n3 These assigned errors were identified as follows: \u201cLynelle Moore, Katrina Moore Brooks, \nUnder the Influence of Drugs\u201d; \u201cPerjured Testimony, State Witne ss, Lynelle Moore\u201d; \n\u201cAssistant Prosecutor Failed to Correct Perjured Testimony\u201d; \u201cPerjury Ohio Revised Code \nR.C. 2921.11(a)\u201d; and \u201cWitness Misconduct, Complaining State Witness, Lynelle Moore.\u201d    \n-5- \nwere inadmissible.  In his ninth assignment of error, he assert s that \u201cjuror \nmisconduct\u201d occurred.  \u201cUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment \nof conviction bars the convicted defendant from raising and litigating in any \nproceeding, except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or  a n y  \nclaimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by \nthe defendant at the trial which resulted in that judgment of conviction or on \nan appeal from that judgment.\u201d  State v. Perry,  10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 \nN.E.2d 104 (1967).  Devaughns' second, third, fourth, fifth, seventh, eighth, \nninth and tenth assigned errors are barred by the doctrine of r es judicata \nand overruled. \n(Footnote added.) \n In State v. DeVaughns, 2018-Ohio-1421, we held that \u201cthe blood evidence \nissue raised in DeVaughns' motion for new trial was barred by the doctrine of res judicata, \nas he could have raised that issue in his direct appeal and raised similar issues\u201d in State \nv. DeVaughns , 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24631, 2012-Ohio-5791, and State v. \nDeVaughns, 2017-Ohio-475, 84 N.E.3d 332 (2d Dist.).  Id. at \u00b6 21.  We also concluded \nthat our decision in State v. DeVaughns , 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23720, 2011-Ohio-\n125, \u201cremain[ed] the law of the case, thus rendering any challenge DeVaughns may have  \n-6- \nto that decision without merit.\u201d 4  DeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27727, 2018-\nOhio-1421, \u00b6 24.  In DeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23720,  2011-Ohio-125, we \nstated that a witness letter stating that DeVaughns picked up h is child from a daycare \nfacility while he was allegedly re straining Moore was not newly  discovered evidence \nwarranting a new trial, and that the substance of the letter wa s admitted as a stipulation \nat the original trial.  Id. at \u00b6 22-23. \n As the State correctly asserts, this Court has previously addre ssed all of \nDeVaughns\u2019s arguments and rejected them; they were thus barred by the doctrines of res \njudicata and the law of the case. The trial court properly overruled his motions.    \n The judgment of the trial court is affirmed. \n. . . . . . . . . . . . . \n \nHALL, J. and WELBAUM, J., concur.         \n \n \n \nC o p i e s  s e n t  t o :        \n \nMathias H.

No. 0074332, Assistant\nProsecuting Attorney, Montgomery County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Appellate Division,\nMontgomery County Courts Building, 301 West Third Street, 5th Floor, Dayton, Ohio\n45422\n\nAttorney for Plaintiff-Appellee\n\nCHRISTOPHER A. DEVAUGHNS, #A525-249, P.O. Box 69, London, Ohio 43140\n\nAttorney for Defendant-Appellant\n\nDONOVAN, J.\nChristopher A. DeVaughns appeals from the trial court\u2019s denial of three motions that he had filed pro se, which generally related to the existence of plain error, witnesses\u2019 competency, and a presentence investigation. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nThe facts surrounding DeVaughns\u2019s convictions were set forth in our previous opinion in State v. DeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21654, 2007-Ohio-3455, \u00b6 1-4. Therein, we affirmed DeVaughns\u2019s convictions for felonious assault and kidnapping, but we remanded the matter for resentencing because the court had not afforded DeVaughns an opportunity to speak on his own behalf at sentencing. Id. at \u00b6 36. The trial court imposed an aggregate sentence of 18 years.\n\nOn December 8, 2020, DeVaughns filed a motion in the trial court asserting error at trial as follows:\n\n* * * [T]he attached documents (Exhibits 1-7 of the attached appendix) are of the Defendant\u2019s misbeliefs that the Identity of the \u201cBLOOD ON IT\u201d evidence to convict had already been identified; however, the identity whatof [sic], in violation of Crim.R. 16, is being withheld. To wit: Discovered at time of Recent appeal 2020-CA-28370\n\n* * * For reasons of gross ineffective assistance of appointed appellate counsel, at [the] time of Defendant\u2019s direct appeal * * * The Defendant is asking this Court to find that appointed counsel, many years experienced, allowed the State\u2019s \u201cBlood on it\u201d evidence inadmissible, to be presented to the Defendant\u2019s Trial Jury; resulting, pursuant Crim.R. 52(B)\n\n1 State v. DeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28370, 2020-Ohio-2850.\nPLAIN ERROR \u2013 REVERSIBLE ERROR.\n\n\u00b6 4 On December 9, 2020, DeVaughns filed a motion asking the trial court, \u201cpursuant to Evid.R. 601(A): to find that the testimony given while experiencing heavy influences of heroin and crack-cocaine, self-admittedly, of the State\u2019s sole Plaintiff, Lynelle V. Moore, to be inadmissible pursuant Ohio Evid. R. 601 (A).\u201d We note that Evid.R. 601 sets forth a general rule of competency for witnesses.\n\n\u00b6 5 Finally, on January 5, 2021, DeVaughns filed a \u201cmotion to remand,\u201d asserting that, at his resentencing on remand, his trial and appellate counsel \u201cwere self-made unavailable to the trial court and to the Defendant.\u201d He seemed to ask to be resentenced again, with defense counsel required to appear. DeVaughns\u2019s motion relied on R.C. 2951.03(B)(2), which provides: \u201cPrior to sentencing, the court shall permit the defendant and the defendant\u2019s counsel to comment on the presentence investigation report and, in its discretion, may permit the defendant and the defendant\u2019s counsel to introduce testimony or other information that relates to any alleged factual inaccuracy contained in the report.\u201d DeVaughns attached a portion of our opinion in State v. DeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22349, 2008-Ohio-4010. In that appeal from DeVaughns\u2019s resentencing, we held that \u201cno reasonable argument can be made that the trial court erred by proceeding with the re-sentencing hearing, because the record reflects that DeVaughns voluntarily chose to proceed with [an associate of his original appellate counsel] representing him at the hearing.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 30.\n\n\u00b6 6 In its decision overruling all of DeVaughns\u2019s motions, the trial court simply stated that the motions were \u201cnot well taken.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 7 DeVaughns asserts two issues for review in his brief. In his first argument,\nhe asserts that one of the witnesses at his trial, Lynelle Moore, was under the influence of drugs when she testified against him, that her testimony was accordingly inadmissible, and that he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. In his second argument, DeVaughns asserts that, at the time of the kidnapping of which he was convicted, \u201celse where\u201d and had an exculpatory alibi. DeVaughns does not raise any argument with respect to the denial of his first motion.\n\n\u00b6 8 The State responds that DeVaughns\u2019s claims in this appeal are barred by res judicata and by the law of the case. The State directs our attention to State v. DeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24631, 2012-Ohio-5791, and State v. DeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27727, 2018-Ohio-1421. We agree with the State.\n\n\u00b6 9 In State v. DeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24631, 2012-Ohio-5791, \u00b6 8, we stated:\n\n* * * DeVaughns herein for the first time asserts multiple arguments related to his trial. For example, his second, third, fourth, eighth and tenth assigned errors are directed to the trial testimony of the victim herein, Lynelle Moore, and her sister, Katrina Moore, whose credibility DeVaughns contests. DeVaughns' fifth assignment of error is addressed to the trial court's failure to instruct the jury regarding his purported alibi. In his seventh assigned error, he asserts that \u201cblood samples\u201d admitted at trial\n\n---\n\n2 We note that DeVaughns did not raise the issue of his alleged alibi defense in the motions he filed in the trial court.\n\n3 These assigned errors were identified as follows: \u201cLynelle Moore, Katrina Moore Brooks, Under the Influence of Drugs\u201d; \u201cPerjured Testimony, State Witness, Lynelle Moore\u201d; \u201cAssistant Prosecutor Failed to Correct Perjured Testimony\u201d; \u201cPerjury Ohio Revised Code R.C. 2921.11(a)\u201d; and \u201cWitness Misconduct, Complaining State Witness, Lynelle Moore.\u201d\nwere inadmissible. In his ninth assignment of error, he asserts that \u201cjuror misconduct\u201d occurred. \u201cUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars the convicted defendant from raising and litigating in any proceeding, except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial which resulted in that judgment of conviction or on an appeal from that judgment.\u201d State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967). Devaughns\u2019 second, third, fourth, fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth assigned errors are barred by the doctrine of res judicata and overruled.\n\n(Footnote added.)\n\n\u00b6 10 In State v. DeVaughns, 2018-Ohio-1421, we held that \u201cthe blood evidence issue raised in DeVaughns\u2019 motion for new trial was barred by the doctrine of res judicata, as he could have raised that issue in his direct appeal and raised similar issues\u201d in State v. DeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24631, 2012-Ohio-5791, and State v. DeVaughns, 2017-Ohio-475, 84 N.E.3d 332 (2d Dist.). Id. at \u00b6 21. We also concluded that our decision in State v. DeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23720, 2011-Ohio-125, \u201cremain[ed] the law of the case, thus rendering any challenge DeVaughns may have\nto that decision without merit.\"4  *DeVaughns*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27727, 2018-Ohio-1421, \u00b6 24. In *DeVaughns*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23720, 2011-Ohio-125, we stated that a witness letter stating that DeVaughns picked up his child from a daycare facility while he was allegedly restraining Moore was not newly discovered evidence warranting a new trial, and that the substance of the letter was admitted as a stipulation at the original trial. *Id.* at \u00b6 22-23.\n\n{\u00b6 11} As the State correctly asserts, this Court has previously addressed all of DeVaughns\u2019s arguments and rejected them; they were thus barred by the doctrines of res judicata and the law of the case. The trial court properly overruled his motions.\n\n{\u00b6 12} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\nHALL, J. and WELBAUM, J., concur.\n\nCopies sent to:\n\nMathias H.

Mobley, Jr., pro se. \n          \nAPPEAL from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas \nSADLER, J. \n{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Alphonso D. Mobley, Jr., appeals from a judgment of \nthe Franklin County Court of Common Pleas denying his motion to withdraw his guilty \nplea.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm. \nI.  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{\u00b6 2} On April 15, 2016, a Franklin County  Grand Jury indicted appellant on \ncharges of aggravated arson, in violation of R.C. 2909.02, a felony of the first degree; \ncriminal use of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon or explosive, in \nviolation of R.C. 2909.27, a felony of the second degree; criminal possession of chemical, \nbiological, radiological, or nucl ear weapon or explosive, in violation of R.C. 2909.26, a \nfelony of the third degree; illegal assembly or possession of chemicals or substances for the No. 18AP-23 2 \n \n \n \nmanufacture of a chemical weapon, biological weapon, radiological or nuclear weapon or \nexplosive device, in violation of R.C. 2909.28, a felony of the fourth degree; and illegally \nmanufacturing or possessing explosives, in violation of R.C. 2923.17, a felony of the second \ndegree.  A mandatory R.C. 2941.141 firearm specification attached to each of the above-\nreferenced charges in the indictment.  The indictment also contained an unspecified count \nfor having weapons while under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13, a felony of the third \ndegree. \n{\u00b6 3} Appellant subsequently entered a plea agreement whereby he pleaded guilty \nto aggravated arson with a firearm specification and criminal use of an explosive device.  \nThe parties jointly recommended a prison term of 14 years.  On application of the \nprosecutor, the trial court ordered a nolle pr osequi as to the remaining counts in the \nindictment. \n{\u00b6 4} On May 1, 2017, the trial court convicted appellant and sentenced him to ten \nyears in prison for aggravated arson, plus a mandatory one-year prison term for the firearm \nspecification and three years in prison for criminal use of an explosive device.  The trial \ncourt ordered appellant to serve the prison terms for the two convictions consecutive to \neach other and consecutive to the firearm specification, for an aggregate prison term of 14 \nyears.  Appellant did not appeal the judgment of conviction and sentence. \n{\u00b6 5} On October 25, 2017, appellant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea \npursuant to Crim.R. 32.1.  In his affidavit in support of the motion, appellant averred that \nhis plea was \"involuntary and unknowingly made,\" the prosecutor committed misconduct \nby \"misrepresentations in presenting an illusory promise in an agreement that \nrecommended an illegal sentence,\" and his trial counsel was \"ineffective in not evaluating \nthe application of the sentence.\"  (Appellant's Aff. at \u00b6 2-4, attached to Mot. to Withdraw \nGuilty Plea.)  The substance of appellant's argument in support of his motion to withdraw \nhis guilty plea is that the convictions of aggravated arson and criminal use of an explosive \ndevice were allied offenses of similar import and that R.C. 2941.25 required the trial court \nto merge the two counts for purposes of conviction and sentence. \n{\u00b6 6} The trial court found that res judicata barred appellant from raising the \nmerger argument underlying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because that argument \ncould have been raised in a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence.  In No. 18AP-23 3 \n \n \n \nthe alternative, the trial court determined that appellant did not allege facts in his motion \nwhich would support a finding of manifest injustice, prosecutorial misconduct, or \nineffective assistance of trial counsel.  Ac cordingly, the trial court denied the motion \nwithout an evidentiary hearing. \n{\u00b6 7} Appellant timely appealed to this court from the judgment of the trial court. \nII.  ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR \n{\u00b6 8} Appellant assigns the following as trial court error: \n[1.]  Trial court abused its discretion when it denied petitioner \nmotion to withdraw on grounds was not allied offenses of \nsimilar import. \n \n[2.]  Trial court abused its discretion when it denied petitioners \n[sic] motion of [sic] withdraw on grounds of res judicata. \n \n[3.]  Trial court abused its discretion when it denied motion to \nwithdraw without a hearing. \n \n[4.]  Trial court abused its discretion when it denied motion to \nwithdraw on grounds that counsel is not ineffective. \n \n[5.]  Trial court abused its discretion when it denied motion to \nwithdraw on grounds: no manifest injustice. \n \nIII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n{\u00b6 9} Pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1, \"post-sentence motions to withdraw guilty pleas \nare subject to a manifest injustice standard.\"  State v. Muhumed, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-1001, \n2012-Ohio-6155, \u00b6 8, citing State v. Oluoch, 10th Dist. No. 07AP-45, 2007-Ohio-5560, \u00b6 9, \nciting State v. Xie, 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 526 (1992).  \"An appellate court will not reverse a trial \ncourt's denial of a motion to withdraw a plea absent an abuse of discretion.\"  Muhumed at \n\u00b6 8, citing State v. Totten, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-278, 2005-Ohio-6210, \u00b6 5.  Where, however, \nthe issue is the applicability of res judicata, which is a question of law, an appellate court \nconducts a de novo review.  Muhumed at \u00b6 11. \nIV.  LEGAL ANALYSIS \nA.  Appellant's Second Assignment of Error \n{\u00b6 10} Because we find that our resolution of appellant's second assignment of error \nimpacts our ruling on each of appellant's other assignments of error, we will consider it No. 18AP-23 4 \n \n \n \nfirst.  In appellant's second assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court abused \nits discretion when it denied appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea on grounds of \nres judicata.  We disagree. \n{\u00b6 11} Appellant's primary argument in support of his motion to withdraw his guilty \nplea is grounded on R.C. 2941.25, which applies to multiple count indictments and provides \nas follows: \n(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed \nto constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the \nindictment or information may contain counts for all such \noffenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one. \n \n(B) Where the defendant's conduct constitutes two or more \noffenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in \ntwo or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed \nseparately or with a separate animus as to each, the \nindictment or information may contain counts for all such \noffenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them. \n \n{\u00b6 12} Appellant claims that the two counts in the indictment to which he pleaded \nguilty, aggravated arson and criminal use of an explosive device, are allied offenses of \nsimilar import and that R.C. 2941.25 required the trial court to merge the two counts for \npurposes of conviction and sentence.  The trial court concluded that res judicata barred \nappellant's merger argument.  We agree with the trial court. \n{\u00b6 13} \"Motions to withdraw guilty pleas are governed by Crim.R. 32.1, which \np r o v i de s tha t the  mo tio n  'ma y b e ma de o n l y before sentence is imposed; but to correct \nmanifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and \npermit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.' \"  State v. Spivakov, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-\n32, 2013-Ohio-3343, \u00b6 9, quoting Crim.R. 32 .1.  Manifest injustice relates to some \nfundamental flaw in the proceedings which results in a miscarriage of justice or is \ninconsistent with the demands of due process.  Id. at \u00b6 10, citing State v. Williams, 10th \nDist. No. 03AP-1214, 2004-Ohio-6123, \u00b6 5.  \" ' \"[I]t is clear that under such standard, a \npostsentence withdrawal motion is allowable only in extraordinary cases.\" ' \"  Spivakov at \n\u00b6 10, quoting State v. Gripper, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-1186, 2011-Ohio-3656, \u00b6 7, quoting State \nv. Smith, 49 Ohio St.2d 261, 264 (1977). No. 18AP-23 5 \n \n \n \n{\u00b6 14} \"Under the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a \nconvicted defendant who was represented by co unsel from raising and litigating in any \nproceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due \nprocess that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which \nresulted in that judgment of conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.\"  (Emphasis \nomitted.)  State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175 (1967), paragraph nine of the syllabus.  \" ' \"[R]es \njudicata promotes the principles of finality and judicial economy by preventing endless \nrelitigation of an issue on which a defendant has already received a full and fair opportunity \nto be heard.\" ' \"  State v. Walden, 3d Dist. No. 4-15-13, 2016-Ohio-258, \u00b6 19, quoting State \nv. Schwieterman, 3d Dist. No. 10-09-12, 2010-Ohio-102, \u00b6 23, quoting State v. Saxon, 109 \nOhio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, \u00b6 18.  Consistent with these principles, this court has \nrepeatedly held that res judicata bars a party from raising issues in a postsentencing \nCrim.R. 32.1 motion that were or could have been raised in a direct appeal.  State v. Ikharo, \n10th Dist. No. 10AP-967, 2011-Ohio-2746, \u00b6 11; State v. Hagler, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-291, \n2010-Ohio-6123; State v. Conteh , 10th Dist. No. 09AP-490, 2009-Ohio-6780; State v. \nHazel, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-1002, 2009-Ohio-2144. \n{\u00b6 15} When we apply the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Ohio in State v. \nUnderwood, 124 Ohio St.3d 365, 2010-Ohio-1, to th e facts of this case, we conclude that \nappellant could have raised in a direct appeal from his conviction and sentence the very \nsame merger argument he now makes in support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  \nIn Underwood, a grand jury indicted Underwood on two counts of aggravated theft and \ntwo counts of theft.  Underwood agreed to plead no contest to all four counts in exchange \nfor receiving a prison term of no more than two years.  In its written sentencing \nrecommendation, the state noted that the two counts in each of the different categories of \nthefts would be considered allied offenses of similar import.  However, at sentencing, no \ndiscussion was held regarding allied offenses, and the trial court convicted Underwood of \nall four counts and imposed a two-year prison sentence for each conviction.  The trial court \nordered all the sentences to be served concurrently for a total prison term of two years.  Id. \nat \u00b6 2-6. \n{\u00b6 16} Underwood appealed, arguing the trial court committed plain error by \nconvicting him of allied offenses of similar import and imposing multiple sentences.  The No. 18AP-23 6 \n \n \n \nSecond District Court of Appeals agreed with Underwood and reversed the conviction.  The \nstate then appealed the decision to the Supreme Court on the following issue: \"Is an agreed \nand jointly recommended sentence 'authorized by law' under R.C. 2953.08(D)(1), and thus \nnot reviewable, when the agreed sentence includes convictions for offenses that are allied \noffenses of similar import?\"  Id. at \u00b6 9.  The Supreme Court answered the question in the \nnegative and affirmed the decision of the Second District.  Id. at \u00b6 33. \n{\u00b6 17} In so ruling, the Supreme Court stated: \n[A] trial court is prohibited from imposing individual sentences \nfor counts that constitute allied offenses of similar import.  A \ndefendant's plea to multiple counts does not affect the court's \nduty to merge those allied counts at sentencing.  This duty is \nmandatory, not discretionary. Therefore, we conclude that \nwhen a sentence is imposed on multiple counts that are allied \noffenses of similar import in violation of R.C. 2941.25(A), R.C. \n2953.08(D) does not bar appellate review of that sentence even \nthough it was jointly recommended by the parties and imposed \nby the court. \n \nId. at \u00b6 26. \n{\u00b6 18} The Underwood court explained that R.C. 2941.25, in essence, codifies the \ndouble jeopardy protections of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and, \nthus, must be considered as an exception to R.C. 2953.08(D)(1).1  Id. at \u00b6 23-26. \n{\u00b6 19} Pursuant to the decision of the Supreme Court in Underwood, there can be \nno doubt that appellant could have raised the merger argument he advanced in his Crim.R. \n32.1 motion in a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence.  This is true \neven though the merger issue was not raised at sentencing.  Id.  Consequently, res judicata \nbarred appellant from raising the merger argument in his subsequent Crim.R. 32.1 motion \nto withdraw his guilty plea.  Id.  See also State v. Jefferson, 2d Dist. No. 26022, 2014-Ohio-\n2555, \u00b6 8 (because the failure to merge allied offenses does not render a judgment void, but \nvoidable, a Crim.R. 32.1 challenge to the trial court's failure to merge allied offenses is \nbarred by the doctrine of res judicata); State v. Askew, 5th Dist. No. 2015CA00034, 2015-\nOhio-4125, \u00b6 16 (res judicata barred appellant's Crim.R. 32.1 motion based on his claim that \n                                                   \n1 R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) provides that \"[a] sentence imposed upon a defendant is not subject to review under this \nsection if the sentence is authorized by law, has been recommended jointly by the defendant and the \nprosecution in the case, and is imposed by a sentencing judge.\" No. 18AP-23 7 \n \n \n \ntrial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a merger argument at sentencing).  See also \nWalden at \u00b6 20. \n{\u00b6 20} For the foregoing reasons, we hold the trial court did not err when it \nconcluded that res judicata barred appellant's merger argument in support of his Crim.R. \n3 2 . 1  m o t i o n  t o  w i t h d r a w  h i s  g u i l t y  p l e a .   A c c o r d i n g l y ,  a p p e l l a n t ' s  s e c o n d  a s s i g n m e n t  o f \nerror is overruled. \n B.  Appellant's First and Fifth Assignments of Error \n{\u00b6 21} In appellant's first and fifth assignments of error, appellant makes the same \nmerger argument we addressed in connection with appellant's second assignment of error.  \nIn each of these assignments of error, appellant claims that manifest injustice occurred \nwhen he was convicted of aggravated arson and criminal use of an explosive device because \nthose two counts in the indictment are allied offenses of similar import. \n{\u00b6 22} As we determined in connection with appellant's second assignment of error, \nres judicata barred appellant from raising the merger argument in support of his motion to \nwithdraw his guilty plea because appellant could have raised that argument in a direct \nappeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence.  Moreover, even if res judicata did \nnot bar appellant from raising a merger argument in support of his Crim.R. 32.1 motion to \nwithdraw his guilty plea, \"[a] defendant seeking to withdraw a post-sentence guilty plea \nbears the burden of establishing a manifest injustice based on specific facts either contained \nin the record or supplied through affidavits attached to the motion.\"  State v. Barrett, 10th \nDist. No. 11AP-375, 2011-Ohio-4986, \u00b6 8. \n{\u00b6 23} State v. Ruff, 143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015-Ohio-995, sets forth the standard to \napply to merger determinations under R.C. 2941.25: \nAs a practical matter, when determining whether offenses are \nallied offenses of similar import within the meaning of R.C. \n2941.25, courts must ask three questions when defendant's \nconduct supports multiple offenses : (1) Were the offenses \ndissimilar in import or significance? (2) Were they committed \nseparately? and (3) Were they committed with separate animus \nor motivation?  An affirmative answer to any of the above will \npermit separate convictions.  The conduct, the animus, and the \nimport must all be considered. \n \n(Emphasis added.)  Id. at \u00b6 31. No. 18AP-23 8 \n \n \n \n{\u00b6 24} Here, appellant's affidavit attached as an exhibit to his motion to withdraw \nhis guilty plea does not provide any information regarding the conduct underlying the \nconvictions.  Appellant did not file a copy of the transcript of the plea hearing or the \nsentencing hearing with his motion.  Additionally, we note that the only relevant factual \ninformation that may be gleaned from the indictment is that appellant committed the two \noffenses at issue on the same date.  The trial court concluded that \"Defendant's crimes (F1 \nAggravated arson with firearm specification, and F2 Criminal Use of an Explosive Device) \nare not allied offenses of similar import.\"  (Dec. 15, 2017 Entry at 3.)  The trial judge who \nissued the judgment of conviction and sentence in this case is the same trial judge who \ndenied appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea. \n{\u00b6 25} On this record, we have no basis on which to question the trial court's \ndetermination that the count in the indictment charging appellant with aggravated arson \ndid not merge with the count charging appellant with criminal use of an explosive device \nfor purposes of conviction and sentence.  Accordingly, appellant's first and fifth \nassignments of error are overruled. \nC.  Appellant's Fourth Assignment of Error \n{\u00b6 26} In his fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that his trial counsel \nprovided ineffective assistance by failing to make the merger argument at sentencing.  We \ndisagree. \n{\u00b6 27} In the Askew case, the Fifth District Court of Appeals held that res judicata \nbarred appellant's Crim.R. 32.1  motion alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel \nbecause appellant could have raised his argument in a direct appeal from his conviction and \nsentence.  In Askew, as in this case, appellant pleaded guilty to multiple counts in the \nindictment.  The trial court convicted appellant of each of the counts to which he pleaded \nguilty and imposed multiple prison terms.  Appellant did not appeal from his conviction \nand sentence but later filed a motion to withdraw his plea pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1.  As is \nthe case herein, appellant in Askew claimed that his trial counsel provided ineffective \nassistance by failing to argue at the sentencing hearing that R.C. 2941.25 precluded a \nconviction of multiple counts.  The Fifth District held that res judicata barred appellant's \nineffective assistance claim.  Id. at \u00b6 16. No. 18AP-23 9 \n \n \n \n{\u00b6 28} We agree with the reasoning employed by the Fifth District.  Accordingly, we \nhold the trial court did not err when it determined that res judicata barred appellant from \nraising his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in support of his motion to \nwithdraw his guilty plea.  Moreover, the trial court found that appellant's claim of \nineffective assistance of trial counsel was \"wholly unsupported by the record, and * * * \nentirely meritless.\"  (Dec. 15, 2017 Entry at 3.)  As noted in connection with appellant's first \nand fifth assignments of error, appellant failed to file the transcript of his plea hearing or \nhis sentencing hearing.  Consequently, even if res judicata did not bar appellant from \nraising ineffective assistance of counsel as a basis to withdraw his guilty plea, there is \ninsufficient evidence in the record for this court to determine the merits of appellant's \nclaim. \n{\u00b6 29} For the foregoing reasons, appellant's fourth assignment of error is overruled. \nD.  Appellant's Third Assignment of Error \n{\u00b6 30} In his third assignment of error, appellant argues the trial court abused its \ndiscretion when it denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea without first conducting \nan evidentiary hearing.  We disagree. \n{\u00b6 31} A trial court is not automatically required to hold a hearing on a postsentence \nmotion to withdraw a guilty plea.  Barrett at \u00b6 9.  A hearing must only be held if the facts \nalleged by the defendant, accepted as true, would require that the defendant be allowed to \nwithdraw the plea.  Id.  As previously noted, appellant's affidavit in support of his motion \ndid not contain information regarding the conduct underlying the offenses to which he \npleaded guilty.  Thus, the facts alleged by th e appellant, if accepted as true, would not \nsupport his merger argument.  Moreover, the re cord evidences the fact that res judicata \nbarred appellant from raising a merger argument in his Crim.R. 32.1 motion.  \nConsequently, even if appellant had alleged sufficient facts to support a merger argument, \nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion without a hearing.  Walden \nat \u00b6 20-21 (because appellant \"could have raised his claims relating to R.C. 2941.25 and \nCrim.R. 11 on direct appeal[,] * * * we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion \nin denying [appellant's] post-sentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea without a \nhearing\"). \n{\u00b6 32} For the foregoing reasons, appellant's third assignment of error is overruled. No. 18AP-23 10 \n \n \n \nV.

Mobley, Jr., appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b6 2 On April 15, 2016, a Franklin County Grand Jury indicted appellant on charges of aggravated arson, in violation of R.C. 2909.02, a felony of the first degree; criminal use of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon or explosive, in violation of R.C. 2909.27, a felony of the second degree; criminal possession of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon or explosive, in violation of R.C. 2909.26, a felony of the third degree; illegal assembly or possession of chemicals or substances for the\nmanufacture of a chemical weapon, biological weapon, radiological or nuclear weapon or explosive device, in violation of R.C. 2909.28, a felony of the fourth degree; and illegally manufacturing or possessing explosives, in violation of R.C. 2923.17, a felony of the second degree. A mandatory R.C. 2941.141 firearm specification attached to each of the above-referenced charges in the indictment. The indictment also contained an unspecified count for having weapons while under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13, a felony of the third degree.\n\n\u00b6 3 Appellant subsequently entered a plea agreement whereby he pleaded guilty to aggravated arson with a firearm specification and criminal use of an explosive device. The parties jointly recommended a prison term of 14 years. On application of the prosecutor, the trial court ordered a nolle prosequi as to the remaining counts in the indictment.\n\n\u00b6 4 On May 1, 2017, the trial court convicted appellant and sentenced him to ten years in prison for aggravated arson, plus a mandatory one-year prison term for the firearm specification and three years in prison for criminal use of an explosive device. The trial court ordered appellant to serve the prison terms for the two convictions consecutive to each other and consecutive to the firearm specification, for an aggregate prison term of 14 years. Appellant did not appeal the judgment of conviction and sentence.\n\n\u00b6 5 On October 25, 2017, appellant filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1. In his affidavit in support of the motion, appellant averred that his plea was \"involuntary and unknowingly made,\" the prosecutor committed misconduct by \"misrepresentations in presenting an illusory promise in an agreement that recommended an illegal sentence,\" and his trial counsel was \"ineffective in not evaluating the application of the sentence.\" (Appellant's Aff. at \u00b6 2-4, attached to Mot. to Withdraw Guilty Plea.) The substance of appellant's argument in support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea is that the convictions of aggravated arson and criminal use of an explosive device were allied offenses of similar import and that R.C. 2941.25 required the trial court to merge the two counts for purposes of conviction and sentence.\n\n\u00b6 6 The trial court found that res judicata barred appellant from raising the merger argument underlying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because that argument could have been raised in a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence. In\nthe alternative, the trial court determined that appellant did not allege facts in his motion which would support a finding of manifest injustice, prosecutorial misconduct, or ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Accordingly, the trial court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing.\n\n\u00b6 7 Appellant timely appealed to this court from the judgment of the trial court.\n\nII. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n\u00b6 8 Appellant assigns the following as trial court error:\n\n[1.] Trial court abused its discretion when it denied petitioner motion to withdraw on grounds was not allied offenses of similar import.\n\n[2.] Trial court abused its discretion when it denied petitioners [sic] motion of [sic] withdraw on grounds of res judicata.\n\n[3.] Trial court abused its discretion when it denied motion to withdraw without a hearing.\n\n[4.] Trial court abused its discretion when it denied motion to withdraw on grounds that counsel is not ineffective.\n\n[5.] Trial court abused its discretion when it denied motion to withdraw on grounds: no manifest injustice.\n\nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\u00b6 9 Pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1, \"post-sentence motions to withdraw guilty pleas are subject to a manifest injustice standard.\" State v. Muhumed, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-1001, 2012-Ohio-6155, \u00b6 8, citing State v. Oluoch, 10th Dist. No. 07AP-45, 2007-Ohio-5560, \u00b6 9, citing State v. Xie, 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 526 (1992). \"An appellate court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a plea absent an abuse of discretion.\" Muhumed at \u00b6 8, citing State v. Totten, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-278, 2005-Ohio-6210, \u00b6 5. Where, however, the issue is the applicability of res judicata, which is a question of law, an appellate court conducts a de novo review. Muhumed at \u00b6 11.\n\nIV. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\nA. Appellant's Second Assignment of Error\n\n\u00b6 10 Because we find that our resolution of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error impacts our ruling on each of appellant\u2019s other assignments of error, we will consider it\nfirst. In appellant's second assignment of error, appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion when it denied appellant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea on grounds of res judicata. We disagree.\n\n\u00b6 11 Appellant's primary argument in support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea is grounded on R.C. 2941.25, which applies to multiple count indictments and provides as follows:\n\n(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.\n\n(B) Where the defendant's conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\n\n\u00b6 12 Appellant claims that the two counts in the indictment to which he pleaded guilty, aggravated arson and criminal use of an explosive device, are allied offenses of similar import and that R.C. 2941.25 required the trial court to merge the two counts for purposes of conviction and sentence. The trial court concluded that res judicata barred appellant's merger argument. We agree with the trial court.\n\n\u00b6 13 \"Motions to withdraw guilty pleas are governed by Crim.R. 32.1, which provides that the motion 'may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.' \" State v. Spivakov, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-32, 2013-Ohio-3343, \u00b6 9, quoting Crim.R. 32.1. Manifest injustice relates to some fundamental flaw in the proceedings which results in a miscarriage of justice or is inconsistent with the demands of due process. Id. at \u00b6 10, citing State v. Williams, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1214, 2004-Ohio-6123, \u00b6 5. \" ' '[I]t is clear that under such standard, a postsentence withdrawal motion is allowable only in extraordinary cases.' ' \" Spivakov at \u00b6 10, quoting State v. Gripper, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-1186, 2011-Ohio-3656, \u00b6 7, quoting State v. Smith, 49 Ohio St.2d 261, 264 (1977).\n\"Under the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.\" (Emphasis omitted.) State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175 (1967), paragraph nine of the syllabus. \"'Res judicata promotes the principles of finality and judicial economy by preventing endless relitigation of an issue on which a defendant has already received a full and fair opportunity to be heard.'\" State v. Walden, 3d Dist. No. 4-15-13, 2016-Ohio-258, \u00b6 19, quoting State v. Schwieterman, 3d Dist. No. 10-09-12, 2010-Ohio-102, \u00b6 23, quoting State v. Saxon, 109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, \u00b6 18. Consistent with these principles, this court has repeatedly held that res judicata bars a party from raising issues in a postsentencing Crim.R. 32.1 motion that were or could have been raised in a direct appeal. State v. Ikharo, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-967, 2011-Ohio-2746, \u00b6 11; State v. Hagler, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-291, 2010-Ohio-6123; State v. Conteh, 10th Dist. No. 09AP-490, 2009-Ohio-6780; State v. Hazel, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-1002, 2009-Ohio-2144.\n\nWhen we apply the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Ohio in State v. Underwood, 124 Ohio St.3d 365, 2010-Ohio-1, to the facts of this case, we conclude that appellant could have raised in a direct appeal from his conviction and sentence the very same merger argument he now makes in support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In Underwood, a grand jury indicted Underwood on two counts of aggravated theft and two counts of theft. Underwood agreed to plead no contest to all four counts in exchange for receiving a prison term of no more than two years. In its written sentencing recommendation, the state noted that the two counts in each of the different categories of thefts would be considered allied offenses of similar import. However, at sentencing, no discussion was held regarding allied offenses, and the trial court convicted Underwood of all four counts and imposed a two-year prison sentence for each conviction. The trial court ordered all the sentences to be served concurrently for a total prison term of two years. Id. at \u00b6 2-6.\n\nUnderwood appealed, arguing the trial court committed plain error by convicting him of allied offenses of similar import and imposing multiple sentences. The\nSecond District Court of Appeals agreed with Underwood and reversed the conviction. The state then appealed the decision to the Supreme Court on the following issue: \"Is an agreed and jointly recommended sentence 'authorized by law' under R.C. 2953.08(D)(1), and thus not reviewable, when the agreed sentence includes convictions for offenses that are allied offenses of similar import?\" *Id.* at \u00b6 9. The Supreme Court answered the question in the negative and affirmed the decision of the Second District. *Id.* at \u00b6 33.\n\n\u00b6 17 In so ruling, the Supreme Court stated:\n\n[A] trial court is prohibited from imposing individual sentences for counts that constitute allied offenses of similar import. A defendant's plea to multiple counts does not affect the court's duty to merge those allied counts at sentencing. This duty is mandatory, not discretionary. Therefore, we conclude that when a sentence is imposed on multiple counts that are allied offenses of similar import in violation of R.C. 2941.25(A), R.C. 2953.08(D) does not bar appellate review of that sentence even though it was jointly recommended by the parties and imposed by the court.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 26.\n\n\u00b6 18 The *Underwood* court explained that R.C. 2941.25, in essence, codifies the double jeopardy protections of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and, thus, must be considered as an exception to R.C. 2953.08(D)(1).1 *Id.* at \u00b6 23-26.\n\n\u00b6 19 Pursuant to the decision of the Supreme Court in *Underwood*, there can be no doubt that appellant could have raised the merger argument he advanced in his Crim.R. 32.1 motion in a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence. This is true even though the merger issue was not raised at sentencing. *Id.* Consequently, res judicata barred appellant from raising the merger argument in his subsequent Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty plea. *Id.* See also *State v. Jefferson*, 2d Dist. No. 26022, 2014-Ohio-2555, \u00b6 8 (because the failure to merge allied offenses does not render a judgment void, but voidable, a Crim.R. 32.1 challenge to the trial court's failure to merge allied offenses is barred by the doctrine of res judicata); *State v. Askew*, 5th Dist. No. 2015CA00034, 2015-Ohio-4125, \u00b6 16 (res judicata barred appellant's Crim.R. 32.1 motion based on his claim that\n\n---\n\n1 R.C. 2953.08(D)(1) provides that \"[a] sentence imposed upon a defendant is not subject to review under this section if the sentence is authorized by law, has been recommended jointly by the defendant and the prosecution in the case, and is imposed by a sentencing judge.\"\ntrial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a merger argument at sentencing). See also Walden at \u00b6 20.\n\n\u00b6 20 For the foregoing reasons, we hold the trial court did not err when it concluded that res judicata barred appellant\u2019s merger argument in support of his Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\nB. Appellant\u2019s First and Fifth Assignments of Error\n\n\u00b6 21 In appellant\u2019s first and fifth assignments of error, appellant makes the same merger argument we addressed in connection with appellant\u2019s second assignment of error. In each of these assignments of error, appellant claims that manifest injustice occurred when he was convicted of aggravated arson and criminal use of an explosive device because those two counts in the indictment are allied offenses of similar import.\n\n\u00b6 22 As we determined in connection with appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, res judicata barred appellant from raising the merger argument in support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because appellant could have raised that argument in a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence. Moreover, even if res judicata did not bar appellant from raising a merger argument in support of his Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty plea, \u201c[a] defendant seeking to withdraw a post-sentence guilty plea bears the burden of establishing a manifest injustice based on specific facts either contained in the record or supplied through affidavits attached to the motion.\u201d State v. Barrett, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-375, 2011-Ohio-4986, \u00b6 8.\n\n\u00b6 23 State v. Ruff, 143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015-Ohio-995, sets forth the standard to apply to merger determinations under R.C. 2941.25:\n\nAs a practical matter, when determining whether offenses are allied offenses of similar import within the meaning of R.C. 2941.25, courts must ask three questions when defendant\u2019s conduct supports multiple offenses: (1) Were the offenses dissimilar in import or significance? (2) Were they committed separately? and (3) Were they committed with separate animus or motivation? An affirmative answer to any of the above will permit separate convictions. The conduct, the animus, and the import must all be considered.\n\n(Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 31.\nHere, appellant\u2019s affidavit attached as an exhibit to his motion to withdraw his guilty plea does not provide any information regarding the conduct underlying the convictions. Appellant did not file a copy of the transcript of the plea hearing or the sentencing hearing with his motion. Additionally, we note that the only relevant factual information that may be gleaned from the indictment is that appellant committed the two offenses at issue on the same date. The trial court concluded that \"Defendant\u2019s crimes (F1 Aggravated arson with firearm specification, and F2 Criminal Use of an Explosive Device) are not allied offenses of similar import.\" (Dec. 15, 2017 Entry at 3.) The trial judge who issued the judgment of conviction and sentence in this case is the same trial judge who denied appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\nOn this record, we have no basis on which to question the trial court\u2019s determination that the count in the indictment charging appellant with aggravated arson did not merge with the count charging appellant with criminal use of an explosive device for purposes of conviction and sentence. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first and fifth assignments of error are overruled.\n\nC. Appellant\u2019s Fourth Assignment of Error\n\nIn his fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to make the merger argument at sentencing. We disagree.\n\nIn the Askew case, the Fifth District Court of Appeals held that res judicata barred appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 32.1 motion alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel because appellant could have raised his argument in a direct appeal from his conviction and sentence. In Askew, as in this case, appellant pleaded guilty to multiple counts in the indictment. The trial court convicted appellant of each of the counts to which he pleaded guilty and imposed multiple prison terms. Appellant did not appeal from his conviction and sentence but later filed a motion to withdraw his plea pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1. As is the case herein, appellant in Askew claimed that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to argue at the sentencing hearing that R.C. 2941.25 precluded a conviction of multiple counts. The Fifth District held that res judicata barred appellant\u2019s ineffective assistance claim. Id. at \u00b6 16.\nWe agree with the reasoning employed by the Fifth District. Accordingly, we hold the trial court did not err when it determined that res judicata barred appellant from raising his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in support of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Moreover, the trial court found that appellant's claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel was \"wholly unsupported by the record, and * * * entirely meritless.\" (Dec. 15, 2017 Entry at 3.) As noted in connection with appellant's first and fifth assignments of error, appellant failed to file the transcript of his plea hearing or his sentencing hearing. Consequently, even if res judicata did not bar appellant from raising ineffective assistance of counsel as a basis to withdraw his guilty plea, there is insufficient evidence in the record for this court to determine the merits of appellant's claim.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, appellant's fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\nD. Appellant's Third Assignment of Error\n\nIn his third assignment of error, appellant argues the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea without first conducting an evidentiary hearing. We disagree.\n\nA trial court is not automatically required to hold a hearing on a postsentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea. Barrett at \u00b6 9. A hearing must only be held if the facts alleged by the defendant, accepted as true, would require that the defendant be allowed to withdraw the plea. Id. As previously noted, appellant's affidavit in support of his motion did not contain information regarding the conduct underlying the offenses to which he pleaded guilty. Thus, the facts alleged by the appellant, if accepted as true, would not support his merger argument. Moreover, the record evidences the fact that res judicata barred appellant from raising a merger argument in his Crim.R. 32.1 motion. Consequently, even if appellant had alleged sufficient facts to support a merger argument, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion without a hearing. Walden at \u00b6 20-21 (because appellant \"could have raised his claims relating to R.C. 2941.25 and Crim.R. 11 on direct appeal[,] * * * we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in denying [appellant's] post-sentence motion to withdraw his guilty plea without a hearing\").\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, appellant's third assignment of error is overruled.\nV. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 33 Having overruled appellant's five assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nKLATT and HORTON, JJ., concur."}

After the \nappeals were determined, appellant filed a sworn affidavit of the same juror, arguing it \nwas a substitute for the previous unsworn affidavit, and filed motions to amend and \nsupplement the motion for new trial.  The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for new trial Morgan County, Case No.  18 AP 0003 3\nbased upon juror misconduct, a decision we affirmed in State v. Shuster, 5th Dist. Morgan \nNo. 15AP0017, 2016-Ohio-5030 [Shuster III], appeal not allowed, 148 Ohio St.3d 1426, \n2017-Ohio-905, 71 N.E.3d 298.  \n{\u00b65} On February 20, 2014, appellant filed a petition for post-conviction relief \narguing defense trial counsel should have made better use of the defense psychological \nexpert, obtained a medical expert, and used a more experienced investigator.  The trial \ncourt dismissed appellant\u2019s petition without a hearing, a decision we affirmed in State v. \nShuster, 5th Dist. Morgan No. 14 AP 0003, 2014-Ohio-4144 [ Shuster II ], appeal not \nallowed, 142 Ohio St.3d 1409, 2015 -Ohio- 1099, 27 N.E.3d 539. \n{\u00b66} On October 26, 2016, appellant filed Defendant\u2019s Motion for Grand Jury \nTestimony and Evidence as well as Disclosure of Proceedings. \n{\u00b67} On November 4, 2016, appellant filed a Motion for Leave to File Motion for \nNew Trial Instanter with Verified Motion for New Trial premised upon allegations of \nprosecutorial misconduct and \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d by the trial court.  Appellee responded \nwith a memorandum in opposition on November 17, 2016, and the trial court overruled \nappellant\u2019s motion by judgment entries dated November 28, 2016 and December 7, 2016. \nThis Court affirmed the decision of the trial court in State v. Shuster, 5th Dist. Morgan No. \n16AP0012, 2017-Ohio-2776  [Shuster IV]. \n{\u00b68} On August 15, 2017, appellant filed an original action for mandamus with \nthis Court in case number 17AP0010. In said action, appellant argued the lower court \nfailed to make a ruling or decision on a motion, which he believes prevents him from \nappealing or moving the issue forward. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the action on Morgan County, Case No.  18 AP 0003 4\ngrounds that appellant did not state a claim upon which relief can be granted. This Court \ndismissed the mandamus action. \n{\u00b69} On February 16, 2018, appellant filed an appeal with this Court in case \nnumber 18AP0002. In said appeal, appellant challenged the decision by the trial court on \nthe denial of appellant's motion for a new trial on grounds for abuse of discretion. \nAppellant has not filed a brief in 18AP0002. \n{\u00b610} Appellant now appeals from the trial court\u2019s decision overruling his motion \nfor Grand Jury testimony.  \n{\u00b611} Appellant raises one assignment of error: \nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR \n{\u00b612} \u201cI.  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION; WHEN \nAFTER FAILIN [SIC] AND REFUSING TO EVEN RULE FOR OVER ONE YEAR, IT \nDENIED DEFENDANT'S PROPERLY FILED MOTION FOR GRAND JURY TESTIMONY \nAND EVIDENCE AS WELL AS DISCLOSURE OF PROCEEDINGS; AND ONLY SO \nRULING AFTER BEING ORDERED BY THIS COURT OF APPEALS, AFTER \nDEFENDANT WAS FORCED TO FILE A MANDAMUS ACTION; AND BY \nINCORRECTLY RULING THAT DEFENDANT FAILED TO SHOW A PARTICULARIZED \nNEED; WHEN, AT THE TIME OF RULING, DEFENDANT ACTUALLY HAD A PENDING \nMOTION FOR NEW TRIAL WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIAL COURT; AND \nALSO SHOWING FURTHER BIAS AND PREJUDICE BY CONTENDING THAT \nDEFENDANT WAS BEING OVERLY LITIGIOUS; WHILE SIMPLY EXERCISING HIS \nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, AND FURTHER CONTENDING THAT RES JUDICATA \nMITIGATES AGAINST DEFENDANT'S REQUEST FOR GRAND JURY DISCLOSURES, Morgan County, Case No.  18 AP 0003 5\nEVEN THOUGH THIS WAS HIS FIRST AND ONLY MOTION FILED ASKING FOR \nSUCH INFORMATION.\u201d \nI. \n{\u00b613} In appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error, he argues the trial court erred in \noverruling his motion for Grand Jury testimony.  We disagree. \n{\u00b614}  Ohio Crim.R. 6(E) provides, in part, that \u201c[d]eliberations of the grand jury \nand the vote of any grand juror shall not be disclosed.\u201d However, if the defense shows a \n\u201cparticularized need\u201d for disclosure that outweighs the need for secrecy, all relevant \nportions of a grand jury transcript should be produced. State v. Greer, 66 Ohio St.2d 139, \n420 N.E.2d 982 (1981), paragraph two of the syllabus. A \u201cparticularized need\u201d exists \n\u201cwhen the circumstances reveal a probability t hat the failure to provide the grand jury \ntestimony will deny the defendant a fair trial.\u201d State v. Davis, 38 Ohio St.3d 361, 365, 528 \nN.E.2d 925 (1988). A claim of particularized need cannot be replete with speculation and \ninnuendo. State v. Stojetz , 84 Ohio St.3d 452, 460, 1999\u2013Ohio\u2013464, 705 N.E.2d 329. \nImpeachment purposes may be a proper basis for disclosure of grand jury testimony, but \nthat purpose alone is not sufficient: the \u201cparticularized need\u201d standard must still be met. \nState v. Hernandez, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 87\u2013C\u201356, 1991 WL 44362, aff'd, 63 Ohio \nSt.3d 577, 589 N.E.2d 1310 (1992). \n{\u00b615} The decision whether to release grand jury testimony \u201cis within the \ndiscretion of the trial court.\u201d Greer, supra, at paragraph one of the syllabus. A decision to \ndeny release will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Brown, 38 Ohio \nSt.3d 305, 308, 528 N.E.2d 523 (1988). In order to find an abuse of discretion, the \nreviewing court must determine that the trial court's decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, Morgan County, Case No.  18 AP 0003 6\nor unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. Blakemore v. Blakemore, \n5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). \n{\u00b616} Upon review, in the instant case, we find the trial court did not abuse its \ndiscretion in overruling appellant's motion for disclosure of the grand jury testimony. \nAppellant's motion merely speculates that biased evidence may have been presented. As \nnoted in Hernandez, supra, a defendant must show a particularized need for disclosure \nbeyond the mere use of the grand jury testimony for impeachment purposes. Appellant \ndid not do so in the instant case. \n{\u00b617} We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in its decision overruling \nappellant\u2019s motion.  Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is overruled. \n{\u00b618} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of \nMorgan County, Ohio, is affirmed. \n \nBy: Wise, John, P.

The trial court sentenced appellant to an aggregate prison term of 105 years to life. Upon direct appeal, we affirmed the convictions and sentence. State v. Shuster, 5th Dist.

A comprehensive statement of the facts underlying appellant\u2019s convictions may be found in Shuster I.\n\n\u00b64 On June 5, 2013, appellant filed a motion for new trial based upon juror misconduct, to which was attached an unsworn affidavit of a juror. A hearing was held on July 5, 2013, but the trial court denied the motion on the basis that it had no jurisdiction to rule during the pendency of the appeals described supra. The trial court also found appellant failed to file an affidavit with the motion in violation of Crim.R. 33(C). After the appeals were determined, appellant filed a sworn affidavit of the same juror, arguing it was a substitute for the previous unsworn affidavit, and filed motions to amend and supplement the motion for new trial.

Morgan No. 16AP0012, 2017-Ohio-2776 [Shuster IV].\n\n{\u00b68} On August 15, 2017, appellant filed an original action for mandamus with this Court in case number 17AP0010.

We affirm the judgment of the trial court. \n{\u00b6 2}  Jackson was convicted in January 2011 of murder, aggravated bu rglary, \naggravated robbery, and a firearm specification.  He was senten ced to an aggregate \nterm of 28 years to life in prison.  We affirmed his conviction  on direct appeal, overruling \n11 assignments of error.  State v. Jackson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24430, 2012-Ohio-\n2335.  Since then, Jackson has pursued various avenues of relie f.  See State v. \nJackson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27272, 2017-Ohio-1304, \u00b6 3. \n{\u00b6 3} On October 27, 2017, acting pro se, Jackson filed a motion to dismiss and a \nnotice of his intent to renew his \u201cMotion for Acquittal; Motion to Dismiss.\u201d  The trial court \noverruled the motions, noting that the relief sought by Jackson  was similar to previous \nmotions before the court which had been overruled and that Jack son had presented no \nnew additional information for the court to consider. \n{\u00b6 4} On December 26, 2017, Jackson f iled a pro se motion asking the court to \nreconsider its previous decision overruling his \u201crenewed motion  to dismiss\u201d and to state \nits findings on the record.  The motion suggested that his spee dy trial rights had been \nviolated.  On January 9, 2018, Jackson filed a motion to dismis s the indictment, and on \nJanuary 11, 2018, he filed a motion for a new trial and a renew ed motion for acquittal.  \nThe January 11 motion included multiple attachments, including as Exhibit 01 an order  \n-3- \nfrom the Area One Court of Montgomery County, which was dated M arch 31, 2010, and \ncaptioned \u201cState of Ohio v. John Doe .\u201d  In the order, the Area One Court granted the \nmotion of the Trotwood Police Department for an order compellin g Cincinnati Bell \nWireless to produce all phone records pertaining to certain pho ne numbers, finding that \nthe records were \u201crelevant and material to an ongoing investiga tion of Aggravated \nMurder.\u201d  Cincinnati Bell Wireless was specifically ordered to produce the records to \nDetective Mike Pigman of the Trotwood Police Department. \n{\u00b6 5} In his supporting memorandum, Jackson asserted that the State h ad failed \nto obtain a search warrant before obtaining \u201chis call detail re cords containing Cell Site \nLocation Information (\u201cCSLI\u201d)\u201d and used the information from his phone records to obtain \nhis conviction.  Citing the testimony of Detective Pigman at tr ial, Jackson asserted that \nExhibit 01 had not been \u201cpart of discovery\u201d and that the exhibit established that \u201ca search \nand seizure ha[d] taken place.\u201d  A ccording to Jackson, disclosure of the phone records \nin discovery would have allowed trial counsel to review the pho ne records and to recall \nwitnesses \u201cto challenge their credibility, as to their actual l ocations during this crime.\u201d  \nJackson argued that the State used these phone records to place him in the vicinity of the \ncrime, \u201cwhich weighed heavily on the minds of the jurors.\u201d \n{\u00b6 6} Jackson also attached his own affidavit, in which he averred th at the State \nhad conducted an illegal search and seizure of his Cincinnati Bell Wireless phone records \nand had failed to provide documents related to that search (nam ely, the order requiring \nCincinnati Bell Wireless to provide the records to the Trotwood  Police Department) in its \ndiscovery.  Jackson also averred that the State \u201cconducted long  t e r m  \nmonitoring/tracking\u201d of him for more than 22 days and that it obtained the phone records  \n-4- \nwithout a warrant.  Further, Jackso n asserted in his affidavit that the State withheld the \nphone records in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d \n215 (1963).  According to Jackson, the State\u2019s disclosure of th e phone records for the \nfirst time on the last day of trial \u201cpresent[ed] an irregularity of proceedings\u201d and a \u201csurprise \nwhich ordinary prudence could not have guarded against,\u201d and th e State\u2019s misconduct \nrequired that the phone records be suppressed and a new trial or d e r e d .     \n{\u00b6 7} On January 18, 2018, Jackson moved to supplement his motion to reconsider \nand requested \u201cCrim.R. 12(F) Findings.\u201d   \n{\u00b6 8} On April 25, 2018, the court filed an order indicating its inte ntion to decide \nseveral pending matters and setting deadlines for the parties t o file their responses and \nreplies.  Jackson filed a reply to the court\u2019s order in May 2018.  In June 2018, the State \nfiled a memorandum contra Jackson\u2019s motion for new trial and/or  motion for acquittal, \narguing that the doctrine of res judicata barred Jackson\u2019s motions. \n{\u00b6 9} On April 16, 2020, Jackson filed a \u201cMotion to Correct an Illega l/Void \nSentence,\u201d and on May 26, 2020, Jackson filed a motion for leav e to supplement that \nmotion.   \n{\u00b6 10} On June 8, 2020, Jackson filed a motion to supplement his Janua ry 11, \n2018 motion for a new trial and a request for leave to file a delayed motion for a new trial.  \nIn his attached affidavit, he asserted that the State had withh eld the subpoena to \nCincinnati Bell Wireless \u201cknowingly and purposefully,\u201d knowing that it \u201cwas falsely \nobtained without [an] affidavit,\u201d and thereby prevented him dur ing trial, on appeal, and \n\u201cduring federal review\u201d from presenting evidence of an illegal search and seizure, perjured \ntestimony, and a Brady violation.  Jackson averred that an evidentiary hearing was  \n-5- \nrequired.  Jackson also attached various correspondence to him from the Law Director \nfor the City of Trotwood, from his (Jackson\u2019s) appellate counsel, from defense counsel at \ntrial, and from an Assistant State Public Defender.   \n{\u00b6 11} On December 11, 2020, the court denied Jackson\u2019s April 16, 2020, \u201cMotion \nto Correct an Illegal/Void Sentence\u201d and his May 26, 2020, motion for leave to supplement \nthat motion.  The court treated the motions as seeking postconv iction relief and \nconcluded that such relief was barred by res judicata.  (The tr ial court\u2019s judgment on \nthese matters is on appeal in a separate case, Montgomery App. No. 29001.)  The same \nday, the court overruled Jackson\u2019s December 26, 2017, motion as king the court to \nreconsider its previous decision overruling his \u201crenewed motion  to dismiss\u201d and his \nJanuary 11, 2018, motion for a new trial and renewed motion for  acquittal.  The court \ndetermined that the relief Jackson sought was similar to the re lief sought in his previous \nmotions before the court, which had already been overruled, and  that he had presented \nno new or additional information for the court to consider. \n{\u00b6 12} Jackson appeals pro se from the trial court\u2019s order overruling his \u201cMotion(s) \nfor New Trial/Acquittal and Motion(s) to Dismiss.\u201d  He raises t wo assignments of error, \nwhich we will consider together: \nJUDGE PARKER ABUSED HIS DISCRETION, AND ERRED WHEN \nHE OVERRULED APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL, BEFORE \nFINDING IF HE HAS PROVIDED CLEAR, AND CONVINCING PROOF \nTHAT HE WAS UNAVOIDABLY DELAYED IN SUBMITTING A TIMELY \nMOTION. \nDID JUDGE PARKER ABUSE HIS DISCRETION, HOLDING THAT  \n-6- \nAPPELLANT HAD PRESENTED NO NEW ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE FOR \nTHE COURT TO CONSIDER? \n{\u00b6 13} In his first assignment of error,  Jackson asserts that the tria l court \n\u201cerroneously ruled on his motion for a new trial\u201d before addressing his \u201cMotion for request \nof leave\u201d filed two years later.  He asserts that the court failed to rule on his June 8, 2020 \nmotion, which set forth the reasons for his delayed motion and the newly discovered \nevidence obtained from a records  request.  Jackson asserts that  the \u201ctrial court did not \nin any way clarify by name of motion, or date of filing, that m otion for leave had been \nresolved and decided.\u201d  He argues that the court\u2019s determinatio n that the relief sought \nwas similar to previous motions and that no additional evidence had been presented had \nbeen \u201cproperly rebutted\u201d by his June 8, 2020 request for leave and the accompanying \ndocuments.   \n{\u00b6 14} In his second assignment of error, Jackson points to Exhibit 01 , the Area \nOne Court order which gave the Trotwood Police Department acces s to certain phone \nrecords, to refute the trial court\u2019s conclusion that he presented \u201cno additional information\u201d \nfor the court to consider.  Jackson asserts that he had not had  any knowledge of the \nexistence of Exhibit 01 and therefore had been prevented from a sserting that the phone \nrecords had been illegally searched and seized without a warran t, that he had been \ntracked for more than 21 days without a warrant, and that he ha d been tracked \ncontinuously, 24 hours a day, through cell site location inform ation without a warrant.  \nFurther, he argues that he was prevented from challenging wheth er the State\u2019s actions \nwere proper under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution  and whether the \nState\u2019s failure to disclose information relevant to the case constituted a Brady violation.  \n-7- \n{\u00b6 15} The State responds that Jackson has litigated issues related to  the \nCincinnati Bell Wireless records, and he raises nothing that wa s not already litigated or \nthat could not have been litigated; therefore, his motion was b arred by res judicata.  \nAccording to the State, Jackson \u201cappears to argue that he could  not have previously \nraised issues related to the or der compelling production of rec ords because he never \nreceived it in discovery, and it was not entered on the journal of any court,\u201d but the State \ncontends \u201cthat cannot be true, since Jackson already pressed hi s various claims\u201d about \nthe phone records.  The State directs our attention to State v. Jackson , 2d Dist. \nMontgomery No. 27172, 2017-Ohio-1304, \u00b6 5, and it asserts that Jackson is attempting \nto circumvent the time limits for postconviction relief time by styling his motion as a motion \nfor a new trial.   \n{\u00b6 16} The State argues that Jackson\u2019s attempt to challenge the admiss ibility of \nphone record and tracking evidence was barred by res judicata.  The State points out \nthat Jackson\u2019s argument does not rely on United States v. Carpenter , __ U.S. __, 138 \nS.Ct. 2206, 201 L.Ed.2d 507 (2018), which was fairly recently decided, and that Jackson \n\u201ccould have litigated any non- Carpenter claim on direct appeal.\u201d  Further, according to \nthe State, Jackson\u2019s claim cannot be based on Carpenter, because he filed his motion \nbefore the Supreme Court decided Carpenter; thus, if Jackson\u2019s claim were to be \nconsidered on the merits, it would fail because \u201cthe prevailing  case law at the time \nJackson filed his motion was that police did not need a search warrant to obtain CSLI \n[phone records].\u201d   \n{\u00b6 17} The State further asserts that, even if Carpenter were considered, \nJackson\u2019s claim would fail because: \u201c(1) Carpenter does not apply retroactively to criminal  \n-8- \njudgments that are already final; (2) Jackson does not contend that the police obtained \nhis historical CSLI, only that they tracked him in real time; a nd (3) police obtained the \nCSLI in good faith reliance on the prevailing case law at the t ime.\u201d  The State asserts \nthat Carpenter applies retroactively only to criminal judgments that are not final. \n{\u00b6 18} In reply, Jackson asserts that the State has failed to show tha t Exhibit 01 \ndid not represent newly discovered evidence that was previously  undisclosed. He also \nargues that the issues of unavoidable delay and entitlement to a new trial are \u201cdistinct\u201d \nand \u201cmay not be conflated.\u201d   \n{\u00b6 19} The trial court addressed Jackso n\u2019s filings of December 26, 201 7, and \nJanuary 11, 2018, in the order from which this appeal arose.   \n{\u00b6 20} This Court has previously stated: \n\u201cA trial court's decision on a Crim.R. 33 motion for a new trial will not \nbe reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d  State v.

DeVaughns at \u00b6 18-19. \n{\u00b6 23}  Jackson failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that h e was \nunavoidably delayed in presenting a timely motion or prevented from discovering the \u201cnew \nevidence\u201d upon which he relies, namely Exhibit 01.  In State v. Jackson , 2d Dist. \nMontgomery No. 27272, 2017-Ohio-1304, \u00b6 3, we noted that Jackson:   \n* * * filed a pro se document in the trial court on April 12, 2 016 \nreferencing the post-conviction relief statute, R.C. 2953.21, and requesting \na new trial. * * *  The trial court construed the 42-page docum ent as a \nstatutory petition for post-conviction relief.  It concluded, h owever, that \nJackson had not timely filed the petition and had not demonstra ted being \nunavoidably prevented from discovering the facts upon which his five claims  \n-11-\nfor relief depended so as to justify a later filing.  \n{\u00b6 24} This Court noted as follows: \n* * * With regard to the \u201cunavoidably prevented\u201d issue, the trial court \nconcluded that Jackson's petition failed \u201cto demonstrate he was unaware of \nthe facts supporting his post-conviction claims or that he was unable, in the \nexercise of reasonabl e diligence, to discover such facts in a s ufficiently \ntimely fashion to meet the R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) filing requiremen t . \u201d   *  *  *  \nMore specifically, the trial c ourt addressed each of Jackson's five claims \nand reasoned as follows: \nThough Mr. Jackson's asserted claims in support of post-\nconviction relief are not particularly coherent, the first four  claims \nrelate, in one fashion or another, to Mr. Jackson's assertion t hat \nCincinnati Bell cellular telephone records were obtained illega lly, \nwere not timely disclosed, and that Michael Monta, Mr. Jackson' s \ntrial attorney, was ineffective regarding the Cincinnati Bell r ecords, \nor that the Cricket Wireless cellular telephone records obtaine d by \nthe State were suppressed.  The Cincinnati Bell records were an  \nissue at trial as reflected by the appellate decision resulting from Mr. \nJackson's appeal of his various convictions.  State v. Jackson ,  \n-12-\n2012-Ohio-2335, \u00b6\u00b6 69-75 (2d Dist.) 1 .  Mr. Jackson, as such, \ncannot credibly assert he was unaware of the facts relating to the \nCincinnati Bell records or was unavoidably precluded from \ndiscovering the facts supporting his post-conviction claims which \nrely, in one way or the other, upon the Cincinnati Bell records. \nThe Cricket Wireless records were not, to this writer's \nrecollection, a topic upon which trial testimony was received.  \nNonetheless, the record produced by Mr. Jackson reflects that t he \nState, on June 29, 2010, provided the Cricket Wireless records to \nMike Monta, Mr. Jackson's trial attorney. (Ex. D-1 attached to \nDennis Jackson's Petition).  This, of course, eliminates Mr. \nJackson's contention the Cri cket Wireless re cords were \nsuppressed.  Mr. Jackson, furthermore, does not explain how he,  \nin the exercise of reasonable diligence, was unavoidably prevented \nfrom discovery of the Cricket Wireless records.  In short, Mr. \nJackson, as it relates to his Cincinnati Bell and Cricket Wireless \nassertions, has failed in his burden to establish that this cou rt has \nthe jurisdictional ability to entertain his petition seeking po st-\n \n1 According to the 2012 Jackson opinion, Paula Papke testified that she \u201cwas a \u2018security \nanalyst\u2019 and \u2018custodian of records\u2019 with Cincinnati Bell and, i n that capacity, she was \nresponsible for processing subpoenas and requests for records.

As such, res judicata barred his argume nts.  \n{\u00b6 27} Finally, we note that U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Carpenter \n\u201cspecifically addressed the government's ability to utilize cell phone data without a warrant \nto ascertain a suspect's location and movement over a period of  weeks, months, and \nyears\u201d and concluded that \u201cobtaining a CSLI without a warrant v iolates the Fourth \nAmendment.\u201d  State v.

Snowden at \n\u00b6 30.  Jackson did not address Carpenter, and we agree with the State that it does not \napply here. \n{\u00b6 28} For the foregoing reasons, Jackson\u2019s assignments of error are overruled.  \n{\u00b6 29} The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.  \n. . . . . . . . . . . . . \n \nHALL, J. and WELBAUM, J., concur.         \n \n \n \n \n \nC o p i e s  s e n t  t o :        \n \nMathias H.

We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nJackson was convicted in January 2011 of murder, aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and a firearm specification. He was sentenced to an aggregate term of 28 years to life in prison. We affirmed his conviction on direct appeal, overruling 11 assignments of error. State v. Jackson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24430, 2012-Ohio-2335. Since then, Jackson has pursued various avenues of relief. See State v. Jackson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27272, 2017-Ohio-1304, \u00b6 3.\n\nOn October 27, 2017, acting pro se, Jackson filed a motion to dismiss and a notice of his intent to renew his \u201cMotion for Acquittal; Motion to Dismiss.\u201d The trial court overruled the motions, noting that the relief sought by Jackson was similar to previous motions before the court which had been overruled and that Jackson had presented no new additional information for the court to consider.\n\nOn December 26, 2017, Jackson filed a pro se motion asking the court to reconsider its previous decision overruling his \u201crenewed motion to dismiss\u201d and to state its findings on the record. The motion suggested that his speedy trial rights had been violated. On January 9, 2018, Jackson filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, and on January 11, 2018, he filed a motion for a new trial and a renewed motion for acquittal. The January 11 motion included multiple attachments, including as Exhibit 01 an order\nfrom the Area One Court of Montgomery County, which was dated March 31, 2010, and captioned \u201cState of Ohio v. John Doe.\u201d In the order, the Area One Court granted the motion of the Trotwood Police Department for an order compelling Cincinnati Bell Wireless to produce all phone records pertaining to certain phone numbers, finding that the records were \u201crelevant and material to an ongoing investigation of Aggravated Murder.\u201d Cincinnati Bell Wireless was specifically ordered to produce the records to Detective Mike Pigman of the Trotwood Police Department.\n\n{\u00b6 5} In his supporting memorandum, Jackson asserted that the State had failed to obtain a search warrant before obtaining \u201chis call detail records containing Cell Site Location Information (\u201cCSLI\u201d)\u201d and used the information from his phone records to obtain his conviction. Citing the testimony of Detective Pigman at trial, Jackson asserted that Exhibit 01 had not been \u201cpart of discovery\u201d and that the exhibit established that \u201ca search and seizure ha[d] taken place.\u201d According to Jackson, disclosure of the phone records in discovery would have allowed trial counsel to review the phone records and to recall witnesses \u201cto challenge their credibility, as to their actual locations during this crime.\u201d Jackson argued that the State used these phone records to place him in the vicinity of the crime, \u201cwhich weighed heavily on the minds of the jurors.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6 6} Jackson also attached his own affidavit, in which he averred that the State had conducted an illegal search and seizure of his Cincinnati Bell Wireless phone records and had failed to provide documents related to that search (namely, the order requiring Cincinnati Bell Wireless to provide the records to the Trotwood Police Department) in its discovery. Jackson also averred that the State \u201cconducted long term monitoring/tracking\u201d of him for more than 22 days and that it obtained the phone records\nwithout a warrant. Further, Jackson asserted in his affidavit that the State withheld the phone records in violation of *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). According to Jackson, the State\u2019s disclosure of the phone records for the first time on the last day of trial \u201cpresent[ed] an irregularity of proceedings\u201d and a \u201csurprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against,\u201d and the State\u2019s misconduct required that the phone records be suppressed and a new trial ordered.\n\n{\u00b6 7} On January 18, 2018, Jackson moved to supplement his motion to reconsider and requested \u201cCrim.R. 12(F) Findings.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6 8} On April 25, 2018, the court filed an order indicating its intention to decide several pending matters and setting deadlines for the parties to file their responses and replies. Jackson filed a reply to the court\u2019s order in May 2018. In June 2018, the State filed a memorandum contra Jackson\u2019s motion for new trial and/or motion for acquittal, arguing that the doctrine of res judicata barred Jackson\u2019s motions.\n\n{\u00b6 9} On April 16, 2020, Jackson filed a \u201cMotion to Correct an Illegal/Void Sentence,\u201d and on May 26, 2020, Jackson filed a motion for leave to supplement that motion.\n\n{\u00b6 10} On June 8, 2020, Jackson filed a motion to supplement his January 11, 2018 motion for a new trial and a request for leave to file a delayed motion for a new trial. In his attached affidavit, he asserted that the State had withheld the subpoena to Cincinnati Bell Wireless \u201cknowingly and purposefully,\u201d knowing that it \u201cwas falsely obtained without [an] affidavit,\u201d and thereby prevented him during trial, on appeal, and \u201cduring federal review\u201d from presenting evidence of an illegal search and seizure, perjured testimony, and a *Brady* violation. Jackson averred that an evidentiary hearing was\nrequired. Jackson also attached various correspondence to him from the Law Director for the City of Trotwood, from his (Jackson\u2019s) appellate counsel, from defense counsel at trial, and from an Assistant State Public Defender.\n\n\u00b6 11 On December 11, 2020, the court denied Jackson\u2019s April 16, 2020, \u201cMotion to Correct an Illegal/Void Sentence\u201d and his May 26, 2020, motion for leave to supplement that motion. The court treated the motions as seeking postconviction relief and concluded that such relief was barred by res judicata. (The trial court\u2019s judgment on these matters is on appeal in a separate case, Montgomery App. No. 29001.) The same day, the court overruled Jackson\u2019s December 26, 2017, motion asking the court to reconsider its previous decision overruling his \u201crenewed motion to dismiss\u201d and his January 11, 2018, motion for a new trial and renewed motion for acquittal. The court determined that the relief Jackson sought was similar to the relief sought in his previous motions before the court, which had already been overruled, and that he had presented no new or additional information for the court to consider.\n\n\u00b6 12 Jackson appeals pro se from the trial court\u2019s order overruling his \u201cMotion(s) for New Trial/Acquittal and Motion(s) to Dismiss.\u201d He raises two assignments of error, which we will consider together:\n\nJUDGE PARKER ABUSED HIS DISCRETION, AND ERRED WHEN HE OVERRULED APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL, BEFORE FINDING IF HE HAS PROVIDED CLEAR, AND CONVINCING PROOF THAT HE WAS UNAVOIDABLY DELAYED IN SUBMITTING A TIMELY MOTION.\n\nDID JUDGE PARKER ABUSE HIS DISCRETION, HOLDING THAT\nAPPELLANT HAD PRESENTED NO NEW ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE FOR\nTHE COURT TO CONSIDER?\n\n\u00b6 13 In his first assignment of error, Jackson asserts that the trial court \u201cerroneously ruled on his motion for a new trial\u201d before addressing his \u201cMotion for request of leave\u201d filed two years later. He asserts that the court failed to rule on his June 8, 2020 motion, which set forth the reasons for his delayed motion and the newly discovered evidence obtained from a records request. Jackson asserts that the \u201ctrial court did not in any way clarify by name of motion, or date of filing, that motion for leave had been resolved and decided.\u201d He argues that the court\u2019s determination that the relief sought was similar to previous motions and that no additional evidence had been presented had been \u201cproperly rebutted\u201d by his June 8, 2020 request for leave and the accompanying documents.\n\n\u00b6 14 In his second assignment of error, Jackson points to Exhibit 01, the Area One Court order which gave the Trotwood Police Department access to certain phone records, to refute the trial court\u2019s conclusion that he presented \u201cno additional information\u201d for the court to consider. Jackson asserts that he had not had any knowledge of the existence of Exhibit 01 and therefore had been prevented from asserting that the phone records had been illegally searched and seized without a warrant, that he had been tracked for more than 21 days without a warrant, and that he had been tracked continuously, 24 hours a day, through cell site location information without a warrant. Further, he argues that he was prevented from challenging whether the State\u2019s actions were proper under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and whether the State\u2019s failure to disclose information relevant to the case constituted a Brady violation.\nThe State responds that Jackson has litigated issues related to the Cincinnati Bell Wireless records, and he raises nothing that was not already litigated or that could not have been litigated; therefore, his motion was barred by res judicata. According to the State, Jackson \u201cappears to argue that he could not have previously raised issues related to the order compelling production of records because he never received it in discovery, and it was not entered on the journal of any court,\u201d but the State contends \u201cthat cannot be true, since Jackson already pressed his various claims\u201d about the phone records. The State directs our attention to State v. Jackson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27172, 2017-Ohio-1304, \u00b6 5, and it asserts that Jackson is attempting to circumvent the time limits for postconviction relief time by styling his motion as a motion for a new trial.\n\nThe State argues that Jackson\u2019s attempt to challenge the admissibility of phone record and tracking evidence was barred by res judicata. The State points out that Jackson\u2019s argument does not rely on United States v. Carpenter, __ U.S. __, 138 S.Ct. 2206, 201 L.Ed.2d 507 (2018), which was fairly recently decided, and that Jackson \u201ccould have litigated any non-Carpenter claim on direct appeal.\u201d Further, according to the State, Jackson\u2019s claim cannot be based on Carpenter, because he filed his motion before the Supreme Court decided Carpenter; thus, if Jackson\u2019s claim were to be considered on the merits, it would fail because \u201cthe prevailing case law at the time Jackson filed his motion was that police did not need a search warrant to obtain CSLI [phone records].\u201d\n\nThe State further asserts that, even if Carpenter were considered, Jackson\u2019s claim would fail because: \u201c(1) Carpenter does not apply retroactively to criminal\njudgments that are already final; (2) Jackson does not contend that the police obtained his historical CSLI, only that they tracked him in real time; and (3) police obtained the CSLI in good faith reliance on the prevailing case law at the time.\u201d The State asserts that Carpenter applies retroactively only to criminal judgments that are not final.\n\n\u00b6 18 In reply, Jackson asserts that the State has failed to show that Exhibit 01 did not represent newly discovered evidence that was previously undisclosed. He also argues that the issues of unavoidable delay and entitlement to a new trial are \u201cdistinct\u201d and \u201cmay not be conflated.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 19 The trial court addressed Jackson\u2019s filings of December 26, 2017, and January 11, 2018, in the order from which this appeal arose.\n\n\u00b6 20 This Court has previously stated:\n\n\u201cA trial court's decision on a Crim.R. 33 motion for a new trial will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d State v. Gillispie, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24456, 2012-Ohio-1656, \u00b6 31, citing State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 564 N.E.2d 54 (1990), paragraph one of the syllabus; State v.

State v. Lanier, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2009 CA 84, 2010-Ohio-2921, \u00b6 15, citing State v. Warwick, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 01CA33, 2002 WL 1585663, *2 (July 19, 2002); State v.

Walden, 19 Ohio App.3d 141, 145-146, 483 N.E.2d 859 (10th Dist.1984).\n\n\u201c[A] defendant fails to demonstrate that he or she was unavoidably prevented from discovering new evidence when he would have discovered that information earlier had he or she exercised due diligence and some effort.\u201d State v. Lenoir, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26846, 2016-Ohio-4981, \u00b6 24, citing State v. Metcalf, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26101, 2015-Ohio-3507, \u00b6 11, citing Warwick.\n\n(Emphasis added.) DeVaughns at \u00b6 18-19.\n\n\u00b6 23 Jackson failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that he was unavoidably delayed in presenting a timely motion or prevented from discovering the \u201cnew evidence\u201d upon which he relies, namely Exhibit 01. In State v. Jackson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27272, 2017-Ohio-1304, \u00b6 3, we noted that Jackson:\n\n* * * filed a pro se document in the trial court on April 12, 2016 referencing the post-conviction relief statute, R.C. 2953.21, and requesting a new trial. * * * The trial court construed the 42-page document as a statutory petition for post-conviction relief. It concluded, however, that Jackson had not timely filed the petition and had not demonstrated being unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts upon which his five claims\nfor relief depended so as to justify a later filing.\n\n\u00b6 24 This Court noted as follows:\n\n* * * With regard to the \u201cunavoidably prevented\u201d issue, the trial court concluded that Jackson's petition failed \u201cto demonstrate he was unaware of the facts supporting his post-conviction claims or that he was unable, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, to discover such facts in a sufficiently timely fashion to meet the R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) filing requirement.\u201d * * *\n\nMore specifically, the trial court addressed each of Jackson's five claims and reasoned as follows:\n\nThough Mr. Jackson's asserted claims in support of post-conviction relief are not particularly coherent, the first four claims relate, in one fashion or another, to Mr. Jackson's assertion that Cincinnati Bell cellular telephone records were obtained illegally, were not timely disclosed, and that Michael Monta, Mr. Jackson's trial attorney, was ineffective regarding the Cincinnati Bell records, or that the Cricket Wireless cellular telephone records obtained by the State were suppressed. The Cincinnati Bell records were an issue at trial as reflected by the appellate decision resulting from Mr. Jackson's appeal of his various convictions. State v. Jackson,\nMr. Jackson, as such, cannot credibly assert he was unaware of the facts relating to the Cincinnati Bell records or was unavoidably precluded from discovering the facts supporting his post-conviction claims which rely, in one way or the other, upon the Cincinnati Bell records.\n\nThe Cricket Wireless records were not, to this writer's recollection, a topic upon which trial testimony was received. Nonetheless, the record produced by Mr. Jackson reflects that the State, on June 29, 2010, provided the Cricket Wireless records to Mike Monta, Mr. Jackson's trial attorney. (Ex. D-1 attached to Dennis Jackson's Petition). This, of course, eliminates Mr. Jackson's contention the Cricket Wireless records were suppressed. Mr. Jackson, furthermore, does not explain how he, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the Cricket Wireless records. In short, Mr. Jackson, as it relates to his Cincinnati Bell and Cricket Wireless assertions, has failed in his burden to establish that this court has the jurisdictional ability to entertain his petition seeking post-\n\n---\n\n1 According to the 2012 Jackson opinion, Paula Papke testified that she \u201cwas a \u2018security analyst\u2019 and \u2018custodian of records\u2019 with Cincinnati Bell and, in that capacity, she was responsible for processing subpoenas and requests for records. She received such a subpoena from Detective Pigman regarding the records for multiple telephone numbers between March 10 and March 26, 2010.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 73. \u201cThe records were pertinent to the State's case because they established that Jackson's cell phone signals were transmitted by towers in the vicinity of Trotwood in the hours before and after the shooting; Jackson told detectives that he had been in Kettering with the mother of one of his children at that time.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 69.\nconviction relief.\n\n* * *\n\n(Footnote added.) Id. at \u00b6 5.\n\n{\u00b6 25} As noted by this Court:\n\n* * * Res judicata \u201cbars the assertion of claims against a valid, final judgment of conviction that have been raised or could have been raised on appeal.\u201d State v. Ketterer, 126 Ohio St.3d 448, 2010-Ohio-3831, 935 N.E.2d 9, \u00b6 59, citing State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph nine of the syllabus.

Montgomery 28519, 2020-Ohio-3575, \u00b6 14.\n\n{\u00b6 26} The trial court properly determined that Jackson \u201cpresented no new additional information\u201d for the trial court to consider, since Jackson had previously argued that the Cincinnati Bell cellular phone records had been obtained illegally and had not been timely disclosed. As such, res judicata barred his arguments.\n\n{\u00b6 27} Finally, we note that U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Carpenter \u201cspecifically addressed the government\u2019s ability to utilize cell phone data without a warrant to ascertain a suspect\u2019s location and movement over a period of weeks, months, and years\u201d and concluded that \u201cobtaining a CSLI without a warrant violates the Fourth Amendment.\u201d State v.

Snowden at \u00b6 30. Jackson did not address Carpenter, and we agree with the State that it does not apply here.\n\n\u00b6 28 For the foregoing reasons, Jackson\u2019s assignments of error are overruled.\n\n\u00b6 29 The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\nHALL, J. and WELBAUM, J., concur.\n\nCopies sent to:\n\nMathias H.

For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the court \nbelow. \n{\u00b62} On September 22, 2014, Snowden pled \u201cno contest\u201d to two counts of \nOperating a Motor Vehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs with a \nSpecification of Repeat OVI Offender, fourth degree felonies in  violation of R.C. \n4511.19(A)(1)(a) (operating a vehicle \u201cunder the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or 2 \n \nCase No. 2021-T-0008 \na combination of them\u201d) and (A)(2)(a) and (b) (refusing to subm it to a chemical test or \ntests subsequent to being arrested for OVI having been previously convicted of OVI). \n{\u00b63} Based on the version of R.C. 4511.19 in effect at the time Snow den \ncommitted the offenses (July 20, 2013), OVI was a fourth-degree  felony carrying a \nmandatory prison term of one to five years under certain condit ions: \u201can offender who, \nwithin six years of the offense, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three \nor four violations of division (A) or (B) of this section or ot her equivalent offenses or an \noffender who, within twenty years of the offense, previously ha s been convicted of or \npleaded guilty to five or more violations of that nature is gui lty of a felony of the fourth \ndegree,\u201d and, for violations of division (A)(1)(a) or (A)(2), \u201c [t]he court shall sentence the \noffender to * * * a mandatory prison term of one, two, three, f our, or five years.\u201d  R.C. \n4511.19(G)(1)(d)(i) and (ii). \n{\u00b64} The underlying Indictment charged, with respect to both OVI cou nts, that \nSnowden, \u201cwithin twenty years of the offense, previously has be en convicted of or \npleaded guilty to five or more violations of division (A) or (B ) of section 4511.19 of the \nOhio Revised Code, to-wit: on or about 06/04/2009, in Girard Municipal Court, Case No. \n2009-TRC-1396; on or about 10/01/2003, in Niles Municipal [Court], Case No. 2003-TRC-\n001418; on or about 03/23/2000, in Warren Municipal Court, Case No. 1999-TRC-08034; \non or about 10/21/1997, in Chardon Municipal Court, Case No. 1997-TRC-9062; [and] on \nor about 04/11/1994, in Warren Municipal Court, Case No. 1994-TRC-588.\u201d \n{\u00b65} Pursuant to the Specification of Repeat OVI Offender, when \u201cthe  offender \nis being sentenced for a fourth degree felony OVI offense[,] * * * the court shall impose \nupon the offender a mandatory prison term of one, two, three, f our, or five years,\u201d if the 3 \n \nCase No. 2021-T-0008 \nindictment \u201cspecifies that the offender, within twenty years of the offense, previously has \nbeen convicted of or pleaded guilty to five or more equivalent [OVI] offenses.\u201d  R.C. \n2929.13(G)(2) and R.C. 2941.1413. \n{\u00b66} On September 23, 2014, the trial court, having merged the OVI c ounts, \nimposed mandatory prison terms of one year for OVI and one year  for the Specification \nof Repeat OVI Offender to be served consecutively. \n{\u00b67} Snowden filed a direct appeal in which he challenged the consti tutionality \nof the Specification of Repeat OVI Offender statute, the imposition of consecutive prison \nterms, the underlying factual basis for the conviction, and the constitutional effectiveness \nof trial counsel.  In State v. Snowden, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2014-T-0092, 2015-Ohio-\n2611, this court affirmed his conviction and sentence. \n{\u00b68} On November 17, 2020, Snowden filed a Motion to Vacate Void Judgment.  \nSnowden argued that the judgment against him was void inasmuch as it \u201cwas a direct \nresult of prosecutor misconduct and a violation of Brady [v.] Maryland , 373 U.S. 83 \n(1963).\u201d  \n{\u00b69} On January 26, 2021, the trial court denied the Motion to Vacate construed \nas one for postconviction relief.  The court noted that the Mot ion was untimely pursuant \nto R.C. 2953.21(A)(2)(a) (\u201ca petition * * * shall be filed no l ater than three hundred sixty-\nfive days after the date on which the trial transcript is filed  in the court of appeals\u201d).  The \ncourt further found, \u201cupon review of the Defendant\u2019s Motion and  accompanying \nmemorandum in support, * * * that the Defendant has presented n o evidence of \nprosecutorial misconduct or a Brady violation.\u201d \n{\u00b610} On February 22, 2021, Snowden filed a Notice of Appeal.  On app eal, he 4 \n \nCase No. 2021-T-0008 \nraises the following assignments of error: \n{\u00b611} \u201c[1.] This Appellant was innocent of the charged crime.  There were multiple \ndue process and constitutional violations committed in the tria l court.  The Judge was \nprohibited by statute from imposing a prison term.  State and Federal [precedents] declare \nthe judgment is void.\u201d \n{\u00b612} \u201c[2.] A Judge and Prosecutor ignored a written request for bill of particulars \nthat caused a Defendant to be wrongfully imprisoned and the Defendant has proof beyond \nall reasonable doubt as to his innocence of the aggravated felony he was convicted of, a \nhearing should be held to remove the unlawful conviction that c arries serious lifelong \nconsequences.\u201d \n{\u00b613} Snowden is collaterally challenging his felony OVI conviction on the grounds \nthat the Indictment was void.  If true, considerations of timeliness and res judicata would \nnot bar this court from overturning the conviction. \n{\u00b614} \u201cA judgment of conviction based on an indictment which does not  charge \nan offense is void for lack of jurisdiction of the subject matt er and may be successfully \nattacked either on direct appeal to a reviewing court or by a collateral proceeding.\u201d  State \nv. Cimpritz, 158 Ohio St. 490, 110 N.E.2d 416 (1953), paragraph six of the  syllabus.  It \nhas subsequently been clarified, however, that defects in an in dictment, such as the \nomission of the essential element of a crime in the charging in strument, do not implicate \na court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction or render the conviction void.  State ex rel. Rackley v. \nSloan, 150 Ohio St.3d 11, 2016-Ohio-3416, 78 N.E.3d 819, \u00b6 9 (challenges to the validity \nor sufficiency of an indictment are \u201cnonjurisdictional in natur e\u201d) (citation omitted).  \u201c[A] \ndefective indictment renders the charge voidable, not void,\u201d an d such error \u201cdoes not 5 \n \nCase No. 2021-T-0008 \ndeprive the trial court of subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d  (Citations omitted.)  State v. Parker, \n8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 109950, 2021-Ohio-1090, \u00b6 14. \n{\u00b615} Claims that an indictment is defective or insufficient, being merely voidable, \nmust be raised in a direct appeal.  \u201c[A]fter a judgment of conv iction for the crime sought \nto be charged in such indictment, such a collateral attack woul d no longer be effective \nbecause the judgment of conviction necessarily binds a defendan t, where the court \nrendering it has jurisdiction of the person of the defendant an d also jurisdiction of the \nsubject matter, i.e., jurisdiction to try the defendant for the  crime for which he was \nconvicted.\u201d  State v. Wozniak, 172 Ohio St. 517, 522-523, 178 N.E.2d 800 (1961).  \u201cSuch \na judgment of conviction is necessarily binding as between the state and the defendant \nand can only be set aside by a direct and not a collateral attack.\u201d  Id. at 523; State ex rel. \nBandarapalli v. Gallagher , 128 Ohio St.3d 314, 2011-Ohio-230, 943 N.E.2d 1020, \u00b6 1; \nMidling v. Perrini, 14 Ohio St.2d 106, 236 N.E.2d 557 (1968), syllabus; Pishok v. Kelly, \n11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2008-T-0093, 2009-Ohio-287, \u00b6 13. \n{\u00b616} The distinction between a void and voidable indictment has been described \nthus: \nThe \u2018void\u2019 class includes those setting forth facts which in no  \nconceivable form can constitute a criminal offense; or if they might \nconstitute an offense, the court issuing the process had no \njurisdiction over such offense or the person charged with the offense.  \nThe \u2018voidable\u2019 class includes those where a bona fide attempt h as \nbeen made to charge a possible offense under the statute, but b y \nreason of some defect or irregularity such charge is per se \ninsufficient in law. \n \nBrinkman v. Drolesbaugh, 97 Ohio St. 171, 173, 119 N.E. 451 (1918). \n{\u00b617} Snowden argues that the underlying Indictment charged him with a crime \nthat does not exist, i.e., that there is no such crime as fourth-degree felony OVI based on 6 \n \nCase No. 2021-T-0008 \nfive prior OVI convictions within a twenty-year period: \u201cThe 20 year look back only applies \n* * * when the offender is guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide or aggravated vehicular \nassault.  * * *  This is the law as enacted by the Ohio General Assembly.  In this case the \nAppellant had no aggravating factors that would raise his misde meanor to a felony or \nallow a prison sentence.  The Judge could not legally convict the Appellant due to the fact \n[that] written legislative statute would not allow it.\u201d  Appellant\u2019s brief at 3-4. \n{\u00b618} Whether the defect described by Snowden would render the Indictment void \nor voidable is immaterial in the present case.  Contrary to Sno wden\u2019s position, neither \nfourth-degree felony OVI nor the Specification of Repeat OVI Offender require a predicate \nconviction for Aggravated Vehicular Homicide (R.C. 2903.06) or Aggravated Vehicular \nAssault (R.C. 2903.08).  Snowden has cited no statute to substa ntiate his claim and this \ncourt is not aware of any such statute.

For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the court below.\n\n{\u00b62} On September 22, 2014, Snowden pled \u201cno contest\u201d to two counts of Operating a Motor Vehicle While Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs with a Specification of Repeat OVI Offender, fourth degree felonies in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1)(a) (operating a vehicle \u201cunder the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or\na combination of them\u201d) and (A)(2)(a) and (b) (refusing to submit to a chemical test or tests subsequent to being arrested for OVI having been previously convicted of OVI).\n\n{\u00b63} Based on the version of R.C. 4511.19 in effect at the time Snowden committed the offenses (July 20, 2013), OVI was a fourth-degree felony carrying a mandatory prison term of one to five years under certain conditions: \u201can offender who, within six years of the offense, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or four violations of division (A) or (B) of this section or other equivalent offenses or an offender who, within twenty years of the offense, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to five or more violations of that nature is guilty of a felony of the fourth degree,\u201d and, for violations of division (A)(1)(a) or (A)(2), \u201c[t]he court shall sentence the offender to * * * a mandatory prison term of one, two, three, four, or five years.\u201d R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(d)(i) and (ii).\n\n{\u00b64} The underlying Indictment charged, with respect to both OVI counts, that Snowden, \u201cwithin twenty years of the offense, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to five or more violations of division (A) or (B) of section 4511.19 of the Ohio Revised Code, to-wit: on or about 06/04/2009, in Girard Municipal Court, Case No. 2009-TRC-1396; on or about 10/01/2003, in Niles Municipal [Court], Case No. 2003-TRC-001418; on or about 03/23/2000, in Warren Municipal Court, Case No. 1999-TRC-08034; on or about 10/21/1997, in Chardon Municipal Court, Case No. 1997-TRC-9062; [and] on or about 04/11/1994, in Warren Municipal Court, Case No. 1994-TRC-588.\u201d\n\n{\u00b65} Pursuant to the Specification of Repeat OVI Offender, when \u201cthe offender is being sentenced for a fourth degree felony OVI offense[,] * * * the court shall impose upon the offender a mandatory prison term of one, two, three, four, or five years,\u201d if the\nindictment \u201cspecifies that the offender, within twenty years of the offense, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to five or more equivalent [OVI] offenses.\u201d R.C. 2929.13(G)(2) and R.C. 2941.1413.\n\n{\u00b66} On September 23, 2014, the trial court, having merged the OVI counts, imposed mandatory prison terms of one year for OVI and one year for the Specification of Repeat OVI Offender to be served consecutively.\n\n{\u00b67} Snowden filed a direct appeal in which he challenged the constitutionality of the Specification of Repeat OVI Offender statute, the imposition of consecutive prison terms, the underlying factual basis for the conviction, and the constitutional effectiveness of trial counsel. In State v. Snowden, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2014-T-0092, 2015-Ohio-2611, this court affirmed his conviction and sentence.\n\n{\u00b68} On November 17, 2020, Snowden filed a Motion to Vacate Void Judgment. Snowden argued that the judgment against him was void inasmuch as it \u201cwas a direct result of prosecutor misconduct and a violation of Brady [v.] Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\u201d\n\n{\u00b69} On January 26, 2021, the trial court denied the Motion to Vacate construed as one for postconviction relief. The court noted that the Motion was untimely pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(A)(2)(a) (\u201ca petition * * * shall be filed no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the date on which the trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals\u201d). The court further found, \u201cupon review of the Defendant\u2019s Motion and accompanying memorandum in support, * * * that the Defendant has presented no evidence of prosecutorial misconduct or a Brady violation.\u201d\n\n{\u00b610} On February 22, 2021, Snowden filed a Notice of Appeal. On appeal, he\nraises the following assignments of error:\n\n{\u00b611} \u201c[1.] This Appellant was innocent of the charged crime. There were multiple due process and constitutional violations committed in the trial court. The Judge was prohibited by statute from imposing a prison term. State and Federal [precedents] declare the judgment is void.\u201d\n\n{\u00b612} \u201c[2.] A Judge and Prosecutor ignored a written request for bill of particulars that caused a Defendant to be wrongfully imprisoned and the Defendant has proof beyond all reasonable doubt as to his innocence of the aggravated felony he was convicted of, a hearing should be held to remove the unlawful conviction that carries serious lifelong consequences.\u201d\n\n{\u00b613} Snowden is collaterally challenging his felony OVI conviction on the grounds that the Indictment was void. If true, considerations of timeliness and res judicata would not bar this court from overturning the conviction.\n\n{\u00b614} \u201cA judgment of conviction based on an indictment which does not charge an offense is void for lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter and may be successfully attacked either on direct appeal to a reviewing court or by a collateral proceeding.\u201d State v. Cimpritz, 158 Ohio St. 490, 110 N.E.2d 416 (1953), paragraph six of the syllabus. It has subsequently been clarified, however, that defects in an indictment, such as the omission of the essential element of a crime in the charging instrument, do not implicate a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction or render the conviction void. State ex rel. Rackley v. Sloan, 150 Ohio St.3d 11, 2016-Ohio-3416, 78 N.E.3d 819, \u00b6 9 (challenges to the validity or sufficiency of an indictment are \u201cnonjurisdictional in nature\u201d) (citation omitted). \u201c[A] defective indictment renders the charge voidable, not void,\u201d and such error \u201cdoes not\ndeprive the trial court of subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d (Citations omitted.) State v. Parker, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 109950, 2021-Ohio-1090, \u00b6 14.\n\n{\u00b615} Claims that an indictment is defective or insufficient, being merely voidable, must be raised in a direct appeal. \u201c[A]fter a judgment of conviction for the crime sought to be charged in such indictment, such a collateral attack would no longer be effective because the judgment of conviction necessarily binds a defendant, where the court rendering it has jurisdiction of the person of the defendant and also jurisdiction of the subject matter, i.e., jurisdiction to try the defendant for the crime for which he was convicted.\u201d State v. Wozniak, 172 Ohio St. 517, 522-523, 178 N.E.2d 800 (1961). \u201cSuch a judgment of conviction is necessarily binding as between the state and the defendant and can only be set aside by a direct and not a collateral attack.\u201d Id. at 523; State ex rel. Bandarapalli v. Gallagher, 128 Ohio St.3d 314, 2011-Ohio-230, 943 N.E.2d 1020, \u00b6 1; Midling v. Perrini, 14 Ohio St.2d 106, 236 N.E.2d 557 (1968), syllabus; Pishok v. Kelly, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2008-T-0093, 2009-Ohio-287, \u00b6 13.\n\n{\u00b616} The distinction between a void and voidable indictment has been described thus:\n\nThe \u2018void\u2019 class includes those setting forth facts which in no conceivable form can constitute a criminal offense; or if they might constitute an offense, the court issuing the process had no jurisdiction over such offense or the person charged with the offense. The \u2018voidable\u2019 class includes those where a bona fide attempt has been made to charge a possible offense under the statute, but by reason of some defect or irregularity such charge is per se insufficient in law.\n\nBrinkman v. Drolesbaugh, 97 Ohio St. 171, 173, 119 N.E. 451 (1918).\n\n{\u00b617} Snowden argues that the underlying Indictment charged him with a crime that does not exist, i.e., that there is no such crime as fourth-degree felony OVI based on\nfive prior OVI convictions within a twenty-year period: \u201cThe 20 year look back only applies * * * when the offender is guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide or aggravated vehicular assault. * * * This is the law as enacted by the Ohio General Assembly. In this case the Appellant had no aggravating factors that would raise his misdemeanor to a felony or allow a prison sentence. The Judge could not legally convict the Appellant due to the fact [that] written legislative statute would not allow it.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 3-4.\n\n{\u00b618} Whether the defect described by Snowden would render the Indictment void or voidable is immaterial in the present case. Contrary to Snowden\u2019s position, neither fourth-degree felony OVI nor the Specification of Repeat OVI Offender require a predicate conviction for Aggravated Vehicular Homicide (R.C. 2903.06) or Aggravated Vehicular Assault (R.C. 2903.08). Snowden has cited no statute to substantiate his claim and this court is not aware of any such statute. In the absence of any demonstrated error or defect in the Indictment, there are no grounds for considering the challenge to his conviction.\n\n{\u00b619} The assignments of error are without merit.\n\n{\u00b620} For the foregoing reasons, the denial of Snowden\u2019s Motion to Vacate Void Judgment is affirmed. Costs to be taxed against the appellant.\n\nTHOMAS R. WRIGHT, J.,\n\nJOHN J. EKLUND, J.,\n\nconcur."}

Superior Avenue, 11th Floor \nCleveland, Ohio  44113  \n \n \nKATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, J.: \n{\u00b61} Applicant, Damon Dunn, seeks to reopen his appeal pursuant to App.R. 26(B), \nclaiming that appellate counsel was ineffective.  For the reasons that follow, we deny the \napplication. \n{\u00b62} Dunn was indicted in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-12-568849-A and convicted of crimes \nrelated to the murder of Kenneth Adams.  He appealed, arguing three assigned errors: The \ndenial of a motion to dismiss based on prosecutorial misconduct, the admission of testimony \nfrom a representative of a cell phone company, and th e court\u2019s use of a flight jury instruction.  Dunn\u2019s convictions were affirmed on appeal.  State v. Dunn , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101648, \n2015-Ohio-3138.1     \n{\u00b63}  After the appellate deci sion was issued on August 6, 2015, Dunn filed a timely \napplication for reopening on N ovember 3, 2015.  Six days later,  this court journalized an \nerroneous denial of a motion fo r reconsideration.  Through a se ries of cleri cal errors, the \napplication remained pending.  These errors were  brought to this cour t\u2019s attention by Dunn\u2019s \nmotion requesting findings of fact s and conclusions of law, f iled on March 5, 2018.  This court \nvacated the earlier order denying a motion for rec onsideration, and gave the state an opportunity \nto file a brief in opposition to Dunn\u2019s application.  The state did not do so.   \n{\u00b64} In his application, Dunn asse rts two proposed assignments of error.  First, he \ncontends that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to  raise and argue that the evidence \nwas insufficient to support his convictions and the manifest weight of the evidence did not \nsupport his convictions.  Second, Dunn asserts that appellate c ounsel was ineffective for not \nalleging instances where trial counsel was ineffective.     \nI.  Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel  \n{\u00b65} A criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to representation during the \nappellate process.  Therefore,  claims of ineffective assist ance of appellate counsel are \ncognizable.  State v. Murnahan , 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204 (1992).  App.R. 26(B) \nprovides a procedure to assert such  claims.  It allows for the re opening of an appeal based on a \nclaim that appellate counsel was ineffective. \n                                            \n1A more detailed recitation of the facts can be found at paragraphs 2 through \n14 of this opinion.   {\u00b66} An application for reopening must set forth \u201c[o]ne or more assignments of error or \narguments in support of assignments of error that previously were not considered on the merits in \nthe case by any appellate court or that were c onsidered on an incomplete record because of \nappellate counsel\u2019s deficient representation[.]\u201d  App.R. 26(B )(2)(c).  The application is \nrequired to support the alleged assignments of error with a sworn statement detailing the \ndeficient representation and how the deficient performance prejudiced th e applicant.  App.R. \n26(B)(2)(d).  \u201cTo succeed on an App.R. 26(B) a pplication, a petitioner must establish that \ncounsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonabl e representation and that he \nwas prejudiced by the deficient performance.\u201d  State v. Adams , 146 Ohio St.3d 232, \n2016-Ohio-3043, 54 N.E.3d 1227, \u00b6 2, citing State v. Dillon, 74 Ohio St.3d 166, 171, 657 N.E.2d \n273 (1995); App.R. 26(B)(5).  This is the standard  applicable to other ineffective assistance \nclaims announced in Strickland v. Washington , 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 \n(1984).  See State v. Reed , 74 Ohio St.3d 534, 660 N.E.2d 456 (1996).  Dunn must \ndemonstrate that \u201cthere was a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 as to whether he has a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of \nineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d  State v. Spivey, 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d \n696 (1998). \n{\u00b67} In order to show prejudice, an applicant must demonstrate that \u201cthere is a reasonable \nprobability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt about \nhis guilt.\u201d Strickland at 695. In determining whether an a pplicant has been prejudiced, the court \n\u201cmust consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.\u201d Id. \n{\u00b68} An appellate attorney has wide latitude and thus the discretion to decide which \nissues and arguments will prove most useful on appeal.  Strickland  at \uf05f 7.  Appellate counsel is \nalso not required to rais e every possible issue.  Jones v. Barnes , 463 U.S. 745, 753-754, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983); State v. Gumm, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 653 N.E.2d 253 (1995). \nAdditionally, appellate counsel is not required to argue assi gnments of error that are meritless.  \nId.  \nA.  Sufficiency and Manifest Weight of the Evidence  \n{\u00b69} Dunn argues that he was prejudiced by appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise \nsufficiency of the evidence because there was no reliable evidence that he killed Kenneth Adams. \n  \n{\u00b610} The question of \u201cwhether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict is a \nquestion of law.\u201d  State v. Thompkins , 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), citing \nState v. Robinson , 162 Ohio St. 486, 124 N.E.2d 148 (1955).  It is \u201can inquiry about due \nprocess, * * * the resolution of which does not  allow the court to weigh the evidence.\u201d  State v. \nMartin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983). \n{\u00b611} When analyzing whether the evidence adduced  is legally sufficient, an appellate \ncourt does not assess whether the state\u2019s evidence is  to be believed but wh ether, if believed, the \nevidence admitted at trial supported the conviction. State v. Starks , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. \n91682, 2009-Ohio-3375, \uf05f 25, citing Thompkins at 387.  \u201cThe relevant i nquiry is whether, after \nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to  the prosecution, any rationa l trier of fact could \nhave found the essential el ements of the crime prove n beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v. \nLeonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, quoting State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio \nSt.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.  \n{\u00b612} Dunn was found guilty of aggravated mu rder (R.C. 2903.01(A)), murder (R.C. \n2903.02(B)), felonious assault (R.C. 2903.11(A)(2)), and having weapons while under disability (R.C. 2923.13(A)(3)). Dunn does not assert a challenge to any individual element as lacking, but \ngenerally asserts that the testimony adduced against him is unreliable. \n{\u00b613}  At Dunn\u2019s trial, the state adduced eyewitness testimony that Dunn shot and killed \nAdams at a car wash.  Reginald Longstreet te stified that he saw D unn shoot Adams several \ntimes.  Corroborating evidence demonstrated that L ongstreet was at the car wash at the time of \nthe shooting and in a position to see the perpetrato r.  Further, cell phone records indicated that \nDunn\u2019s phone was in the area of the car wash at the time of the shooting.   \n{\u00b614} Under this appellate standard, this court does not examine the credibility of the \nwitnesses, but simply determines whether the testimony, along with all the evidence adduced a \ntrial, if believed, satisfies the elements of aggravated murder, murder, felonious assault, and \nhaving weapons while under disability.  After examining the evidence adduced at trial, this \ncourt cannot say that a ppellate counsel was ine ffective for choosing not to raise a sufficiency \na r g u m e n t .                          \n{\u00b615} Dunn also asserts that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to argue that his \nconvictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence. \n{\u00b616} A manifest weight inquiry looks at wh ether the evidence was substantial enough \nfor a jury to reasonably conclude that all of th e elements of the alleged crime have been proved \nbeyond a reasonable doubt.  The appellate court s its \u201c\u2018as a thirteenth juror.\u2019\u201d  Thompkins, 78 \nOhio St.3d at 386, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), quoting Tibbs v. Florida, 457 U.S. 31, 42, 102 S.Ct. \n2211, 72 L.Ed.2d 652 (1982). The appe llate court reviews the en tire record, considers the \ncredibility of the witnesses, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, and determines \nwhether the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed  and a new trial ordered.  Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 485 \nN.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).   \n{\u00b617} Dunn alleges that Longstreet\u2019s testim ony, the only eyewitness testimony that \nplaced him at the car wash at the time of mu rder, cannot be believed because of omissions, \nalterations, and the presence of an ulterior motive. \n{\u00b618}  Shortly after witnessing the murder, Longstreet fled the state in an attempt to \navoid federal prosecution for drug trafficking.  Therefore, he did not provide a statement to \npolice about the shooting until months later, when  he was attempting to work out a reduction to \nthe federal charges.   \n{\u00b619} Dunn highlights this ulterior motive, the fact  that Longstreet testified that he was \nhigh on PCP at the time he witnessed the murder, and instances where Longstreet\u2019s testimony \nconflicted with his previous statements.  For instance, in a pretrial statement Longstreet \ndescribed the shooter as wearing all black, but a video that pur ported to show the perpetrator \nrunning from the scene depicted a person wearing a white shirt and dark pants.  Most of the \ninstances highlighted by Dunn were addressed at  trial on cross-examina tion and used in an \nattempt to impeach Longstreet\u2019s credibility.   \n{\u00b620} After a review of the record, this court cannot say that counsel was ineffective for \nfailing to raise a challenge to the manifest weight of the evidence.  There are small \ninconsistencies in some aspects of the testimony adduced at trial, but nothing that casts doubt on \nthe verdicts reached by the jury and trial court.  This is not the exceptional case where the trier \nof fact clearly lost its way in rendering its verdict.   \n{\u00b621} There is no colorable claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failing \nto mount a sufficiency or manifest weight challenge.    B. Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel   \n{\u00b622} Dunn argues that appellate counsel should have argued trial counsel was ineffective \nfor failing to sufficiently challenge the admission of testimony from a representative of a cell \nphone provider.  Dunn classifies this testimony as expert testimony th at did not meet the \nstandard for reliability or comply with evidentiary rules governing expert testimony.  However, \non direct appeal, appellate counsel did raise this issue as an assignment of error.  This court \ndetermined that the testimony of the representative from Verizon Wireless and an investigator \nthat used cell phone records and information to create a map or data compilation did not \nconstitute expert testimony.  Dunn, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101648, 2015-Ohio-3138, at \uf05f \n51-54.  See also State v. Johnson , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105612, 2018-Ohio-1389, \uf05f 24-30 \n(finding that testimony of the cell phone represen tative did not constitute expert testimony).  \nAppellate counsel could not be ineffective for raising the alleged error Dunn now asserts because \ncounsel did, in fact, raise and argue the issue.  State v. Glenn , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94425, \n2012-Ohio-1530, \uf05f 8.  Res judicata bars review of the issue as outlined in Glenn.   \n{\u00b623} Dunn further alleges trial counsel wa s ineffective for failing to properly \ncross-examine Longstreet and sufficiently impeach him using prior inconsistent statements.  \nThe same ineffective assistance of counsel standard of review  announced above applies to the \nreview of this issue.     \n{\u00b624} An examination of the trial testimony indicat es that trial counsel used Longstreet\u2019s \npretrial statements to impeach his testimony and cast dispersions on his veracity and motives for \ntestifying.  Counsel used those statements to de monstrate that Longstreet \u2019s description of the \nshooter wearing all black was contrary to the vi deo evidence that showed a person running away \nfrom the scene of the shooting wearing a white shirt.   Counsel also used th e pretrial statements and the negotiations between fede ral and state prosecutors to establish that Longstreet was \ntestifying as part of a deal.  Counsel highlighted statements that  Longstreet made that indicated \nhe was \u201cincapacitated off of the drug called PCP\u201d at the time Adams was killed.   \n{\u00b625} Longstreet was extensively cross-examin ed.

For the reasons that follow, we deny the application.\n\n{\u00b62} Dunn was indicted in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-12-568849-A and convicted of crimes related to the murder of Kenneth Adams. He appealed, arguing three assigned errors: The denial of a motion to dismiss based on prosecutorial misconduct, the admission of testimony from a representative of a cell phone company, and the court\u2019s use of a flight jury instruction.\nDunn\u2019s convictions were affirmed on appeal.  *State v. Dunn*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101648, 2015-Ohio-3138.\u00b9\n\n{\u00b63} After the appellate decision was issued on August 6, 2015, Dunn filed a timely application for reopening on November 3, 2015. Six days later, this court journalized an erroneous denial of a motion for reconsideration. Through a series of clerical errors, the application remained pending. These errors were brought to this court\u2019s attention by Dunn\u2019s motion requesting findings of facts and conclusions of law, filed on March 5, 2018. This court vacated the earlier order denying a motion for reconsideration, and gave the state an opportunity to file a brief in opposition to Dunn\u2019s application. The state did not do so.\n\n{\u00b64} In his application, Dunn asserts two proposed assignments of error. First, he contends that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise and argue that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions and the manifest weight of the evidence did not support his convictions. Second, Dunn asserts that appellate counsel was ineffective for not alleging instances where trial counsel was ineffective.\n\nI. Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel\n\n{\u00b65} A criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to representation during the appellate process. Therefore, claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are cognizable. *State v. Murnahan*, 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204 (1992). App.R. 26(B) provides a procedure to assert such claims. It allows for the reopening of an appeal based on a claim that appellate counsel was ineffective.\n\n\u00b9A more detailed recitation of the facts can be found at paragraphs 2 through 14 of this opinion.\nAn application for reopening must set forth \u201c[o]ne or more assignments of error or arguments in support of assignments of error that previously were not considered on the merits in the case by any appellate court or that were considered on an incomplete record because of appellate counsel\u2019s deficient representation[.]\u201d App.R. 26(B)(2)(c). The application is required to support the alleged assignments of error with a sworn statement detailing the deficient representation and how the deficient performance prejudiced the applicant. App.R. 26(B)(2)(d). \u201cTo succeed on an App.R. 26(B) application, a petitioner must establish that counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation and that he was prejudiced by the deficient performance.\u201d State v. Adams, 146 Ohio St.3d 232, 2016-Ohio-3043, 54 N.E.3d 1227, \u00b6 2, citing State v. Dillon, 74 Ohio St.3d 166, 171, 657 N.E.2d 273 (1995); App.R. 26(B)(5). This is the standard applicable to other ineffective assistance claims announced in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). See State v. Reed, 74 Ohio St.3d 534, 660 N.E.2d 456 (1996). Dunn must demonstrate that \u201cthere was a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 as to whether he has a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d State v. Spivey, 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d 696 (1998).\n\nIn order to show prejudice, an applicant must demonstrate that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt about his guilt.\u201d Strickland at 695. In determining whether an applicant has been prejudiced, the court \u201cmust consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.\u201d Id.\n\nAn appellate attorney has wide latitude and thus the discretion to decide which issues and arguments will prove most useful on appeal. Strickland at 7. Appellate counsel is also not required to raise every possible issue. Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 753-754, 103\nAdditionally, appellate counsel is not required to argue assignments of error that are meritless. *Id.*\n\n**A. Sufficiency and Manifest Weight of the Evidence**\n\n{\u00b69} Dunn argues that he was prejudiced by appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise sufficiency of the evidence because there was no reliable evidence that he killed Kenneth Adams.\n\n{\u00b610} The question of \u201cwhether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict is a question of law.\u201d *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), citing *State v. Robinson*, 162 Ohio St. 486, 124 N.E.2d 148 (1955). It is \u201can inquiry about due process, * * * the resolution of which does not allow the court to weigh the evidence.\u201d *State v. Martin*, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\n\n{\u00b611} When analyzing whether the evidence adduced is legally sufficient, an appellate court does not assess whether the state\u2019s evidence is to be believed but whether, if believed, the evidence admitted at trial supported the conviction. *State v. Starks*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 91682, 2009-Ohio-3375, _25, citing *Tompkins* at 387. \u201cThe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *State v. Leonard*, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, quoting *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n{\u00b612} Dunn was found guilty of aggravated murder (R.C. 2903.01(A)), murder (R.C. 2903.02(B)), felonious assault (R.C. 2903.11(A)(2)), and having weapons while under disability\nDunn does not assert a challenge to any individual element as lacking, but generally asserts that the testimony adduced against him is unreliable.\n\nAt Dunn\u2019s trial, the state adduced eyewitness testimony that Dunn shot and killed Adams at a car wash. Reginald Longstreet testified that he saw Dunn shoot Adams several times. Corroborating evidence demonstrated that Longstreet was at the car wash at the time of the shooting and in a position to see the perpetrator. Further, cell phone records indicated that Dunn\u2019s phone was in the area of the car wash at the time of the shooting.\n\nUnder this appellate standard, this court does not examine the credibility of the witnesses, but simply determines whether the testimony, along with all the evidence adduced at trial, if believed, satisfies the elements of aggravated murder, murder, felonious assault, and having weapons while under disability. After examining the evidence adduced at trial, this court cannot say that appellate counsel was ineffective for choosing not to raise a sufficiency argument.\n\nDunn also asserts that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to argue that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nA manifest weight inquiry looks at whether the evidence was substantial enough for a jury to reasonably conclude that all of the elements of the alleged crime have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court sits \u201cas a thirteenth juror.\u201d Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at 386, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), quoting Tibbs v. Florida, 457 U.S. 31, 42, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 72 L.Ed.2d 652 (1982). The appellate court reviews the entire record, considers the credibility of the witnesses, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, and determines whether the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the\nconviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. *Martin*, 20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\n\n{\u00b617} Dunn alleges that Longstreet\u2019s testimony, the only eyewitness testimony that placed him at the car wash at the time of murder, cannot be believed because of omissions, alterations, and the presence of an ulterior motive.\n\n{\u00b618} Shortly after witnessing the murder, Longstreet fled the state in an attempt to avoid federal prosecution for drug trafficking. Therefore, he did not provide a statement to police about the shooting until months later, when he was attempting to work out a reduction to the federal charges.\n\n{\u00b619} Dunn highlights this ulterior motive, the fact that Longstreet testified that he was high on PCP at the time he witnessed the murder, and instances where Longstreet\u2019s testimony conflicted with his previous statements. For instance, in a pretrial statement Longstreet described the shooter as wearing all black, but a video that purported to show the perpetrator running from the scene depicted a person wearing a white shirt and dark pants. Most of the instances highlighted by Dunn were addressed at trial on cross-examination and used in an attempt to impeach Longstreet\u2019s credibility.\n\n{\u00b620} After a review of the record, this court cannot say that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise a challenge to the manifest weight of the evidence. There are small inconsistencies in some aspects of the testimony adduced at trial, but nothing that casts doubt on the verdicts reached by the jury and trial court. This is not the exceptional case where the trier of fact clearly lost its way in rendering its verdict.\n\n{\u00b621} There is no colorable claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failing to mount a sufficiency or manifest weight challenge.\nB. Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel\n\n{\u00b622} Dunn argues that appellate counsel should have argued trial counsel was ineffective for failing to sufficiently challenge the admission of testimony from a representative of a cell phone provider. Dunn classifies this testimony as expert testimony that did not meet the standard for reliability or comply with evidentiary rules governing expert testimony. However, on direct appeal, appellate counsel did raise this issue as an assignment of error. This court determined that the testimony of the representative from Verizon Wireless and an investigator that used cell phone records and information to create a map or data compilation did not constitute expert testimony. Dunn, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101648, 2015-Ohio-3138, at 51-54. See also State v. Johnson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105612, 2018-Ohio-1389, 24-30 (finding that testimony of the cell phone representative did not constitute expert testimony). Appellate counsel could not be ineffective for raising the alleged error Dunn now asserts because counsel did, in fact, raise and argue the issue. State v. Glenn, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94425, 2012-Ohio-1530, 8. Res judicata bars review of the issue as outlined in Glenn.\n\n{\u00b623} Dunn further alleges trial counsel was ineffective for failing to properly cross-examine Longstreet and sufficiently impeach him using prior inconsistent statements. The same ineffective assistance of counsel standard of review announced above applies to the review of this issue.\n\n{\u00b624} An examination of the trial testimony indicates that trial counsel used Longstreet\u2019s pretrial statements to impeach his testimony and cast dispersions on his veracity and motives for testifying. Counsel used those statements to demonstrate that Longstreet\u2019s description of the shooter wearing all black was contrary to the video evidence that showed a person running away from the scene of the shooting wearing a white shirt. Counsel also used the pretrial statements\nand the negotiations between federal and state prosecutors to establish that Longstreet was testifying as part of a deal. Counsel highlighted statements that Longstreet made that indicated he was \u201cincapacitated off of the drug called PCP\u201d at the time Adams was killed.\n\n{\u00b625} Longstreet was extensively cross-examined. Counsel attempted to discredit Longstreet and attack his motives for testifying using videos, written and recorded statements made to police, letters written by Longstreet, and video evidence. Appellate counsel cannot be said to be ineffective for failing to argue that trial counsel was ineffective in this regard.\n\n{\u00b626} Dunn has failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that \u201cthere is a genuine issue as to whether the applicant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d App.R. 26(B)(5).\n\n{\u00b627} Accordingly, the application for reopening is denied.\n\nKATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, JUDGE\n\nLARRY A.

He \nunsuccessfully challenged his conviction on direct appeal and in postconviction \nfilings between 2014 and 2017.  See State v. Littlepage , 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-\n140760 (Dec. 4, 2015); State v. Littlepage, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-140574 (Aug. 26, \n2015), appeals not accepted , 144 Ohio St.3d 1429, 2015-Ohio-5225, 42 N.E.3d 764, \nand 145 Ohio St.3d 1461, 2016-Ohio-2807, 49 N.E.3d 322; State v. Littlepage , 1st \nDist. Hamilton No. C-160918, 2018-Ohio-1382. \nMotion to Correct Sentence \n{\u00b63} In the case numbered C-170157, Littlepage presents a single assignment \nof error challenging the common pleas court\u2019s judgment overruling his February \n2 0 1 7  \u201c M o t i o n  t o  C o r r e c t  S e n t e n c e . \u201d   I n  t h a t  m o t i o n ,  h e  s o u g h t  c o r r e c t i o n  o f  h i s  \nsentence on the ground that it was void because the trial court had failed to make \nstatutorily mandated findings.  We do no t reach the merits of the assignment of \nerror, because we have no jurisdiction to review the judgment overruling the motion. \n{\u00b64} No common pleas court jurisdiction.   Littlepage did not specify \nin his motion a statute or rule under whic h the relief sought may be afforded.  The \ncommon pleas court was thus left to \u201crec ast\u201d the motion \u201cinto whatever category \nnecessary to identify and establish the cr iteria by which the motion should be \njudged.\u201d  State v. Schlee , 117 Ohio St.3d 153, 2008-Ohio-545, 882 N.E.2d 431, \u00b6 12 \nand syllabus. \n{\u00b65} But the motion was not reviewable under the standards provided by R.C. \n2953.21 et seq., governing the proceedings upon a petition for postconviction relief, \nbecause the motion alleged statutory, rather than constitutional, violations.  See R.C. OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS \n \n 3 \n2953.21(A)(1) (requiring a postconviction pe titioner to demonstrate a constitutional \nviolation in the proceedings resulting in his conviction); State v. Hodge , 128 Ohio \nSt.3d 1, 2010-Ohio-6320, 941 N.E.2d 768, \u00b6 26 (holding that sentencing findings are \nnot constitutionally mandated).  The motion  was also not reviewable as a motion for \na new trial under Crim.R. 33 or as a moti on to withdraw his guilty plea under \nCrim.R. 32.1, because Littlepage was not conv icted following a tria l, but upon a plea \nof guilty, and his motion did not seek with drawal of that plea.  The motion was not \nreviewable under R.C. Chapter 2731 as a petition for a writ of mandamus, under R.C. \nChapter 2721 as a declaratory judgment action, or under R.C. Chapter 2725 as a \npetition for a writ of habeas corpus, because the motion did not satisfy those statutes\u2019 \nprocedural requirements.  See R.C. 2731.04, 2721.12(A), and 2725.04.  And Crim.R. \n57(B) did not require the common pleas cour t to entertain the motion under Civ.R. \n60(B), because Littlepage\u2019s sentence had been reviewable under the procedures \nprovided for a direct appeal.  See State v. Smith , 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-150445 \nand C-150446, 2016-Ohio-3521, \u00b6 19. \n{\u00b66} We, therefore, conclude that the common pleas court had no jurisdiction \nto entertain Littlepage\u2019s \u201cMotion to Correct Sentence.\u201d \n{\u00b67} No appeals court jurisdiction.  Moreover, this court has no \njurisdiction to review the common pleas court\u2019s judgment overruling the motion.  \nArticle IV, Section 3(B)(2), Ohio Consti tution, confers upon an intermediate \nappellate court only \u201c s u c h  j u r i s d i c t i o n  a s  m a y  b e  p r o v i d e d  b y  l a w  t o  r e v i e w  a n d  \naffirm, modify, or reverse judgments or final orders of the courts of record inferior to \nthe court of appeals within the district.\u201d \n{\u00b68} The common pleas court\u2019s judgment overruling Littlepage\u2019s motion to \ncorrect his sentence is not a judgment of conviction.  Therefore, the judgment \noverruling the motion is plainly not reviewable under the jurisdiction conferred upon \na n  a p p e a l s  c o u r t  b y  R . C .  2 9 5 3 . 0 2  o r  2 9 5 3 . 0 8  t o  r e v i e w  a  j u d g m e n t  o f  c o n v i c t i o n  \nentered in a criminal case.  OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS \n \n 4\n{\u00b69} An appeals court has jurisdiction under R.C. 2953.23(B) to review an \norder awarding or denying postconviction relief.  But the entry overruling Littlepage\u2019s \nmotion was not appealable under R.C. 2953.23(B), because, as we determined, the \nmotion was not reviewable by the common  pleas court under the postconviction \nstatutes. \n{\u00b610} An appeals court also has jurisdiction under R.C. 2505.03(A) to review \nand affirm, modify, or reverse a \u201cfinal order, judgment or decree.\u201d  A \u201cfinal order\u201d \nincludes an order that \u201caffects a substantial right\u201d in \u201can action,\u201d when that order \neither \u201cin effect determines the action and prevents a judgment,\u201d R.C. 2505.02(B)(1), \nor is \u201cmade in a special pr oceeding,\u201d that is, in \u201can ac tion or proceeding that is \nspecially created by statute and that prior to 1853 was not denoted as an action at law \nor a suit in equity.\u201d  R.C. 2505.02(B)(2) and (A)(2).  A \u201cfinal order\u201d also includes an \norder that \u201cgrants or denies a provisional remedy,\u201d that is, a remedy in \u201ca proceeding \nancillary to an action,\u201d when that order \u201cin effect determines the action with respect \nto the provisional remedy an d prevents a judgment in th e action in favor of the \nappealing party with respect to the provisional remedy,\u201d and when \u201c[t]he appealing \nparty would not be afforded a meaningful or  effective remedy by an appeal following \nfinal judgment as to all proceedings, issues, claims, and parties in the action.\u201d  R.C. \n2505.02(A)(3) and (B)(4). \n{\u00b611} The common pleas court\u2019s entry overruling Littlepage\u2019s \u201cMotion to \nCorrect Sentence\u201d was not reviewable by this court under R.C. 2505.03(A) as a \u201cfinal \norder.\u201d  The entry was not \u201cmade\u201d in any \u201cspecial\u201d statutory proceeding.  See R.C. \n2505.02(B)(2).  Nor can the entry be said to have effectively determined or prevented \na judgment in any proceeding, when the motion was not filed in any action, or in any \nproceeding ancillary to an action, then pending befo re the court.  See R.C. \n2505.02(B)(1) and (B)(4)(a). \n{\u00b612} Not correctable under the jurisdiction to correct a void \njudgment.  Finally, the sentencing error alleged in Littlepage\u2019s \u201cMotion to Correct OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS \n \n 5\nSentence\u201d was not subject to correction by this court or by the common pleas court \nunder the jurisdiction to correct a void judgment.  See State ex rel. Cruzado v. \nZaleski, 111 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-5795, 856 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 18-19.  The alleged \nerror, even if demonstrated, would not have rendered his conviction void.  See State \nv. Wurzelbacher , 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-130011, 2013-Ohio-4009, \u00b6 8; State v. \nGrant, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-120695, 2013-Ohio-3421, \u00b6 9-16 (holding that a \njudgment of conviction is void only to the extent that a sentence is unauthorized by \nstatute or does not include a statutorily ma ndated term or if the trial court lacks \nsubject-matter jurisdiction or the authority to act). \nMotion for Transcript of Grand Jury Proceedings \n{\u00b613} In the case numbered C-170207, Littlepage presents a single \nassignment of error challenging the common pleas court\u2019s judgment overruling his \nApril 2017 \u201cMotion for Grand Jury Testim ony and Evidence [and] Disclosure of \nProceedings.\u201d  He sought in his motion an order granting him \u201caccess\u201d to the record \nof the proceedings before the grand jury le ading to his indictment.  We do not reach \nthe merits of this assignment of error, because, again, we lack jurisdiction to review \nthe overruling of the motion. \n{\u00b614}   No common pleas court jurisdiction. Littlepage submitted \nhis motion \u201cpursuant to [R.C.] 2939.19 and Crim.R. 6(E)\u201d and characterized his \nrequest for disclosure of grand jury proceedings as \u201cthe equivalent of a demand for \ndiscovery * * * in accordance with Crim.R. 16.\u201d  To demonstrate his \u201cparticularized \nneed\u201d for the record of those proceedings, he alleged that his conviction had been the \nproduct of his trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, prosecutorial misconduct, and other \ndue-process violations, and that he was actually innocent of the offense to which he \nhad pled guilty. \n{\u00b615} R.C. 2939.19 and Crim.R. 6(E) preclude disclosure of the opinions, \ndeliberations, and votes of grand jurors.  Crim.R. 6(E) permits disclosure of \u201cother \nmatters occurring before the grand jury * * * only when so directed by the court OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS \n \n 6\npreliminary to or in connection with a ju dicial proceeding, or when permitted by the \ncourt at the request of the defendant upon  a showing that grounds may exist for a \nmotion to dismiss the indictment becaus e of matters occurring before the grand \njury.\u201d  Thus, \u201c[g]rand jury proceedings are secret, and an accused is not entitled to \ninspect grand jury transcripts either before or during trial unless the ends of justice \nrequire it and there is a showing by the defense that a particularized need for \ndisclosure exists which outweighs the need for secrecy.\u201d  State v. Greer , 66 Ohio \nSt.2d 139, 420 N.E.2d 982 (1981), paragraph two of the syllabus. \n{\u00b616} The Courts of Appeals for the Eighth, Tenth, and Fifth Appellate \nDistricts have held that a trial court has no jurisdiction to order disclosure of grand \njury proceedings when no proceeding within that court\u2019s jurisdic tion is pending.  \nState v.

Cuyahoga No. 83492, 2004-Ohio-2695, \u00b6 7.  Compelled by the \nreasoning of those decisions, we hold that the common pleas court had no \njurisdiction to entertai n Littlepage\u2019s \u201cMotion for Grand Jury Testimony and \nEvidence [and] Disclosure of Proceedings ,\u201d when it was not filed in a pending \nproceeding within that court\u2019s jurisdiction.      \n{\u00b617} No appeals court jurisdiction.   Nor does this court have \njurisdiction to review the common pleas co urt\u2019s judgment denying the relief sought \nin Littlepage\u2019s \u201cMotion for Grand Jury Testimony and Evidence [and] Disclosure of \nProceedings.\u201d \n{\u00b618} The motion sought an order requiring disclosure of the grand jury \nproceedings leading to the indictment upon which Littlep age was convicted; it did \nnot seek relief from that conviction.  Therefore, the judgment overruling the motion \nis not reviewable under our jurisdiction under R.C. 2953.02 or 2953.08 to review a \njudgment of conviction entered in a criminal case. OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS \n \n 7\n{\u00b619} Nor could the motion be \u201crecast\u201d as  a postconviction motion that the \ncommon pleas court had jurisdiction to entertain.  Again, Littlepage did not seek in \nthe motion relief from his conviction.  He characterized the motion as \u201cthe equivalent \nof a demand for discovery.\u201d  And the motion may fairly be read to seek discovery for \nthe purpose of preparing a postconviction petition.  But the motion was not filed in a \npending postconviction proceeding.  And the postconviction statutes do not, except \nin capital cases, provide for discovery in  the initial stages of a postconviction \nproceeding.  State ex rel. Love v. Cuyahoga Cty. Prosecutor\u2019s Office,  87 Ohio St.3d \n158, 159, 718 N.E.2d 426 (1999).  The motion was thus not reviewable by the \ncommon pleas court under the postconviction statutes.  In turn, it was not \nreviewable under our jurisdiction under R.C. 2953.23(B) to review an order denying \npostconviction relief. \n{\u00b620} Finally, the entry overruling the mo tion was not reviewable by this \ncourt under the jurisdiction conferred under R.C. 2505.03(A) to review and affirm, \nmodify, or reverse a \u201cfinal order.\u201d  The entry was not \u201cmade\u201d in any \u201cspecial\u201d \nstatutory proceeding.

He unsuccessfully challenged his conviction on direct appeal and in postconviction filings between 2014 and 2017. See State v. Littlepage, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-140760 (Dec. 4, 2015); State v. Littlepage, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-140574 (Aug. 26, 2015), appeals not accepted, 144 Ohio St.3d 1429, 2015-Ohio-5225, 42 N.E.3d 764, and 145 Ohio St.3d 1461, 2016-Ohio-2807, 49 N.E.3d 322; State v. Littlepage, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-160918, 2018-Ohio-1382.\n\nMotion to Correct Sentence\n\n{\u00b63} In the case numbered C-170157, Littlepage presents a single assignment of error challenging the common pleas court\u2019s judgment overruling his February 2017 \u201cMotion to Correct Sentence.\u201d In that motion, he sought correction of his sentence on the ground that it was void because the trial court had failed to make statutorily mandated findings. We do not reach the merits of the assignment of error, because we have no jurisdiction to review the judgment overruling the motion.\n\n{\u00b64} No common pleas court jurisdiction. Littlepage did not specify in his motion a statute or rule under which the relief sought may be afforded. The common pleas court was thus left to \u201crecast\u201d the motion \u201cinto whatever category necessary to identify and establish the criteria by which the motion should be judged.\u201d State v. Schlee, 117 Ohio St.3d 153, 2008-Ohio-545, 882 N.E.2d 431, \u00b6 12 and syllabus.\n\n{\u00b65} But the motion was not reviewable under the standards provided by R.C. 2953.21 et seq., governing the proceedings upon a petition for postconviction relief, because the motion alleged statutory, rather than constitutional, violations. See R.C.\n2953.21(A)(1) (requiring a postconviction petitioner to demonstrate a constitutional violation in the proceedings resulting in his conviction); State v. Hodge, 128 Ohio St.3d 1, 2010-Ohio-6320, 941 N.E.2d 768, \u00b6 26 (holding that sentencing findings are not constitutionally mandated). The motion was also not reviewable as a motion for a new trial under Crim.R. 33 or as a motion to withdraw his guilty plea under Crim.R. 32.1, because Littlepage was not convicted following a trial, but upon a plea of guilty, and his motion did not seek withdrawal of that plea. The motion was not reviewable under R.C. Chapter 2731 as a petition for a writ of mandamus, under R.C. Chapter 2721 as a declaratory judgment action, or under R.C. Chapter 2725 as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, because the motion did not satisfy those statutes\u2019 procedural requirements. See R.C. 2731.04, 2721.12(A), and 2725.04. And Crim.R. 57(B) did not require the common pleas court to entertain the motion under Civ.R. 60(B), because Littlepage\u2019s sentence had been reviewable under the procedures provided for a direct appeal. See State v. Smith, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-150445 and C-150446, 2016-Ohio-3521, \u00b6 19.\n\n{\u00b66} We, therefore, conclude that the common pleas court had no jurisdiction to entertain Littlepage\u2019s \u201cMotion to Correct Sentence.\u201d\n\n{\u00b67} No appeals court jurisdiction. Moreover, this court has no jurisdiction to review the common pleas court\u2019s judgment overruling the motion. Article IV, Section 3(B)(2), Ohio Constitution, confers upon an intermediate appellate court only \u201csuch jurisdiction as may be provided by law to review and affirm, modify, or reverse judgments or final orders of the courts of record inferior to the court of appeals within the district.\u201d\n\n{\u00b68} The common pleas court\u2019s judgment overruling Littlepage\u2019s motion to correct his sentence is not a judgment of conviction. Therefore, the judgment overruling the motion is plainly not reviewable under the jurisdiction conferred upon an appeals court by R.C. 2953.02 or 2953.08 to review a judgment of conviction entered in a criminal case.\nAn appeals court has jurisdiction under R.C. 2953.23(B) to review an order awarding or denying postconviction relief. But the entry overruling Littlepage's motion was not appealable under R.C. 2953.23(B), because, as we determined, the motion was not reviewable by the common pleas court under the postconviction statutes.\n\nAn appeals court also has jurisdiction under R.C. 2505.03(A) to review and affirm, modify, or reverse a \u201cfinal order, judgment or decree.\u201d A \u201cfinal order\u201d includes an order that \u201caffects a substantial right\u201d in \u201can action,\u201d when that order either \u201cin effect determines the action and prevents a judgment,\u201d R.C. 2505.02(B)(1), or is \u201cmade in a special proceeding,\u201d that is, in \u201can action or proceeding that is specially created by statute and that prior to 1853 was not denoted as an action at law or a suit in equity.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(B)(2) and (A)(2). A \u201cfinal order\u201d also includes an order that \u201cgrants or denies a provisional remedy,\u201d that is, a remedy in \u201ca proceeding ancillary to an action,\u201d when that order \u201cin effect determines the action with respect to the provisional remedy and prevents a judgment in the action in favor of the appealing party with respect to the provisional remedy,\u201d and when \u201c[t]he appealing party would not be afforded a meaningful or effective remedy by an appeal following final judgment as to all proceedings, issues, claims, and parties in the action.\u201d R.C. 2505.02(A)(3) and (B)(4).\n\nThe common pleas court\u2019s entry overruling Littlepage\u2019s \u201cMotion to Correct Sentence\u201d was not reviewable by this court under R.C. 2505.03(A) as a \u201cfinal order.\u201d The entry was not \u201cmade\u201d in any \u201cspecial\u201d statutory proceeding. See R.C. 2505.02(B)(2). Nor can the entry be said to have effectively determined or prevented a judgment in any proceeding, when the motion was not filed in any action, or in any proceeding ancillary to an action, then pending before the court. See R.C. 2505.02(B)(1) and (B)(4)(a).\n\nNot correctable under the jurisdiction to correct a void judgment. Finally, the sentencing error alleged in Littlepage's \u201cMotion to Correct\nSentence\u201d was not subject to correction by this court or by the common pleas court under the jurisdiction to correct a void judgment. See State ex rel. Cruzado v. Zaleski, 111 Ohio St.3d 353, 2006-Ohio-5795, 856 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 18-19. The alleged error, even if demonstrated, would not have rendered his conviction void. See State v. Wurzelbacher, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-130011, 2013-Ohio-4009, \u00b6 8; State v. Grant, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-120695, 2013-Ohio-3421, \u00b6 9-16 (holding that a judgment of conviction is void only to the extent that a sentence is unauthorized by statute or does not include a statutorily mandated term or if the trial court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction or the authority to act).\n\nMotion for Transcript of Grand Jury Proceedings\n\n\u00b613 In the case numbered C-170207, Littlepage presents a single assignment of error challenging the common pleas court\u2019s judgment overruling his April 2017 \u201cMotion for Grand Jury Testimony and Evidence [and] Disclosure of Proceedings.\u201d He sought in his motion an order granting him \u201caccess\u201d to the record of the proceedings before the grand jury leading to his indictment. We do not reach the merits of this assignment of error, because, again, we lack jurisdiction to review the overruling of the motion.\n\n\u00b614 No common pleas court jurisdiction. Littlepage submitted his motion \u201cpursuant to [R.C.] 2939.19 and Crim.R. 6(E)\u201d and characterized his request for disclosure of grand jury proceedings as \u201cthe equivalent of a demand for discovery * * * in accordance with Crim.R. 16.\u201d To demonstrate his \u201cparticularized need\u201d for the record of those proceedings, he alleged that his conviction had been the product of his trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, prosecutorial misconduct, and other due-process violations, and that he was actually innocent of the offense to which he had pled guilty.\n\n\u00b615 R.C. 2939.19 and Crim.R. 6(E) preclude disclosure of the opinions, deliberations, and votes of grand jurors. Crim.R. 6(E) permits disclosure of \u201cother matters occurring before the grand jury * * * only when so directed by the court\npreliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding, or when permitted by the court at the request of the defendant upon a showing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the indictment because of matters occurring before the grand jury.\u201d Thus, \u201c[g]rand jury proceedings are secret, and an accused is not entitled to inspect grand jury transcripts either before or during trial unless the ends of justice require it and there is a showing by the defense that a particularized need for disclosure exists which outweighs the need for secrecy.\u201d State v. Greer, 66 Ohio St.2d 139, 420 N.E.2d 982 (1981), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n{\u00b616} The Courts of Appeals for the Eighth, Tenth, and Fifth Appellate Districts have held that a trial court has no jurisdiction to order disclosure of grand jury proceedings when no proceeding within that court\u2019s jurisdiction is pending. State v. Harper, 5th Dist. Guernsey No. 13 CA 15, 2013-Ohio-3897, \u00b6 19; State v. Russell, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 05AP\u20131325, 2006-Ohio-5945, \u00b6 10; State v. Short, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 83492, 2004-Ohio-2695, \u00b6 7. Compelled by the reasoning of those decisions, we hold that the common pleas court had no jurisdiction to entertain Littlepage\u2019s \u201cMotion for Grand Jury Testimony and Evidence [and] Disclosure of Proceedings,\u201d when it was not filed in a pending proceeding within that court\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n{\u00b617} No appeals court jurisdiction. Nor does this court have jurisdiction to review the common pleas court\u2019s judgment denying the relief sought in Littlepage\u2019s \u201cMotion for Grand Jury Testimony and Evidence [and] Disclosure of Proceedings.\u201d\n\n{\u00b618} The motion sought an order requiring disclosure of the grand jury proceedings leading to the indictment upon which Littlepage was convicted; it did not seek relief from that conviction. Therefore, the judgment overruling the motion is not reviewable under our jurisdiction under R.C. 2953.02 or 2953.08 to review a judgment of conviction entered in a criminal case.\nNor could the motion be \u201crecast\u201d as a postconviction motion that the common pleas court had jurisdiction to entertain. Again, Littlepage did not seek in the motion relief from his conviction. He characterized the motion as \u201cthe equivalent of a demand for discovery.\u201d And the motion may fairly be read to seek discovery for the purpose of preparing a postconviction petition. But the motion was not filed in a pending postconviction proceeding. And the postconviction statutes do not, except in capital cases, provide for discovery in the initial stages of a postconviction proceeding. State ex rel. Love v. Cuyahoga Cty. Prosecutor\u2019s Office, 87 Ohio St.3d 158, 159, 718 N.E.2d 426 (1999). The motion was thus not reviewable by the common pleas court under the postconviction statutes. In turn, it was not reviewable under our jurisdiction under R.C. 2953.23(B) to review an order denying postconviction relief.\n\nFinally, the entry overruling the motion was not reviewable by this court under the jurisdiction conferred under R.C. 2505.03(A) to review and affirm, modify, or reverse a \u201cfinal order.\u201d The entry was not \u201cmade\u201d in any \u201cspecial\u201d statutory proceeding.

Gillispie soug ht the transcripts in \nconnection with his pending federal lawsuit against Moore and o thers alleging violations \nof 42 U.S.C.1983 and seeking compensation for wrongful imprison ment. The federal \nlawsuit followed Gillispie\u2019s release from prison after serving 20 years for three rape \nconvictions. Gillespie was released pursuant to a federal writ of habeas corpus, and the \nrape charges later were dismissed with prejudice. In ordering disclosure of the grand-jury \ntranscripts, the trial court found that Gillispie had shown a \u201c particularized need\u201d that \noutweighed the need to maintain grand-jury secrecy.  \n{\u00b6 2} For the following reasons, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in \nordering full disclosure and production of the grand-jury transcripts \u201cwithout exception or \nlimitation.\u201d Although the record supports releasing portions of one transcript, the trial court \nerred in ordering the release of all grand-jury testimony from all four witnesses. \nAccordingly, the trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed in part and reversed in part.  \nI. Factual and Procedural Background \n{\u00b6 3} A jury convicted Gillispie on three counts of rape and other charges in 1991. \nAfter being granted a new trial, he was convicted again by a se cond jury. Witnesses at \nboth trials included the victims and Moore, who was the lead in vestigator. This court  \n-3- \naffirmed Gillispie\u2019s convictions on direct appeal. Two decades of post-conviction actions \nfollowed, culminating in (1) the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio granting \nGillispie a conditional writ of habeas corpus based on a violat ion of Brady v. Maryland, \n373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), vacating his convictions, and ordering \nhim retried and (2) this court ordering a new trial based on an  alternate-suspect theory. \nSee Gillispie v. Timmermans-Cooper , 835 F.Supp.2d 482 (S.D. Ohio 2011); State v. \nGillispie, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26965, 2016-Ohio-7688. Following the State\u2019s inability \nto produce supplemental police reports underlying the Brady violation, the trial court later \ndismissed Gillespie\u2019s indictment with prejudice. Gillispie then  filed a lawsuit in federal \ncourt alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. 1983. The lawsuit included several state-law claims. \nDefendants in the action included Moore and Miami Township. In September 2020, the \nfederal court disposed of all claims except the section 1983 claims against Moore.  \n{\u00b6 4} Gillispie filed a motion in the trial court below seeking transcripts of grand jury \ntestimony from Moore and the three rape victims. He argued that he needed the testimony \nto obtain a fair adjudication of his federal claims and that such need outweighed any need \nto maintain grand-jury secrecy. In a March 25, 2021 ruling, the  trial court sustained \nGillispie\u2019s motion. It ordered disclosure and production of the grand-jury testimony of all \nfour witnesses \u201cwithout exception or limitation.\u201d This appeal followed. \nII. Governing Law  \n{\u00b6 5} The long-standing rule in Ohio and elsewhere is that grand-jury proceedings \nare secret. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. United States, 360 U.S. 395, 399-400, 79 S.Ct. \n1237, 3 L.Ed.2d 1323 (1959) (recognizing a history and traditio n of grand-jury secrecy \n\u201colder than our Nation itself\u201d); In re Rice, 2018-Ohio-1087, 109 N.E.3d 608, \u00b6 18 (8th Dist.)  \n-4- \n(\u201cIt is critical to its functioning that the secretive nature of the work of a grand jury remain \nsacrosanct and inviolable. As such, that secrecy has long been \u2018jealously guarded\u2019 by \nOhio courts.\u201d). The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized a \u201climite d exception\u201d allowing \ndisclosure of grand-jury transcripts where \u201c \u2018the ends of justi ce require it and there is a \nshowing * * * that a particularized need for disclosure exists which outweighs the need for \nsecrecy.\u2019 \u201d State v. Graham, 164 Ohio St. 3d 187, 2020-Ohio-6700, 172 N.E.3d 841, \u00b6 25, \nquoting State v. Greer, 66 Ohio St.2d 139, 420 N.E.2d 982 (1981), paragraph two of th e \nsyllabus.  \n{\u00b6 6} \u201cA particularized need is established \u2018when the circumstances r eveal a \nprobability that the failure to provide the grand jury testimony will deny the [movant] a fair \ntrial.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting State v. Sellards, 17 Ohio St.3d 169, 173, 478 N.E.2d 781 (1985). A \nparticularized need for grand-jury testimony may arise when suc h testimony is required \nto impeach a witness, to refresh recollection, or to test credi bility. Greer at 145, citing \nUnited States v. Procter & Gamble Co. , 356 U.S. 677, 78 S.Ct. 983, 2 L.Ed.2d 1077 \n(1958). The particularized-need requirement helps ensure that w hen grand-jury secrecy \nis lifted, it is done \u201cdiscretely and limitedly.\u201d Proctor & Gamble Co . at 683. Whether a \nparticularized need exists is a question of fact for a trial co urt to resolve within its \ndiscretion. State v.

Analysis \n{\u00b6 9} In a joint brief, Miami Township and Moore advance the following assignment \nof error: \nTHE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT \nCOMPROMISED THE SECRECY OF THE GRAND JURY WHEN IT \nRULED THAT PETITIONER-GILLISPIE HAD DEMONSTRATED  \n-6- \nPARTICULARIZED NEED AND DISCLOSED THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE \nGRAND JURY PROCEEDINGS. \n{\u00b6 10} In a separate appellate brief, the State raises the following two assignments \nof error: \nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW BY \nRELEASING GRAND JURY TRANSCRIPTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY \nWITHOUT FIRST PROPERLY DETERMINING WHETHER THE \nPARTICULARIZED NEED FOR THE TRANSCRIPTS THAT GILLISPIE \nALLEGED COULD BE MET THROUGH OTHER SOURCES. \nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY FINDING THAT THERE IS NO \nNEED TO PRESERVE THE SECRECY OF THE GRAND JURY \nPROCEEDINGS IN THIS CASE IN ANY FORM AND TO ANY EXTENT. \n{\u00b6 11} We begin our analysis by recognizing that four of the five trad itional \njustifications for preserving grand-jury secrecy do not apply h ere. There is no concern \nabout Gillispie \u201cescaping\u201d before his indictment. There is no r isk of people importuning \nhis grand jurors, suborning perjury, or tampering with the gran d jurors. Nor is there any \nconcern about protecting Gillispie from disclosure of the fact that a grand jury investigated \nhim. Given that the grand-jury proceedings concluded more than 30 years ago and \nGillispie previously was indicted and convicted, the foregoing considerations do not justify \nmaintaining grand-jury secrecy in this case.  \n{\u00b6 12} One factor, however, remains applicable, namely the need to enc ourage \nfree and full disclosures by potential future grand-jury witnesses. The U.S. Supreme Court \nhas recognized that \u201c[p]arties seeking grand jury transcripts *  * * must show that the  \n-7- \nmaterial they seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in a nother judicial proceeding, \nthat the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy, and that their \nrequest is structured to cover only material so needed.\u201d Douglas Oil Co. of California v. \nPetrol Stops Northwest, 441 U.S. 211, 222, 99 S.Ct. 1667, 60 L.Ed.2d 156 (1979). \u201cSuch \na showing must be made even when the grand jury whose transcrip ts are sought has \nconcluded its operations * * *. For in considering the effects of disclosure on grand jury \nproceedings, the courts must consider not only the immediate effects upon a particular \ngrand jury, but also the possible effect upon the functioning of future grand juries.\u201d \n(Emphasis added.) Id. The practice of disclosing grand-jury testimony \u201crenders \nconsiderably more concrete the threat to the willingness of wit nesses to come forward \nand to testify fully and candidly.\u201d United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc ., 463 U.S. 418, \n432, 103 S. Ct. 3133, 77 L. Ed. 2d 743 (1983); see also State v. Owens, 4th Dist. Gallia \nNo. 14CA9, 2015-Ohio-3017, \u00b6 14 (quoting Douglas Oil and noting that \u201cconcerns with \nfreedom in grand jury deliberations and the encouragement of fr ee and untrammeled \ndisclosures by persons with information are always present because * * * \u2018[p]ersons called \nupon to testify will consider the likelihood that their testimo ny may one day be disclosed \nto outside parties\u2019 \u201d).  \n{\u00b6 13} As the need for secrecy decreases, however, the requisite showi ng of \nparticularized need also decreases. Douglas Oil at 223 (noting that \u201cas the considerations \njustifying secrecy become less relevant, a party asserting a need for grand jury transcripts \nwill have a lesser burden in showing justification\u201d). \u201c[W]hen t here is a balancing of the \noften minimal need to preserve secrecy against the need for the  defendant to review \ncertain portions of the grand jury testimony, * * * all relevan t portions of the transcript  \n-8- \nshould be produced, with the trial court deleting extraneous ma tters, and issuing \nprotective orders where necessary.\u201d Greer at 151.  \n{\u00b6 14} In the present case, the trial court ignored the residual interest in preserving \ngrand-jury secrecy that remains even after a criminal case long  since has concluded. It \nfound that the appellants had \u201cutterly failed to establish any need for secrecy.\u201d (March 25, \n2021 Decision, Entry, and Order at 3.) In response to the appel lants\u2019 concern about a \npotential \u201cchilling effect\u201d on future grand juries if the trans cripts at issue were released, \nthe trial court characterized their argument as \u201cadvocating for  secrecy for the sake of \nsecrecy.\u201d It reasoned that, \u201cfollowed to its logical conclusion , the State\u2019s \u2018chilling effect\u2019 \nargument would literally prohibit the discovery, production and  use of [g]rand [j]ury \n[t]estimony in every case, no matter the State\u2019s excesses.\u201d The  trial court opined that \n\u201c[t]his cannot be the law in a free society.\u201d (Id. at 8-9.)  \n{\u00b6 15} The case law cited above makes clear, however, that recognizing  t h e  \npotential impact of disclosure on the functioning of future gra nd juries does not \u201cliterally \nprohibit\u201d the release of any grand-jury testimony in every case . Rather, case law \nestablishes that this residual interest in preserving secrecy s imply must be weighed \nagainst the movant\u2019s particularized need for disclosure. As our  analysis herein will \ndemonstrate, a movant\u2019s interest in disclosure sometimes may outweigh a relatively minor \ninterest in maintaining secrecy. In such a case, a court should  release only necessary \nportions of a grand-jury transcript while excluding extraneous testimony. \n{\u00b6 16} Having found that a general interest in preserving grand-jury s ecrecy still \nexists in this case, we turn to the particularized-need issue. In his attempt to establish a \nparticularized need for the grand-jury transcripts, Gillispie finds himself in a better position  \n-9- \nthan most litigants. In the proceedings below, the trial court actually reviewed those \ntranscripts and permitted counsel to do likewise. In this postu re, Gillispie need not \nspeculate about whether the grand-jury transcripts might contain testimony that is useful \nto impeach a witness, to refresh recollection, or to test credi bility in his federal lawsuit. \nHaving enjoyed the benefit of examining the transcripts, the pa rties know what they \ncontain.  \n{\u00b6 17} Based on his review of the transcripts, Gillispie argued below that he \nneeded Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony to ensure a fair adjudicati on of his section 1983 \nclaims and to prevent misleading the trier-of-fact in the feder al lawsuit. In post-hearing \nbriefing before the trial court, Gillispie noted that Moore som etimes failed to remember \ncertain facts about his investigation while being deposed in 20 18. Gillispie also argued \nthat Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony disclosed previously unknown facts and sometimes \ncontradicted Moore\u2019s later statements in the rape case. In all, Gillispie\u2019s post-hearing brief \ncited more than 20 instances during Moore\u2019s 2018 deposition in which he failed to recall \nthings about his investigation.  Gillispie\u2019s post-hearing brief also cited seven specific \ninstances in which he believed Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony was needed for purposes of \nrefreshing recollection, impeaching, or testing Moore\u2019s credibi lity. (March 19, 2021 \nPetitioner\u2019s Brief at 10-21.) Because Gillispie bore the burden  of establishing a \nparticularized need, we will confine our review of Moore\u2019s gran d-jury testimony to the \ninstances he cited.  \n{\u00b6 18} In conducting our review, we are mindful that no particularized  need exists \nif Gillispie can obtain elsewhere the information he seeks from  grand-jury testimony. \nIndeed, if Moore\u2019s testimony before the grand jury was merely c umulative of statements  \n-10-\nhe made other places (including reports, hearings, at the two criminal trials, or in his 2018 \ndeposition), then no \u201cneed\u201d for the grand-jury testimony exists  at all. In such a \ncircumstance, Gillispie can refresh recollection, impeach, or o therwise test Moore\u2019s \ncredibility by using an alternative source. See In re January 27, 2017 Order Releasing \nGrand Jury Materials , 2018-Ohio-988, 108 N.E.3d 1170, \u00b6 10 (2d Dist.) (finding no \n\u201cparticularized need\u201d where \u201cthe transcript of M.H.\u2019s grand jur y testimony would provide \nlittle or no additional information germane to C.P.\u2019s claim aga inst M.H.\u201d); State v. Webb, \n2d Dist. Greene No. 2005-CA-52, 2006-Ohio-1113, \u00b6 13 (finding a n absence of \nparticularized need where appellant \u201cdid not present a compelling argument that the only \nway for him to substantiate his claims against the deputies was  through the use of the \ngrand jury testimony\u201d); State ex rel. Dann v. Taft, 109 Ohio St. 3d 364, 2006-Ohio-1825, \n848 N.E.2d 472, \u00b6 68 (recognizing in the executive-privilege co ntext that particularized \nneed \u201cdoes not exist when privileged information can be obtained elsewhere\u201d). \n{\u00b6 19} In his post-hearing brief below, Gillispie listed 29 pages from Moore\u2019s 2018 \ndeposition in which Moore purportedly failed to recall specific s of his investigation. \nGillispie claimed Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony was necessary to  refresh the detective\u2019s \nrecollection on those issues. With one exception that will be d iscussed below, however, \nGillispie made no attempt to sho w how the grand-jury testimony would help refresh \nMoore\u2019s recollection on any particular issue. Likewise, on appeal Gillsipie simply refers to \ndeposition pages where Moore failed to remember things. (Brief of Appellee-Petitioner at \n17, 22.) For its part, the trial court also noted Moore\u2019s inability to remember things during \nhis 2018 deposition. (March 25, 2021 Decision, Entry, and Order at 5.) It does not follow, \nhowever, that Gillispie needs Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony simply because Moore cannot  \n-11-\nremember certain things. Without any showing that Moore\u2019s grand -jury testimony would \nrefresh Moore\u2019s recollection on a particular issue (and that Moore\u2019s recollection could not \nbe refreshed from another source), Gillsipie failed to demonstr ate a particularized need \nfor the grand-jury testimony for refreshment purposes.1 \n{\u00b6 20} With regard to the seven specific arguments raised in Gillispie \u2019s post-\nhearing brief below, he did assert that he needed grand-jury testimony to refresh Moore\u2019s \nrecollection about a composite sketch of the rape suspect. When  testifying before the \ngrand jury, Moore identified who drew the sketch. In his 2018 d eposition, he could not \nrecall that information. The appellants argue that the artist\u2019s identify is not relevant to the \nfederal lawsuit, whereas Gillispie claims the artist\u2019s identify  is a proper subject of \ndiscovery in that action. Upon review, we fail to see how the i dentity of the sketch artist \n(who was not Moore) is itself relevant to Gillispie\u2019s section 1 983 claims. At most, the \nartist\u2019s identity perhaps could lead to the discovery of releva nt information in the federal \nlawsuit. But such an assertion is speculative, and grand-jury t estimony is not properly \ndisclosed to aid in general discovery. Greer at 147, quoting State v. Laskey, 21 Ohio St.2d \n187, 191, 257 N.E.2d 65 (1970), vacated on other grounds, Lasky v. Ohio, 408 U.S. 936, \n92 S.Ct. 2861, 33 L.Ed.2d 753 (1972); see also State v. Boehm, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. \n16335, 1997 WL 856285, *2 (Dec. 31, 1997); State v. Carte , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. \n91534, 2009-Ohio-4193, \u00b6 28; State v. Tenbrook , 34 Ohio Misc.2d 14, 15, 517 N.E.2d \n \n1 This court itself could examine each of the 29 pages cited from Moore\u2019s deposition and \nthen independently study his grand-jury testimony to seek to determine whether anything \nin the grand-jury transcript might refresh his recollection on a material issue. But \u201c[a]n \nappellate court is not a ferret[.]\u201d State v. Sullivan, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23948, 2011-\nOhio-2976, \u00b6 42 (Froelich, J., concurring). Gillispie bore the burden to demonstrate a \nparticularized need to use Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony for refreshment purposes. String \nciting 29 pages from a deposition failed to meet this burden.   \n-12-\n1046 (Cuyahoga C.P.1987). Regardless, we see no probability tha t a failure to provide \nGillispie with the identity of a sketch artist will deprive him of a fair trial in federal court.  \n{\u00b6 21} Gillispie\u2019s second attempt to show particularized need involved  the timing \nof Moore\u2019s involvement with the rape investigation. Moore consi stently asserted in \nconnection with Gillispie\u2019s crim inal trial and his deposition i n federal court that he was \nassigned to the case on June 18, 1990. In his grand-jury testim ony, however, Moore \ntestified that he was assigned to the case in May 1990. Gillisp ie claims this discrepancy \nis significant insofar as it impacts what was in the investigat ory file when Moore became \ninvolved. One issue in federal court is an allegation that Moore suppressed or destroyed \nan exonerating report prepared by other detectives who were working on the case in May \n1990. If Moore also was working on the case in May 1990, this fact would lend credence \nto Gillispie\u2019s theory that Moore knew about the report\u2014a fact Moore denies.  \n{\u00b6 22} The appellants contend Gillispie should not be allowed to use t he grand-\njury testimony because he previously never disputed whether Moore\u2019s involvement began \nin June 1990. Prior to reviewing the grand-jury testimony, howe ver, Gillispie had no \nreason to dispute Moore\u2019s claim about when he became involved. Now Gillispie does \nhave a reason to question the timing of Moore\u2019s involvement. The trial court did not abuse \nits discretion in finding that Gillispie\u2019s need for this portion of Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony \noutweighed any interest in keeping it secret.  \n{\u00b6 23} Gillispie\u2019s third argument on the particularized-need issue con cerned \nMoore\u2019s interaction with Richar d Wolfe, who had been Gillispie\u2019 s supervisor at General \nMotors. Wolfe arrived at the police department during the inves tigation and dropped off \nseveral employee identification cards, including one from Gillispie. At trial, Moore testified  \n-13-\nthat he obtained the ID cards from Wolfe outside the police department and gave them to \nSergeant Steven Fritz. In his 2018 deposition, Moore recalled b riefly meeting with Wolfe \nand Fritz about the cards inside the police department and Fritz putting the cards in a file. \nGillispie contends both of the foregoing accounts conflict with  Moore\u2019s grand-jury \ntestimony, in which Moore recounted Wolfe meeting with him insi de the police \ndepartment, placing the cards on Moore\u2019s desk along with a comp osite sketch of the \nsuspect, and proceeding to compare the composite with the ID ca rds in the presence of \nMoore and possibly other detectives. In our view, this aspect o f Moore\u2019s grand-jury \ntestimony potentially conflicts with his trial testimony and deposition. Once again, the trial \ncourt did not abuse its discretion in finding that Gillispie\u2019s need for this portion of Moore\u2019s \ngrand-jury testimony outweighed the residual interest in keeping it secret. \n{\u00b6 24} In his fourth argument regarding p articularized need, Gillispie  addressed \nMoore\u2019s possession of campground receipts related to an alibi d efense. In the criminal \nproceeding, Gillispie claimed that he had been camping in Kentucky on August 28, 1988, \nwhen two of the rapes occurred. Gillispie contends Moore obtained and then suppressed \nor destroyed campground records that would have confirmed the alibi. Moore has denied \nthis claim, insisting that the only Kentucky campground receipts he obtained were for the \ndates of May 26, 1988, June 24, 1988, and July 15, 1988. In opposition to this assertion, \nGillispie cited grand-jury testimony from Moore about having a \u201cfew months\u201d of \nregistration cards and about Gillispie being at the campground \u201cfour days after the girls \ngot raped.\u201d Gillispie contended this testimony at least implied  that Moore had \u201cscores of \nrecords,\u201d including records establishing that Gillispie was at the campground shortly after \nthe rapes. Although the appellants dispute Gillispie\u2019s interpretation of Moore\u2019s grand-jury  \n-14-\ntestimony, he raised a legitimate issue with which to attempt to impeach Moore or to test \nhis credibility. In addition, we ar e unaware of anywhere else i n the record that Moore \nsuggested he had records placi ng Gillispie at the campground da ys after the rapes. We \nsee no abuse of discretion in the trial court ordering the release of this portion of Moore\u2019s \ngrand-jury testimony.  \n{\u00b6 25} Gillispie\u2019s fifth particularized-need argument addressed Moore\u2019s interaction \nwith Torrie Strohman, who was G illispie\u2019s girlfriend just befor e the rapes. Gillsipie \nstressed that his section 1983 claims included allegations that  Moore had fabricated, \nmanipulated, and destroyed evidence related to conversations wi th Strohman, including \nwritten reports and audio recordings. Gillispie maintained that  he needed grand-jury \ntestimony about Moore\u2019s dealings with Strohman because the fore going issues did not \narise in the pretrial proceedings or at the criminal trials. Gi llispie characterized Moore\u2019s \ntestimony relative to Strohman as \u201cextremely illuminating\u201d and not duplicated elsewhere. \n{\u00b6 26} In its ruling releasing Moore\u2019s entire grand-jury transcript, the trial court did \nnot specifically address Gillispie\u2019s need for testimony about t he detective\u2019s interaction \nwith Strohman. On appeal, Gillsipie does not address the merits  of this issue beyond \nciting his post-hearing brief. For their part, the appellants o bject to the trial court\u2019s \nwholesale disclosure of Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony. But they do not specifically address \nGillispie\u2019s need for testimony about the detective\u2019s interaction with Strohman.  \n{\u00b6 27} Having conducted our own review of Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony  about \nhis conversations with Strohman, we see no particularized need for Gillispie to access it. \nPerhaps the most significant revelation in Moore\u2019s testimony was that Strohman told him \nshe and Gillispie previously had engaged in sexual activity at or near the rape sites. Moore  \n-15-\nincluded this information in one or more police reports, sugges ting that it demonstrated \nGillispie\u2019s familiarity with the crime scenes.  \n{\u00b6 28} In a September 21, 2020 summary judgment ruling, the federal district court \nnoted that Strohman had filed an affidavit denying that she and  Gillispie had been to the \nplaces where the rapes occurred. Her affidavit also alleged tha t Moore\u2019s reports and a \ntranscript of their conversations contained other falsehoods and included additional things \nthat she did not say. We have not been made aware of anything i n Moore\u2019s grand-jury \ntestimony that is inconsistent with the detective\u2019s later reports or statements. Rather, the \nconflict appears to be between Moore\u2019s statements and Strohman\u2019s affidavit. Gillispie has \nno need for Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony to explore this discrepancy.   \n{\u00b6 29} In his sixth argument, Gillispi e claimed he need ed Moore\u2019s gran d-jury \ntestimony to establish that Moore had spoken to one of the victims during her review of a \nphoto spread. At a post-indictment suppression hearing, Moore recalled watching as the \nvictim selected Gillispie\u2019s picture and identified him as the perpetrator after narrowing her \nchoice between a couple of photographs. In his grand-jury testi mony, Moore \nacknowledged that he actually spoke to the victim while she was  reviewing the \nphotographs, asking her whether anyone in the array looked like the perpetrator. We are \nunaware of anywhere else in the record where Moore acknowledged  speaking to the \nvictim during her identification. The trial court did not abuse  its discretion in finding a \nparticularized need for this portion of the transcript.  \n{\u00b6 30} As part of the same argument, Gillispie also sought to use Moor e\u2019s grand-\njury testimony to establish his knowledge that Gillispie\u2019s picture did not match the victims\u2019 \ndescription of the perpetrator. In particular, Moore told the grand jury that the victims had  \n-16-\ndescribed the perpetrator as having brown hair with a reddish tint. Moore then explained \nto the grand jurors that the picture in the photo array made it  appear as if Gillispie had \n\u201cdarker brown\u201d hair, whereas it actually had \u201ca brown red tint.\u201d In the subsequent criminal \nproceedings, Moore testified that Gillispie\u2019s photograph did ma tch the description \nprovided by the victims. We are unaware of any source other than the grand-jury transcript \nwhere Moore seemingly acknowledged that the photograph did not accurately depict the \nperpetrator\u2019s hair color as reported by the victims. The trial court again did not abuse its \ndiscretion in finding a particularized need for this portion of Moore\u2019s grand jury transcript. \n{\u00b6 31} In his final argument below, Gillispie asserted that he needed Moore\u2019s \ngrand-jury testimony regarding interactions that culminated in an interview at the police \ndepartment. Specifically, Gillispie claimed that Moore would not tell him why the detective \nwanted to interview him or what the investigation concerned, ev en during the interview \nitself. According to Gillispie, this lack of disclosure was inconsistent with what Moore told \nthe grand jury. Having reviewed the grand-jury transcript, howe ver, we see no conflict. \nMoore\u2019s grand-jury testimony is consistent with Gillispie\u2019s claim that the detective refused \nto tell him what the investigation concerned prior to the inter view. In addition, the \ndetective\u2019s grand-jury testimony makes clear that the detective had no reason to disclose \nthe topic during the interview because Gillispie had obtained t hat information from his \nattorney prior to the interview. The only specific conflict Gil lispie cited below involved \nwhether Moore had listed potential charges on a Miranda form before or after Gillispie \nsigned it. But that issue was not addressed in Moore\u2019s grand-ju ry testimony. Therefore, \nGillispie failed to demonstrate a particularized need for the portion of Moore\u2019s grand-jury \ntranscript recounting his interaction with Gillispie.  \n-17-\n{\u00b6 32} Turning now to the grand-jury testimony of the rape victims, Gillispie argued \nbelow that their testimony was necessary to refresh their recol lection. In a preliminary \nruling, the trial court found a particularized need for the victims\u2019 testimony because during \ntheir federal-court depositions they could not recall \u201csome det ails of events which \nhappened almost 30 years ago.\u201d (March 16, 2020 Entry at 2.) The  trial court cited one \nvictim\u2019s inability to recall whether she had been asked to go t o the police department to \nview a photo spread. During her deposition in federal court, a second victim failed to recall \nwhether she told Moore she was 90 percent sure of her identific ation or whether he told \nher she needed to be 100 percent sure. This victim also could n ot recall whether Moore \ntold her Gillispie had changed his appearance before she testif ied in court. Finally, the \ntrial court noted the third victim\u2019s inability to remember Moor e asking her how confident \nshe was in her photo identification. ( Id.) Given that Gillispie\u2019s federal lawsuit included \nallegations of Moore manipulating witnesses, the trial court fo und a particularized need \nto refresh the victims\u2019 recollection with their grand-jury testimony. (Id.) The trial court later \nreiterated its ruling in the judgment from which the appellants have appealed. (March 25, \n2021 Decision, Entry, and Order at 7.)  \n{\u00b6 33} Upon review, we see no need to refresh the first victim\u2019s recollection about \nwhether she was asked to go to the police department to view a photo spread. Throughout \nthe criminal proceedings and in their depositions, Moore and th is victim consistently \nagreed that the detective brought the photo array to her home, where she made a positive \nidentification. Without citing the record, Gillispie contends it is \u201cundisputed\u201d that this victim \nalso viewed pictures at the police department. We are unaware of anything in the record, \nhowever, establishing that this victim ever viewed a photo spre ad at the police  \n-18-\ndepartment. In the criminal proceedings, the victim explained that she went to the police \ndepartment to help create a composite drawing of the perpetrator. At times, she referred \nto this composite drawing as a \u201cpicture.\u201d But the only photo ar ray she saw was the one \npresented at her own home. Regardless of whether this victim wa s asked to go to the \npolice department to view a photo array, she never went. 2  Therefore, we see no \nparticularized need for this aspect of the victim\u2019s grand-jury testimony.  \n{\u00b6 34} We note too that the second victim did not testify about being 90 percent or \n100 percent sure during her grand-jury testimony. She did testi fy during the criminal trial \nabout telling Moore she was 90 percent sure of her identification and about him telling her \nto be 100 percent sure. Furthermore, a grand-jury transcript co uld not refresh her \nrecollection regarding something Moore later told her about Gil lispie changing his \nappearance prior to trial. This alleged statement occurred afte r the victim\u2019s grand-jury \ntestimony, which did not reference any changed appearance.  \n{\u00b6 35} Finally, the third victim provided no grand-jury testimony abou t her level of \nconfidence regarding her photo identification. Therefore, the testimony could not be used \nto refresh her recollection on that issue. In short, despite having the benefit of examining \nthe victims\u2019 grand-jury testimony, neither Gillispie nor the tr ial court identified any \n \n2 The appellants contend this victim\u2019s grand-jury testimony does not address whether she \nwas asked to view a photo spread at the police department. Desp ite our diligent review \nof the voluminous record, we have been unable to locate this pa rticular victim\u2019s grand-\njury transcript. Nevertheless, the record is devoid of evidence  that this victim ever went \nto the police department to view actual photographs. The eviden ce is all to the contrary. \nOn appeal, Gillispie cites nothing from her grand-jury transcript establishing how it would \nrefresh her recollection on the issue, and the State maintains that the issue never came \nup in this victim\u2019s grand-jury testimony. Under these circumsta nces, we are confident in \nfinding no particularized need for the grand-jury testimony eve n though we have been \nunable to locate it.   \n-19-\nparticular way to use the testimony to refresh the victims\u2019 rec ollection about any issue. \nUnder these circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion in finding a particularized \nneed to use the victims\u2019 grand-jury testimony for refreshment purposes.  \n{\u00b6 36} In his post-hearing brief below, which was filed after his coun sel had an \nopportunity to review the grand-jury testimony, Gillispie also identified two specific \ninstances where a victim\u2019s grand-jury testimony conflicted with  her later statements. In \ngrand-jury testimony, one victim recalled spending about an hou r with the perpetrator. \nThis victim testified months later that she had been with the perpetrator for about one and \na half hours. Gillispie claimed this contradiction corroborated  an expert\u2019s opinion that \nvictims often over-estimate the time they spent with a perpetra t o r .  T h e  S t a t e  n o t e d ,  \nhowever, that the same victim\u2019s original police statement indic ated that her encounter \nwith the perpetrator lasted an hour and a half. Because Gillisp ie can establish the \ncontradiction without the grand-jury testimony, we see no particularized need for it.  \n{\u00b6 37} Gillispie next asserted that another victim\u2019s testimony shifted  o v e r  t i m e  \nregarding the perpetrator\u2019s hair color. This victim originally told investigators the \nperpetrator had \u201cbrownish red hair.\u201d In subsequent grand-jury testimony, the same victim \ndescribed the perpetrator\u2019s hair color as \u201cbrown.\u201d In a Decembe r 1990 suppression \nhearing, this victim again described the perpetrator\u2019s hair col or being \u201call one color or \nmedium brown.\u201d Later, in February 1991, she identified his hair color at different times as \n\u201cthin brownish hair\u201d and \u201cbrownish thin hair with a reddish tin t to it.\u201d In June 1991, this \nwitness described the perpetrator\u2019s hair as simply \u201cbrown.\u201d  \n{\u00b6 38} Gillispie maintained that his hair lacked any redness and that Moore\u2019s \ninfluence on the victim caused her to change her testimony from  initially describing his  \n-20-\nhair as \u201cbrownish red\u201d to \u201cbrown.\u201d Gillispie also noted that Moore spoke to this victim prior \nto a post-indictment suppression hearing and told her that Gillispie had changed his hair \ncolor. According to Gillispie, this evidence suggested that Moo re had influenced the \nvictim\u2019s identification testimony and caused it to align with his true appearance.  \n{\u00b6 39} Upon review, we see no particularized need for the victim\u2019s gra nd-jury \ntestimony about the perpetrator having \u201cbrown\u201d hair. Gillispie contends he had brown hair \nwith some gray in it, that the victim\u2019s initial description of brownish red hair was inaccurate, \nand that Moore was aware of this inaccuracy and caused the vict im to change her \ntestimony. We note, however, that Gillispie\u2019s suggestion about Moore influencing the \nvictim to change her description of the perpetrator\u2019s hair over  time is undermined by the \nvictim alternately describing the perpetrator\u2019s hair color at v arious times as \u201cbrown,\u201d \n\u201cmedium brown,\u201d \u201cthinish brown,\u201d and \u201cbrownish\u201d with a \u201creddish tint.\u201d In any event, as for \nthis victim\u2019s testimony before the grand jury about the perpetr ator having \u201cbrown\u201d hair, \nshe provided the same in information during the suppression hea ring and at trial. To the \nextent that there is a distinction to be made between the perpetrator having \u201cbrown\u201d hair, \nas opposed to \u201cbrownish red hair\u201d or \u201cbrownish thin hair with a reddish tint to it,\u201d Gillispie \ncan make his point without the grand-jury testimony. \nIV. Two Additional Considerations  \n{\u00b6 40} In finding no abuse of discretion in the disclosure of limited portions  o f  \ndetective Moore\u2019s grand-jury transcript, we express no firm opi nion on the relevance of \nthose excerpts to Gillispie\u2019s pe nding federal lawsuit. For pres ent purpose, we hold only \nthat Gillispie made a sufficient threshold showing of particularized need to justify making \nthe excerpts available in his section 1983 action. His demonstr ated need outweighs the  \n-21-\nresidual need to maintain secrecy given the passage of time and  the termination of his \nprosecution. In light of its familiarity with Gillispie\u2019s pendi ng lawsuit, the federal district \ncourt is better positioned than this court to assess the ultimate relevance of the transcript \nexcerpts in the context of his section 1983 claims. We conclude only that those excerpts \nmust be made available to him.  \n{\u00b6 41} Finally, we recognize that witnesses enjoy absolute immunity fr om liability \nunder 42 U.S.C. 1983 based on their grand-jury testimony. As we  observed in In re \nJanuary 27, 2017 Order Releasing Grand Jury Materials , 2018-Ohio-988, 108 N.E.3d \n1170 (2d Dist.): \nFor purposes of federal law, a \u201cgrand jury witness has absolute  \nimmunity from any * * * claim [under 42 U.S.C. 1983] based on t he \nwitness\u2019[s] testimony,\u201d and this \u201crule may not be circumvented by [way of a] \nclaim[ ] that a grand jury witness conspired to present false testimony or by \nus[e] [of] evidence of [a] witness\u2019[s] testimony to support any  other [42 \nU.S.C.] 1983 claim concerning the initiation or maintenance of a \nprosecution.\u201d Rehberg v. Paulk , 566 U.S. 356, 369, 132 S.Ct. 1497, 182 \nL.Ed.2d 593 (2012). Immunity applies \u201cto all grand-jury witnesses, even law-\nenforcement officers who have \u2018conspired to present false testi mony.\u2019 \u201d \n(Emphasis in original.) King v. Harwood, 852 F.3d 568, 584 (6th Cir.2017), \nquoting Rehberg, 566 U.S. at 369, 132 S.Ct. 1497. \nId. at \u00b6 8. \n \n{\u00b6 42} Although section 1983 liability cannot be predicated on what a witness told \na grand jury, testimony before a grand jury may be used for oth er purposes, such as to  \n-22-\nattack a witness\u2019s credibility through impeachment. Marshall v. Randall , 719 F.3d 113, \n116-117 (2d Cir.2013). On appeal, the parties have not addresse d the potential \napplicability of the rule in Rehberg, and we express no opinion on it. We leave the issue \nfor the federal district court to address if it arises in the c ontext of Gillispie\u2019s pending \nlawsuit. We have proceeded herein on the basis that Gillispie seeks to use the grand-jury \ntestimony for permissible purposes, not as substantive evidence  underlying his section \n1983 claims.  \nV. Conclusion \n{\u00b6 43} Based on the reasoning set forth above, the appellants\u2019 assignm ents of \nerror are sustained in part and overruled in part. The assignments of error are sustained \ninsofar as the trial court erred in ordering full disclosure an d production of the grand-jury \ntestimony of all four witnesses \u201cwithout exception or limitation.\u201d The assignments of error \nare overruled, however, insofar as the appellants contend the t rial court abused its \ndiscretion in ordering disclosure and production of any grand-jury testimony.  \n{\u00b6 44} Gillispie is entitled to disclosure and production of the porti ons of detective \nMoore\u2019s grand-jury testimony addressing: (1) the timing of his involvement with the rape \ninvestigation (May or June 1990); (2) his interaction with Rich ard Wolfe regarding \nemployee identification cards and a composite sketch; (3) his possession of campground \nreceipts related to an alibi defense; and (4) his comments to one of the victims during her \nreview of a photo array and his statement seemingly acknowledgi ng that Gillispie\u2019s \nphotograph did not precisely match the perpetrator\u2019s hair color as reported by the victims. \nThe foregoing testimony is found on pages 3, 5, 6, 24, and 29 o f Moore\u2019s grand-jury \ntestimony transcript. Disclosure and production of the above-re ferenced portions of the  \n-23-\ngrand-jury testimony shall be limited to the parties and counsel solely for use in Gillispie\u2019s \npending federal lawsuit.3  \n{\u00b6 45} Gillispie failed to demonstrate his entitlement to the production or disclosure \nof any other grand-jury testimony. The trial court acted unreas onably, and therefore \nabused its discretion, in finding otherwise.  The judgment of t he Montgomery County \nCommon Pleas Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the previously-ordered \ns t a y  i s  l i f t e d .       \n. . . . . . . . . . . . . \n \nHALL, J. and EPLEY, J., concur.             \n \n \n \nC o p i e s  s e n t  t o :          \n \nMathias H.

(March 25, 2021 \nDecision, Entry, and Order at footnote 5.) For present purposes , we express no opinion \nabout Gillispie\u2019s need for grand-jury transcripts in connection with his state-court lawsuit.

No. 0081939, 3584 Mooney Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio\n45208\nThe State of Ohio, Miami Township, and Matthew Scott Moore appeal from the trial court's decision, entry, and order sustaining appellee Roger Dean Gillispie's motion for disclosure of grand-jury transcripts. Gillispie sought the transcripts in connection with his pending federal lawsuit against Moore and others alleging violations of 42 U.S.C.1983 and seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment. The federal lawsuit followed Gillispie's release from prison after serving 20 years for three rape convictions. Gillespie was released pursuant to a federal writ of habeas corpus, and the rape charges later were dismissed with prejudice. In ordering disclosure of the grand-jury transcripts, the trial court found that Gillispie had shown a \u201cparticularized need\u201d that outweighed the need to maintain grand-jury secrecy.\n\nFor the following reasons, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering full disclosure and production of the grand-jury transcripts \u201cwithout exception or limitation.\u201d Although the record supports releasing portions of one transcript, the trial court erred in ordering the release of all grand-jury testimony from all four witnesses. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\n\nA jury convicted Gillispie on three counts of rape and other charges in 1991. After being granted a new trial, he was convicted again by a second jury. Witnesses at both trials included the victims and Moore, who was the lead investigator. This court\naffirmed Gillispie\u2019s convictions on direct appeal. Two decades of post-conviction actions followed, culminating in (1) the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio granting Gillispie a conditional writ of habeas corpus based on a violation of *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), vacating his convictions, and ordering him retried and (2) this court ordering a new trial based on an alternate-suspect theory. See *Gillispie v. Timmermans-Cooper*, 835 F.Supp.2d 482 (S.D. Ohio 2011); *State v. Gillispie*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26965, 2016-Ohio-7688. Following the State\u2019s inability to produce supplemental police reports underlying the *Brady* violation, the trial court later dismissed Gillespie\u2019s indictment with prejudice. Gillispie then filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging violations of 42 U.S.C. 1983. The lawsuit included several state-law claims. Defendants in the action included Moore and Miami Township. In September 2020, the federal court disposed of all claims except the section 1983 claims against Moore.\n\n{\u00b6 4} Gillispie filed a motion in the trial court below seeking transcripts of grand jury testimony from Moore and the three rape victims. He argued that he needed the testimony to obtain a fair adjudication of his federal claims and that such need outweighed any need to maintain grand-jury secrecy. In a March 25, 2021 ruling, the trial court sustained Gillispie\u2019s motion. It ordered disclosure and production of the grand-jury testimony of all four witnesses \u201cwithout exception or limitation.\u201d This appeal followed.\n\nII. Governing Law\n\n{\u00b6 5} The long-standing rule in Ohio and elsewhere is that grand-jury proceedings are secret. *Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. v. United States*, 360 U.S. 395, 399-400, 79 S.Ct. 1237, 3 L.Ed.2d 1323 (1959) (recognizing a history and tradition of grand-jury secrecy \u201colder than our Nation itself\u201d); *In re Rice*, 2018-Ohio-1087, 109 N.E.3d 608, \u00b6 18 (8th Dist.)\n(\u201cIt is critical to its functioning that the secretive nature of the work of a grand jury remain sacrosanct and inviolable. As such, that secrecy has long been \u2018jealously guarded\u2019 by Ohio courts.\u201d). The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized a \u201climited exception\u201d allowing disclosure of grand-jury transcripts where \u201c\u2018the ends of justice require it and there is a showing * * * that a particularized need for disclosure exists which outweighs the need for secrecy.\u2019\u201d State v. Graham, 164 Ohio St. 3d 187, 2020-Ohio-6700, 172 N.E.3d 841, \u00b6 25, quoting State v. Greer, 66 Ohio St.2d 139, 420 N.E.2d 982 (1981), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n\u00b6 6 \u201cA particularized need is established \u2018when the circumstances reveal a probability that the failure to provide the grand jury testimony will deny the [movant] a fair trial.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting State v. Sellards, 17 Ohio St.3d 169, 173, 478 N.E.2d 781 (1985). A particularized need for grand-jury testimony may arise when such testimony is required to impeach a witness, to refresh recollection, or to test credibility. Greer at 145, citing United States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677, 78 S.Ct. 983, 2 L.Ed.2d 1077 (1958). The particularized-need requirement helps ensure that when grand-jury secrecy is lifted, it is done \u201cdiscretely and limitedly.\u201d Proctor & Gamble Co. at 683. Whether a particularized need exists is a question of fact for a trial court to resolve within its discretion. State v. Perkins, 191 Ohio App.3d 263, 2010-Ohio-5161, 945 N.E.2d 1083, \u00b6 45 (2d Dist.).\n\n\u00b6 7 To evaluate the need for secrecy of grand-jury proceedings, courts consider the following rationales for preserving secrecy: \u201c\u2018(1) To prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated; (2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent persons subject to indictment or their friends from\nimportuning the grand jurors; (3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may testify before grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it; (4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have information with respect to the commission of crimes; (5) to protect innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact that he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial where there was no probability of guilt.\u2019 \" In re Petition for Disclosure of Evidence Presented to Franklin County Grand Juries in 1970, 63 Ohio St.2d 212, 219, 407 N.E.2d 513, (1980), quoting United States v. Rose, 215 F.2d 617, 628-629 (3d Cir.1954).\n\n\u00b6 8 We review a trial court\u2019s ruling regarding access to grand-jury testimony for an abuse of discretion. State v. Brown, 38 Ohio St.3d 305, 308, 528 N.E.2d 523 (1988). \u201c \u2018Abuse of discretion\u2019 has been defined as an attitude that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. It is to be expected that most instances of abuse of discretion will result in decisions that are simply unreasonable, rather than decisions that are unconscionable or arbitrary.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 46. \u201cA decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process that would support that decision.\u201d AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Redevelopment, 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597 (1990).\n\nIII. Analysis\n\n\u00b6 9 In a joint brief, Miami Township and Moore advance the following assignment of error:\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT COMPROMISED THE SECRECY OF THE GRAND JURY WHEN IT RULED THAT PETITIONER-GILLISPIE HAD DEMONSTRATED\nPARTICULARIZED NEED AND DISCLOSED THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE\nGRAND JURY PROCEEDINGS.\n\n\u00b6 10 In a separate appellate brief, the State raises the following two assignments of error:\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW BY\nRELEASING GRAND JURY TRANSCRIPTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY\nWITHOUT FIRST PROPERLY DETERMINING WHETHER THE\nPARTICULARIZED NEED FOR THE TRANSCRIPTS THAT GILLISPIE\nALLEGED COULD BE MET THROUGH OTHER SOURCES.\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY FINDING THAT THERE IS NO\nNEED TO PRESERVE THE SECRECY OF THE GRAND JURY\nPROCEEDINGS IN THIS CASE IN ANY FORM AND TO ANY EXTENT.\n\n\u00b6 11 We begin our analysis by recognizing that four of the five traditional\njustifications for preserving grand-jury secrecy do not apply here. There is no concern\nabout Gillispie \u201cescaping\u201d before his indictment. There is no risk of people importuning\nhis grand jurors, suborning perjury, or tampering with the grand jurors. Nor is there any\nconcern about protecting Gillispie from disclosure of the fact that a grand jury investigated\nhim. Given that the grand-jury proceedings concluded more than 30 years ago and\nGillispie previously was indicted and convicted, the foregoing considerations do not justify\nmaintaining grand-jury secrecy in this case.\n\n\u00b6 12 One factor, however, remains applicable, namely the need to encourage\nfree and full disclosures by potential future grand-jury witnesses. The U.S. Supreme Court\nhas recognized that \u201c[p]arties seeking grand jury transcripts * * * must show that the\nmaterial they seek is needed to avoid a possible injustice in another judicial proceeding, that the need for disclosure is greater than the need for continued secrecy, and that their request is structured to cover only material so needed.\" *Douglas Oil Co. of California v. Petrol Stops Northwest*, 441 U.S. 211, 222, 99 S.Ct. 1667, 60 L.Ed.2d 156 (1979). \u201cSuch a showing must be made even when the grand jury whose transcripts are sought has concluded its operations * * *. For in considering the effects of disclosure on grand jury proceedings, the courts must consider not only the immediate effects upon a particular grand jury, but also the possible effect upon the functioning of future grand juries.\u201d (Emphasis added.) *Id.* The practice of disclosing grand-jury testimony \u201crenders considerably more concrete the threat to the willingness of witnesses to come forward and to testify fully and candidly.\u201d *United States v. Sells Engineering, Inc.*, 463 U.S. 418, 432, 103 S. Ct. 3133, 77 L. Ed. 2d 743 (1983); see also *State v. Owens*, 4th Dist. Gallia No. 14CA9, 2015-Ohio-3017, \u00b6 14 (quoting *Douglas Oil* and noting that \u201cconcerns with freedom in grand jury deliberations and the encouragement of free and untrammeled disclosures by persons with information are always present because * * * \u2018[p]ersons called upon to testify will consider the likelihood that their testimony may one day be disclosed to outside parties\u2019 \u201d).\n\n\u00b6 13 As the need for secrecy decreases, however, the requisite showing of particularized need also decreases. *Douglas Oil* at 223 (noting that \u201cas the considerations justifying secrecy become less relevant, a party asserting a need for grand jury transcripts will have a lesser burden in showing justification\u201d). \u201c[W]hen there is a balancing of the often minimal need to preserve secrecy against the need for the defendant to review certain portions of the grand jury testimony, * * * all relevant portions of the transcript\nshould be produced, with the trial court deleting extraneous matters, and issuing protective orders where necessary.\u201d *Greer* at 151.\n\n{\u00b6 14} In the present case, the trial court ignored the residual interest in preserving grand-jury secrecy that remains even after a criminal case long since has concluded. It found that the appellants had \u201cutterly failed to establish any need for secrecy.\u201d (March 25, 2021 Decision, Entry, and Order at 3.) In response to the appellants\u2019 concern about a potential \u201cchilling effect\u201d on future grand juries if the transcripts at issue were released, the trial court characterized their argument as \u201cadvocating for secrecy for the sake of secrecy.\u201d It reasoned that, \u201cfollowed to its logical conclusion, the State\u2019s \u2018chilling effect\u2019 argument would literally prohibit the discovery, production and use of [g]rand [j]ury [t]estimony in every case, no matter the State\u2019s excesses.\u201d The trial court opined that \u201c[t]his cannot be the law in a free society.\u201d (*Id.* at 8-9.)\n\n{\u00b6 15} The case law cited above makes clear, however, that recognizing the potential impact of disclosure on the functioning of future grand juries does not \u201cliterally prohibit\u201d the release of any grand-jury testimony in every case. Rather, case law establishes that this residual interest in preserving secrecy simply must be weighed against the movant\u2019s particularized need for disclosure. As our analysis herein will demonstrate, a movant\u2019s interest in disclosure sometimes may outweigh a relatively minor interest in maintaining secrecy. In such a case, a court should release only necessary portions of a grand-jury transcript while excluding extraneous testimony.\n\n{\u00b6 16} Having found that a general interest in preserving grand-jury secrecy still exists in this case, we turn to the particularized-need issue. In his attempt to establish a particularized need for the grand-jury transcripts, Gillispie finds himself in a better position\nthan most litigants. In the proceedings below, the trial court actually reviewed those transcripts and permitted counsel to do likewise. In this posture, Gillispie need not speculate about whether the grand-jury transcripts might contain testimony that is useful to impeach a witness, to refresh recollection, or to test credibility in his federal lawsuit. Having enjoyed the benefit of examining the transcripts, the parties know what they contain.\n\n\u00b6 17 Based on his review of the transcripts, Gillispie argued below that he needed Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony to ensure a fair adjudication of his section 1983 claims and to prevent misleading the trier-of-fact in the federal lawsuit. In post-hearing briefing before the trial court, Gillispie noted that Moore sometimes failed to remember certain facts about his investigation while being deposed in 2018. Gillispie also argued that Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony disclosed previously unknown facts and sometimes contradicted Moore\u2019s later statements in the rape case. In all, Gillispie\u2019s post-hearing brief cited more than 20 instances during Moore\u2019s 2018 deposition in which he failed to recall things about his investigation. Gillispie\u2019s post-hearing brief also cited seven specific instances in which he believed Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony was needed for purposes of refreshing recollection, impeaching, or testing Moore\u2019s credibility. (March 19, 2021 Petitioner\u2019s Brief at 10-21.) Because Gillispie bore the burden of establishing a particularized need, we will confine our review of Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony to the instances he cited.\n\n\u00b6 18 In conducting our review, we are mindful that no particularized need exists if Gillispie can obtain elsewhere the information he seeks from grand-jury testimony. Indeed, if Moore\u2019s testimony before the grand jury was merely cumulative of statements\nhe made other places (including reports, hearings, at the two criminal trials, or in his 2018 deposition), then no \u201cneed\u201d for the grand-jury testimony exists at all. In such a circumstance, Gillispie can refresh recollection, impeach, or otherwise test Moore\u2019s credibility by using an alternative source. See In re January 27, 2017 Order Releasing Grand Jury Materials, 2018-Ohio-988, 108 N.E.3d 1170, \u00b6 10 (2d Dist.) (finding no \u201cparticularized need\u201d where \u201cthe transcript of M.H.\u2019s grand jury testimony would provide little or no additional information germane to C.P.\u2019s claim against M.H.\u201d); State v. Webb, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2005-CA-52, 2006-Ohio-1113, \u00b6 13 (finding an absence of particularized need where appellant \u201cdid not present a compelling argument that the only way for him to substantiate his claims against the deputies was through the use of the grand jury testimony\u201d); State ex rel. Dann v. Taft, 109 Ohio St. 3d 364, 2006-Ohio-1825, 848 N.E.2d 472, \u00b6 68 (recognizing in the executive-privilege context that particularized need \u201cdoes not exist when privileged information can be obtained elsewhere\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 19 In his post-hearing brief below, Gillispie listed 29 pages from Moore\u2019s 2018 deposition in which Moore purportedly failed to recall specifics of his investigation. Gillispie claimed Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony was necessary to refresh the detective\u2019s recollection on those issues. With one exception that will be discussed below, however, Gillispie made no attempt to show how the grand-jury testimony would help refresh Moore\u2019s recollection on any particular issue. Likewise, on appeal Gillispie simply refers to deposition pages where Moore failed to remember things. (Brief of Appellee-Petitioner at 17, 22.) For its part, the trial court also noted Moore\u2019s inability to remember things during his 2018 deposition. (March 25, 2021 Decision, Entry, and Order at 5.) It does not follow, however, that Gillispie needs Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony simply because Moore cannot\nremember certain things. Without any showing that Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony would refresh Moore\u2019s recollection on a particular issue (and that Moore\u2019s recollection could not be refreshed from another source), Gillispie failed to demonstrate a particularized need for the grand-jury testimony for refreshment purposes.\u00b9\n\n\u00b6 20 With regard to the seven specific arguments raised in Gillispie\u2019s post-hearing brief below, he did assert that he needed grand-jury testimony to refresh Moore\u2019s recollection about a composite sketch of the rape suspect. When testifying before the grand jury, Moore identified who drew the sketch. In his 2018 deposition, he could not recall that information. The appellants argue that the artist\u2019s identity is not relevant to the federal lawsuit, whereas Gillispie claims the artist\u2019s identity is a proper subject of discovery in that action. Upon review, we fail to see how the identity of the sketch artist (who was not Moore) is itself relevant to Gillispie\u2019s section 1983 claims. At most, the artist\u2019s identity perhaps could lead to the discovery of relevant information in the federal lawsuit. But such an assertion is speculative, and grand-jury testimony is not properly disclosed to aid in general discovery. Greer at 147, quoting State v. Laskey, 21 Ohio St.2d 187, 191, 257 N.E.2d 65 (1970), vacated on other grounds, Lasky v. Ohio, 408 U.S. 936, 92 S.Ct. 2861, 33 L.Ed.2d 753 (1972); see also State v. Boehm, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16335, 1997 WL 856285, *2 (Dec. 31, 1997); State v. Carte, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 91534, 2009-Ohio-4193, \u00b6 28; State v. Tenbrook, 34 Ohio Misc.2d 14, 15, 517 N.E.2d\n\n\u00b9 This court itself could examine each of the 29 pages cited from Moore\u2019s deposition and then independently study his grand-jury testimony to seek to determine whether anything in the grand-jury transcript might refresh his recollection on a material issue. But \u201c[a]n appellate court is not a ferret[.]\u201d State v. Sullivan, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23948, 2011-Ohio-2976, \u00b6 42 (Froelich, J., concurring). Gillispie bore the burden to demonstrate a particularized need to use Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony for refreshment purposes. String citing 29 pages from a deposition failed to meet this burden.\nRegardless, we see no probability that a failure to provide Gillispie with the identity of a sketch artist will deprive him of a fair trial in federal court.\n\n\u00b6 21 Gillispie\u2019s second attempt to show particularized need involved the timing of Moore\u2019s involvement with the rape investigation. Moore consistently asserted in connection with Gillispie\u2019s criminal trial and his deposition in federal court that he was assigned to the case on June 18, 1990. In his grand-jury testimony, however, Moore testified that he was assigned to the case in May 1990. Gillispie claims this discrepancy is significant insofar as it impacts what was in the investigatory file when Moore became involved. One issue in federal court is an allegation that Moore suppressed or destroyed an exonerating report prepared by other detectives who were working on the case in May 1990. If Moore also was working on the case in May 1990, this fact would lend credence to Gillispie\u2019s theory that Moore knew about the report\u2014a fact Moore denies.\n\n\u00b6 22 The appellants contend Gillispie should not be allowed to use the grand-jury testimony because he previously never disputed whether Moore\u2019s involvement began in June 1990. Prior to reviewing the grand-jury testimony, however, Gillispie had no reason to dispute Moore\u2019s claim about when he became involved. Now Gillispie does have a reason to question the timing of Moore\u2019s involvement. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Gillispie\u2019s need for this portion of Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony outweighed any interest in keeping it secret.\n\n\u00b6 23 Gillispie\u2019s third argument on the particularized-need issue concerned Moore\u2019s interaction with Richard Wolfe, who had been Gillispie\u2019s supervisor at General Motors. Wolfe arrived at the police department during the investigation and dropped off several employee identification cards, including one from Gillispie. At trial, Moore testified\nthat he obtained the ID cards from Wolfe outside the police department and gave them to Sergeant Steven Fritz. In his 2018 deposition, Moore recalled briefly meeting with Wolfe and Fritz about the cards inside the police department and Fritz putting the cards in a file. Gillispie contends both of the foregoing accounts conflict with Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony, in which Moore recounted Wolfe meeting with him inside the police department, placing the cards on Moore\u2019s desk along with a composite sketch of the suspect, and proceeding to compare the composite with the ID cards in the presence of Moore and possibly other detectives. In our view, this aspect of Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony potentially conflicts with his trial testimony and deposition. Once again, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Gillispie\u2019s need for this portion of Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony outweighed the residual interest in keeping it secret.\n\n\u00b6 24 In his fourth argument regarding particularized need, Gillispie addressed Moore\u2019s possession of campground receipts related to an alibi defense. In the criminal proceeding, Gillispie claimed that he had been camping in Kentucky on August 28, 1988, when two of the rapes occurred. Gillispie contends Moore obtained and then suppressed or destroyed campground records that would have confirmed the alibi. Moore has denied this claim, insisting that the only Kentucky campground receipts he obtained were for the dates of May 26, 1988, June 24, 1988, and July 15, 1988. In opposition to this assertion, Gillispie cited grand-jury testimony from Moore about having a \u201cfew months\u201d of registration cards and about Gillispie being at the campground \u201cfour days after the girls got raped.\u201d Gillispie contended this testimony at least implied that Moore had \u201cscores of records,\u201d including records establishing that Gillispie was at the campground shortly after the rapes. Although the appellants dispute Gillispie\u2019s interpretation of Moore\u2019s grand-jury\ntestimony, he raised a legitimate issue with which to attempt to impeach Moore or to test his credibility. In addition, we are unaware of anywhere else in the record that Moore suggested he had records placing Gillispie at the campground days after the rapes. We see no abuse of discretion in the trial court ordering the release of this portion of Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony.\n\n\u00b6 25 Gillispie\u2019s fifth particularized-need argument addressed Moore\u2019s interaction with Torrie Strohman, who was Gillispie\u2019s girlfriend just before the rapes. Gillispie stressed that his section 1983 claims included allegations that Moore had fabricated, manipulated, and destroyed evidence related to conversations with Strohman, including written reports and audio recordings. Gillispie maintained that he needed grand-jury testimony about Moore\u2019s dealings with Strohman because the foregoing issues did not arise in the pretrial proceedings or at the criminal trials. Gillispie characterized Moore\u2019s testimony relative to Strohman as \u201cextremely illuminating\u201d and not duplicated elsewhere.\n\n\u00b6 26 In its ruling releasing Moore\u2019s entire grand-jury transcript, the trial court did not specifically address Gillispie\u2019s need for testimony about the detective\u2019s interaction with Strohman. On appeal, Gillispie does not address the merits of this issue beyond citing his post-hearing brief. For their part, the appellants object to the trial court\u2019s wholesale disclosure of Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony. But they do not specifically address Gillispie\u2019s need for testimony about the detective\u2019s interaction with Strohman.\n\n\u00b6 27 Having conducted our own review of Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony about his conversations with Strohman, we see no particularized need for Gillispie to access it. Perhaps the most significant revelation in Moore\u2019s testimony was that Strohman told him she and Gillispie previously had engaged in sexual activity at or near the rape sites. Moore\nincluded this information in one or more police reports, suggesting that it demonstrated Gillispie\u2019s familiarity with the crime scenes.\n\n{\u00b6 28} In a September 21, 2020 summary judgment ruling, the federal district court noted that Strohman had filed an affidavit denying that she and Gillispie had been to the places where the rapes occurred. Her affidavit also alleged that Moore\u2019s reports and a transcript of their conversations contained other falsehoods and included additional things that she did not say. We have not been made aware of anything in Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony that is inconsistent with the detective\u2019s later reports or statements. Rather, the conflict appears to be between Moore\u2019s statements and Strohman\u2019s affidavit. Gillispie has no need for Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony to explore this discrepancy.\n\n{\u00b6 29} In his sixth argument, Gillispie claimed he needed Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony to establish that Moore had spoken to one of the victims during her review of a photo spread. At a post-indictment suppression hearing, Moore recalled watching as the victim selected Gillispie\u2019s picture and identified him as the perpetrator after narrowing her choice between a couple of photographs. In his grand-jury testimony, Moore acknowledged that he actually spoke to the victim while she was reviewing the photographs, asking her whether anyone in the array looked like the perpetrator. We are unaware of anywhere else in the record where Moore acknowledged speaking to the victim during her identification. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding a particularized need for this portion of the transcript.\n\n{\u00b6 30} As part of the same argument, Gillispie also sought to use Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony to establish his knowledge that Gillispie\u2019s picture did not match the victims\u2019 description of the perpetrator. In particular, Moore told the grand jury that the victims had\ndescribed the perpetrator as having brown hair with a reddish tint. Moore then explained to the grand jurors that the picture in the photo array made it appear as if Gillispie had \u201cdarker brown\u201d hair, whereas it actually had \u201ca brown red tint.\u201d In the subsequent criminal proceedings, Moore testified that Gillispie\u2019s photograph did match the description provided by the victims. We are unaware of any source other than the grand-jury transcript where Moore seemingly acknowledged that the photograph did not accurately depict the perpetrator\u2019s hair color as reported by the victims. The trial court again did not abuse its discretion in finding a particularized need for this portion of Moore\u2019s grand jury transcript.\n\n\u00b6 31 In his final argument below, Gillispie asserted that he needed Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony regarding interactions that culminated in an interview at the police department. Specifically, Gillispie claimed that Moore would not tell him why the detective wanted to interview him or what the investigation concerned, even during the interview itself. According to Gillispie, this lack of disclosure was inconsistent with what Moore told the grand jury. Having reviewed the grand-jury transcript, however, we see no conflict. Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony is consistent with Gillispie\u2019s claim that the detective refused to tell him what the investigation concerned prior to the interview. In addition, the detective\u2019s grand-jury testimony makes clear that the detective had no reason to disclose the topic during the interview because Gillispie had obtained that information from his attorney prior to the interview. The only specific conflict Gillispie cited below involved whether Moore had listed potential charges on a Miranda form before or after Gillispie signed it. But that issue was not addressed in Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony. Therefore, Gillispie failed to demonstrate a particularized need for the portion of Moore\u2019s grand-jury transcript recounting his interaction with Gillispie.\nTurning now to the grand-jury testimony of the rape victims, Gillispie argued below that their testimony was necessary to refresh their recollection. In a preliminary ruling, the trial court found a particularized need for the victims\u2019 testimony because during their federal-court depositions they could not recall \u201csome details of events which happened almost 30 years ago.\u201d (March 16, 2020 Entry at 2.) The trial court cited one victim\u2019s inability to recall whether she had been asked to go to the police department to view a photo spread. During her deposition in federal court, a second victim failed to recall whether she told Moore she was 90 percent sure of her identification or whether he told her she needed to be 100 percent sure. This victim also could not recall whether Moore told her Gillispie had changed his appearance before she testified in court. Finally, the trial court noted the third victim\u2019s inability to remember Moore asking her how confident she was in her photo identification. (Id.) Given that Gillispie\u2019s federal lawsuit included allegations of Moore manipulating witnesses, the trial court found a particularized need to refresh the victims\u2019 recollection with their grand-jury testimony. (Id.) The trial court later reiterated its ruling in the judgment from which the appellants have appealed. (March 25, 2021 Decision, Entry, and Order at 7.)\n\nUpon review, we see no need to refresh the first victim\u2019s recollection about whether she was asked to go to the police department to view a photo spread. Throughout the criminal proceedings and in their depositions, Moore and this victim consistently agreed that the detective brought the photo array to her home, where she made a positive identification. Without citing the record, Gillispie contends it is \u201cundisputed\u201d that this victim also viewed pictures at the police department. We are unaware of anything in the record, however, establishing that this victim ever viewed a photo spread at the police\ndepartment. In the criminal proceedings, the victim explained that she went to the police department to help create a composite drawing of the perpetrator. At times, she referred to this composite drawing as a \u201cpicture.\u201d But the only photo array she saw was the one presented at her own home. Regardless of whether this victim was asked to go to the police department to view a photo array, she never went. Therefore, we see no particularized need for this aspect of the victim\u2019s grand-jury testimony.\n\n{\u00b6 34} We note too that the second victim did not testify about being 90 percent or 100 percent sure during her grand-jury testimony. She did testify during the criminal trial about telling Moore she was 90 percent sure of her identification and about him telling her to be 100 percent sure. Furthermore, a grand-jury transcript could not refresh her recollection regarding something Moore later told her about Gillispie changing his appearance prior to trial. This alleged statement occurred after the victim\u2019s grand-jury testimony, which did not reference any changed appearance.\n\n{\u00b6 35} Finally, the third victim provided no grand-jury testimony about her level of confidence regarding her photo identification. Therefore, the testimony could not be used to refresh her recollection on that issue. In short, despite having the benefit of examining the victims\u2019 grand-jury testimony, neither Gillispie nor the trial court identified any\n\n---\n\n2 The appellants contend this victim\u2019s grand-jury testimony does not address whether she was asked to view a photo spread at the police department. Despite our diligent review of the voluminous record, we have been unable to locate this particular victim\u2019s grand-jury transcript. Nevertheless, the record is devoid of evidence that this victim ever went to the police department to view actual photographs. The evidence is all to the contrary. On appeal, Gillispie cites nothing from her grand-jury transcript establishing how it would refresh her recollection on the issue, and the State maintains that the issue never came up in this victim\u2019s grand-jury testimony. Under these circumstances, we are confident in finding no particularized need for the grand-jury testimony even though we have been unable to locate it.\nparticular way to use the testimony to refresh the victims\u2019 recollection about any issue. Under these circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion in finding a particularized need to use the victims\u2019 grand-jury testimony for refreshment purposes.\n\n\u00b6 36 In his post-hearing brief below, which was filed after his counsel had an opportunity to review the grand-jury testimony, Gillispie also identified two specific instances where a victim\u2019s grand-jury testimony conflicted with her later statements. In grand-jury testimony, one victim recalled spending about an hour with the perpetrator. This victim testified months later that she had been with the perpetrator for about one and a half hours. Gillispie claimed this contradiction corroborated an expert\u2019s opinion that victims often over-estimate the time they spent with a perpetrator. The State noted, however, that the same victim\u2019s original police statement indicated that her encounter with the perpetrator lasted an hour and a half. Because Gillispie can establish the contradiction without the grand-jury testimony, we see no particularized need for it.\n\n\u00b6 37 Gillispie next asserted that another victim\u2019s testimony shifted over time regarding the perpetrator\u2019s hair color. This victim originally told investigators the perpetrator had \u201cbrownish red hair.\u201d In subsequent grand-jury testimony, the same victim described the perpetrator\u2019s hair color as \u201cbrown.\u201d In a December 1990 suppression hearing, this victim again described the perpetrator\u2019s hair color being \u201call one color or medium brown.\u201d Later, in February 1991, she identified his hair color at different times as \u201cthin brownish hair\u201d and \u201cbrownish thin hair with a reddish tint to it.\u201d In June 1991, this witness described the perpetrator\u2019s hair as simply \u201cbrown.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 38 Gillispie maintained that his hair lacked any redness and that Moore\u2019s influence on the victim caused her to change her testimony from initially describing his\nhair as \u201cbrownish red\u201d to \u201cbrown.\u201d Gillispie also noted that Moore spoke to this victim prior to a post-indictment suppression hearing and told her that Gillispie had changed his hair color. According to Gillispie, this evidence suggested that Moore had influenced the victim\u2019s identification testimony and caused it to align with his true appearance.\n\n{\u00b6 39} Upon review, we see no particularized need for the victim\u2019s grand-jury testimony about the perpetrator having \u201cbrown\u201d hair. Gillispie contends he had brown hair with some gray in it, that the victim\u2019s initial description of brownish red hair was inaccurate, and that Moore was aware of this inaccuracy and caused the victim to change her testimony. We note, however, that Gillispie\u2019s suggestion about Moore influencing the victim to change her description of the perpetrator\u2019s hair over time is undermined by the victim alternately describing the perpetrator\u2019s hair color at various times as \u201cbrown,\u201d \u201cmedium brown,\u201d \u201cthinish brown,\u201d and \u201cbrownish\u201d with a \u201creddish tint.\u201d In any event, as for this victim\u2019s testimony before the grand jury about the perpetrator having \u201cbrown\u201d hair, she provided the same in information during the suppression hearing and at trial. To the extent that there is a distinction to be made between the perpetrator having \u201cbrown\u201d hair, as opposed to \u201cbrownish red hair\u201d or \u201cbrownish thin hair with a reddish tint to it,\u201d Gillispie can make his point without the grand-jury testimony.\n\nIV. Two Additional Considerations\n\n{\u00b6 40} In finding no abuse of discretion in the disclosure of limited portions of detective Moore\u2019s grand-jury transcript, we express no firm opinion on the relevance of those excerpts to Gillispie\u2019s pending federal lawsuit. For present purpose, we hold only that Gillispie made a sufficient threshold showing of particularized need to justify making the excerpts available in his section 1983 action. His demonstrated need outweighs the\nresidual need to maintain secrecy given the passage of time and the termination of his prosecution. In light of its familiarity with Gillispie\u2019s pending lawsuit, the federal district court is better positioned than this court to assess the ultimate relevance of the transcript excerpts in the context of his section 1983 claims. We conclude only that those excerpts must be made available to him.\n\n\u00b6 41 Finally, we recognize that witnesses enjoy absolute immunity from liability under 42 U.S.C. 1983 based on their grand-jury testimony. As we observed in In re January 27, 2017 Order Releasing Grand Jury Materials, 2018-Ohio-988, 108 N.E.3d 1170 (2d Dist.):\n\nFor purposes of federal law, a \u201cgrand jury witness has absolute immunity from any * * * claim [under 42 U.S.C. 1983] based on the witness'[s] testimony,\u201d and this \u201crule may not be circumvented by [way of a] claim[ ] that a grand jury witness conspired to present false testimony or by us[e] [of] evidence of [a] witness'[s] testimony to support any other [42 U.S.C.] 1983 claim concerning the initiation or maintenance of a prosecution.\u201d Rehberg v. Paulk, 566 U.S. 356, 369, 132 S.Ct. 1497, 182 L.Ed.2d 593 (2012). Immunity applies \u201cto all grand-jury witnesses, even law-enforcement officers who have \u2018conspired to present false testimony.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) King v. Harwood, 852 F.3d 568, 584 (6th Cir.2017), quoting Rehberg, 566 U.S. at 369, 132 S.Ct. 1497.\n\nId. at \u00b6 8.\n\n\u00b6 42 Although section 1983 liability cannot be predicated on what a witness told a grand jury, testimony before a grand jury may be used for other purposes, such as to\nattack a witness\u2019s credibility through impeachment. *Marshall v. Randall*, 719 F.3d 113, 116-117 (2d Cir.2013). On appeal, the parties have not addressed the potential applicability of the rule in *Rehberg*, and we express no opinion on it. We leave the issue for the federal district court to address if it arises in the context of Gillispie\u2019s pending lawsuit. We have proceeded herein on the basis that Gillispie seeks to use the grand-jury testimony for permissible purposes, not as substantive evidence underlying his section 1983 claims.\n\nV. Conclusion\n\n\u00b6 43 Based on the reasoning set forth above, the appellants\u2019 assignments of error are sustained in part and overruled in part. The assignments of error are sustained insofar as the trial court erred in ordering full disclosure and production of the grand-jury testimony of all four witnesses \u201cwithout exception or limitation.\u201d The assignments of error are overruled, however, insofar as the appellants contend the trial court abused its discretion in ordering disclosure and production of any grand-jury testimony.\n\n\u00b6 44 Gillispie is entitled to disclosure and production of the portions of detective Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony addressing: (1) the timing of his involvement with the rape investigation (May or June 1990); (2) his interaction with Richard Wolfe regarding employee identification cards and a composite sketch; (3) his possession of campground receipts related to an alibi defense; and (4) his comments to one of the victims during her review of a photo array and his statement seemingly acknowledging that Gillispie\u2019s photograph did not precisely match the perpetrator\u2019s hair color as reported by the victims. The foregoing testimony is found on pages 3, 5, 6, 24, and 29 of Moore\u2019s grand-jury testimony transcript. Disclosure and production of the above-referenced portions of the\ngrand-jury testimony shall be limited to the parties and counsel solely for use in Gillispie\u2019s pending federal lawsuit.  \n\n\u00b6 45 Gillispie failed to demonstrate his entitlement to the production or disclosure of any other grand-jury testimony. The trial court acted unreasonably, and therefore abused its discretion, in finding otherwise. The judgment of the Montgomery County Common Pleas Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the previously-ordered stay is lifted.\n\nHALL, J. and EPLEY, J., concur.\n\nCopies sent to:\n\nMathias H. Heck, Jr.\nAndrew T. French\nFrank H. Scialdone\nCara M. Wright\nEdward J. Dowd\nDawn M. Frick\nChristopher T. Herman\nMichele L. Berry\nDavid B. Owens\nHon. Steven K. Dankof\n\n---\n\n3 The trial court noted that Gillispie also had a civil lawsuit pending in Montgomery County Common Pleas Court. It declined to address the relevance of the grand-jury transcripts to that lawsuit in part because Gillispie had not briefed the issue. (March 25, 2021 Decision, Entry, and Order at footnote 5.) For present purposes, we express no opinion about Gillispie\u2019s need for grand-jury transcripts in connection with his state-court lawsuit."}

Also pending are Dixon\u2019s motions for leave to  2.\nfile commitment papers, leave to file judicial notice, and to proceed in forma pauperis.   \nAs set forth below, the state\u2019s motion is well-taken, and Dixon\u2019s petition is dismissed.   \nProcedural History \n{\u00b6 2} Dixon is imprisoned pursuant to a 2006 conviction in the Montgomery \nCounty Court of Common Pleas for complicity to commit aggravated robbery, in \nviolation of R.C. 2911.01, a felony of the first degree (Count 1); complicity to commit \naggravated burglary, in violation of R.C. 2911.11, a felony of the first degree (Count 2); \nand complicity to commit felonious assault, in violation of R.C. 2903.11, a felony of the \nsecond degree (Count 3).  Dixon was also convicted of three firearm specifications, \npursuant to R.C. 2941.145, one for each count.  The trial court sentenced Dixon to an \naggregate term of 21 years in prison.   \n{\u00b6 3} Dixon appealed, and the Second Appellate District affirmed Dixon\u2019s \nconviction and sentence in toto.  State v. Dixon, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21823, 2008-\nOhio-755, \u00b6 50; appeal not accepted for review, 119 Ohio St.3d 1416, 2008-Ohio-755, \n891 N.E.2d 773; (\u201cDixon I\u201d).   \n{\u00b6 4} Over the years, Dixon has filed many motions for postconviction relief.  \nFollowing adverse trial court judgments, Dixon pursued five separate appeals, all of \nwhich were unsuccessful.  See State v. Dixon, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27991, 2019-\nOhio-230, \u00b6 2-12 (\u201cDixon VI\u201d) for a synopsis of Dixon II, Dixon III, Dixon IV, and Dixon \nV.       3.\n{\u00b6 5} Dixon simultaneously pursued habeas relief.1  On March 6, 2018, Dixon \nfiled a petition for a writ of habeas corpus against a former warden of the Toledo \nCorrectional Institution.  State ex rel. Dixon v. Coleman, Warden, 6th Dist. Lucas No.  \nL-18-1042 (Mar. 13, 2018).  Dixon asserted claims relating to the length of his sentence, \nappointment of trial counsel, trial judge bias, discovery errors and misconduct by the \nprosecution.  We denied the writ, and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed our decision.  \nState ex rel. Dixon v. Bowerman, Slip Opinion No. 2018-0621, 2019-Ohio-716, \u00b6 5.  \n{\u00b6 6} On March 28, 2019, Dixon filed another petition for a writ of habeas corpus \nin this court.    We described Dixon\u2019s claims as follows:  \n Dixon\u2019s petition begins with three specific grounds for relief \n(ineffective assistance; prosecutorial misconduct; and abuse of discretion \nby all judges), and he also asserts he was unlawfully restrained because of \nhis \u201cactual innocence.\u201d  Furthermore, he asserts the following errors \noccurred during his trial and at sentencing which he alleges resulted in his \nunlawful conviction and sentence:  instances of prosecutorial misconduct \nduring trial; trial judge bias; disparity in sentencing; a failure to merge his \nconvictions for allied offenses; his inability to select appointed counsel of \nchoice; ineffective assistance of appointed counsel at trial, on appeal, and in  \n                                              \n1  Dixon also pursued habeas relief in federal court.  In Dixon v. Warden, Southern Ohio \nCorrectional Institute, 940 F. Supp.2d 614 (S.D.Ohio 2013), the district court dismissed \nDixon\u2019s petition.  In 2018, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals denied Dixon\u2019s motion for \nleave to file a second, successive federal habeas petition.  \n  4.\nprior habeas corpus actions; and a denial of due process and equal \nprotection in the resolution of his postconviction relief petitions, motions, \nand original actions because of repeated denials or dismissals of these \nactions on res judicata or procedural grounds.  Dixon v. Bowerman, 6th \nDist. Lucas No. L-19-1066, 2019-Ohio-1711, \u00b6 6.   \n{\u00b6 7} We dismissed the petition, finding that \u201call of [Dixon\u2019s] claims could have \nbeen or were raised at trial, after trial by motion or postconviction relief petitions, or in an \nappeal of the individual judgments.\u201d  We also based our dismissal on Dixon\u2019s failure to \nverify the petition under oath, as required by R.C. 2725.04.  Finally, although not a basis \nto dismiss the petition, we noted that Dixon failed to enumerate the paragraphs within his \npetition, as required by Civ.R. 10(B).  Id. at \u00b6 4-6. \n{\u00b6 8} Undeterred, Dixon filed another petition on July 30, 2019, and it is this \npetition that is before us today.  In it, Dixon raises the very same claims that he has \nattempted to relitigate since his unsuccessful direct appeal.  First, Dixon alleges his \n\u201cactual innocence\u201d because \u201cno aggravated robbery took place * * *.  [Rather], it was a \nfailed robbery [and] nothing was stolen.\u201d  Second, Dixon argues that his three-year \nsentence as to the gun specifications was illegal because \u201cthe only one who brandished a \ngun\u201d was his co-conspirator.  Third, Dixon argues that the state knowingly offered \nperjured testimony from his co-conspirators, who \u201cchanged [their] stories 3 times to \nsecure [their] deals.\u201d  Finally, Dixon argues that he received ineffective assistance of trial \nand appellate counsel.  As with the previous petition, Dixon failed to enumerate the  5.\nparagraphs in contravention of Civ.R. 10 and failed to attach the commitment papers, \nalthough, as stated, he did seek leave to correct the latter issue.   \nLaw and Argument \n{\u00b6 9} Habeas corpus relief is an available remedy only in \u201ccertain extraordinary \ncircumstances where there is an unlawful restraint of a person\u2019s liberty, notwithstanding \nthe fact that only nonjurisdictional issues are involved, but only where there is no \nadequate legal remedy, e.g., appeal or post-conviction relief.\u201d  State ex rel. Jackson v. \nMcFaul, 73 Ohio St.3d 185, 186 (1995), citing State ex rel. Pirman v. Money, 69 Ohio \nSt.3d 591, 593 (1994). \n{\u00b6 10} Res judicata bars a petitioner from filing successive habeas corpus \npetitions.  Bevins v. Richard, 144 Ohio St.3d 54, 2015-Ohio-2832, \u00b6 4 (\u201cBevins could \nhave argued any cognizable claim that he had in [his previous] habeas action; therefore, \nres judicata bars his successive habeas corpus petition.\u201d).  Here, too, Dixon could have \nraised any cognizable claim in his previous habeas actions, and indeed, the instant \npetition mirrors his most recent petition.  For that reason, res judicata bars the instant \naction.     \n{\u00b6 11} Second, habeas corpus is not available when there is an adequate remedy at \nlaw.  Adequate remedies include a motion for postconviction relief and a direct appeal.  \nSee, e.g., Jones v. Kelley, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2010-T-0020, 2010-Ohio-3682, \u00b6 11 \n(Manifest weight and sufficiency claims cannot be reviewed as part of a habeas corpus \nproceeding because both issues can be raised via direct appeal); Accord Kneuss v. Sloan, \n146 Ohio St.3d 248, 2016-Ohio-3310, 54 N.E.3d 1242 (Actual innocence and ineffective  6.\nassistance of counsel claims are not properly raised in a petition for habeas corpus); Keith \nv. Bobby, 117 Ohio St.3d 470, 2008-Ohio-1443, 884 N.E.2d 1067 (perjured testimony \nclaims), Dunkle v. Dept. of Rehab. & Corr., 148 Ohio St.3d 621, 2017-Ohio-551, 71 \nN.E.3d 1098 (Sentencing error claims).  Because Dixon had an adequate remedy at law \nas to each claim set forth in his petition, he has failed to assert a claim upon which relief \nmay be granted.  Therefore, Dixon is not entitled to the extraordinary and extreme form \nof relief requested, i.e. immediate release from the custody of the state.   \n{\u00b6 12} Based on the face of the petition, we find Dixon has not stated a claim \nentitling him to habeas corpus relief.  Therefore, the petition is ordered dismissed.  \nDixon\u2019s pending motions are rendered moot and are denied.  The costs of this action are \nassessed to petitioner. \n{\u00b6 13} The clerk is directed to serve upon all parties, within three days, a copy of \nthis decision in a manner prescribed by Civ.R. 5(B). \n \nWrit denied. \n \nArlene Singer, J.                             _______________________________ \nJUDGE \nThomas J.

Box 209, Orient, OH 43146 (Defendant-Appellant). \n \n \nCYNTHIA WESTCOTT RICE, J. \n{\u00b61} This matter is before us on Appellant, John L. Turner, Jr.\u2019s, appeal from the \nLake County Court of Common Pleas\u2019 July 17, 2020 denial of his motion to vacate or \nsuspend payment or fines and/or costs and his motion to stay the imposition of restitution, \nfines, and/or costs.  For the reasons set forth herein, the judgment is affirmed.  \n{\u00b62} In 2014, appellant was indicted on 13 counts of Breaking and En tering, \nfelonies of the fifth degree, in violation of R.C. 2911.13(B); eight counts Theft, felonies of 2 \n \nCase No. 2020-L-088 \nthe fifth degree, in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1); and one count of Intimidation, a felony \nof the third degree, in violation of R.C. 2921.03.  These charg es arose from appellant \nbreaking in to several parked vehicles and stealing their contents.  Appellant pleaded not \nguilty, and the case went to trial where appellant proceeded pro se.   \n{\u00b63} At the state\u2019s request, the trial court dismissed 14 counts, le aving seven \ncounts of Theft and one count of Intimidation.  The jury found him guilty of all eight counts. \nAppellant filed a direct appeal; this court affirmed the convic tion in State v. Turner, 11th \nDist. Lake No. 2015-L-116, 2016-Ohio-4733 (\u201cTurner I \u201d). \n{\u00b64} Appellant has filed many subsequent motions.  He now appeals th e denial \nof his motion to vacate or suspend payment or fines and/or cost s and his motion to stay \nthe imposition of restitution, fines, and/or costs. \n{\u00b65} Appellant assigns 14 errors for our review: \n{\u00b66} [1.] The prosecution of Lake County violated defendant\u2019s due \nprocess of law and his equal protection of the laws, by nolle prosequi \na theft charge to deprive defendant his right to confront that witness \nabout the crime against him. See (exhibit A). \n{\u00b67} [2.] The prosecution of Lake County violated defendant\u2019s Brady \nmaterial of not turning over the 911 call from the City of East lake \nOhio on the indictment charges, which is a witness of the crime. And \nthe photo\u2019s of all the broken into vehicle of the night or day of the \ncrime in the parking lot of Elpalenque restaurant, discovery violation. \n{\u00b68} [3.] The prosecutorial misconstruction of the break and enterin g \ncharges, statute R.C. 2911.13(B), to force excessive bail and f ines \nwhich was cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. \n{\u00b69} [4.] Double jeopardy, or once in jeopardy for the same offense. \n{\u00b610} [5.] There was no international maritime valid contract. And no court \nhas jurisdiction in admiralty jurisdiction until there is an co ntract that \nhas been breach. \n{\u00b611} [6.] A defect in the trial mechanism or framework that by deprivation \nof basic Constitutional protection of the right to counsel, thi s 3 \n \nCase No. 2020-L-088 \nconstitutional protection Crim.R. 44(C), requires automatic rev ersal \nbecause [defendant] was tried unfairly and defendant[\u2019s] relief  t o  \nvacate the conviction or sentence. \n{\u00b612} [7.] Plain error; was that the trial judge did not get a writte n signed \nwaiver of counsel, as the procedural rule 44(C) requires. An er ror \nthat is so obvious and prejudicial that an appellate court shou ld \naddress it despite the defendant failure to raise a proper objection at \ntrial. A plain error is often said to be so obvious and substan tial that \nfailure to correct it would infringe a party\u2019s due-process righ ts and \ndamages the integrity of the judicial process see Fed. R. Evid.  \n103(d). \n{\u00b613} (D) Plain error. \n{\u00b614} Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of plain errors af fecting \nsubstantial rights although they were not brought to the attent ion of \nthe court. \n{\u00b615} There is NO written signed waiver of counsel, and automatic reversal \nis warranted pursuant to using another appeal de novo review wi ll \nclearly be or show racism, based on defendant is a African American \nBlack male citizen of the U.S. \n{\u00b616} [8.] The trial just deprived defendant his right to confront the witness \nby allowing the prosecution to dismiss charges that the grand j ury \nreturn a true bill for because it was not a felony charge and by doing \nthat defendant was not able to confront the witness or all the \nwitnesses because the prosecution knew that the truth of who\u2019s \nvehicle was really right behind the back door of dang this computer \nstore, and the witness Dillion Hardy did not see defendant break into \nMr. Brian J.

For the reasons set forth herein, the judgment is affirmed.\n\nIn 2014, appellant was indicted on 13 counts of Breaking and Entering, felonies of the fifth degree, in violation of R.C. 2911.13(B); eight counts Theft, felonies of\nthe fifth degree, in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(1); and one count of Intimidation, a felony of the third degree, in violation of R.C. 2921.03. These charges arose from appellant breaking into several parked vehicles and stealing their contents. Appellant pleaded not guilty, and the case went to trial where appellant proceeded pro se.\n\n{\u00b63} At the state\u2019s request, the trial court dismissed 14 counts, leaving seven counts of Theft and one count of Intimidation. The jury found him guilty of all eight counts. Appellant filed a direct appeal; this court affirmed the conviction in State v. Turner, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2015-L-116, 2016-Ohio-4733 (\u201cTurner I\u201d).\n\n{\u00b64} Appellant has filed many subsequent motions.

See (exhibit A).\n\n{\u00b67} [2.] The prosecution of Lake County violated defendant\u2019s Brady material of not turning over the 911 call from the City of Eastlake Ohio on the indictment charges, which is a witness of the crime. And the photo\u2019s of all the broken into vehicle of the night or day of the crime in the parking lot of Elpalenque restaurant, discovery violation.\n\n{\u00b68} [3.] The prosecutorial misconstruction of the break and entering charges, statute R.C. 2911.13(B), to force excessive bail and fines which was cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\n\n{\u00b69} [4.] Double jeopardy, or once in jeopardy for the same offense.\n\n{\u00b610} [5.] There was no international maritime valid contract. And no court has jurisdiction in admiralty jurisdiction until there is an contract that has been breach.\n\n{\u00b611} [6.] A defect in the trial mechanism or framework that by deprivation of basic Constitutional protection of the right to counsel, this\nconstitutional protection Crim.R. 44(C), requires automatic reversal because [defendant] was tried unfairly and defendant['s] relief to vacate the conviction or sentence.\n\n{\u00b612} [7.] Plain error; was that the trial judge did not get a written signed waiver of counsel, as the procedural rule 44(C) requires. An error that is so obvious and prejudicial that an appellate court should address it despite the defendant failure to raise a proper objection at trial. A plain error is often said to be so obvious and substantial that failure to correct it would infringe a party's due-process rights and damages the integrity of the judicial process see Fed. R. Evid. 103(d).\n\n{\u00b613} (D) Plain error.\n\n{\u00b614} Nothing in this rule precludes taking notice of plain errors affecting substantial rights although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\n\n{\u00b615} There is NO written signed waiver of counsel, and automatic reversal is warranted pursuant to using another appeal de novo review will clearly be or show racism, based on defendant is a African American Black male citizen of the U.S.\n\n{\u00b616} [8.] The trial just deprived defendant his right to confront the witness by allowing the prosecution to dismiss charges that the grand jury return a true bill for because it was not a felony charge and by doing that defendant was not able to confront the witness or all the witnesses because the prosecution knew that the truth of who's vehicle was really right behind the back door of dang this computer store, and the witness Dillion Hardy did not see defendant break into Mr. Brian J. Brusky vehicle, or any other vehicle.\n\n{\u00b617} [9.] Prosecutorial misconduct arranging the City of Eastlake charges around the City of Mentor charges pursuant to the lack of the elements of the crime for the City of Mentor charges, to induce action or change the decisions of the jury because the prosecution had no elements of the crime to prove defendant did any of the crimes.\n\n{\u00b618} [10.] The prosecution did not prove any elements of the City of Mentor crime to sustain a conviction.\n\n{\u00b619} [11.] The trial judge refused to give defendant another lawyer, after the defendant moved the court to get another counsel for his defense. See page 70 of 101, line 13, 14, and 15 of the transcript of proceedings, February 4, 2015.\n[\u00b620] [12.] The prosecution and trial judge in this case, bias or prejudice pursuant to racism of defendant is a African American man and if this failure to review this plain error on this appeal for the second time would be damaging to the integrity of the judicial process.\n\n[\u00b621] [13.] The trial judge refused to modify the bond after 13, charges was dismissed do to misconstruction of the statute of breaking and entering R.C. 2911.13, on property that open to the public, only show\u2019s the bias toward an African American man.

Venters, Public Defender, and Marley C. \nNelson, for appellant.  \n          \nAPPEAL from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas \nSADLER, J. \n{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Joseph Coogan, appeals the order of the Franklin \nCounty Court of Common Pleas, denying appellant's amended petition to vacate and set \naside judgment. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court. \nI.  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{\u00b6 2} This is the second appeal this court has heard in connection with appellant's \n2014 conviction for rape, sexual battery, and kidnapping.  In State v. Coogan, 10th Dist. \nNo. 14AP-220, 2014-Ohio-4775, \u00b6 3-11 (\"Coogan I\"), we set forth the facts of the case as \nfollows: \nThis case arises from an incident that occurred in the early \nmorning hours of May 27, 2013 after a party in which both the \nvictim (\"KC\") and appellant were drinking. The party occurred No. 18AP-829  2 \n \n \nat a residence where Cierra Chapman, KC and KC's daughter \nwere living. In the early morning hours, KC became very \nintoxicated and then angry when talking about KC's mother. \nThe other party guests told her to go to bed and appellant \ncarried KC upstairs to her bedroom, with SC, the 16-year-old \nbrother of Cierra Chapman, showing the way. Appellant is the \nbiological father of KC who was 19 at the time. \n \nAt trial, KC testified that once appellant had taken her to her \nroom, he laid her down on the bed and then he lay next to her. \nShe does not remember SC showing appellant where the \nbedroom was, nor does she remember having a cigarette with \nSC. She testified that appellant lay down on the bed with her \nf u l l y  c l o t h e d .  S h e  s a i d  t h a t  h e  r e m o v e d  h e r  p a n t s ,  b r a ,  a n d  \nunderwear and climbed on top of her. He touched her breasts \nand inserted his fingers into her vagina. He told her to be quiet \nand stop moving, while he held a blanket over her mouth. KC \ntestified that appellant had his clothes on but his pants were \npulled down. \n \nKC said that when Cierra Chapman came into the room \nappellant immediately stood up and zipped up his pants, told \nCierra to watch KC and left the room. KC then told Cierra what \nhad happened. KC testified that she was menstruating at the \ntime and was wearing a tampon, which appellant took out of \nher. An ambulance and the police were called and KC was taken \nto a hospital. \n \nCierra Chapman testified that both KC and appellant were \ndrinking and appellant carried KC up to her room after she \nbecame emotional at the end of the evening, with her brother \nSC showing the way. Cierra said that after about 45 minutes to \nan hour, she went upstairs to the bedroom which she shared \nwith KC. \n \nWhen Cierra walked into the bedroom, appellant jumped up \nfrom lying on the bed and quickly covered KC with a blanket. \nAppellant's pants and belt were unbuckled. He put on his boots \nand fixed his belt. He asked Cierra to watch KC because she was \ngoing to be sick and then Cierra showed him out of the bedroom \nwith the light from her phone. \n \nOnce appellant left, Cierra turned on the light and KC sat up \nand said \"I think my dad touched me.\" (Tr. Vol. I, 111.) Cierra \nuncovered the blanket and saw KC's pants and underwear were \ndown around her ankles. Her strapless bra was around her \nknees. She also had her shirt pulled up exposing her breasts. No. 18AP-829  3 \n \n \nCierra described KC as hysterical. KC would cry, pass out, then \nwake up and scream leave me alone. Cierra was able to get her \nmother, who was also at the party, to come to the bedroom. KC \ntold Cierra's mother what happened and they called the police. \n \nSC, the 16-year-old brother of Ci erra Chapman, said that he \nhad not been drinking at the party. He testified that both \nappellant and KC lay down on the bed with their clothes on \nwhen he initially showed them KC's bedroom. SC testified that \nhe went back to the bedroom after about 15 minutes to check \non KC. He found both appellant and KC under a blanket. SC \nsaid that KC sat up and asked for a cigarette. All three of them \nsmoked a cigarette and talked for a bit. Then SC left the \nbedroom. \n \nThe State presented DNA evidence at trial which was collected \nfrom KC's underwear, bra and used tampon. The expert, [Mr. \nRoss,] testified that the bra and tampon string both had some \nmale DNA present. There was also male DNA found on vaginal \nand anal swabs from KC but not enough sample was present to \nmake a more extensive comparison. On KC's underwear, the \nState's expert testified there was a significant amount of male \nDNA. The expert stated the frequency of the DNA profile for \nthe DNA found on the underwear was one in every 3,333 \nunrelated male individuals and the appellant fit that profile. \n \nAppellant testified in his own defense and stated that after SC \nleft the room for a second time both he and KC fell asleep on \nthe bed. Appellant said that KC woke up and asked that he close \nthe door, so he got up to close the door and realized that it was \nalready closed. It was at this point he said KC starting taking \nher clothes off. Appellant said he told her to stop because he \nwas still in the room. He testified he physically grabbed her \narms and her pants to prevent her from taking her clothes off, \nat which point he put the blanket over her and she fell back \nasleep. Appellant testified he was trying to adjust his belt to \nleave when Cierra Chapman came in. \n \nCoogan I at \u00b6 3-11. \n{\u00b6 3} In affirming appellant's conviction, in Coogan I, we found the judgment of \nconviction was not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence and that defense \ncounsel's closing argument was not deficient as to deny appellant effective assistance of \ncounsel.  Regarding the manifest weight of the evidence, we discussed that issues of witness \ncredibility, weight of the evidence, and inconsistencies fall within the province of the jury, No. 18AP-829  4 \n \n \nand concluded that, after having examined the entire record, competent and credible \nevidence supported the guilty verdict beyond  a reasonable doubt.  We noted Cierra's \nundisputed testimony that she saw appellant buckling his pants when she entered the \nroom, Cierra's testimony that appellant hastily covered KC with the blanket, the fact that \nCierra found KC in a state of undress under the blanket, and the male DNA on the tampon \nfrom KC.  We observed that \"the jury could well have doubted appellant's testimony that \nhis DNA came to be found on KC's cloths and tampon only because he was trying to keep \nKC dressed when she attempted to remove her own cloths.\"  Coogan I at \u00b6 15. \n{\u00b6 4} On October 8, 2014, appellant filed a petition to vacate and set aside \njudgment pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 and amended the petition on November 12, 2014.  The \npetition sets forth the following five grounds for relief:  \nGROUND I: Joseph Coogan's convictions and sentences are \nvoid and/or voidable because the State failed to disclose to trial \ncounsel the underlying lab notes and data, which provided \ncritical information necessary to impeach the State's experts.  \nBrady v.

VI, XIV;  Ohio Const. \nSections 1 &  10, Art. I.

The State permitted the \nevidence presented to the jury to indicate that the Y-STR \nprofile, from which Mr. Coogan could not be excluded, came \nfrom the crotch area of the victim's underwear when the DNA \nswab which produced those results could have been from the \nwaistband of the underwear and consistent with Mr. Coogan's \ntestimony.

VI, XIV; Ohio Const. Art. I,\u00a7\u00a7 1,10.  Exhibits \nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, and I. \n \n(Nov. 12, 2014 Am. Petition at 18-28.)  Plaintiff-appellee, State of Ohio, filed an answer and \na motion to dismiss the petition. \n{\u00b6 5} On September 26, 2018, the trial court rendered judgment in appellee's favor \non the amended petition.  The trial court grouped appellant's grounds into three categories: \n(1) the state committed a Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) violation by suppressing \nallegedly exculpatory evidence; (2) the state committed a Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 \n(1959) violation by allegedly providing false or misleading information to the jury; and \n(3) ineffective assistance of counsel. No. 18AP-829  6 \n \n \n{\u00b6 6} The trial court found each ground for relief to be \"barred by res judicata \nand/or lacks merit.\"  (Sept. 26, 2018 Jgmt. Entry at 9-11.)  Regarding the proposed Brady \nviolation, the trial court found res judicata applied because \"even assuming the State failed \nto produce certain lab reports, the defense did not raise any issue about the lab reports and \nDNA evidence before, during, or even in the direct appeal following the trial and sentence.\"  \n(Jgmt. Entry at 9.)  As an alternative on the merits, the trial court found that \"even if the \nCourt were to ignore res judicata, this argument nevertheless fails because the record does \nnot support a finding that a Brady violation occurred as the State's final DNA report was \ndisclosed to the defense prior to trial and State's BCI experts testified about the collection \nof the DNA swabs and results at trial and were subject to cross examination. See generally, \nState v.  Payne, 10th Dist. No.  09AP-107, 2010-Ohio-1018, \u00b6 32.\"  (Jgmt. Entry at 9-10.) \n{\u00b6 7} Regarding the proposed Napue violation, the trial co urt found res judicata \napplied because issues about the alleged false or misleading testimony of Ross was not \nraised at trial or in the direct appeal of this case.  Regardless of res judicata, the trial court \nfound appellant would not be entitled to relief on the merits since Ross' testimony did not \nneed to be corrected by the state.  The trial court noted:  \nMr. Ross testified that K.C.'s underwear was swabbed multiple \ntimes using one swab and that one of the areas swabbed \nincluded the crotch area of K.C.'s underwear.  There was also \ntestimony about why one swab was used as opposed to multiple \nswabs. Notwithstanding Mr. Ross' testimony, at trial the \ndefendant offered an explanation as to how his DNA could have \ngotten on or inside K.C.'s underwear. Accordingly, even if Mr. \nRoss' testimony could have been misconstrued by the jury, the \ndefendant's testimony about how his DNA could be found on \nor in K.C.'s underwear refutes this Napue violation claim. \n(Jgmt. Entry at 10.) \n{\u00b6 8} Regarding the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, the trial court \nfound appellant's arguments that counsel failed to request labs notes and hire a DNA expert \nas well as failed to ask witnesses vital questions to be barred by res judicata and lacked \nmerit.  The trial court additionally found appellant's argument that ineffective assistance \nwas rendered because counsel failed to call \"crucial\" witnesses to the stand to lack merit.  \n(Jgmt. Entry at 11.)  The trial court conclu ded appellant failed to demonstrate prejudice \nunder Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), and, as a result, was not entitled to No. 18AP-829  7 \n \n \npostconviction relief in this regard.  Thus, the trial court denied appellant's amended \npetition to vacate the judgment of conviction and dismissed the petition. \n{\u00b6 9} Appellant filed a timely appeal. \nII.  ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR \n{\u00b6 10} Appellant assigns the following as trial court error: \n[1.]  The trial court erred when it denied Joseph Coogan's \npetition for postconviction relief on res judicata grounds when \nthe petition set forth sufficient operative facts to establish that \nthe State committed a Brady violation when it did not disclose \nthe BCI LAB Notes that underlie the State's DNA final report, \nwhich could not have been raised on direct appeal because the \nnecessary evidence was dehors the record. \n[2.]  The trial court erred when it denied Joseph Coogan's \npetition for postconviction relief on res judicata grounds when \nthe petition set forth sufficient operative facts to establish the \nState committed a Napue violation when it did not correct the \nmisleading testimony it adduced from David Ross, which \ncould not have been raised on direct appeal because the \nnecessary evidence was dehors the record. \n \nIII.  LEGAL ANALYSIS \n{\u00b6 11} For clarity of analysis, we will address appellant's assignments of error \ntogether. Appellant's first and second assignments of error assert the trial court erred in \ndenying, \"on res judicata grounds,\" his petition for postconviction relief regarding alleged \nBrady and Napue violations.  (Appellant's Brief at v, vi.)  Appellant requests an evidentiary \nhearing on his postconviction petition \"to develop a record upon which this issue may be \nmore effectively addressed.\"  (Appellant's Brief at 13, 21-22.)   \n{\u00b6 12} Appellee argues that appellant did not raise any error challenging the trial \ncourt's alternative conclusion, that defendant's first and second grounds for relief \"lack[ed] \nmerit,\" and notes that appellant did not raise any error asserting trial counsel was \nineffective.  (Jgmt. Entry at 9-11.)  Regardless, appellee contends res judicata does apply \nsince the DNA test results were provided to defense counsel, and the state had an expert \ntestify regarding the DNA tests and the notes the analysts prepared.  Thus, appellant could \nhave raised an issue challenging the discovery he received or an argument challenging the \ncollection of the DNA before or during the trial.  Because appellant's petition was based on \ninformation and evidence that was available for use at the time of his trial, his failure to No. 18AP-829  8 \n \n \nraise these contentions before or during trial (and then on direct appeal) barred their review \nin these collateral proceedings.  Appellee further asserts appellant did not attach sufficient \nevidence to his petition to warrant a hearing, and that the trial court was correct in finding \nappellant's Brady and Napue claims to lack merit on this record. \n{\u00b6 13} Replying to appellee, appellant acknowledges his assignments of error \nchallenge res judicata only, but suggests this court should \"sua sponte\" reach the arguments \non the merits of the Brady and Napue claims in the interest of justice since we have the \ncomplete record of the case before us and the parties addressed the merits in their briefs, \nnegating surprise and prejudice.  (Appellant's Reply Brief at 4.) \n{\u00b6 14} For the following reasons, we agree with appellee that appellant's failure to \nassign the trial court's merit rulings as error is dispositive to this appeal.  First, App.R. \n12(A)(1)(b) states that \"a court of appeals shall * * * [d]etermine the appeal on its merits on \nthe assignments of error set forth in the briefs.\"  In other words, this court will not review \narguments which do not support reversal based on the assignment of error.  Huntington \nNatl. Bank v. Burda, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-658, 2009-Ohio-1752, \u00b6 21 (\"This court rules on \nassignments of error, not mere arguments.\").  Relatedly, an appellate court has no duty to \ncreate an argument on an appellant's behalf.  McKahan v. CSX Transp., Inc., 10th Dist. No. \n09AP-376, 2009-Ohio-5359, \u00b6 10.  Therefore, the fact that parties addressed the merits of \nthe Brady and Napue claims as arguments in their briefs does not change this court's \nobligation to determine the appeal based upon the assignments of error, which in this case \nare only premised on the applicability of res judicata. \n{\u00b6 15} Second, the assignments of error do not present questions for appellate \nreview that would have practical effect in this case.  The duty of a judicial tribunal is to \ndecide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to make \ndeclarations which cannot affect the matter at issue in the case before it.  Grove City v. \nClark, 10th Dist. No. 01AP-1369, 2002-Ohio-4549, \u00b6 12.  When a decision on an issue would \nnot be beneficial to the parties, that issue is moot.  State v. Alexander, 7th Dist. No. 03 CA \n789, 2004-Ohio-5525, \u00b6 33; Clark at \u00b6 11 (citations omitted) (\"[A] moot case is one which \nseeks to get a judgment * * * upon some matter which, when rendered, for any reason \ncannot have any practical legal effect upon a then-existing controversy.\").  In this case, res \njudicata is only one of the two legal bases for the trial court's decision to deny appellant's No. 18AP-829  9 \n \n \npetition.  Thus, for sake of argument, even if we were to sustain the assignments of error, \nthe outcome of the case would not change since appellant did not assign the trial court's \ndecision on the merits of the Brady and Napue claims as error and, therefore, that part of \nthe trial court decision would survive and support denial of the petition.  Considering all of \nthe above, we find appellant's assignments of error to be moot. \n{\u00b6 16} Accordingly, pursuant to App.R. 12(A)(1)(c), we overrule appellant's first and \nsecond assignments of error as moot. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \n{\u00b6 17} Having overruled appellant's two assi gnments of error, we affirm the \njudgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. \nJudgment affirmed. \nKLATT, P.J., and BEATTY BLUNT, J., concur. \n_____________ ", "case_juv": "0", "case_crim": "0", "case_2001": "0", "case_app": "0", "case_pros": "0", "aoe_none": "0", "aoe_grandjury": "0", "aoe_court": "0", "aoe_defense": "0", "aoe_procbar": "1", "aoe_prochist": "0", "case_timeframe": "0", "other": "164    0\nName: other, dtype: int64", "olmocr_text": "IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\nTENTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\nState of Ohio, : \nPlaintiff-Appellee, : No. 18AP-829\nv. : (C.P.C.

For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court.\n\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b6 2 This is the second appeal this court has heard in connection with appellant\u2019s 2014 conviction for rape, sexual battery, and kidnapping. In State v. Coogan, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-220, 2014-Ohio-4775, \u00b6 3-11 (\u201cCoogan I\u201d), we set forth the facts of the case as follows:\n\nThis case arises from an incident that occurred in the early morning hours of May 27, 2013 after a party in which both the victim (\u201cKC\u201d) and appellant were drinking. The party occurred\nat a residence where Cierra Chapman, KC and KC\u2019s daughter were living. In the early morning hours, KC became very intoxicated and then angry when talking about KC\u2019s mother. The other party guests told her to go to bed and appellant carried KC upstairs to her bedroom, with SC, the 16-year-old brother of Cierra Chapman, showing the way. Appellant is the biological father of KC who was 19 at the time.\n\nAt trial, KC testified that once appellant had taken her to her room, he laid her down on the bed and then he lay next to her. She does not remember SC showing appellant where the bedroom was, nor does she remember having a cigarette with SC. She testified that appellant lay down on the bed with her fully clothed. She said that he removed her pants, bra, and underwear and climbed on top of her. He touched her breasts and inserted his fingers into her vagina. He told her to be quiet and stop moving, while he held a blanket over her mouth. KC testified that appellant had his clothes on but his pants were pulled down.\n\nKC said that when Cierra Chapman came into the room appellant immediately stood up and zipped up his pants, told Cierra to watch KC and left the room. KC then told Cierra what had happened. KC testified that she was menstruating at the time and was wearing a tampon, which appellant took out of her. An ambulance and the police were called and KC was taken to a hospital.\n\nCierra Chapman testified that both KC and appellant were drinking and appellant carried KC up to her room after she became emotional at the end of the evening, with her brother SC showing the way. Cierra said that after about 45 minutes to an hour, she went upstairs to the bedroom which she shared with KC.\n\nWhen Cierra walked into the bedroom, appellant jumped up from lying on the bed and quickly covered KC with a blanket. Appellant\u2019s pants and belt were unbuckled. He put on his boots and fixed his belt. He asked Cierra to watch KC because she was going to be sick and then Cierra showed him out of the bedroom with the light from her phone.\n\nOnce appellant left, Cierra turned on the light and KC sat up and said \"I think my dad touched me.\" (Tr. Vol. I, 111.) Cierra uncovered the blanket and saw KC\u2019s pants and underwear were down around her ankles. Her strapless bra was around her knees. She also had her shirt pulled up exposing her breasts.\nCierra described KC as hysterical. KC would cry, pass out, then wake up and scream leave me alone. Cierra was able to get her mother, who was also at the party, to come to the bedroom. KC told Cierra\u2019s mother what happened and they called the police.\n\nSC, the 16-year-old brother of Cierra Chapman, said that he had not been drinking at the party. He testified that both appellant and KC lay down on the bed with their clothes on when he initially showed them KC\u2019s bedroom. SC testified that he went back to the bedroom after about 15 minutes to check on KC. He found both appellant and KC under a blanket. SC said that KC sat up and asked for a cigarette. All three of them smoked a cigarette and talked for a bit. Then SC left the bedroom.\n\nThe State presented DNA evidence at trial which was collected from KC\u2019s underwear, bra and used tampon. The expert, [Mr. Ross,] testified that the bra and tampon string both had some male DNA present. There was also male DNA found on vaginal and anal swabs from KC but not enough sample was present to make a more extensive comparison. On KC\u2019s underwear, the State\u2019s expert testified there was a significant amount of male DNA. The expert stated the frequency of the DNA profile for the DNA found on the underwear was one in every 3,333 unrelated male individuals and the appellant fit that profile.\n\nAppellant testified in his own defense and stated that after SC left the room for a second time both he and KC fell asleep on the bed. Appellant said that KC woke up and asked that he close the door, so he got up to close the door and realized that it was already closed. It was at this point he said KC starting taking her clothes off. Appellant said he told her to stop because he was still in the room. He testified he physically grabbed her arms and her pants to prevent her from taking her clothes off, at which point he put the blanket over her and she fell back asleep. Appellant testified he was trying to adjust his belt to leave when Cierra Chapman came in.\n\nCoogan I at \u00b6 3-11.\n\n\u00b6 3 In affirming appellant\u2019s conviction, in Coogan I, we found the judgment of conviction was not contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence and that defense counsel\u2019s closing argument was not deficient as to deny appellant effective assistance of counsel. Regarding the manifest weight of the evidence, we discussed that issues of witness credibility, weight of the evidence, and inconsistencies fall within the province of the jury,\nand concluded that, after having examined the entire record, competent and credible evidence supported the guilty verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. We noted Cierra's undisputed testimony that she saw appellant buckling his pants when she entered the room, Cierra's testimony that appellant hastily covered KC with the blanket, the fact that Cierra found KC in a state of undress under the blanket, and the male DNA on the tampon from KC. We observed that \"the jury could well have doubted appellant's testimony that his DNA came to be found on KC's cloths and tampon only because he was trying to keep KC dressed when she attempted to remove her own cloths.\" Coogan I at \u00b6 15.\n\n\u00b6 4 On October 8, 2014, appellant filed a petition to vacate and set aside judgment pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 and amended the petition on November 12, 2014. The petition sets forth the following five grounds for relief:\n\nGROUND I: Joseph Coogan's convictions and sentences are void and/or voidable because the State failed to disclose to trial counsel the underlying lab notes and data, which provided critical information necessary to impeach the State's experts. Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed.2d 215 (1963); Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 433, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). U.S. Const. Amends. VI, XIV; Ohio Const. Sections 1 & 10, Art. I. Exhibits B, E, F, and G.\n\nGROUND II: Joseph Coogan's convictions and sentences are void and/or voidable because the State provided false or misleading information to the jury or created a false impression and failed to correct the record. The State permitted the evidence presented to the jury to indicate that the Y-STR profile, from which Mr. Coogan could not be excluded, came from the crotch area of the victim's underwear when the DNA swab which produced those results could have been from the waistband of the underwear and consistent with Mr. Coogan's testimony. Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 272, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959); Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 151, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). U.S. Const. Amends. VI, XIV; Ohio Const. Sections 1 & 10, Art. I. Exhibits B, E, F, and G.\n\nGROUND III: Joseph Coogan's convictions and sentences are void and/or voidable because he was denied the effective assistance of counsel to which he was entitled under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Mr. Coogan's counsel failed to specifically request the underlying lab notes and data from the DNA testing done by the State. Strickland v. Washington, 466\nGROUND IV: Joseph Coogan's convictions and sentences are void and/or voidable because he was denied the effective assistance of counsel to which he was entitled under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Mr. Coogan's counsel failed to ask of a witness that he called to the stand vital impeachment information. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); *Richey v. Mitchell*, 395 F.3d 660 (6th Cir. 2005); *State v. Bradley*, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989); *State v. Smith*, 17 Ohio St.3d 98, 477 N.E.2d 1128 (1985); *State v. Jackson*, 64 Ohio St.2d 107, 413 N.E.2d 819 (1980). U.S. Const., Amends. VI, XIV; Ohio Const. Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 10. Exhibits B, E, F, and G.\n\nGROUND V: Joseph Coogan's convictions and sentences are void and/or voidable because he was denied the effective assistance of counsel to which he was entitled under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Mr. Coogan's counsel failed to investigate or speak to Jordan Rapp and Ariana Harry. These witnesses were made known to him by Mr. Coogan, and could have provided crucial impeachment information. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); *Richey v. Mitchell*, 395 F.3d 660 (6th Cir. 2005); *State v. Bradley*, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989); *State v. Smith*, 17 Ohio St.3d 98, 477 N.E.2d 1128 (1985); *State v. Jackson*, 64 Ohio St.2d 107, 413 N.E.2d 819 (1980). U.S. Const., Amends. VI, XIV; Ohio Const. Art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 10. Exhibits A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.\n\n(No. 18AP-829) Plaintiff-appellee, State of Ohio, filed an answer and a motion to dismiss the petition.\n\n\u00b6 5 On September 26, 2018, the trial court rendered judgment in appellee's favor on the amended petition. The trial court grouped appellant's grounds into three categories: (1) the state committed a *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) violation by suppressing allegedly exculpatory evidence; (2) the state committed a *Napue v. Illinois*, 360 U.S. 264 (1959) violation by allegedly providing false or misleading information to the jury; and (3) ineffective assistance of counsel.\nThe trial court found each ground for relief to be \"barred by res judicata and/or lacks merit.\" (Sept. 26, 2018 Jgmt. Entry at 9-11.) Regarding the proposed Brady violation, the trial court found res judicata applied because \"even assuming the State failed to produce certain lab reports, the defense did not raise any issue about the lab reports and DNA evidence before, during, or even in the direct appeal following the trial and sentence.\" (Jgmt. Entry at 9.) As an alternative on the merits, the trial court found that \"even if the Court were to ignore res judicata, this argument nevertheless fails because the record does not support a finding that a Brady violation occurred as the State's final DNA report was disclosed to the defense prior to trial and State's BCI experts testified about the collection of the DNA swabs and results at trial and were subject to cross examination. See generally, State v. Payne, 10th Dist. No. 09AP-107, 2010-Ohio-1018, \u00b6 32.\" (Jgmt. Entry at 9-10.)\n\nRegarding the proposed Napue violation, the trial court found res judicata applied because issues about the alleged false or misleading testimony of Ross was not raised at trial or in the direct appeal of this case. Regardless of res judicata, the trial court found appellant would not be entitled to relief on the merits since Ross' testimony did not need to be corrected by the state. The trial court noted:\n\nMr. Ross testified that K.C.'s underwear was swabbed multiple times using one swab and that one of the areas swabbed included the crotch area of K.C.'s underwear. There was also testimony about why one swab was used as opposed to multiple swabs. Notwithstanding Mr. Ross' testimony, at trial the defendant offered an explanation as to how his DNA could have gotten on or inside K.C.'s underwear. Accordingly, even if Mr. Ross' testimony could have been misconstrued by the jury, the defendant's testimony about how his DNA could be found on or in K.C.'s underwear refutes this Napue violation claim.\n\n(Jgmt. Entry at 10.)\n\nRegarding the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, the trial court found appellant's arguments that counsel failed to request labs notes and hire a DNA expert as well as failed to ask witnesses vital questions to be barred by res judicata and lacked merit. The trial court additionally found appellant's argument that ineffective assistance was rendered because counsel failed to call \"crucial\" witnesses to the stand to lack merit. (Jgmt. Entry at 11.) The trial court concluded appellant failed to demonstrate prejudice under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), and, as a result, was not entitled to\npostconviction relief in this regard. Thus, the trial court denied appellant's amended petition to vacate the judgment of conviction and dismissed the petition.\n\n\u00b6 9 Appellant filed a timely appeal.\n\nII. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n\u00b6 10 Appellant assigns the following as trial court error:\n\n[1.] The trial court erred when it denied Joseph Coogan's petition for postconviction relief on res judicata grounds when the petition set forth sufficient operative facts to establish that the State committed a Brady violation when it did not disclose the BCI LAB Notes that underlie the State's DNA final report, which could not have been raised on direct appeal because the necessary evidence was dehors the record.\n\n[2.] The trial court erred when it denied Joseph Coogan's petition for postconviction relief on res judicata grounds when the petition set forth sufficient operative facts to establish the State committed a Napue violation when it did not correct the misleading testimony it adduced from David Ross, which could not have been raised on direct appeal because the necessary evidence was dehors the record.\n\nIII. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n\u00b6 11 For clarity of analysis, we will address appellant's assignments of error together. Appellant's first and second assignments of error assert the trial court erred in denying, \"on res judicata grounds,\" his petition for postconviction relief regarding alleged Brady and Napue violations. (Appellant's Brief at v, vi.) Appellant requests an evidentiary hearing on his postconviction petition \"to develop a record upon which this issue may be more effectively addressed.\" (Appellant's Brief at 13, 21-22.)\n\n\u00b6 12 Appellee argues that appellant did not raise any error challenging the trial court's alternative conclusion, that defendant's first and second grounds for relief \"lack[ed] merit,\" and notes that appellant did not raise any error asserting trial counsel was ineffective. (Jgmt. Entry at 9-11.) Regardless, appellee contends res judicata does apply since the DNA test results were provided to defense counsel, and the state had an expert testify regarding the DNA tests and the notes the analysts prepared. Thus, appellant could have raised an issue challenging the discovery he received or an argument challenging the collection of the DNA before or during the trial. Because appellant's petition was based on information and evidence that was available for use at the time of his trial, his failure to\nraise these contentions before or during trial (and then on direct appeal) barred their review in these collateral proceedings. Appellee further asserts appellant did not attach sufficient evidence to his petition to warrant a hearing, and that the trial court was correct in finding appellant\u2019s *Brady* and *Napue* claims to lack merit on this record.\n\n\u00b6 13 Replying to appellee, appellant acknowledges his assignments of error challenge res judicata only, but suggests this court should \"sua sponte\" reach the arguments on the merits of the *Brady* and *Napue* claims in the interest of justice since we have the complete record of the case before us and the parties addressed the merits in their briefs, negating surprise and prejudice. (Appellant's Reply Brief at 4.)\n\n\u00b6 14 For the following reasons, we agree with appellee that appellant's failure to assign the trial court's merit rulings as error is dispositive to this appeal. First, App.R. 12(A)(1)(b) states that \"a court of appeals shall *** [d]etermine the appeal on its merits on the assignments of error set forth in the briefs.\" In other words, this court will not review arguments which do not support reversal based on the assignment of error. *Huntington Natl. Bank v. Burda*, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-658, 2009-Ohio-1752, \u00b6 21 (\"This court rules on assignments of error, not mere arguments.\"). Relatedly, an appellate court has no duty to create an argument on an appellant's behalf. *McKahan v. CSX Transp., Inc.*, 10th Dist. No. 09AP-376, 2009-Ohio-5359, \u00b6 10. Therefore, the fact that parties addressed the merits of the *Brady* and *Napue* claims as arguments in their briefs does not change this court's obligation to determine the appeal based upon the assignments of error, which in this case are only premised on the applicability of res judicata.\n\n\u00b6 15 Second, the assignments of error do not present questions for appellate review that would have practical effect in this case. The duty of a judicial tribunal is to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried into effect, and not to make declarations which cannot affect the matter at issue in the case before it. *Grove City v. Clark*, 10th Dist. No. 01AP-1369, 2002-Ohio-4549, \u00b6 12. When a decision on an issue would not be beneficial to the parties, that issue is moot. *State v. Alexander*, 7th Dist. No. 03 CA 789, 2004-Ohio-5525, \u00b6 33; *Clark* at \u00b6 11 (citations omitted) (\"[A] moot case is one which seeks to get a judgment *** upon some matter which, when rendered, for any reason cannot have any practical legal effect upon a then-existing controversy.\"). In this case, res judicata is only one of the two legal bases for the trial court's decision to deny appellant's\npetition. Thus, for sake of argument, even if we were to sustain the assignments of error, the outcome of the case would not change since appellant did not assign the trial court\u2019s decision on the merits of the *Brady* and *Napue* claims as error and, therefore, that part of the trial court decision would survive and support denial of the petition. Considering all of the above, we find appellant\u2019s assignments of error to be moot.\n\n\u00b6 16 Accordingly, pursuant to App.R. 12(A)(1)(c), we overrule appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error as moot.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 17 Having overruled appellant\u2019s two assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n\n*Judgment affirmed.*\n\nKLATT, P.J., and BEATTY BLUNT, J., concur."}

Robinson, Jr., appeals, pro se, from a \njudgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas denying his motion for new trial \nand modification of verdict/sentence.  For the following reasons, we affirm. \nI.  Facts and Procedural History \n{\u00b6 2} The facts and procedural history of this case are outlined in our decision \nregarding appellant's direct appeal of his case in State v. Robinson, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-\n5 6 3 ,  2 0 1 4 - O h i o - 5 2 0 ,  a n d  w i l l  o n l y  b e  r e p e a t e d  h e r e  a s  r e l e v a n t  t o  o u r  d i s c u s s i o n .   I n  \nRobinson, appellant asserted that: (1) the jury verdicts in the case were not supported by \nthe manifest weight of the evidence, and (2) the trial court erred in imposing consecutive \nsentences without making the necessary findings mandated by R.C. 2929.14(C)(4).  We \noverruled both assignments of error and affirmed the trial court judgment.   No. 17AP-707 2 \n \n \n \n{\u00b6 3} Subsequently, appellant filed with this court an application for delayed \nreopening of the appeal.  We denied appellant's application noting that appellate counsel \nhad provided appellant with copies of the appellate briefs in a timely fashion and, therefore, \nappellant had the opportunity to notify counsel or this court of any additional issues before \nthe case was submitted to a panel of the court for a decision.  We also noted appellant was \nconvicted of aggravated burglary and sexual battery based on eye witness testimony \nsupported by DNA evidence, and nothing before us indicated that any of his lawyers \nrendered ineffective assistance of counsel.  State v. Robinson, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-563, \n2015-Ohio-3486. \n{\u00b6 4} On August 22, 2016, appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief.  The \ntrial court denied the petition on December 8, 2016, and we affirmed the trial court's denial \non May 15, 2017.  State v. Robinson, 10th Dist. No. 16AP-887, 2017-Ohio-2773.   \n{\u00b6 5} On August 18, 2017, appellant filed a motion for new trial and modification \nof verdict and sentence alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.  The trial court denied the \npetition finding it to be not well-taken.  Appellant timely appealed. \nII.  Assignment of Error \n{\u00b6 6} Although not expressly articulated, having reviewed his brief it appears \nappellant asserts a single assignment of error: that the trial court erred in denying his \nmotion for new trial.  In support, he makes several arguments including: (1) the verdicts of \nguilty of sexual battery and aggravated burglary were not supported by sufficient evidence, \n(2) the judge abused its discretion by not instructing jurors on lesser-included offenses, \n(3) the judge abused its discretion by admitting certain evidence which was prejudicial to \nappellant in violation of the Rules of Evidence, (4) the prosecutor engaged in misconduct,1  \nand (5) his trial counsel was ineffective in not timely bringing this motion for new trial. \nIII.  Discussion \n{\u00b6 7} We begin by considering appellant's arguments regarding the timeliness of \nhis motion.  Appellant asserts he filed the motion pursuant to Crim.R. 33.  An appellate \ncourt applies an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a trial court's denial of a motion \nfor leave to file a delayed motion for new trial.  State v. Anderson, 10th Dist. No. 12AP-133, \n                                                   \n1 We note appellant's motion did not contain an affidavit regarding prosecutorial misconduct which is required \nby Crim.R. 33(C). No. 17AP-707 3 \n \n \n \n2012-Ohio-4733, \u00b6 9.  Although an abuse of discretion is typically defined as an \nunreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable decision, no court has the authority, within its \ndiscretion, to commit an error of law.  State v. Moncrief, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-391, 2013-\nOhio-4571, \u00b6 7. \n{\u00b6 8} Crim.R. 33(B) states: \nApplication for a new trial shall be made by motion which, \nexcept for the cause of newly discovered evidence, shall be \nfiled within fourteen days after the verdict was rendered, or \nthe decision of the court where a trial by jury has been waived, \nunless it is made to appear by clear and convincing proof that \nthe defendant was unavoidably prevented from filing his \nmotion for a new trial, in which case the motion shall be filed \nwithin seven days from the order of the court finding that the \ndefendant was unavoidably prevented from filing such motion \nwithin the time provided herein. \n \nMotions for new trial on account of newly discovered evidence \nshall be filed within one hundred twenty days after the day \nupon which the verdict was rendered, or the decision of the \ncourt where trial by jury has been waived. If it is made to \nappear by clear and convincing proof that the defendant was \nunavoidably prevented from the discovery of the evidence \nupon which he must rely, such motion shall be filed within \nseven days from an order of the court finding that he was \nunavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence within \nthe one hundred twenty day period. \n \n{\u00b6 9} In State v. Jama , 10th Dist. No. 11AP-210, 2012-Ohio-2466, \u00b6 21, we \nobserved some courts have held a trial court cannot consider the merits of a motion for new \ntrial until it makes a finding regarding timeliness.   See id., reference to State v. Lanier, 2d \nDist. No. 2009 CA 84, 2010-Ohio-2921, \u00b6 17 (a defendant may file a motion for new trial \nalong with the request for leave to file said motion, but the court cannot consider the merits \nof the motion for a new trial until it makes a finding of unavoidable prevention).  We also \nnoted in Jama the trial court never made a finding of unavoidable prevention or issued an \norder to that effect because Jama failed to properly seek leave before filing his motion.  Such \nis the case here, as appellant never sought leave to file his motion before filing the same and \nin ultimately denying appellant's motion, the trial court did not address the timeliness of \nthe motion.  Rather, the court indicated that \"after full and careful consideration, [the No. 17AP-707 4 \n \n \n \ncourt] finds said motion not well taken and hereby denies the same.\"  (Emphasis omitted.) \n(Jgmt. Entry.)    \n{\u00b6 10} Nevertheless, we find appellant's motion to be untimely as the verdict was \nrendered on May 10, 2013, and the motion for new trial was filed well beyond the 14-day \ndeadline outlined in Crim.R. 33.  \n{\u00b6 11} As noted above, Crim.R. 33 provides for the filing of an untimely motion for \nnew trial: (1) when it is made to appear by clear and convincing proof that the defendant \nwas unavoidably prevented from filing his motion for new trial, and (2) in the case of newly \ndiscovered evidence, when certain criteria are met.  \n{\u00b6 12} \"A party is 'unavoidably prevented' from filing a motion for a new trial if the \nparty had no knowledge of the existence of the ground supporting the motion and could not \nhave learned of that existence within the time prescribed for filing the motion in the exercise \nof reasonable diligence.\"  State v. Hoover-Moore, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-1049, 2015-Ohio-\n4863, \u00b6 13; State v. Walden, 19 Ohio App.3d 141, 145-46 (10th Dist.1984). \n{\u00b6 13} \"Clear and convincing proof that the defendant was 'unavoidably prevented' \nfrom filing 'requires more than a mere allegation that a defendant has been unavoidably \nprevented from discovering the evidence he seeks to introduce as support for a new trial.' \"  \nState v. Lee, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-229, 2005-Ohio-6374, \u00b6 9, quoting State v. Mathis, 134 \nOhio App.3d 77, 79 (1st Dist.1999).  The requirement of clear and convincing evidence puts \nthe burden on a defendant to prove he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the \nevidence in a timely manner. State v. Rodriguez-Baron, 7th Dist. No. 12-MA-44, 2012-\nOhio-5360, \u00b6 11. \n{\u00b6 14} Appellant stated he brought the motion and the appeal \"along with \narguments of fact that are supported by evidence that was presented at trial.\"  (Emphasis \nadded.)  (Appellant's Brief at 7.)  Therefore, by his own admission, appellant did not bring \nthe motion on grounds of newly discovered evidence. Review of his motion supports that \nhis motion is supported by evidence presented at trial and not newly discovered evidence.2  \n{\u00b6 15} In his motion for new trial, appellant stated he was unavoidably prevented \nfrom filing a Crim.R. 33 motion because his trial counsel never informed him that she could \n                                                   \n2 We reject appellant's argument at page eight of his brief before this court that the lack of jury instructions on \nlesser-included offenses constitutes \"new discovered evidence\" because these instructions were not part of the \ntrial court record. (Appellant's Brief at 8.) No. 17AP-707 5 \n \n \n \nor would file a motion for new trial or a modification of sentence.   Appellant further argues \nthe lack of jury instructions on lesser-included offenses \"being ignored by the court\" \nappellant's counsel \"still does not take these arguments to the next level by motioning the \ncourt for a new trial or sentence modification * * * which shows her incompetence and \ndeficiency in not doing so.\"  (Mot. for New Trial at 28.)  We do not accept this as evidence \nof being unavoidably prevented from filing the motion as the lack of jury instructions on \nlesser-included offenses was known to trial counsel and appellant at the time of trial.  At \nthe time of trial and within the time prescribed for filing the motion, appellant was aware \nof the grounds he asserts in support of his motion.   \n{\u00b6 16} Finally, appellant argues that his motion cannot be barred for untimeliness \npursuant to Jama.  In Jama, we noted the defendant did not file a timely motion and we \nfound the trial court erred in modifying the verdict without providing some reference to a \nvalid authority which permits such a review and modification.  We are not persuaded Jama \nsupports a finding that appellant was unavoidably prevented from filing his motion in a \ntimely manner.   \n{\u00b6 17} Accordingly, we find appellant's motion was not timely filed and, therefore, \nthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.   \n{\u00b6 18} Having found appellant's motion to be untimely filed, it is not necessary for \nthis court to address appellant's remaining arguments which address the merits of his \nmotion. \nIV.  Conclusion \n{\u00b6 19} In conclusion, we overrule appellant's single assignment of error.

Robinson, Jr., appeals, pro se, from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas denying his motion for new trial and modification of verdict/sentence. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\nI. Facts and Procedural History\n\n\u00b6 2 The facts and procedural history of this case are outlined in our decision regarding appellant\u2019s direct appeal of his case in State v. Robinson, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-563, 2014-Ohio-520, and will only be repeated here as relevant to our discussion. In Robinson, appellant asserted that: (1) the jury verdicts in the case were not supported by the manifest weight of the evidence, and (2) the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences without making the necessary findings mandated by R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). We overruled both assignments of error and affirmed the trial court judgment.\nSubsequently, appellant filed with this court an application for delayed reopening of the appeal. We denied appellant\u2019s application noting that appellate counsel had provided appellant with copies of the appellate briefs in a timely fashion and, therefore, appellant had the opportunity to notify counsel or this court of any additional issues before the case was submitted to a panel of the court for a decision. We also noted appellant was convicted of aggravated burglary and sexual battery based on eye witness testimony supported by DNA evidence, and nothing before us indicated that any of his lawyers rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Robinson*, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-563, 2015-Ohio-3486.\n\nOn August 22, 2016, appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief. The trial court denied the petition on December 8, 2016, and we affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial on May 15, 2017. *State v. Robinson*, 10th Dist. No. 16AP-887, 2017-Ohio-2773.\n\nOn August 18, 2017, appellant filed a motion for new trial and modification of verdict and sentence alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court denied the petition finding it to be not well-taken. Appellant timely appealed.\n\n**II. Assignment of Error**\n\nAlthough not expressly articulated, having reviewed his brief it appears appellant asserts a single assignment of error: that the trial court erred in denying his motion for new trial. In support, he makes several arguments including: (1) the verdicts of guilty of sexual battery and aggravated burglary were not supported by sufficient evidence, (2) the judge abused its discretion by not instructing jurors on lesser-included offenses, (3) the judge abused its discretion by admitting certain evidence which was prejudicial to appellant in violation of the Rules of Evidence, (4) the prosecutor engaged in misconduct, and (5) his trial counsel was ineffective in not timely bringing this motion for new trial.\n\n**III. Discussion**\n\nWe begin by considering appellant\u2019s arguments regarding the timeliness of his motion. Appellant asserts he filed the motion pursuant to Crim.R. 33. An appellate court applies an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial. *State v. Anderson*, 10th Dist. No. 12AP-133,\n\n---\n\n1 We note appellant\u2019s motion did not contain an affidavit regarding prosecutorial misconduct which is required by Crim.R. 33(C).\n2012-Ohio-4733, \u00b6 9. Although an abuse of discretion is typically defined as an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable decision, no court has the authority, within its discretion, to commit an error of law. *State v. Moncrief*, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-391, 2013-Ohio-4571, \u00b6 7.\n\n\u00b6 8  Crim.R. 33(B) states:\n\nApplication for a new trial shall be made by motion which, except for the cause of newly discovered evidence, shall be filed within fourteen days after the verdict was rendered, or the decision of the court where a trial by jury has been waived, unless it is made to appear by clear and convincing proof that the defendant was unavoidably prevented from filing his motion for a new trial, in which case the motion shall be filed within seven days from the order of the court finding that the defendant was unavoidably prevented from filing such motion within the time provided herein.\n\nMotions for new trial on account of newly discovered evidence shall be filed within one hundred twenty days after the day upon which the verdict was rendered, or the decision of the court where trial by jury has been waived. If it is made to appear by clear and convincing proof that the defendant was unavoidably prevented from the discovery of the evidence upon which he must rely, such motion shall be filed within seven days from an order of the court finding that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence within the one hundred twenty day period.\n\n\u00b6 9  In *State v. Jama*, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-210, 2012-Ohio-2466, \u00b6 21, we observed some courts have held a trial court cannot consider the merits of a motion for new trial until it makes a finding regarding timeliness. *See id.*, reference to *State v. Lanier*, 2d Dist. No. 2009 CA 84, 2010-Ohio-2921, \u00b6 17 (a defendant may file a motion for new trial along with the request for leave to file said motion, but the court cannot consider the merits of the motion for a new trial until it makes a finding of unavoidable prevention). We also noted in *Jama* the trial court never made a finding of unavoidable prevention or issued an order to that effect because *Jama* failed to properly seek leave before filing his motion. Such is the case here, as appellant never sought leave to file his motion before filing the same and in ultimately denying appellant\u2019s motion, the trial court did not address the timeliness of the motion.

We deny Robinson\u2019s motions  and affirm the \ncourt of appeals\u2019 judgment. \nI.  Factual and Procedural Background \n{\u00b6 2} Robinson is serving a 55-year pri son sentence.  On December 18,  \n2020, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Ninth District.  Robinson \nattached to his petition an affidavit of indigency, stating: \n \nI, Martin Robinson, do hereby state that I am without the \nnecessary funds to pay costs of this action for the following reasons: \nI am illegally incarcerated in Ohio Department of \nRehabilitation and Correction, and earn no money. SUPREME COURT OF OHIO \n \n \n2\nI request that any filing fees , court costs, deposits, if \napplicable, be waived, for all filings in these courts. \n \n{\u00b6 3} The Lorain County Prosecuting Attorney, whom Robinson named as \nthe respondent below, filed a mo tion to dismiss Robinson\u2019s peti tion under Civ.R. \n12(B)(6), arguing that it was procedurally deficient on numerous grounds and that \nit failed to state a claim that is cognizable in habeas corpus.

Robinson\u2019s Motions \n{\u00b6 5} With his reply brief in this appeal, Robinson included a motion  for \n\u201c \u2018Brady\u2019 discovery, evidence, and compl ete record.\u201d  Although Robinson  \npresumably seeks through that motion evidence that is favorable  to him regarding \nhis underlying convictions, see Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 \nL.Ed.2d 215 (1963), he does not explain what evidence he is see king or offer any \nargument supporting his request.  To the extent that Robinson is seeking additional \nevidence in support of his habeas corpus claim, the request is improper.  \u201cA \nreviewing court generally may not add matter to the record before it and then decide \nthe appeal on the basis of the new matter.\u201d  State ex rel.

Accordingly,  we deny \nRobinson\u2019s motion. \n{\u00b6 6} We also deny Robinson\u2019s motion fo r oral argument.  A case may b e \nset for oral argument under S.Ct.Prac.R. 17.02(A) if it \u201cinvolv es a matter of great \npublic importance, complex issues of law or fact, a substantial constitutional issue, \nor a conflict among courts of appeals.\u201d  State ex rel.

Dismissal of the Habeas Petition \n{\u00b6 7} We review de novo a court of appeals\u2019 dismissal of a habeas cor pus \naction for failure to comply with the affidavit requirements in  R.C. 2969.25.  See \nState ex rel. Steele v. Foley , 164 Ohio St.3d 540, 2021-Ohio-2073, 173 N.E.3d \n1209, \u00b6 6-7. \n{\u00b6 8} An inmate seeking a waiver of the court\u2019s filing fees when \ncommencing a civil action against a governmental entity or employee in a court of \ncommon pleas, court of appeals, county court, or municipal court must file with his \ncomplaint an affidavit stating that he is seeking a waiver of t he prepayment of the \ncourt\u2019s full filing fees and an a ffidavit of indigency.  R.C. 2 969.25(C).  The \naffidavits must contain (1) a st atement setting forth the balan ce of the inmate\u2019s \ninstitutional account for each of the preceding six months and (2) a statement that \nsets forth all other cash and things of value owned by the inma te.  Id.  These \nrequirements are mandatory and an inmate\u2019s failure to comply with them is a proper \nbasis for dismissal of the action.  State ex rel. Evans v. McGrath , 151 Ohio St.3d \n345, 2017-Ohio-8290, 88 N.E.3d 957, \u00b6 5. \n{\u00b6 9} Robinson\u2019s affidavit of indigenc y did not satisfy the mandatory  \nrequirements.  It was not notar ized and is therefore defective.   See Griffin v. \nMcFaul, 116 Ohio St.3d 30, 2007-Ohio-5506, 876 N.E.2d 527, \u00b6 2, 4.  F urther, \nRobinson\u2019s affidavit failed to include the balance of his inmat e account or a SUPREME COURT OF OHIO \n \n \n4\nstatement of any cash or things of value that he owns.  See R.C. 2969.25(C).  These \ndeficiencies made Robinson\u2019s habeas action subject to dismissal.  See State ex rel. \nRoden v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. & Corr. , 159 Ohio St.3d 314, 2020-Ohio-408, 150 \nN.E.3d 905, \u00b6 7. \n{\u00b6 10} In this appeal, Robinson does not  argue that he satisfied R.C. \n2969.25(C)\u2019s mandatory requirements, much less that the court of appeals erred in \ndismissing his petition because of his noncompliance.  Rather, Robinson argues the \nmerits of his habeas claims, which the court of appeals never r eached.  Robinson \ntherefore fails to demonstrate any error by the court of appeals warranting reversal \nof its judgment. \n{\u00b6 11} Accordingly, the court of appeal s correctly dismissed Robinson\u2019 s \nhabeas petition. \nJudgment affirmed. \nO\u2019CONNOR, C.J., and KENNEDY, FISCHER, DEWINE, DONNELLY, STEWART, \nand BRUNNER, JJ., concur. \n_________________ \nMartin Robinson, pro se. \nJ.D.

We deny Robinson\u2019s motions and affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.\n\nI. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n\u00b6 2 Robinson is serving a 55-year prison sentence. On December 18, 2020, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Ninth District. Robinson attached to his petition an affidavit of indigency, stating:\n\nI, Martin Robinson, do hereby state that I am without the necessary funds to pay costs of this action for the following reasons:\n\nI am illegally incarcerated in Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, and earn no money.\nI request that any filing fees, court costs, deposits, if applicable, be waived, for all filings in these courts.\n\n\u00b6 3 The Lorain County Prosecuting Attorney, whom Robinson named as the respondent below, filed a motion to dismiss Robinson\u2019s petition under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), arguing that it was procedurally deficient on numerous grounds and that it failed to state a claim that is cognizable in habeas corpus. Robinson did not file a response to the motion to dismiss.\n\n\u00b6 4 Without expressly ruling on the state\u2019s motion, the court of appeals dismissed Robinson\u2019s petition. The court of appeals found Robinson\u2019s affidavit of indigency deficient under R.C. 2969.25(C). 2021-Ohio-634, \u00b6 4. And because compliance with R.C. 2969.25 is mandatory when an inmate seeks to waive a court\u2019s filing fees in a civil action against a governmental entity or employee in a court of appeals, the court of appeals dismissed Robinson\u2019s petition without reaching the merits of his claims for habeas relief. See id. at \u00b6 2, 5. Robinson appealed to this court as of right.\n\nII. Analysis\n\nA. Robinson\u2019s Motions\n\n\u00b6 5 With his reply brief in this appeal, Robinson included a motion for \u201c\u2018Brady\u2019 discovery, evidence, and complete record.\u201d Although Robinson presumably seeks through that motion evidence that is favorable to him regarding his underlying convictions, see Brady v.

Harris v. Turner, 160 Ohio\nAccordingly, we deny Robinson\u2019s motion.\n\n\u00b6 6 We also deny Robinson\u2019s motion for oral argument.

Davis v. Pub. Emps. Retirement Bd., 111 Ohio St.3d 118, 2006-Ohio-5339, 855 N.E.2d 444, \u00b6 15. This case involves none of those criteria.\n\nB. Dismissal of the Habeas Petition\n\n\u00b6 7 We review de novo a court of appeals\u2019 dismissal of a habeas corpus action for failure to comply with the affidavit requirements in R.C. 2969.25. See State ex rel. Steele v. Foley, 164 Ohio St.3d 540, 2021-Ohio-2073, 173 N.E.3d 1209, \u00b6 6-7.\n\n\u00b6 8 An inmate seeking a waiver of the court\u2019s filing fees when commencing a civil action against a governmental entity or employee in a court of common pleas, court of appeals, county court, or municipal court must file with his complaint an affidavit stating that he is seeking a waiver of the prepayment of the court\u2019s full filing fees and an affidavit of indigency.

The affidavits must contain (1) a statement setting forth the balance of the inmate\u2019s institutional account for each of the preceding six months and (2) a statement that sets forth all other cash and things of value owned by the inmate. Id. These requirements are mandatory and an inmate\u2019s failure to comply with them is a proper basis for dismissal of the action. State ex rel. Evans v.

Further, Robinson\u2019s affidavit failed to include the balance of his inmate account or a\nstatement of any cash or things of value that he owns. See R.C. 2969.25(C). These deficiencies made Robinson\u2019s habeas action subject to dismissal. See State ex rel. Roden v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. & Corr., 159 Ohio St.3d 314, 2020-Ohio-408, 150 N.E.3d 905, \u00b6 7.\n\n\u00b6 10 In this appeal, Robinson does not argue that he satisfied R.C. 2969.25(C)\u2019s mandatory requirements, much less that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his petition because of his noncompliance. Rather, Robinson argues the merits of his habeas claims, which the court of appeals never reached.

Gibson, appeals the decision of the Butler County Court of \nCommon Pleas denying his joint petition for postconviction relief and motion for a new trial.  \nFor the reasons outlined below, we affirm the trial court's decision. \n{\u00b6 2} On April 22, 2016, a jury found Gibson guilty of raping a nine- year-old girl in \nviolation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), a first-degree felony.  Approximately one month later, on Butler CA2020-11-114 \n \n - 2 - \nMay 24, 2016, the trial court held a sentencing hearing and sen tenced Gibson to serve a \nmandatory term of ten-years-to-life in prison.  The trial court  also ordered Gibson to pay a \n$5,000 fine and classified Gibson as a Tier III sex offender.   \n{\u00b6 3} On March 13, 2017, this court affirmed Gibson's conviction.  See State v. \nGibson, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2016-06-107, 2017-Ohio-877.  In so ho lding, this court \nfound Gibson's conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.  Id. at \u00b6 32-\n41.  In reaching this decision, this court found it clear that \"[t]he jury found [the victim's] \ntestimony believable and we defer to the factfinder with respec t to credibility \ndeterminations.\"  Id. at \u00b6 39.  This court also found that \"[a]ny asserted inconsist encies\" in \nthe victim's testimony were \"readily explained\" by the testimon y elicited from the state's \nexpert witness, \"an expert in pediatric abuse who has seen over  a thousand patients for \nchild sexual abuse in her career * * *.\"  Id.  This was in addition to this court's finding that \n\"to the extent any inconsistencies existed, the jury was able to rationally resolve them based \non the testimony presented at trial during their deliberations.\"  Id. at \u00b6 40. \n{\u00b6 4} On December 12, 2018, Gibson filed with this court an applicati on for \nreconsideration and an application to reopen his appeal.  This court denied Gibson's \napplication for reconsideration on January 8, 2019.  See State v. Gibson, 12th Dist. Butler \nCA2016-06-107 (Jan. 8, 2019) (Entry Denying Application for Rec onsideration).  The \nfollowing month, on February 5, 2019, this court also denied Gibson's application to reopen \nhis appeal.  See State v. Gibson, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2016-06-017 (Feb. 5, 2019) (Entry \nDenying Application for Reopening). \n{\u00b6 5} On March 13, 2019, Gibson filed the joint petition for postconviction relief and \nmotion for new trial subject to this appeal.  In support of thi s filing, Gibson argued the trial \ncourt judge who presided over his trial, Judge Charles Pater, w as biased and prejudiced \nagainst him, thereby entitling him to a new trial.   Butler CA2020-11-114 \n \n - 3 - \n{\u00b6 6} On September 4, 2019, Gibson filed a supplemental petition for postconviction \nrelief.  In his supplemental petition, Gibson again argued that he was entitled to a new trial \nbecause Judge Pater \"made decisions to [his] detriment which we re influenced by\" Judge \nPater's bias and prejudice against him.  These decisions includ ed, but were not limited to, \nthe trial court's decision not to dismiss a potential juror for  cause, the trial court's decision \nto permit the victim's mother to testify at trial about Gibson' s \"excessive\" drinking, and the \ntrial court's decision to reject Gibson's request to question a witness about whether Gibson \nhad voluntarily submitted to a polygraph examination. \n{\u00b6 7} On October 26, 2020, a visiting judge issued a decision denying Gibson's joint \npetition for postconviction relief and motion for a new trial.  In so holding, the court noted \nthat it had reviewed the entirety of the record and found \"no e vidence\" that Judge Pater \n\"made trial rulings or other decisions that evidenced judicial bias.\"  Given this finding, the \ncourt also found Gibson had failed to demonstrate that he was entitled to a new trial. \n{\u00b6 8} Gibson now appeals the decision denying his joint petition for postconviction \nrelief and motion for new trial, raising the following five assignments of error for review. \n{\u00b6 9} Assignment of Error No. 1: \n{\u00b6 10} TRIAL COURT ERRED BY APPOINTING COUNSEL REQUESTED BY \nPROSECUTION, VIOLATING LOCAL RULE 6.04. \n{\u00b6 11} Assignment of Error No. 2: \n{\u00b6 12} TRIAL COURT MADE ERROR BY DENYING DEFENDANT THE RIGHT TO \nPRESENT A COMPLETE DEFENSE. \n{\u00b6 13} Assignment of Error No. 3: \n{\u00b6 14} PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT/FRAUD. \n{\u00b6 15} Assignment of Error No. 4: \n{\u00b6 16} PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT.  FILING FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS Butler CA2020-11-114 \n \n - 4 - \nWITH THE COURT WITH THE INTENT TO MISLEAD. \n{\u00b6 17} Assignment of Error No. 5: \n{\u00b6 18} REFUSAL TO DISMISS FOR CAUSE, CREATING A BIAS AND \nPREJUDICIAL JURY. \n{\u00b6 19} In his five assignments of error, Gibson makes a variety of claims challenging \nthe jury's verdict finding him guilty of first-degree felony ra pe.  This includes arguments \nwherein Gibson claims that he received ineffective assistance o f trial counsel, that he was \nthe victim of prosecutorial misconduct, and that the trial court denied him the right to present \na complete defense.  However, even assuming the facts alleged b y Gibson were true, the \nvast majority of Gibson's arguments could have been raised as p art of his direct appeal, \nthereby rendering those claims barred by the doctrine of res ju dicata.  See, e.g., State v. \nHarrop, 12th Dist. Fayette No. CA2018-12-028, 2019-Ohio-3230, \u00b6 8 (re s judicata barred \nappellant's arguments raised in his petition for postconviction relief and motion for new trial \nwhere appellant \"directly appealed his convictions and sentence on multiple occasions, and \neither asserted or could have asserted in his direct appeals the same arguments he raised \nin his motion for a new trial and petition for postconviction relief\"). \n{\u00b6 20} That is to say nothing of the fact that several of Gibson's oth er claims do not \narise out of the judgment entry that Gibson appealed, i.e., the trial court's decision denying \nhis joint petition for postconviction relief and motion for new  trial.  Gibson's claims instead \narise out of the trial court's original judgment entry sentenci ng him to serve a mandatory \nterm of ten-years-to-life in prison after the jury found him gu ilty of first-degree felony rape.  \nPursuant to App.R. 12(A)(1)(a), this court may only \"[r]eview and affirm, modify, or reverse \nthe judgment or final order appealed * * *.\"  (Emphasis added.)  Therefore, assuming \nGibson's claims were not already barred by the doctrine of res judicata, any of Gibson's \nclaims arising out of something other than the trial court's decision denying his joint petition Butler CA2020-11-114 \n \n - 5 - \nand motion need not be addressed by this court.  See, e.g., State v. Wright , 8th Dist. \nCuyahoga No. 95634, 2011-Ohio-3583, \u00b6 7 (\"[b]ecause this assignment of error addresses \nissues outside the scope of the present appeal, it will not be addressed\").   \n{\u00b6 21} Regardless, even when reviewing the actual substance of Gibson' s claims, \nwe find no merit to any of the arguments raised within Gibson's  five assignments of error.  \nFor instance, as it relates to Gibson's first assignment of error alleging the trial court violated \nits Loc.R. 6.04 by appointing him with trial counsel requested by the state, that rule sets \nforth the trial court's procedure as it relates to discovery, s ubmitting interrogatories, and \nrequests for admission.  The trial court's Loc.R. 6.04, therefo re, has no application to the \ncase at bar, let alone to the trial court's decision denying Gi bson's joint petition for \npostconviction relief and motion for new trial.  Gibson's claim otherwise lacks merit. \n{\u00b6 22} Moreover, as it relates to Gibson's fourth assignment of error alleging the state \nacted fraudulently when it filed a false and/or misleading memo randum regarding the \nproposed testimony of his expert witness, Dr. Lowenstein, Gibso n has not provided any \nevidence to prove the state actually engaged in such misconduct .  Gibson has also failed \nto provide any evidence to show how the state's alleged misconduct contributed to the trial \ncourt's purported bias against him, as well as any prejudice resulting from the state's alleged \nmisconduct.  This is because, as the record indicates, Gibson was free to argue against the \nstate's position before the trial court, just as he does to thi s court on appeal.  The same \nrationale would apply to Gibson's arguments advanced under his second and third \nassignments of error, one of which involves a substantially similar argument wherein Gibson \nalleges the state submitted \"false, fraudulent documents with the intent to mislead the court, \nwith complete success.\"  \n{\u00b6 23} Gibson's claims advanced under his fifth assignment of error al so lack merit.  \nIn his fifth assignment of error, Gibson argues the \"willingness\" of the trial court \"to leave a Butler CA2020-11-114 \n \n - 6 - \npotentially bias[ed] juror for defense to use as an unnecessary  preemptory challenge on \nshows bias.\"  The record, however, does not support Gibson's cl aim that his trial counsel \nsought to have that juror excused for cause.  And, even if the record did support such a \nclaim, the record indicates that juror specifically stated that he could be a fair and impartial.  \nThere is also nothing in the record to indicate any decision th e trial court may have made \nregarding this juror was the result of the trial court's bias a gainst Gibson, nor is there \nanything in the record to indicate how the jury's composition p rejudiced Gibson.  This is \nparticularly true here when considering the jury acquitted Gibs on on three of the four \ncharges.   \n{\u00b6 24} In light of the foregoing, and despite Gibson's claims otherwise, the record is \ndevoid of any evidence to suggest the trial court was biased against Gibson or that Gibson \ndid not receive a fair trial.  In so holding, we note the well- established principle that \"a \ndefendant is entitled to a fair, but not perfect, trial.\"  State v. Morton , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga \nNo. 109200, 2021-Ohio-581, \u00b6 49, citing United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 508-509, \n103 S.Ct. 1974 (1983); and State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 166 (1990).  \"The purpose of \nappellate review,\" therefore, \"is to ensure that litigants receive fair trials, not perfect ones.\"  \nState v. Lopez , 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 18646, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 5620, *16  (Dec. \n14, 2001) (Fain, J., concurring).  Accordingly, finding no meri t to any of the arguments \nadvanced herein, Gibson's five assignments of error lack merit and are overruled. \n{\u00b6 25} Judgment affirmed. \n M.

In reaching this decision, this court found it clear that \"[t]he jury found [the victim's] testimony believable and we defer to the factfinder with respect to credibility determinations.\" Id. at \u00b6 39. This court also found that \"[a]ny asserted inconsistencies\" in the victim's testimony were \"readily explained\" by the testimony elicited from the state's expert witness, \"an expert in pediatric abuse who has seen over a thousand patients for child sexual abuse in her career * * *.\" Id. This was in addition to this court's finding that \"to the extent any inconsistencies existed, the jury was able to rationally resolve them based on the testimony presented at trial during their deliberations.\" Id. at \u00b6 40.\n\n\u00b6 4 On December 12, 2018, Gibson filed with this court an application for reconsideration and an application to reopen his appeal. This court denied Gibson's application for reconsideration on January 8, 2019. See State v. Gibson, 12th Dist. Butler CA2016-06-107 (Jan. 8, 2019) (Entry Denying Application for Reconsideration). The following month, on February 5, 2019, this court also denied Gibson's application to reopen his appeal. See State v. Gibson, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2016-06-017 (Feb. 5, 2019) (Entry Denying Application for Reopening).\n\n\u00b6 5 On March 13, 2019, Gibson filed the joint petition for postconviction relief and motion for new trial subject to this appeal. In support of this filing, Gibson argued the trial court judge who presided over his trial, Judge Charles Pater, was biased and prejudiced against him, thereby entitling him to a new trial.\nOn September 4, 2019, Gibson filed a supplemental petition for postconviction relief. In his supplemental petition, Gibson again argued that he was entitled to a new trial because Judge Pater \"made decisions to [his] detriment which were influenced by\" Judge Pater's bias and prejudice against him. These decisions included, but were not limited to, the trial court's decision not to dismiss a potential juror for cause, the trial court's decision to permit the victim's mother to testify at trial about Gibson's \"excessive\" drinking, and the trial court's decision to reject Gibson's request to question a witness about whether Gibson had voluntarily submitted to a polygraph examination.\n\nOn October 26, 2020, a visiting judge issued a decision denying Gibson's joint petition for postconviction relief and motion for a new trial. In so holding, the court noted that it had reviewed the entirety of the record and found \"no evidence\" that Judge Pater \"made trial rulings or other decisions that evidenced judicial bias.\" Given this finding, the court also found Gibson had failed to demonstrate that he was entitled to a new trial.\n\nGibson now appeals the decision denying his joint petition for postconviction relief and motion for new trial, raising the following five assignments of error for review.\n\nAssignment of Error No. 1:\n\nTRIAL COURT ERRED BY APPOINTING COUNSEL REQUESTED BY PROSECUTION, VIOLATING LOCAL RULE 6.04.\n\nAssignment of Error No. 2:\n\nTRIAL COURT MADE ERROR BY DENYING DEFENDANT THE RIGHT TO PRESENT A COMPLETE DEFENSE.\n\nAssignment of Error No. 3:\n\nPROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT/FRAUD.\n\nAssignment of Error No. 4:\n\nPROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT. FILING FRAUDULENT DOCUMENTS\nWITH THE COURT WITH THE INTENT TO MISLEAD.\n\n{\u00b6 17} Assignment of Error No. 5:\n\n{\u00b6 18} REFUSAL TO DISMISS FOR CAUSE, CREATING A BIAS AND PREJUDICIAL JURY.\n\n{\u00b6 19} In his five assignments of error, Gibson makes a variety of claims challenging the jury's verdict finding him guilty of first-degree felony rape. This includes arguments wherein Gibson claims that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel, that he was the victim of prosecutorial misconduct, and that the trial court denied him the right to present a complete defense. However, even assuming the facts alleged by Gibson were true, the vast majority of Gibson's arguments could have been raised as part of his direct appeal, thereby rendering those claims barred by the doctrine of res judicata. See, e.g., State v. Harrop, 12th Dist. Fayette No. CA2018-12-028, 2019-Ohio-3230, \u00b6 8 (res judicata barred appellant's arguments raised in his petition for postconviction relief and motion for new trial where appellant \"directly appealed his convictions and sentence on multiple occasions, and either asserted or could have asserted in his direct appeals the same arguments he raised in his motion for a new trial and petition for postconviction relief\").\n\n{\u00b6 20} That is to say nothing of the fact that several of Gibson's other claims do not arise out of the judgment entry that Gibson appealed, i.e., the trial court's decision denying his joint petition for postconviction relief and motion for new trial. Gibson's claims instead arise out of the trial court's original judgment entry sentencing him to serve a mandatory term of ten-years-to-life in prison after the jury found him guilty of first-degree felony rape. Pursuant to App.R. 12(A)(1)(a), this court may only \"[r]eview and affirm, modify, or reverse the judgment or final order appealed * * *.\" (Emphasis added.) Therefore, assuming Gibson's claims were not already barred by the doctrine of res judicata, any of Gibson's claims arising out of something other than the trial court's decision denying his joint petition\nand motion need not be addressed by this court. See, e.g., State v. Wright, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 95634, 2011-Ohio-3583, \u00b6 7 (\"[b]ecause this assignment of error addresses issues outside the scope of the present appeal, it will not be addressed\").\n\n{\u00b6 21} Regardless, even when reviewing the actual substance of Gibson's claims, we find no merit to any of the arguments raised within Gibson's five assignments of error. For instance, as it relates to Gibson's first assignment of error alleging the trial court violated its Loc.R. 6.04 by appointing him with trial counsel requested by the state, that rule sets forth the trial court's procedure as it relates to discovery, submitting interrogatories, and requests for admission. The trial court's Loc.R. 6.04, therefore, has no application to the case at bar, let alone to the trial court's decision denying Gibson's joint petition for postconviction relief and motion for new trial. Gibson's claim otherwise lacks merit.\n\n{\u00b6 22} Moreover, as it relates to Gibson's fourth assignment of error alleging the state acted fraudulently when it filed a false and/or misleading memorandum regarding the proposed testimony of his expert witness, Dr. Lowenstein, Gibson has not provided any evidence to prove the state actually engaged in such misconduct. Gibson has also failed to provide any evidence to show how the state's alleged misconduct contributed to the trial court's purported bias against him, as well as any prejudice resulting from the state's alleged misconduct. This is because, as the record indicates, Gibson was free to argue against the state's position before the trial court, just as he does to this court on appeal. The same rationale would apply to Gibson's arguments advanced under his second and third assignments of error, one of which involves a substantially similar argument wherein Gibson alleges the state submitted \"false, fraudulent documents with the intent to mislead the court, with complete success.\"\n\n{\u00b6 23} Gibson's claims advanced under his fifth assignment of error also lack merit. In his fifth assignment of error, Gibson argues the \"willingness\" of the trial court \"to leave a\npotentially bias[ed] juror for defense to use as an unnecessary preemptory challenge on shows bias.\" The record, however, does not support Gibson's claim that his trial counsel sought to have that juror excused for cause. And, even if the record did support such a claim, the record indicates that juror specifically stated that he could be a fair and impartial. There is also nothing in the record to indicate any decision the trial court may have made regarding this juror was the result of the trial court's bias against Gibson, nor is there anything in the record to indicate how the jury's composition prejudiced Gibson. This is particularly true here when considering the jury acquitted Gibson on three of the four charges.\n\n{\u00b6 24} In light of the foregoing, and despite Gibson's claims otherwise, the record is devoid of any evidence to suggest the trial court was biased against Gibson or that Gibson did not receive a fair trial. In so holding, we note the well-established principle that \"a defendant is entitled to a fair, but not perfect, trial.\" State v. Morton, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 109200, 2021-Ohio-581, \u00b6 49, citing United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 508-509, 103 S.Ct. 1974 (1983); and State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 166 (1990). \"The purpose of appellate review,\" therefore, \"is to ensure that litigants receive fair trials, not perfect ones.\" State v. Lopez, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 18646, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 5620, *16 (Dec. 14, 2001) (Fain, J., concurring). Accordingly, finding no merit to any of the arguments advanced herein, Gibson's five assignments of error lack merit and are overruled.\n\n{\u00b6 25} Judgment affirmed.\n\nM. POWELL, P.J., and BYRNE, J., concur."}

Pierone k, appeals from his conviction in the \nWayne County Municipal Court.  For the reasons that follow, this Court reverses.   \nI. \n{\u00b62} On August 11, 2017, Mr. Pieronek, in the cour se of his employment as a driver \nfor FedEx, was operating a truck along his route through Apple Creek in Wayne County.  While \ndriving the truck on Bank Street, Mr. Pierone k \u201cheard a big bang\u201d and immediately stopped his \ntruck.  He noticed a wire on the truck and, acco rding to Mr. Pieronek, he informed a FedEx \ndispatcher \u201cabout hitting a wire and the damage to  the poles.\u201d  Mr. Pieronek indicated that he \nwaited approximately ten minutes to hear back from the dispatcher, who then instructed him to \ncontinue on his route and fill out an incident report when he got back.  Mr. Pieronek left the \nscene and continued on his route to his next stop at a business located on Apple Creek Road.  2 \n          \n \nThereafter, Mr. Pieronek proceeded toward another stop on his route, but was forced to park his \ntruck until he completed a mandatory half hour break.   \n{\u00b63} Meanwhile, a witness looking out of a window  in the front room of his house had \nobserved the FedEx truck get hooked on something at the intersection of Bank Street and County \nRoad 44.  He saw a wire come out of the transf ormer, followed by a shower of sparks, and the \nlights going out.  The witness, who resides on West Wood Drive in Apple Creek, contacted the \nWayne County Sheriff\u2019s office to report the inci dent.  The witness also  contacted the electric \nservice provider to report the downed power line and approximately five or six poles.  After the \nHighway Patrol arrived, the witness gave a statement to Trooper Hannah Hill. \n{\u00b64} While on his mandatory break, Mr. Pier onek received a message from a FedEx \ndispatcher instructing him to return to the location where he had struck the wire.  Mr. Pieronek \nmet with Trooper Hill and gave a statement.  Trooper Hill cited Mr. Pieron ek for violating R.C. \n4506.15(A)(11).   \n{\u00b65} The complaint filed in the Wayne County Municipal Court originally charged Mr. \nPieronek for violating R.C. 4506.15(A)(11).  U pon the State\u2019s motion, the charge was later \namended to charge Mr. Pieronek for failure  to stop after an accident under R.C. 4549.02, a \nmisdemeanor of the first degree.  Mr. Pieronek entered a plea of not guilty to the charge. \n{\u00b66} The matter was set for trial and, after several continuan ces of the trial date, the \nmatter proceeded to a bench trial.  After the State presented its case, Mr. Pieronek moved the \ntrial court for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29.  The trial court overruled the \nmotion.  As trial counsel for Mr. Pieronek presente d his case, the State moved to exclude all of \nhis witnesses on the grounds that he failed to provide a witness lis t.  The trial court granted the \nmotion, and Mr. Pieronek was the only witness permitted to testify in his defense.   3 \n          \n \n{\u00b67} The trial court found Mr. Pi eronek guilty of \u201chit skip\u201d in violation of R.C. \n4549.02.  The trial court sentenced Mr. Pieronek to a six-month license suspension and fined him \nfive hundred dollars.  Mr. Pieronek appealed his conviction raising six a ssignments of error for \nour review.  For ease of analysis, we consolidate certain assignments of error.  \nII. \nAssignment of Error I \n \nThe trial court committed prejudicial error by not granting defense counsel\u2019s \n[Crim.R.] 29 motion, since it was undisputed that the incident in question did \nnot involve a collision with either a pedestrian or another motor vehicle nor \ndid it occur upon public road or highway as required by R.C. 4549.02 and \nthe controlling case law.  \n \nAssignment of Error II \n \nThe evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a finding of guilt \nfor hit-skip pursuant to R.C. 4549.02.  \n \n{\u00b68} In his first assignment of error, Mr. Pier onek contends that the trial court erred by \ndenying his Crim. R. 29 motion for judgment of ac quittal.  In his second assignment of error, he \ncontends that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence.  Both assignments of error \nare premised upon the same argument: that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to show \nthat the collision occurred with \u201cproperty upon the ro adway\u201d in order to satisfy the elements of \nR.C. 4549.02.  \n{\u00b69} Crim.R. 29(A) provides that a trial court shall enter a judgment of acquittal upon \nmotion after the evidence on either side is closed, \u201cif the evidence is insufficient to sustain a \nconviction of such offense[.]\u201d  A challenge to th e sufficiency of a criminal conviction presents a \nquestion of law, which we review de novo.  State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386 (1997).  \nIn carrying out this review, our \u201cfunction * * * is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to \ndetermine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the 4 \n          \n \ndefendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d  State v. Jenks , 61 Ohio St.3d 259 (1991), \nparagraph two of the syllabus.  After such an examination and taking the evidence in the light \nmost favorable to the prosecution, we must decide  whether \u201cany rational trier of fact could have \nfound the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d  Id. \n{\u00b610} R.C. 4549.02 (A)(1) states in pertinent part: \u201c[i]n the case of a motor vehicle \naccident or collision with persons or property on a public road or highway, the operator of the \nmotor vehicle, having knowledge of the accide nt or collision, immediately shall stop the \noperator\u2019s motor vehicle at the scene of the accident or collision.\u201d  \n{\u00b611} In support of his sufficiency argument, Mr. Pieronek cites to State v. Cutlip , 9th \nDist. Summit No. 28735, 2018-Ohio-726.  In Cutlip, this Court found insufficient evidence to \nsupport a conviction for failure to stop where th e collision occurred after Mr. Cutlip left the \nroadway, collided with a mailbox adjacent to the road, and landed in a ditch.  Recognizing in \nCutlip that the accident did not, as it must, \u201coccur on a public road or highway[,]\u201d we concluded \nthat the trial court erred by denying Mr. Cutlip\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal.  \nId. at \u00b6 10-11; see R.C. 4549.02(A).    \n{\u00b612} Despite Mr. Pieronek\u2019s insistence that the outcome in Cutlip is determinative of \nthis case, the facts of the present matter are wholly distinguishable from the facts at issue in \nCutlip.  Here, Mr. Pieronek does not claim that the collision occurred after he left the roadway, \nnor does he attempt to establish that the overhead wires with which he collided were located \nadjacent to the roadway.  In his merit brief, Mr. Pi eronek asserts that it is \u201cundisputed\u201d that he \n\u201cwas lawfully driving his FedEx tractor trailer on a road he had travel[ed] many times before \nwhen his vehicle somehow caught on overhanging power line.\u201d  Indeed, such facts are not in \ndispute.  By Mr. Pieronek\u2019s own admission, he was operating his vehicle on the road when it 5 \n          \n \ncollided with overhanging power lines.  Consequently, Mr. Pieronek concedes the very element \nof R.C. 4549.02 he purports to challenge in his firs t two assignments of error.  Accordingly, and \nupon our review of the record viewing the eviden ce submitted in a light most favorable to the \nState, we cannot conclude that there was insuffici ent evidence to convince the trier of fact as to \nMr. Pieronek\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  \n{\u00b613} Mr. Pieronek\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled.  \nAssignment of Error III \n \nThe verdict of guilty for hit-skip pursuant to R.C. 4549.02 was against the \nmanifest weight of the evidence.  \n \n{\u00b614} In his third assignment of error, Mr. Pieronek asserts that the verdict was against \nthe manifest weight of the evidence.  When considering an argument that a criminal conviction is \nagainst the manifest weight standard, this Court is required to  \nreview the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, \nconsider the credibility of witnesses and determine whether, in resolving conflicts \nin the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest \nmiscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial \nordered. \n \nState v. Otten, 33 Ohio App.3d 339, 340 (9th Dist.1986).  Courts are cautioned to only reverse a \nconviction on manifest weight grounds \u201cin exceptional cases,\u201d State v. Carson, 9th Dist. Summit \nNo. 26900, 2013-Ohio-5785, \u00b6 32, citing Otten at 340, where the evidence \u201cweighs heavily \nagainst the conviction[.]\u201d  Thompkins at 387. \n{\u00b615} Although Mr. Pieronek\u2019s mer it brief does set forth the standard of review for a \nmanifest weight challenge, he  does not articulate a manifest weight argument.  Mr. Pieronek \ninstead asserts that \u201cit is clear that controlling case law was not followed\u201d and briefly reiterates \nthe arguments presented in his first assignment of error.  In doing so, Mr. Pieronek fails to \nprovide citations to the parts of the record on which his contention is based and has not presented 6 \n          \n \nan argument supporting his contentions with respect  to this assignment of error as required by \nApp.R. 16(A)(7).  This court will not create or develop an argument on Mr. Pieronek\u2019s behalf.  \nState v. Jackson, 9th Dist. Summit No. 28691, 2018-Ohio-1285, \u00b6 47, citing State v. Sadeghi, 9th \nDist. Wayne No. 14AP0051, 2016-Ohio-744, \u00b6 32. \n{\u00b616} Mr. Pieronek\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled. \nAssignment of Error IV \n \nThe trial court denied [Mr. Pieronek] due process by prohibiting all of [his] \nsubpoenaed witnesses from testifying[.]  \n \n{\u00b617} In his third assignment of error, Mr. Pieronek contends that the trial court erred by \ngranting the State\u2019s motion to exclude all of his subpoenaed witnesses from testifying.  We \nagree. \n{\u00b618} A defendant\u2019s \u201cright to offer the testimony of witnesses * * * is in plain terms the \nright to present a defense,\u201d and \u201c[t]his right is a fundamental element of due process of law.\u201d  \nCity of Lakewood v. Papadelis , 32 Ohio St.3d 1, 4-5 (1987), quoting Washington v. Texas , 388 \nU.S. 14, 19 (1967).  Yet, where the defendant fails to  properly disclose witnesses, it is within the \ndiscretion of the trial court \u201cto exclude testimony that is not disclosed in a timely manner in \norder to prevent surprise and ensure a fair trial.\u201d  State v. Calise , 9th Dist. Summit No. 26027, \n2012-Ohio-4797, \u00b6 30.  However, \u201cthe sancti on of exclusion may infringe on a criminal \ndefendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to present a defense, particularly where * * * all the \ndefendant\u2019s witnesses are excluded.\u201d  Papadelis at 5.   \n{\u00b619} Crim.R. 16 regulates discovery in criminal proceedings.  The purpose of the \u201crule \nis to provide all parties in a criminal case with the information necessary for a full and fair \nadjudication of the facts, to protect the integrity of the justice system and the rights of \ndefendants, and to protect the well-being of witnesses, victims, and society at large.\u201d  Crim.R. 7 \n          \n \n16(A).  Crim.R. 16(I) provides in pertinent part  that \u201c[e]ach party shall provide to opposing \ncounsel a written witness list, including names and addresses of any witne ss it intends to call in \nits case-in-chief, or reasonably anticipates calling in rebuttal or surrebuttal.\u201d  If a party fails to \ncomply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the trial court may \u201cgrant a \ncontinuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it \nmay make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u201d  Crim.R. 16(L)(1).   \n{\u00b620} We review a trial court\u2019s decision regarding a Crim.R. 16 discovery violation for \nan abuse of discretion.  State v. Price, 9th Dist. Medina No. 14CA0070-M, 2015-Ohio-5043, \u00b6 7.  \nAn abuse of discretion is more than an error of judgment; it means that the trial court was \nunreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable in its ruling.  Blakemore v. Blakemore , 5 Ohio St.3d \n217, 219 (1983).  A trial court may abuse its discretion where it fails to engage in a sound \nreasoning process.  State v. Darmond , 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, \u00b6 34.  When \napplying this standard, a reviewing court is precluded from simply substituting its own judgment \nfor that of the trial court.  Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd., 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621 (1993). \n{\u00b621} After the close of the State\u2019s case, couns el for Mr. Pieronek attempted to call the \nfirst witness for the defense.  The State objected to the witness testifying on the grounds that Mr. \nPieronek had not provided the State with a witne ss list.  Mr. Pieronek\u2019s trial counsel countered \nthe State\u2019s claim, asserting that the \u201c[w]itnesse s were identified,\u201d that she issued subpoenas to \neach witness, and that copies of the subpoenas we re provided to the court and also to the State \neach and every time this case was set for trial. \n{\u00b622} The State acknowledged that they rece ived notice of the subpoenas for the \ndefense witnesses prior to the trial and that they had \u201creceived subpoenas every time[.]\u201d  \nHowever, the State argued that Mr. Pieronek\u2019s efforts were insufficient because Crim.R. 16 8 \n          \n \n\u201cdictates and requires\u201d a list of witnesses.  Citing to this Court\u2019s decision in State v. Bennet, 9th \nDist. Wayne No. 10CA0061, 2012-Ohio-392, the State argued that Mr. Pieronek\u2019s failure to \nprovide such a list required the exclusion of the witnesses\u2019 testimony.   \n{\u00b623} At issue in Bennet was the State\u2019s act of providing the defendant with a copy of a \npolice report and informing Mr. Bennet of its intention to call as witnesses all of the individuals \nmentioned therein.  Considering the purpose and the language of Crim.R. 16(A), we held that \n\u201can actual witness list is what the rule requires,\u201d stating:  \nthis Court believes that when Crim.R. 16 requires the parties to exchange \nwitnesses lists, the rule means exactly what it says.  It does not say that parties \nmay exchange documents from which the identities of potential witnesses may \npossibly be gleaned, but requires the exchange of witness lists.   \n \nBennet at \u00b6 6.  Despite having determined that the State failed to comply with Crim.R. 16(I), this \nCourt went on to conclude that Mr. Bennet failed to s how he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s \ndecision to allow a witness to testify. \n{\u00b624} In the present matter, the trial court reviewed the record and informed the parties \nof its conclusion that, regardless of the subpo enas identifying the defense witnesses, Mr. \nPieronek failed to provide a witness list.  The record reflects that counsel for Mr. Pieronek \nattempted to persuade the trial court that these witnesses were not a surprise to the State, and \nargued that an adverse ruling regarding the witnesses would prevent Mr. Pieronek from \npresenting a defense.  The trial court declined to consider whether the State was prejudiced or \nsurprised by the witness, indicating instead that the Bennet case was \u201cdead on point\u201d and it does \nnot \u201ceven get into the whole issue about surprise \u201d before concluding that the court was bound to \nfollow the case in its decision.  The tria l court then ruled, \u201cin accordance with [Bennet,]\u201d that the \ndefense failed to demonstrate that a witness list had been provided to the State prior to trial, \nsustained the State\u2019s objection, and excluded the testimony of Mr. Pieronek \u2019s witnesses.  After 9 \n          \n \nmaking its ruling, the trial court permitted counsel to identify the witnesses and make a proffer of \ntheir respective testimony.   \n{\u00b625} The trial court\u2019s application of the holding in Bennet to the facts of this case is \nquestionable in and of itself.  The record is clear that Mr. Pieronek subpoenaed six witnesses\u2014\nTrooper Elliot Rawson, Jeremey Carson, Mike Cu llop, Ryan Fisher, Joe Hensley, and Rich \nStichle\u2014to attend and gi ve testimony at trial on Thursday , May 17, 2018, and served a copy of \neach subpoena on the assistant prosecuting attorney handling the case.  Although these \nsubpoenas do not constitute the single document containing a list of witnesses\u2014which would be \nthe preferred method for ensuring compliance with Crim.R. 16\u2014the subpoenas clearly list and \nspecifically identify the individuals Mr. Pierone k intended to call, contain the information \nrequired by Crim.R. 16(I), and were provided to the State prior to trial.  This is notably \ndistinguishable from the facts of Bennet, where the State handed over a police report and \nexpected the defense to glean from it the witnesses the State might chose to call.  Nevertheless, \nthis Court need not reach the merits of that issue.   \n{\u00b626} Even if we were to assume that the s ubpoenas failed to comply with the witness \nlist requirement in Crim.R. 16(I), the question then turns to whether the trial court abused its \ndiscretion by imposing this sanction, based solely on the finding  that Mr. Pieronek failed to \nprovide the State with a witness list, \u201cto exclude all the witnesses the defendant intended to call, \nother than the defendant himself.\u201d  Papadelis, 32 Ohio St.3d at 4.  Although the trial court \nconcluded that \u201csurprise\u201d to the State was not  an appropriate consideration under the court\u2019s \ninterpretation of Bennet, such a conclusion is not supported by our decision in that case.  \nMoreover, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law, and ultimately the tria l court\u2019s decision, are \ncontrary to controlling law.   10 \n          \n \n{\u00b627} Prior to imposing sanctions, \u201ca trial cour t must inquire into the circumstances \nsurrounding a violation of Crim.R. 16[(I).]\u201d  Papadelis, at 5.  The Supreme Court of Ohio has \narticulated factors to be considered by the trial court in its inquiry, including: \u201cthe extent of \nsurprise or prejudice to the state if the testimony were allowed, the impact that excluding the \ntestimony would have on the trial, whether the violation was willful or in bad faith, and the \neffectiveness of less severe sanctions\u201d  Darmond, 2013-Ohio-966 at \u00b6 22, citing Papadelis at 5.  \nWhen fashioning an order under Crim.R. 16(L)(1), trial courts may only \u201cimpose the least severe \nsanction\u201d to remedy the discovery violation.  Papadelis at paragraph two of the syllabus. \n{\u00b628} The record reflects that the trial court declined to consider any of the \ncircumstances surrounding the purported discovery violation.  To the cont rary, the trial court \nevinced a faulty belief that it was precluded by law from considering whether the prosecution \nwould be surprised or prejudiced by the testimony of witnesses all of whom, the State was \nadmittedly aware, had been subpoenaed to testify at  trial.  Nor did the trial court take into \naccount the impact that exclusion of all defens e witness would have on the trial and on the \noutcome of the case: effectively denying Mr. Pieronek the ability to present a defense.  \nFurthermore, the record reflects that the trial court did not contemplate any alternative to this \nsanction, much less consider the feasibility of a sanction less severe than  the exclusion of Mr. \nPieronek\u2019s witness.   \n{\u00b629}  Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion.  \n\u201c[T]he trial court did not indicate that it balanced the [S]tate\u2019s interests against [Mr. Pieronek\u2019s] \nSixth Amendment right to present a defense by considering any sanction other than excluding the \ntestimony of his witnesses.\u201d  Papadelis, 32 Ohio St.3d at 5.  Thus, without considering whether \nit was an appropriate sanction, the trial court arbitrarily applied the exceedingly harsh sanction of 11 \n          \n \nexcluding the defense\u2019s witnesses.  Accordingly,  Mr. Pieronek\u2019s fourth a ssignment of error is \nsustained.  \nAssignment of Error V \n \n[Mr. Pieronek] was denied due process and a fair trial d[ue] to the \nprosecutorial misconduct of the state of Ohio[.]  \n \nAssignment of Error VI \n \n[Mr. Pieronek] received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel.  \n \n{\u00b630} In his fifth assignment of error, Mr. Pieronek argues that he was denied due \nprocess based on prosecutorial mis conduct that deprived him of a fair trial.  In his sixth \nassignment of error, he contends that his tria l counsel was ineffective for failure to strictly \ncomply with Crim.R. 16.

Pieronek, appeals from his conviction in the Wayne County Municipal Court. For the reasons that follow, this Court reverses.\n\nI.\n\n{\u00b62} On August 11, 2017, Mr. Pieronek, in the course of his employment as a driver for FedEx, was operating a truck along his route through Apple Creek in Wayne County. While driving the truck on Bank Street, Mr. Pieronek \u201cheard a big bang\u201d and immediately stopped his truck. He noticed a wire on the truck and, according to Mr. Pieronek, he informed a FedEx dispatcher \u201cabout hitting a wire and the damage to the poles.\u201d Mr. Pieronek indicated that he waited approximately ten minutes to hear back from the dispatcher, who then instructed him to continue on his route and fill out an incident report when he got back. Mr. Pieronek left the scene and continued on his route to his next stop at a business located on Apple Creek Road.\nThereafter, Mr. Pieronek proceeded toward another stop on his route, but was forced to park his truck until he completed a mandatory half hour break.\n\n{\u00b63} Meanwhile, a witness looking out of a window in the front room of his house had observed the FedEx truck get hooked on something at the intersection of Bank Street and County Road 44. He saw a wire come out of the transformer, followed by a shower of sparks, and the lights going out. The witness, who resides on West Wood Drive in Apple Creek, contacted the Wayne County Sheriff\u2019s office to report the incident. The witness also contacted the electric service provider to report the downed power line and approximately five or six poles. After the Highway Patrol arrived, the witness gave a statement to Trooper Hannah Hill.\n\n{\u00b64} While on his mandatory break, Mr. Pieronek received a message from a FedEx dispatcher instructing him to return to the location where he had struck the wire. Mr. Pieronek met with Trooper Hill and gave a statement. Trooper Hill cited Mr. Pieronek for violating R.C. 4506.15(A)(11).\n\n{\u00b65} The complaint filed in the Wayne County Municipal Court originally charged Mr. Pieronek for violating R.C. 4506.15(A)(11). Upon the State\u2019s motion, the charge was later amended to charge Mr. Pieronek for failure to stop after an accident under R.C. 4549.02, a misdemeanor of the first degree. Mr. Pieronek entered a plea of not guilty to the charge.\n\n{\u00b66} The matter was set for trial and, after several continuances of the trial date, the matter proceeded to a bench trial. After the State presented its case, Mr. Pieronek moved the trial court for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Crim.R. 29. The trial court overruled the motion. As trial counsel for Mr. Pieronek presented his case, the State moved to exclude all of his witnesses on the grounds that he failed to provide a witness list. The trial court granted the motion, and Mr. Pieronek was the only witness permitted to testify in his defense.\nThe trial court found Mr. Pieronek guilty of \u201chit skip\u201d in violation of R.C. 4549.02. The trial court sentenced Mr. Pieronek to a six-month license suspension and fined him five hundred dollars. Mr. Pieronek appealed his conviction raising six assignments of error for our review. For ease of analysis, we consolidate certain assignments of error.\n\nII.\n\nAssignment of Error I\n\nThe trial court committed prejudicial error by not granting defense counsel\u2019s [Crim.R.] 29 motion, since it was undisputed that the incident in question did not involve a collision with either a pedestrian or another motor vehicle nor did it occur upon public road or highway as required by R.C. 4549.02 and the controlling case law.\n\nAssignment of Error II\n\nThe evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain a finding of guilt for hit-skip pursuant to R.C. 4549.02.\n\nIn his first assignment of error, Mr. Pieronek contends that the trial court erred by denying his Crim. R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. In his second assignment of error, he contends that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence. Both assignments of error are premised upon the same argument: that the State failed to present sufficient evidence to show that the collision occurred with \u201cproperty upon the roadway\u201d in order to satisfy the elements of R.C. 4549.02.\n\nCrim.R. 29(A) provides that a trial court shall enter a judgment of acquittal upon motion after the evidence on either side is closed, \u201cif the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense[.]\u201d A challenge to the sufficiency of a criminal conviction presents a question of law, which we review de novo. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386 (1997). In carrying out this review, our \u201cfunction * * * is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the\ndefendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. After such an examination and taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we must decide whether \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b610 R.C. 4549.02 (A)(1) states in pertinent part: \u201c[i]n the case of a motor vehicle accident or collision with persons or property on a public road or highway, the operator of the motor vehicle, having knowledge of the accident or collision, immediately shall stop the operator\u2019s motor vehicle at the scene of the accident or collision.\u201d\n\n\u00b611 In support of his sufficiency argument, Mr. Pieronek cites to State v. Cutlip, 9th Dist. Summit No. 28735, 2018-Ohio-726. In Cutlip, this Court found insufficient evidence to support a conviction for failure to stop where the collision occurred after Mr. Cutlip left the roadway, collided with a mailbox adjacent to the road, and landed in a ditch. Recognizing in Cutlip that the accident did not, as it must, \u201coccur on a public road or highway[,]\u201d we concluded that the trial court erred by denying Mr. Cutlip\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. Id. at \u00b6 10-11; see R.C. 4549.02(A).\n\n\u00b612 Despite Mr. Pieronek\u2019s insistence that the outcome in Cutlip is determinative of this case, the facts of the present matter are wholly distinguishable from the facts at issue in Cutlip. Here, Mr. Pieronek does not claim that the collision occurred after he left the roadway, nor does he attempt to establish that the overhead wires with which he collided were located adjacent to the roadway. In his merit brief, Mr. Pieronek asserts that it is \u201cundisputed\u201d that he \u201cwas lawfully driving his FedEx tractor trailer on a road he had travel[ed] many times before when his vehicle somehow caught on overhanging power line.\u201d Indeed, such facts are not in dispute. By Mr. Pieronek\u2019s own admission, he was operating his vehicle on the road when it\ncollided with overhanging power lines. Consequently, Mr. Pieronek concedes the very element of R.C. 4549.02 he purports to challenge in his first two assignments of error. Accordingly, and upon our review of the record viewing the evidence submitted in a light most favorable to the State, we cannot conclude that there was insufficient evidence to convince the trier of fact as to Mr. Pieronek\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n{\u00b613} Mr. Pieronek\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\nAssignment of Error III\n\nThe verdict of guilty for hit-skip pursuant to R.C. 4549.02 was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n{\u00b614} In his third assignment of error, Mr. Pieronek asserts that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. When considering an argument that a criminal conviction is against the manifest weight standard, this Court is required to\n\nreview the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\n\nState v. Otten, 33 Ohio App.3d 339, 340 (9th Dist.1986). Courts are cautioned to only reverse a conviction on manifest weight grounds \u201cin exceptional cases,\u201d State v. Carson, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26900, 2013-Ohio-5785, \u00b6 32, citing Otten at 340, where the evidence \u201cweighs heavily against the conviction[.]\u201d Thompkins at 387.\n\n{\u00b615} Although Mr. Pieronek\u2019s merit brief does set forth the standard of review for a manifest weight challenge, he does not articulate a manifest weight argument. Mr. Pieronek instead asserts that \u201cit is clear that controlling case law was not followed\u201d and briefly reiterates the arguments presented in his first assignment of error. In doing so, Mr. Pieronek fails to provide citations to the parts of the record on which his contention is based and has not presented\nan argument supporting his contentions with respect to this assignment of error as required by App.R. 16(A)(7). This court will not create or develop an argument on Mr. Pieronek\u2019s behalf. State v. Jackson, 9th Dist. Summit No. 28691, 2018-Ohio-1285, \u00b6 47, citing State v. Sadeghi, 9th Dist. Wayne No. 14AP0051, 2016-Ohio-744, \u00b6 32.\n\n\u00b616 Mr. Pieronek\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\nAssignment of Error IV\n\nThe trial court denied [Mr. Pieronek] due process by prohibiting all of [his] subpoenaed witnesses from testifying[.]\n\n\u00b617 In his third assignment of error, Mr. Pieronek contends that the trial court erred by granting the State\u2019s motion to exclude all of his subpoenaed witnesses from testifying. We agree.\n\n\u00b618 A defendant\u2019s \u201cright to offer the testimony of witnesses * * * is in plain terms the right to present a defense,\u201d and \u201c[t]his right is a fundamental element of due process of law.\u201d City of Lakewood v. Papadelis, 32 Ohio St.3d 1, 4-5 (1987), quoting Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 19 (1967). Yet, where the defendant fails to properly disclose witnesses, it is within the discretion of the trial court \u201cto exclude testimony that is not disclosed in a timely manner in order to prevent surprise and ensure a fair trial.\u201d State v. Calise, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26027, 2012-Ohio-4797, \u00b6 30. However, \u201cthe sanction of exclusion may infringe on a criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to present a defense, particularly where * * * all the defendant\u2019s witnesses are excluded.\u201d Papadelis at 5.\n\n\u00b619 Crim.R. 16 regulates discovery in criminal proceedings. The purpose of the \u201crule is to provide all parties in a criminal case with the information necessary for a full and fair adjudication of the facts, to protect the integrity of the justice system and the rights of defendants, and to protect the well-being of witnesses, victims, and society at large.\u201d Crim.R.\n16(A). Crim.R. 16(I) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[e]ach party shall provide to opposing\ncounsel a written witness list, including names and addresses of any witness it intends to call in\nits case-in-chief, or reasonably anticipates calling in rebuttal or surrebuttal.\u201d If a party fails to\ncomply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the trial court may \u201cgrant a\ncontinuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it\nmay make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u201d Crim.R. 16(L)(1).\n\n{\u00b620} We review a trial court\u2019s decision regarding a Crim.R. 16 discovery violation for\nan abuse of discretion. State v. Price, 9th Dist. Medina No. 14CA0070-M, 2015-Ohio-5043, \u00b6 7.\nAn abuse of discretion is more than an error of judgment; it means that the trial court was\nunreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable in its ruling. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d\n217, 219 (1983). A trial court may abuse its discretion where it fails to engage in a sound\nreasoning process. State v. Darmond, 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, \u00b6 34. When\napplying this standard, a reviewing court is precluded from simply substituting its own judgment\nfor that of the trial court. Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd., 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621 (1993).\n\n{\u00b621} After the close of the State\u2019s case, counsel for Mr. Pieronek attempted to call the\nfirst witness for the defense. The State objected to the witness testifying on the grounds that Mr.\nPieronek had not provided the State with a witness list. Mr. Pieronek\u2019s trial counsel countered\nthe State\u2019s claim, asserting that the \u201c[w]itnesses were identified,\u201d that she issued subpoenas to\neach witness, and that copies of the subpoenas were provided to the court and also to the State\neach and every time this case was set for trial.\n\n{\u00b622} The State acknowledged that they received notice of the subpoenas for the\ndefense witnesses prior to the trial and that they had \u201creceived subpoenas every time[.]\u201d\nHowever, the State argued that Mr. Pieronek\u2019s efforts were insufficient because Crim.R. 16\n\u201cdictates and requires\u201d a list of witnesses. Citing to this Court\u2019s decision in State v. Bennet, 9th Dist. Wayne No. 10CA0061, 2012-Ohio-392, the State argued that Mr. Pieronek\u2019s failure to provide such a list required the exclusion of the witnesses\u2019 testimony.\n\n{\u00b623} At issue in Bennet was the State\u2019s act of providing the defendant with a copy of a police report and informing Mr. Bennet of its intention to call as witnesses all of the individuals mentioned therein. Considering the purpose and the language of Crim.R. 16(A), we held that \u201can actual witness list is what the rule requires,\u201d stating:\n\nthis Court believes that when Crim.R. 16 requires the parties to exchange witnesses lists, the rule means exactly what it says. It does not say that parties may exchange documents from which the identities of potential witnesses may possibly be gleaned, but requires the exchange of witness lists.\n\nBennet at \u00b6 6. Despite having determined that the State failed to comply with Crim.R. 16(I), this Court went on to conclude that Mr. Bennet failed to show he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s decision to allow a witness to testify.\n\n{\u00b624} In the present matter, the trial court reviewed the record and informed the parties of its conclusion that, regardless of the subpoenas identifying the defense witnesses, Mr. Pieronek failed to provide a witness list. The record reflects that counsel for Mr. Pieronek attempted to persuade the trial court that these witnesses were not a surprise to the State, and argued that an adverse ruling regarding the witnesses would prevent Mr. Pieronek from presenting a defense. The trial court declined to consider whether the State was prejudiced or surprised by the witness, indicating instead that the Bennet case was \u201cdead on point\u201d and it does not \u201ceven get into the whole issue about surprise\u201d before concluding that the court was bound to follow the case in its decision. The trial court then ruled, \u201cin accordance with [Bennet,]\u201d that the defense failed to demonstrate that a witness list had been provided to the State prior to trial, sustained the State\u2019s objection, and excluded the testimony of Mr. Pieronek\u2019s witnesses. After\nmaking its ruling, the trial court permitted counsel to identify the witnesses and make a proffer of their respective testimony.\n\n{\u00b625} The trial court\u2019s application of the holding in Bennet to the facts of this case is questionable in and of itself. The record is clear that Mr. Pieronek subpoenaed six witnesses\u2014Trooper Elliot Rawson, Jeremey Carson, Mike Cullop, Ryan Fisher, Joe Hensley, and Rich Stichle\u2014to attend and give testimony at trial on Thursday, May 17, 2018, and served a copy of each subpoena on the assistant prosecuting attorney handling the case. Although these subpoenas do not constitute the single document containing a list of witnesses\u2014which would be the preferred method for ensuring compliance with Crim.R. 16\u2014the subpoenas clearly list and specifically identify the individuals Mr. Pieronek intended to call, contain the information required by Crim.R. 16(I), and were provided to the State prior to trial. This is notably distinguishable from the facts of Bennet, where the State handed over a police report and expected the defense to glean from it the witnesses the State might chose to call. Nevertheless, this Court need not reach the merits of that issue.\n\n{\u00b626} Even if we were to assume that the subpoenas failed to comply with the witness list requirement in Crim.R. 16(I), the question then turns to whether the trial court abused its discretion by imposing this sanction, based solely on the finding that Mr. Pieronek failed to provide the State with a witness list, \u201cto exclude all the witnesses the defendant intended to call, other than the defendant himself.\u201d Papadelis, 32 Ohio St.3d at 4. Although the trial court concluded that \u201csurprise\u201d to the State was not an appropriate consideration under the court\u2019s interpretation of Bennet, such a conclusion is not supported by our decision in that case. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law, and ultimately the trial court\u2019s decision, are contrary to controlling law.\nPrior to imposing sanctions, \u201ca trial court must inquire into the circumstances surrounding a violation of Crim.R. 16[(I).]\u201d Papadelis, at 5. The Supreme Court of Ohio has articulated factors to be considered by the trial court in its inquiry, including: \u201cthe extent of surprise or prejudice to the state if the testimony were allowed, the impact that excluding the testimony would have on the trial, whether the violation was willful or in bad faith, and the effectiveness of less severe sanctions\u201d Darmond, 2013-Ohio-966 at \u00b6 22, citing Papadelis at 5. When fashioning an order under Crim.R. 16(L)(1), trial courts may only \u201cimpose the least severe sanction\u201d to remedy the discovery violation. Papadelis at paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\nThe record reflects that the trial court declined to consider any of the circumstances surrounding the purported discovery violation. To the contrary, the trial court evinced a faulty belief that it was precluded by law from considering whether the prosecution would be surprised or prejudiced by the testimony of witnesses all of whom, the State was admittedly aware, had been subpoenaed to testify at trial. Nor did the trial court take into account the impact that exclusion of all defense witness would have on the trial and on the outcome of the case: effectively denying Mr. Pieronek the ability to present a defense. Furthermore, the record reflects that the trial court did not contemplate any alternative to this sanction, much less consider the feasibility of a sanction less severe than the exclusion of Mr. Pieronek\u2019s witness.\n\nBased on the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion. \u201c[T]he trial court did not indicate that it balanced the [S]tate\u2019s interests against [Mr. Pieronek\u2019s] Sixth Amendment right to present a defense by considering any sanction other than excluding the testimony of his witnesses.\u201d Papadelis, 32 Ohio St.3d at 5. Thus, without considering whether it was an appropriate sanction, the trial court arbitrarily applied the exceedingly harsh sanction of\nexcluding the defense\u2019s witnesses. Accordingly, Mr. Pieronek\u2019s fourth assignment of error is sustained.\n\n**Assignment of Error V**\n\n[Mr. Pieronek] was denied due process and a fair trial due to the prosecutorial misconduct of the state of Ohio.\n\n**Assignment of Error VI**\n\n[Mr. Pieronek] received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel.\n\n{\u00b630} In his fifth assignment of error, Mr. Pieronek argues that he was denied due process based on prosecutorial misconduct that deprived him of a fair trial. In his sixth assignment of error, he contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failure to strictly comply with Crim.R. 16. We decline to address his fifth and sixth assignments of error, having concluded that they are moot in light of this Court\u2019s resolution of his fourth assignment of error. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).\n\nIII.\n\n{\u00b631} Mr. Pieronek\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error are overruled. His fourth assignment of error is sustained, and his fifth and sixth assignments of error are moot. The judgment of the Wayne County Municipal Court is reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this decision.\n\nJudgment reversed and cause remanded.\n\nThere were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\nWe order that a special mandate issue out of this Court, directing the Wayne County Municipal Court, County of Wayne, State of Ohio, to carry this judgment into execution.

Box 4501 \n  Lima, OH  45802 Wise, Earle, J. \n{\u00b6 1} Defendant-Appellant, Marco A. Feagin, appeals the May 30, 2018 judgment \nentry of the Court of Common Pleas of Richland County, Ohio denying his petition for \npostconviction relief.  Plaintiff-Appellee is the state of Ohio. \nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{\u00b6 2} On December 22, 2004, appellant was sentenced to an aggregate term of \neighteen years to life involving several counts including murder with a firearm \nspecification.  Appellant filed a direct appeal and this court affirmed his convictions and \nsentence.  State v. Feagin, 5th Dist. Richland No. 05CA1, 2006-Ohio-676.  Appellant did \nnot raise any claims of prosecutorial misconduct or ineffective assistance of counsel. \n{\u00b6 3} On March 25, 2010, a new sentencing entry was entered in order to impose \na mandatory term of post-release control.  The trial court sentenced appellant to the \noriginal sentence and added a five year term of mandatory post-release control.  \nAppellant filed an appeal, raising in part prosecutorial misconduct.  This court affirmed \nthe resentencing, and noted the arguments relative to prosecutorial misconduct were res \njudicata as they could have been raised in the direct appeal.  State v. Feagin, 5th Dist. \nRichland No. 10CA46, 2011-Ohio-2025. \n{\u00b6 4} On April 25, 2011, the trial court denied appellant's motion for leave to file \ndelayed motion for new trial.  Appellant filed an appeal, raising in part prosecutorial \nmisconduct.  This court affirmed the trial court's decision, and again found the arguments \nrelative to prosecutorial misconduct to be res judicata.  State v. Feagin, 5th Dist. Richland \nNo. 15CA41, 2015-Ohio-5107.  Appellant filed a motion for reconsideration.  By judgment \nentry filed March 7, 2016, this court granted the motion, finding the trial court erred in resentencing appellant in its March 25, 2010 entry relative to post-release control.  The \nportion of the entry on post-release control was vacated, but the remainder of appellant's \nsentence was left intact.  By judgment entry filed March 9, 2016, the trial court vacated \nthe order of post-release control. \n{\u00b6 5} On April 5, 2016, the trial court denied appellant's motion to convey him for \nhearing after vacation of sentence.  Appellant filed an appeal, raising in part prosecutorial \nmisconduct.  This court affirmed the trial court's decision, and again found the arguments \nrelative to prosecutorial misconduct to be res judicata.  State v. Feagin, 5th Dist. Richland \nNo. 16CA21, 2016-Ohio-7003. \n{\u00b6 6} On May 11, 2018, appellant filed a petition to vacate and set aside judgment \nof conviction and sentence pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23.  Appellant made \narguments relative to jury instructions, prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective \nassistance of counsel.  By judgment entry filed May 30, 2018, the trial court denied the \npetition, finding it was a successive petition for postconviction relief, the petition was \nuntimely filed, and the arguments therein were res judicata. \n{\u00b6 7} Appellant filed an appeal and this matter is now before this court for \nconsideration.  Assignments of error are as follows: \nI \n{\u00b6 8} \"APPELLANT WAS DEPRIVED OF A FAIR TRIAL WHERE THE STATE \nOF OHIO WITHHELD EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE IN VIOLATION OF THE EQUAL \nPROTECTION AND DUE PROCESS CLAUSE(S) OF THE UNITED STATES \nCONSTITUTION AND ART. 1 SECTION 10, 16 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION.\" \n II \n{\u00b6 9} \"APPELLANT WAS DEPRIVED OF A FAIR TRIAL WHERE THE STATE \nFAILED TO PROPERLY INSTRUCT THE JURY AS TO SELF-DEFENSE WHILE \nINSTRUCTING IN A GENERAL SENSE IN VIOLATION OF APPELLANT'S DUE \nPROCESS RIGHTS.\" \nIII \n{\u00b6 10} \"APPELLANT WAS DEPRIVED OF THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF \nCOUNSEL AT TRIAL AND UPON HIS DIRECT APPEAL WHERE COUNSEL ON \nAPPEAL FAILED TO RAISE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF ERRORS OF HIS TRIAL \nCOUNSEL'S AT TRIAL IN VIOLATION OF THE APPELLANT'S SIXTH AMENDMENT \nRIGHT TO EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AS CONTAINED IN THE UNITED \nSTATES CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE 1 SECTION 10, 16 OF THE OHIO \nCONSTITUTION, AND AS CONFERRED IN THE OHIO'S FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT.\" \n{\u00b6 11} We note the day after appellee filed its brief, appellant filed a supplemental \nbrief adding a fourth assignment of error.  Appellant did not seek leave to supplement his \nbrief therefore, the additional assignment of error will not be considered. \nI, II, III \n{\u00b6 12} In his three assignments of error, appellant claims the trial court erred in \ndenying his petition for postconviction relief, arguing he was denied a fair trial because \nthe state withheld exculpatory evidence, the state failed to properly instruct the jury on \nself-defense, and he was deprived of the effective assistance of trial counsel and \nappellate counsel in his direct appeal.  We disagree with appellant's claims. {\u00b6 13} Appellant appeals the trial court's denial of his May 11, 2018 petition to \nvacate and set aside judgment of conviction and sentence.  In his petition, appellant \nargued the jury was not instructed on provocation, the prosecutor made improper \nstatements, the prosecutor elicited perjured testimony, he received ineffective assistance \nof trial counsel regarding the defense of self-defense, the prosecutor withheld exculpatory \nevidence, and the prosecutor used overzealous tactics.  By judgment entry filed May 30, \n2018, the trial court denied the petition, finding it was a successive petition for \npostconviction relief (fifth filing at a minimum), the petition was untimely filed (more than \ntwelve years late), and the arguments therein were res judicata.  We note the trial court \nconducted a thorough analysis on appellant's petition. \n{\u00b6 14} As determined by the trial court, appellant's May 11, 2018 petition for \npostconviction relief was clearly untimely pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(A)(2).  Based upon \nappellant's past filings, the subject petition was a successive petition for postconviction \nrelief.  R.C. 2953.23 states the following: \n \n(A) Whether a hearing is or is not held on a petition filed pursuant to \nsection 2953.21 of the Revised Code, a court may not entertain a petition \nfiled after the expiration of the period prescribed in division (A) of that \nsection or a second petition or successive petitions for similar relief on \nbehalf of a petitioner unless division (A)(1) or (2) of this section applies: \n(1) Both of the following apply: \n(a) Either the petitioner shows that the petitioner was unavoidably \nprevented from discovery of the facts upon which the petitioner must rely to present the claim for relief, or, subsequent to the period prescribed in \ndivision (A)(2) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code or to the filing of an \nearlier petition, the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal \nor state right that applies retroactively to persons in the petitioner's situation, \nand the petition asserts a claim based on that right. \n(b) The petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that, but \nfor constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfin der would have found \nthe petitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted or, \nif the claim challenges a sentence of death that, but for constitutional error \nat the sentencing hearing, no reasonable factfinder would have found the \npetitioner eligible for the death sentence. \n \n{\u00b6 15} In reviewing appellant's May 11, 2018 filing, we find appellant did not satisfy \nthe requirements of R.C. 2953.23. \n{\u00b6 16} Furthermore, the arguments raised by appellant in his petition are barred \nunder the doctrine of res judicata.  As stated by the Supreme Court of Ohio in State v. \nPerry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175 (1967), paragraphs eight and nine of the syllabus, the doctrine \nof res judicata is applicable to petitions for postconviction relief.  The Perry court explained \nthe doctrine at 180-181 as follows: \n \nUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars \na convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and \nlitigating in any proceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have \nbeen raised by the defendant at trial, which resulted in that judgment of \nconviction, or on an appeal from that judgment. \n \n{\u00b6 17} The issues raised by appellant in his petition could have been raised on \ndirect appeal and/or were raised in his previous appeals. \n{\u00b6 18} Upon review, we find the trial court did not err in denying appellant's petition \nfor postconviction relief. \n{\u00b6 19} Assignments of Error I, II, and III are denied. \n{\u00b6 20} The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Richland County, Ohio is \nhereby affirmed. \nBy Wise, Earle, J. \n \nGwin, P.J. and \n \nDelaney, J. concur. \n \n        \n       \n   \nEEW/db 103 ", "case_juv": "0", "case_crim": "0", "case_2001": "0", "case_app": "0", "case_pros": "0", "aoe_none": "0", "aoe_grandjury": "0", "aoe_court": "0", "aoe_defense": "0", "aoe_procbar": "1", "aoe_prochist": "0", "case_timeframe": "0", "other": "378    0\nName: other, dtype: int64", "olmocr_text": "STATE OF OHIO : JUDGES:\n\nPlaintiff-Appellee : Hon.

Merz \n \nWARDEN, London  \n   Correctional Institution, \n   \n : \n    Respondent. \n REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n \n This habeas corpus case is before the Court for decision on the merits.  Relevant filings are \nthe Petition (ECF No. 1), the Stat e Court Record (ECF No. 4), a nd the Warden\u2019s Return of Writ \n(ECF No. 5). \n When the Court ordered an answer in this case, it set a deadline for Petitioner to respond \nto that answer by filing a reply not later than twenty-one days after the answer was filed (Order for \nAnswer, ECF No. 2).  When the Return of Wri t/Answer was filed, the Court notified Petitioner \nthat his reply was due by October 11, 2021 (ECF No. 6).  On October 19, 2021, Petitioner requested \nand received an extension of time to file his reply to and including November 1, 2021 (ECF No. 7 \n& 8).  However as of the date of this Report mo re than three weeks later, Petitioner has neither \nfiled a reply nor requested a further extension.   \n \n \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 1 of 16  PAGEID #: 8642 \n \nLitigation History \n \n On May 11, 2018, a Greene County, Ohio grand jury  indicted Petitioner on two counts of \nrape with repeat violent offe nder specifications in violat ion of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 \n2907.02(A)(2); one count of attempted felonious a ssault in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 \n2923.02(A)/2903.11(A)(1); and one count of abduction under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2905.02(A)(2) \n(Indictment, State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Ex. 1) .  The repeat violent offender specifications \nwere severed for bench trial on Redic\u2019s motion.  Id. Ex. 4.  \n A jury found Redic guilty of the anal rape charge, but not guilty on the other three counts \n(Verdict, State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Ex. 6)1.  He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. \nId. at Ex. 8.  Redic appealed, assigning as error only the claim that the verdict was against the \nmanifest weight of the evidence.  The Ohio Second District Court of  Appeals affirmed.  State v. \nRedic, 2019-Ohio-3395 (Ohio App. 2nd Dist. Aug. 23, 2019)(copy at State Court Record, ECF No. \n4, Ex. 20).   \n Ohio law allows a litigant forty-five days to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio from an \nadverse decision of the court of a ppeals.  In this case Redic\u2019s time to appeal expired October 23, \n2019, but he did not file a notice of appeal until February 20, 2020, along with a motion for delayed \nappeal (State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Exs. 21 , 22).  The Supreme Court summarily denied the \nmotion. Id. at Ex. 23.   \n On November 20, 2019, Redic filed an applicat ion to reopen his appeal pursuant to Ohio \nR. App. P. 26(B) to raise claims  of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel (Application, State \nCourt Record, ECF No. 4, Ex. 24).  The Second District denied that Application on the merits and \n \n1 Redic was tried before The Honorable James A. Brogan, retired judge of the Second District Court of Appeals, sitting \nby assignment. \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 2 of 16  PAGEID #: 8653 \n \nRedic did not appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio.  Id. at Ex. 27. \n Instead on January 28, 2020, Redic filed a Peti tion for Post-Conviction Relief under Ohio \nRevised Code \u00a7 2953.21 (State Court Record, ECF N o. 4, Ex. 28).  The State moved to dismiss \nthe Petition as untimely filed and/or barred by res judicata. Id. at Ex. 29.  The Common Pleas \nCourt found the Petition was timely and not barred by res judicata, but rejected all three of Redic\u2019s \nclaims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on the merits (Judgment Entry, State Court Record, \nECF No. 4, Ex. 31).  Redic did not appeal this decision. \n Redic filed his Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in this Court on April 12, 2021, pleading \nthe following grounds for relief: \nGround One: Manifest weight of the evidence. \n \nSupporting Facts: The trial court abused its discretion because the \nverdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence, constituting \na violation of Appellant\u2019s right  of due process of law and \nfundamental fairness. \n \nGround Two: Ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. \n \nSupporting Facts: The prosecutor failed in his duty to refrain from \nimproper methods of obtaining a rape(s) charges against the \nAppellant, rather than bring a lesser included sexual assault, such as \nsexual battery. (b) Trial court failed to motion to the court for a pre-\ntrial preliminary hearing. (c) Tr ial counsel failed to renew his \nCrim.R. 29 motion to dismiss the State\u2019s case at the conclusion of \ntrial. (d) Trial court abused its discretion in objecting the defense \nCrim.R. 29 motion to dismiss charges. The record clearly provides \nthe State\u2019s evidence was wholly insufficient to suppor t either rape \ncharges.  \n \nGround Three: Due process, prosecutor misconduct. \n \nSupporting Facts: Counsel\u2019s unreasonable decision not to present \nDetective Kraker as a defense witness, cannot reasonably be \nconstrued as sound trial tactic or strategy because counsel\u2019s error in \nnot presenting Detective Kraker to the jury constitutes counsel\u2019s \nabandonment of Petitioner\u2019s defense, resulting in Petitioner\u2019s \nconviction. \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 3 of 16  PAGEID #: 8664 \n \nGround Four: Effective assistance of counsel. \n \nSupporting Facts: Counsel\u2019s failure to introduce East Way mental \nhealth record, or the testimony of potential witness Jason Wiseman, \nand failure to introduce Dayton Police reports during the cross-\nexamination of the Victim, resulting in the Petitioner being deprived \nof due process and effective cross-examination.  \n \n(Petition, ECF No. 1 PageID 5-10). \n \nAnalysis \n  \nGround One:  Manifest Weight of the Evidence \n \n In his First Ground for Relief, Redic claims his conviction is against the manifest weight \nof the evidence. \n Federal habeas corpus is available only to correct federal constitutional violations.  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); Wilson v. Corcoran, 562 U.S. 1 (2010) ; Lewis v. Jeffers , 497 U.S. 764, 780 \n(1990); Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209 (1982), Barclay v. Florida, 463 U.S. 939 (1983).   \"[I]t is \nnot the province of a federal habe as court to reexamine state court determinations on state law \nquestions.  In conducting habeas review, a federal court is limited to deciding whether a conviction \nviolated the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\"  Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, \n67-68 (1991); see also Elmendorf v. Taylor, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 152, 160 (1825)(Marshall C. J.); \nBickham v. Winn, 888 F.3d 248 (6th Cir. Apr. 23, 2018)(Thapar, J. concurring). \n A weight of the evidence claim is not a federal constitutional claim.  Johnson v. Havener, \n534 F.2d 1232 (6 th Cir. 1986).  In State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St. 3d 380 (1997) , the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio reaffirmed the important distincti on between appellate review for insufficiency of \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 4 of 16  PAGEID #: 8675 \n \nthe evidence and review on the cl aim that the conviction is agains t the manifest weight of the \nevidence.    It held: \nIn essence, sufficiency is a test of adequacy.  Whether the evidence \nis legally sufficient to sustain a verdict is a question of law. State v. \nRobinson (1955), 162 Ohio St. 486, 55 O.O. 388, 124 N.E.2d 148.  \nIn addition, a conviction based on  legally insuffi cient evidence \nconstitutes a denial of due process.   Tibbs v. Florida, 457 U.S. 31, \n45, 102  S.Ct. 2211, 2220, 72 L.Ed.2d 652, 663, (1982), citing \nJackson v. Virginia (1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d \n560.  Although a court of appeals may determine that a judgment of \na trial court is sustained by sufficient evidence, that court may \nnevertheless conclude that the judgment is against the weight of the \nevidence.  Robinson, supra, 162 Ohio St. at 487, 55 O.O. at 388-\n389, 124 N.E.2d at 149.  Weight of the evidence concerns \"the \ninclination of the greater amount of  credible evidence, offered in a \ntrial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.  It \nindicates clearly to the jury that the party having the burden of proof \nwill be entitled to their verdict, if, on weighing the evidence in their \nminds, they shall find the greater amount of credible evidence \nsustains the issue which is to be established before them.  Weight is \nnot a question of mathematics, but depends on its effect in inducing \nbelief.\"  (Emphasis added.)  \n \nWhen a court of appeals reverses a judgment of a trial court on the \nbasis that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, the \nappellate court sits as a \" 'thirteenth juror' \" and disagrees with the \nfactfinder's resolution of the conflicting testimony.  Tibbs, 457 U.S. \nat 42, 102 S.Ct. at 2218, 72 L.Ed.2d at 661.  See, also, State v. Martin \n(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 219, 485 N.E.2d \n717, 720-721 (\"The court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the \nevidence and all reasonable infere nces, considers the credibility of \nwitnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the \nevidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest \nmiscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new \ntrial ordered.  The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be \nexercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs \nheavily against the conviction.\"). \n \n78 Ohio St. 3d at 387.  In  State v. Martin , 20 Ohio App. 3d 172 (Hamilton Cty. 1983)(cited \napprovingly by the Supreme Court in Thompkins), Judge Robert Black c ontrasted the manifest \nweight of the evidence claim: \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 5 of 16  PAGEID #: 8686 \n \nIn considering the claim that the conviction was against the manifest \nweight of the evidence, the test is much broader.  The court, \nreviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable \ninferences, considers the credibility of the witnesses and determines \nwhether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost \nits way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the \nconviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. \u2026 \n \nMartin, 20 Ohio App. 3d 172, \u00b63 of the syllabus. \n In his Second Ground for Relief , Redic complains that his appellate counsel provided \nineffective assistance of appell ate counsel by (1) not claiming tr ial counsel provided ineffective \nassistance of trial counsel by not renewing his mo tion to dismiss under Ohio  R. Crim. P. 29 and \n(2) by not claiming the trial cour t abused its discretion by denying that Rule 29 motion when it \nwas made because, he says, \u201cThe record clea rly provides the State\u2019s evidence was wholly \ninsufficient to support either rape charges [sic].\u201d  \n Ohio R. Crim. P. 29 allows a criminal defe ndant to obtain dismissal of a charge with \nprejudice when the State has not presented cons titutionally sufficient evidence by the time the \nState rests its case in chief or by the close of all the evidence.  In deciding a Rule 29 motion, Ohio \ncourts apply the same sufficiency test as is requ ired by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment and enunciated in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979):   \n[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the \nlight most favorable to the pros ecution, any rational trier of fact \ncould have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a \nreasonable doubt . . . .  This familiar standard gives full play to the \nresponsibility of the trie r of fact fairly to re solve conflicts in the \ntestimony, to weigh the evidence and to draw reasonable inferences \nfrom basic facts to ultimate facts.  \n \nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. at 319; Smith v. Nagy, 962 F.3d 192, 205 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting \nJackson). \n Although Redic presented his evidence claim only  as a manifest weight claim, a decision \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 6 of 16  PAGEID #: 8697 \n \nby an Ohio Court of Appeals that a verdict is no t against the manifest weight to the evidence \nlogically implies that there was sufficient evidence.

Ohio May 10, 2011)(White, M.J.); Hughes v. Warden, No. 1:10-cv-091, \n2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54131 (S.D. Ohio Apr. 27, 2011)(Merz, M.J.).  State court findings of fact \nare binding in later habeas corpus proceedings un less the petitioner demonstrates that the finding \nis rebutted by clear and convincing evidence in the state court record.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); \nCullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170 (2011). \n In this case there clearly wa s sufficient evidence to support a conviction of anal rape:  the \nvictim testified that she did not consent to anal intercourse and the SANE nurse testified to injuries \nconsistent with forcible anal rape, to wit, anal  prolapse.  Thus even if Redic had preserved a \nsufficiency of the evidence claim for habeas review, it would be without merit. \n As Redic\u2019s App. R. 26(B) Application acknowle dges, a sufficiency of the evidence claim \nshould be raised on direct appeal  and was not in this case.  In addition to claiming Redic\u2019s First \nGround is not cognizable in habeas corpus, Respondent also asserts it is procedurally defaulted by \nRedic\u2019s failure to raise it on direct appeal. \n The procedural default doctrine in habeas corpus is described by the Supreme Court as \nfollows: \nIn all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims \nin state court pursuant to an adequate and independent state \nprocedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless \nthe prisoner can demonstrate ca use of the default and actual \nprejudice as a result of the alle ged violation of federal law; or \ndemonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a \nfundamental miscarriage of justice. \n \nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991); see also Simpson v. Jones , 238 F.3d 399, 406 \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 7 of 16  PAGEID #: 8708 \n \n(6th Cir. 2000).  That is, a petitioner may not raise on federal habeas a federal constitutional rights \nclaim he could not raise in state court because of procedural default. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. \n72 (1977); Engle v. Isaac , 456 U.S. 107, 110 (1982).  \u201cAbsent cause and prejudice, \u2018a federal \nhabeas petitioner who fails to comply with a State\u2019s rules of procedure waives his right to federal \nhabeas corpus review.\u2019\u201d  Boyle v. Million, 201 F.3d 711, 716 (6 th Cir. 2000), quoting Gravley v. \nMills, 87 F.3d 779, 784-85 (6 th Cir. 1996); Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 485 (1986); Engle, \n456 U.S. at 110; Wainwright, 433 U.S. at 87.   \n[A] federal court may not review federal claims that were \nprocedurally defaulted in state court\u2014that is, claims that the state \ncourt denied based on an adequate and independent state procedural \nrule. E.g., Beard v. Kindler , 558 U.S. 53, 55, 130 S.Ct. 612, 175 \nL.Ed.2d 417 (2009).  This is an important \u201ccorollary\u201d to the \nexhaustion requirement. Dretke v. Haley , 541 U.S. 386, 392, 124 \nS.Ct. 1847, 158 L.Ed. d 659 (2004).  \u201cJust as in those cases in which \na state prisoner fails to exhaust state remedies, a habeas petitioner \nwho has failed to meet the State\u2019s procedural requirements for \npresenting his federal claims has deprived the state courts of an \nopportunity to address\u201d the merits  of \u201cthose claims in the first \ninstance.\u201d  Coleman [v. Thompson], 501 U.S. [722,] 731-732, 111 \nS.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 [(1991)].   The procedural default \ndoctrine thus advances the same  comity, finalit y, and federalism \ninterests advanced by the exhaustion doctrine.  See McCleskey v. \nZant, 499 U.S. 467, 493, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991). \n \nDavila v. Davis, 137 S.

Ct. 2058, 2064 (2017)). \n The Sixth Circuit Court of A ppeals requires a four-part analysis when the State alleges a \nhabeas claim is preclude d by procedural default . Barton v. Warden, S.  Ohio Corr. Facility,  786 \nF.3d 450, 464 (6 th Cir. 2015), Guilmette v. Howes,  624 F.3d 286, 290 (6 th Cir. 2010)( en banc); \nEley v. Bagley , 604 F.3d 958, 965 (6 th Cir. 2010); Reynolds v. Berry , 146 F.3d 345, 347-48 (6 th \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 8 of 16  PAGEID #: 8719 \n \nCir. 1998), citing Maupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6 th Cir. 1986); accord Lott v. Coyle , 261 \nF.3d 594, 601-02 (6th Cir. 2001); Jacobs v. Mohr, 265 F.3d 407, 417 (6th Cir. 2001). \nFirst the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule \nthat is applicable to the petiti oner's claim and th at the petitioner \nfailed to comply with the rule. \n  . . . . \nSecond, the court must decide whet her the state courts actually \nenforced the state procedural sanction, citing County Court of Ulster \nCounty v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 149, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 \n(1979).  \n \nThird, the court must decide whether the state procedural forfeiture \nis an \"adequate and independent\" state ground on which the state \ncan rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim. \n \nOnce the court determines that a state procedural  rule was not \ncomplied with and that the rule was an adequate and independent \nstate ground, then the petitioner must demonstrate under Sykes that \nthere was \"cause\" for him to not follow the procedural rule and that \nhe was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.  \n \nMaupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986); accord, Hartman v. Bagley, 492 F.3d 347, 357 \n(6th Cir. 2007), quoting Monzo v. Edwards, 281 F.3d 568, 576 (6th Cir. 2002).  \n Ohio has a relevant procedural rule:  cla ims which can be decide d on the direct appeal \nrecord, such as claims of insufficient evidence, must be presented there or be barred by res judicata \nfrom consideration in later proceedings.  State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St. 2d 175 (1967). The Perry rule \nhas been repeatedly held to be an adequate and independ ent state ground of decision.  Durr v. \nMitchell, 487 F.3d 423, 432 (6 th Cir. 2007); Buell v. Mitchell , 274 F.3d 337 (6 th Cir. 2001); \nColeman v. Mitchell, 268 F.3d 417 (6th Cir. 2001); Byrd v. Collins, 209 F.3d 486, 521-22 (6th Cir. \n2000); Rust v. Zent, 17 F.3d 155, 160-61 (6th Cir. 1994)(citation omitted); Van Hook v. Anderson, \n127 F. Supp. 2d 899, 913 (S.D. Ohio 2001).  The Ohio courts have consistently enforced the Perry \nrule.    State v. Cole, 2 Ohio St. 3d 112 (1982); State v. Ishmail, 67 Ohio St. 2d 16 (1981).  Thus \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 9 of 16  PAGEID #: 87210 \n \nthere is no doubt they would have found an insufficient evidence claim barred by res judicata if \nRedic had ever made a sufficiency claim in any proceeding subsequent to direct appeal, which he \ndid not. \n A habeas petitioner can overcome a procedural default by showing cause for the default \nand prejudice from the asserted error.  Atkins v. Holloway , 792 F.3d 654, 657 (6 th Cir. 2015).  \nineffective assistance of counsel can constitute excusing case.  Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, \n494-95 (1986).  However such a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be first submitted \nto the state courts and exhausted as required by state procedure.  Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. \n446 (2000).  In this case Redic pr operly presented his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel \nclaim in his 26(B) Applica tion, but then procedurally defaulted that claim by failing to appeal to \nthe Supreme Court of Ohio from denial of his 26(B) Application. \n In sum, Petitioner\u2019s First Ground for Relief sh ould be denied because the claim it raises \nprima facie \u2013 verdict against the manifest weight of the evidence \u2013 is not a federal constitutional \nclaim.  Construed as an insuffic ient evidence claim, it is without  merit and is al so procedurally \ndefaulted. \n \nGround Two:  Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel  \n \n In his Second Ground for Relief, Petitioner assert s he received ineffe ctive assistance of \nappellate counsel.  Although Redic captions his claims as ineffec tive assistance of appellate \ncounsel claims, the issues raised in the supporting facts are claims of (a) prosecutorial misconduct \n(overcharging), (b) trial counsel error (not mo ving for a preliminary hearing), (c) ineffective \nassistance of trial counsel (not renewing the Rule 29 motion), and (d) trial court error (denying the \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 10 of 16  PAGEID #: 87311 \n \nRule 29 motion).  He makes no effort to connect these four sub-claims to  anything his appellate \nattorney did or did not do.  In any event, any cl aim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel \nis barred by Redic\u2019s procedural default in failing to appeal to  the Supreme Court of Ohio from \ndenial of his 26(B) Application.   \n To the extent these four sub-claims raise issues other than ineffective assistance of \nappellate counsel, they also are procedurally defaulted and/or without merit. \n Petitioner\u2019s claim that the prosecutor e ngaged in misconduct by overcharging him is \ngrounded in his claim that there was insufficient evidence to convict h im of anal rape.  As \nexplained above, there was sufficient evidence of anal rape not just for charging purposes, but also \nfor conviction.  It cannot be prosecutorial misconduct to charge a defendant with an offense wholly \nsupported by the evidence.  Thus this sub-claim is without merit; it is also procedurally defaulted \nby Redic\u2019s failure to raise it on direct appeal. \n Petitioner\u2019s claim that he should have been given a preliminary hearing is without merit \nbecause Ohio law does not provide for such a hear ing when the charges result from a grand jury \nindictment.  Moreover there is no federal constitutional right to a preliminary hearing. \n Redic\u2019s third sub-claim is that  he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel when his \nattorney did not renew the Rule 29 motion.  To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of trial \ncounsel, a defendant must show that his attorney performed deficiently and that he was prejudiced \nby the deficient performance.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).  Because there \nplainly was sufficient evidence of anal rape, a renewed Rule  29 motion would undoubtedly have \nbeen denied and Redic was not prejudice by the failure.   \n Redic\u2019s fourth sub-claim fails for the same re ason:  it would have be en error for the trial \ncourt to grant the Rule 29 motion because there was sufficient evidence.  \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 11 of 16  PAGEID #: 87412 \n \n Therefore Redic\u2019s Second Ground fo r Relief should be dismissed. \n \nGround Three:  Due process, prosecutor misconduct. \n \n Although Redic labels his Third Ground as about  prosecutor misconduct, it is never a \nprosecutor\u2019s responsibility to call a defense witness.  From the way the supporting facts are \nworded, the Court reads this as a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In the Petition \nRedic states the claim was not made on direct appeal because it depends on facts outside the \nappellate record, supporting this reading. \n Petitioner raised this as his second claim in his Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, blaming \nhis trial attorney for not calling Detective Kraker as a defense witness and also for not complaining \nof prosecutorial misconduct \u201c[b]ecause, the Prosecutor presented Detective Alan Kraker to the \nCourt as the State's key witness, and motioned the Court that Detective Kraker be permitted to sit \nat Prosecutor's table throughout the Court proceedings. (State  Court Record, ECF No. 4, PageID \n207 et seq.) \n In deciding this claim, Common Pleas Judge Buckwalter held: \nRedic' s second claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is that his \ntrial counsel was ineffective because  his attorney failed to call a \nDetective Alan Kraker as a defense witness at trial or to object to the \nState's failure to call Det. Kraker at trial. Redic argues that had \nKraker testified on direct or cross examination, his testimony \n\"would have clearly demonstrat ed the victim's perjury, or \nfalsification and prior inconsiste nt statements.\" Post Conviction \nPetition, p. 5. \n \nRedic's petition includes a copy of a Narrative Supplement to the \nFairborn Police Department  investigative report  prepared by Det. \nKraker, which includes descriptions  of Det. Kraker's discussions \nwith Y.M . Redic, however, fails to describe or to bring to the \nCourt's attention any claimed inconsistencies between the victim's \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 12 of 16  PAGEID #: 87513 \n \ntestimony at trial and her statemen ts to Det. Kraker which might \nhave constituted material with  which Y.M. could have been \nimpeached at trial. In this matter in which Redic claims ineffective \nassistance of counsel, it is Redic' s burden to prove his allegations \nof ineffective assistan ce of counsel, including a description of any \nclaimed inconsistencies between statements by the victim in Det. \nKraker's narrative report and her testimony at trial. The Court, on its \nown review, does not discern any material or significant \ninconsistencies which might have provided material for \nimpeachment. \n \nThe Court does not find any ground for a claim of ineffective \nassistance of counsel in regard to Redic's allegation that his trial \ncounsel failed to object to the Stat e's not calling Det. Kraker as a \nwitness at trial. The State bore no duty to Defendant to call any \nparticular witness, including Det. Kraker, at trial. More importantly, \nany objection by Defendant to the St ate's omission of Det. Kraker \nas a witness at trial would have been to no avail and could not have \nserved as a means by which Defendant could have made the State \ncall Det. Kraker as its witness at trial. \n \nThe Court does not find that Redic's trial counsel's failure to call \nDet. Kraker as a witness at trial fell below any objective standard of \nreasonableness, and does not find that Defendant has demonstrated \nprejudice in this regard, in that the Court does not find a probability \nthat the outcome of the trial would have been different had \nDefendant called Det. Kraker as a witness at trial. \n \n(Judgment Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Ex. 31, PageID 310-11.) \n Redic did not appeal from dism issal of his post-conviction Petition, so the claims in Ground \nThree are procedurally defaulted.  If the Court were to reach the merits, it would be bound to defer \nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to Judge Buckwalter\u2019s decision because that decision is not an \nobjectively unreasonabl e application of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).  In \nparticular, the State is under no obligation to call as  a witness the law enforcement officer \ndesignated as the State\u2019s representative at trial, so an objection to that effect by trial counsel would \nhave been meritless.  It is ex tremely risky for the defense to cal l the State\u2019s representative as a \ndefense witness because defense counsel cannot know  what he or she will say.  Finally, if the \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 13 of 16  PAGEID #: 87614 \n \npurpose was to show inconsistencies between the vi ctim\u2019s testimony at trial and what she said to \nDetective Kraker, she could have been confronted with those inconsistencies from the record \nKraker made of her statements (attached to Redic\u2019s post-conviction petition) without ever calling \nhim to the stand.   \n Therefore Ground Three should be dismissed as procedurally defaulted and without merit. \n \nGround Four: Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel \n \n In his Fourth Ground for Relief, Redic claims he received ineffectiv e assistance of trial \ncounsel when his trial attorney failed to (1) introduce the victim\u2019s mental  health records from \nEastway, (2) failed to present testimony from Jason Wiseman, and (3) failed to cross-examine the \nvictim with records from the Dayton Police Department. \n Redic raised this as his third claim of in effective assistance of trial counsel in post-\nconviction and Judge Buckwalter decided it as follows: \n \nRedic alleges that he received ineffective assistance at trial because \nhis counsel failed to introduce medical records of Y.M. from \nEastway Mental Health Center a nd failed to call Jason Wiseman, a \ncounselor or doctor who performed an examination of Y.M. at \nEastway, as a witness at trial. Redic also argues that counsel was \nineffective by failin g to introduce Dayton Police Department \nrecords of reports, apparently of previous complaints to the Police \nDepartment made by the victim. \n \nRedic argues that Eastway records and records of an examination of \nY.M. by Jason Wisement, a physician at Eastway, would have \ncontradicted the victim's testimony at trial that she had no mental \nhealth problems other than anxiety.   \n \nAt trial, however, Redic's counsel cross-examined Y.M. based upon \na medical record which stated that  Y.M. had a history of visual \nhallucinations and a diagnosis of Schizioaffective [sic] Disorder. \n[footnote omitted] Tr. 173~182. Y.M. denied a history of \nCase: 3:21-cv-00191-WHR-MRM Doc #: 9 Filed: 11/22/21 Page: 14 of 16  PAGEID #: 87715 \n \nhallucinations and denied a history of schiziophrenia [sic]. Tr. 178, \n181. Therefore, trial counsel did impeach Y.M. at trial based upon \ndiscrepancies between her trial testimony and statements in her \nmedical record. \n \nRedic claims that statements made by the victim in the record \nprepared by Jason Wiseman would have impeached Y.M., but again, \nRedic fails to meet his burden of specifically delineating the areas \nof claimed inconsistency.   \n \nThe Court notes also that at trial Redic's counsel called an expert in \nschizoaffective disorders, Julie Ross Messinger, to the stand, who \ntestified as to potential adverse effects of a schizioaffective [sic] \ndisorder upon a person's ability to accurately observe and recollect \nevents. \n \nRedic does not specify any reason why it was allegedly ineffective \nassistance of counsel to introduce Dayton Police Department reports \ninto evidence at trial. Redic does state that the Police Department \nreport of the subject incident states that Y.M. was on social security \ndisability for bipolar and schiziophrenia [sic]. These diagnoses had \nalready come in, however, in Defendant's Exhibit C. \n \nIn sum, the Court finds that Redic has failed to meet his burden of \nshowing ineffective assistance of counsel on any of the claims in \nthis regard set forth in his peti tion for postconviction relief. The \nCourt does not find that Redic has shown that any of the alleged \nerrors of counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, \nand does not find that Redic has shown that any of the claimed errors \nof counsel would have materially altered the outcome of the trial had \ncounsel proceeded differently. \n \n(Judgment Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Ex. 31, PageID 311-13). \n As with Ground Three, Redic has procedurally  defaulted this claim by failing to appeal \nfrom denial of his post-conviction petition to the Second District Court of Appeals.  Moreover, as \nthe final state court decision on th e merits, Judge Buckwalter\u2019s decision is entitled to deference \nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) as a reasonable application of Strickland.

Relevant filings are the Petition (ECF No. 1), the State Court Record (ECF No. 4), and the Warden\u2019s Return of Writ (ECF No. 5).\n\nWhen the Court ordered an answer in this case, it set a deadline for Petitioner to respond to that answer by filing a reply not later than twenty-one days after the answer was filed (Order for Answer, ECF No. 2). When the Return of Writ/Answer was filed, the Court notified Petitioner that his reply was due by October 11, 2021 (ECF No. 6). On October 19, 2021, Petitioner requested and received an extension of time to file his reply to and including November 1, 2021 (ECF No. 7 & 8). However as of the date of this Report more than three weeks later, Petitioner has neither filed a reply nor requested a further extension.\nLitigation History\n\nOn May 11, 2018, a Greene County, Ohio grand jury indicted Petitioner on two counts of rape with repeat violent offender specifications in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.02(A)(2); one count of attempted felonious assault in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2923.02(A)/2903.11(A)(1); and one count of abduction under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2905.02(A)(2) (Indictment, State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Ex. 1). The repeat violent offender specifications were severed for bench trial on Redic\u2019s motion. Id. Ex. 4.\n\nA jury found Redic guilty of the anal rape charge, but not guilty on the other three counts (Verdict, State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Ex. 6)\\(^1\\). He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment. Id. at Ex. 8. Redic appealed, assigning as error only the claim that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The Ohio Second District Court of Appeals affirmed. State v. Redic, 2019-Ohio-3395 (Ohio App. 2\\(^{nd}\\) Dist. Aug. 23, 2019)(copy at State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Ex. 20).\n\nOhio law allows a litigant forty-five days to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio from an adverse decision of the court of appeals. In this case Redic\u2019s time to appeal expired October 23, 2019, but he did not file a notice of appeal until February 20, 2020, along with a motion for delayed appeal (State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Exs. 21, 22). The Supreme Court summarily denied the motion. Id. at Ex. 23.\n\nOn November 20, 2019, Redic filed an application to reopen his appeal pursuant to Ohio R. App. P. 26(B) to raise claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel (Application, State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Ex. 24). The Second District denied that Application on the merits and\n\n\\(^1\\) Redic was tried before The Honorable James A. Brogan, retired judge of the Second District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.\nRedic did not appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio. *Id.* at Ex. 27.\n\nInstead on January 28, 2020, Redic filed a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2953.21 (State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Ex. 28). The State moved to dismiss the Petition as untimely filed and/or barred by *res judicata.* *Id.* at Ex. 29. The Common Pleas Court found the Petition was timely and not barred by *res judicata,* but rejected all three of Redic\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on the merits (Judgment Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Ex. 31). Redic did not appeal this decision.\n\nRedic filed his Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in this Court on April 12, 2021, pleading the following grounds for relief:\n\n**Ground One:** Manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** The trial court abused its discretion because the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence, constituting a violation of Appellant\u2019s right of due process of law and fundamental fairness.\n\n**Ground Two:** Ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** The prosecutor failed in his duty to refrain from improper methods of obtaining a rape(s) charges against the Appellant, rather than bring a lesser included sexual assault, such as sexual battery. (b) Trial court failed to motion to the court for a pre-trial preliminary hearing. (c) Trial counsel failed to renew his Crim.R. 29 motion to dismiss the State\u2019s case at the conclusion of trial. (d) Trial court abused its discretion in objecting the defense Crim.R. 29 motion to dismiss charges. The record clearly provides the State\u2019s evidence was wholly insufficient to support either rape charges.\n\n**Ground Three:** Due process, prosecutor misconduct.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** Counsel\u2019s unreasonable decision not to present Detective Kraker as a defense witness, cannot reasonably be construed as sound trial tactic or strategy because counsel\u2019s error in not presenting Detective Kraker to the jury constitutes counsel\u2019s abandonment of Petitioner\u2019s defense, resulting in Petitioner\u2019s conviction.\nGround Four: Effective assistance of counsel.\n\nSupporting Facts: Counsel\u2019s failure to introduce East Way mental health record, or the testimony of potential witness Jason Wiseman, and failure to introduce Dayton Police reports during the cross-examination of the Victim, resulting in the Petitioner being deprived of due process and effective cross-examination.\n\n(Petition, ECF No. 1 PageID 5-10).\n\nAnalysis\n\nGround One: Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n\nIn his First Ground for Relief, Redic claims his conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nFederal habeas corpus is available only to correct federal constitutional violations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); Wilson v. Corcoran, 562 U.S. 1 (2010); Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 U.S. 764, 780 (1990); Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209 (1982), Barclay v. Florida, 463 U.S. 939 (1983). \"[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state court determinations on state law questions. In conducting habeas review, a federal court is limited to deciding whether a conviction violated the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\" Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67-68 (1991); see also Elmendorf v. Taylor, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 152, 160 (1825)(Marshall C. J.); Bickham v. Winn, 888 F.3d 248 (6th Cir. Apr. 23, 2018)(Thapar, J. concurring).\n\nA weight of the evidence claim is not a federal constitutional claim. Johnson v. Havener, 534 F.2d 1232 (6th Cir. 1986). In State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St. 3d 380 (1997), the Supreme Court of Ohio reaffirmed the important distinction between appellate review for insufficiency of\nthe evidence and review on the claim that the conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence. It held:\n\nIn essence, sufficiency is a test of adequacy. Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict is a question of law. *State v. Robinson* (1955), 162 Ohio St. 486, 55 O.O. 388, 124 N.E.2d 148. In addition, a conviction based on legally insufficient evidence constitutes a denial of due process. *Tibbs v. Florida*, 457 U.S. 31, 45, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 2220, 72 L.Ed.2d 652, 663, (1982), citing *Jackson v. Virginia* (1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. Although a court of appeals may determine that a judgment of a trial court is sustained by sufficient evidence, that court may nevertheless conclude that the judgment is against the weight of the evidence. *Robinson, supra*, 162 Ohio St. at 487, 55 O.O. at 388-389, 124 N.E.2d at 149. Weight of the evidence concerns \"the inclination of the greater amount of credible evidence, offered in a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other. It indicates clearly to the jury that the party having the burden of proof will be entitled to their verdict, if, on weighing the evidence in their minds, they shall find the greater amount of credible evidence sustains the issue which is to be established before them. Weight is not a question of mathematics, but depends on its effect in inducing belief.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\nWhen a court of appeals reverses a judgment of a trial court on the basis that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, the appellate court sits as a \"'thirteenth juror'\" and disagrees with the factfinder's resolution of the conflicting testimony. *Tibbs*, 457 U.S. at 42, 102 S.Ct. at 2218, 72 L.Ed.2d at 661. See, also, *State v. Martin* (1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 219, 485 N.E.2d 717, 720-721 (\"The court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\").\n\n78 Ohio St. 3d at 387. In *State v. Martin*, 20 Ohio App. 3d 172 (Hamilton Cty. 1983)(cited approvingly by the Supreme Court in *Thompkins*), Judge Robert Black contrasted the manifest weight of the evidence claim:\nIn considering the claim that the conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence, the test is much broader. The court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of the witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. \u2026\n\nMartin, 20 Ohio App. 3d 172, \u00b63 of the syllabus.\n\nIn his Second Ground for Relief, Redic complains that his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance of appellate counsel by (1) not claiming trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of trial counsel by not renewing his motion to dismiss under Ohio R. Crim. P. 29 and (2) by not claiming the trial court abused its discretion by denying that Rule 29 motion when it was made because, he says, \u201cThe record clearly provides the State\u2019s evidence was wholly insufficient to support either rape charges [sic].\u201d\n\nOhio R. Crim. P. 29 allows a criminal defendant to obtain dismissal of a charge with prejudice when the State has not presented constitutionally sufficient evidence by the time the State rests its case in chief or by the close of all the evidence. In deciding a Rule 29 motion, Ohio courts apply the same sufficiency test as is required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and enunciated in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979):\n\n[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt . . . . This familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\n\nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. at 319; Smith v. Nagy, 962 F.3d 192, 205 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Jackson).\n\nAlthough Redic presented his evidence claim only as a manifest weight claim, a decision\nby an Ohio Court of Appeals that a verdict is not against the manifest weight to the evidence logically implies that there was sufficient evidence. *Nash v. Eberlin*, 258 Fed. Appx. 761, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 29645 (6th Cir. Dec. 14, 2007); *Ross v. Miller*, No. 1:10-cv-1185, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65082 (N.D. Ohio May 10, 2011)(White, M.J.); *Hughes v. Warden*, No. 1:10-cv-091, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 54131 (S.D. Ohio Apr. 27, 2011)(Merz, M.J.). State court findings of fact are binding in later habeas corpus proceedings unless the petitioner demonstrates that the finding is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence in the state court record. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); *Cullen v. Pinholster*, 563 U.S. 170 (2011).\n\nIn this case there clearly was sufficient evidence to support a conviction of anal rape: the victim testified that she did not consent to anal intercourse and the SANE nurse testified to injuries consistent with forcible anal rape, to wit, anal prolapse. Thus even if Redic had preserved a sufficiency of the evidence claim for habeas review, it would be without merit.\n\nAs Redic\u2019s App. R. 26(B) Application acknowledges, a sufficiency of the evidence claim should be raised on direct appeal and was not in this case. In addition to claiming Redic\u2019s First Ground is not cognizable in habeas corpus, Respondent also asserts it is procedurally defaulted by Redic\u2019s failure to raise it on direct appeal.\n\nThe procedural default doctrine in habeas corpus is described by the Supreme Court as follows:\n\nIn all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an adequate and independent state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause of the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law; or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\n\n*Coleman v. Thompson*, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991); see also *Simpson v. Jones*, 238 F.3d 399, 406\nThat is, a petitioner may not raise on federal habeas a federal constitutional rights claim he could not raise in state court because of procedural default. *Wainwright v. Sykes*, 433 U.S. 72 (1977); *Engle v. Isaac*, 456 U.S. 107, 110 (1982). \u201cAbsent cause and prejudice, \u2018a federal habeas petitioner who fails to comply with a State\u2019s rules of procedure waives his right to federal habeas corpus review.\u2019\u201d *Boyle v. Million*, 201 F.3d 711, 716 (6th Cir. 2000), quoting *Gravley v. Mills*, 87 F.3d 779, 784-85 (6th Cir. 1996); *Murray v. Carrier*, 477 U.S. 478, 485 (1986); *Engle*, 456 U.S. at 110; *Wainwright*, 433 U.S. at 87.\n\n[A] federal court may not review federal claims that were procedurally defaulted in state court\u2014that is, claims that the state court denied based on an adequate and independent state procedural rule. E.g., *Beard v. Kindler*, 558 U.S. 53, 55, 130 S.Ct. 612, 175 L.Ed.2d 417 (2009). This is an important \u201ccorollary\u201d to the exhaustion requirement. *Dretke v. Haley*, 541 U.S. 386, 392, 124 S.Ct. 1847, 158 L.Ed.2d 659 (2004). \u201cJust as in those cases in which a state prisoner fails to exhaust state remedies, a habeas petitioner who has failed to meet the State\u2019s procedural requirements for presenting his federal claims has deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address\u201d the merits of \u201cthose claims in the first instance.\u201d *Coleman [v. Thompson]*, 501 U.S. [722,] 731-732, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 [(1991)]. The procedural default doctrine thus advances the same comity, finality, and federalism interests advanced by the exhaustion doctrine. See *McCleskey v. Zant*, 499 U.S. 467, 493, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991).\n\n*Davila v. Davis*, 137 S. Ct. 2058, 2064 (2017). \u201c[A] federal court may not review federal claims that were procedurally defaulted in state courts.\u201d *Theriot v. Vashaw*, 982 F.3d 999 (6th Cir. 2020), citing *Maslonka v. Hoffner*, 900 F.3d 269, 276 (6th Cir. 2018) (alteration in original) (quoting *Davila v. Davis*, 137 S. Ct. 2058, 2064 (2017)).\n\nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals requires a four-part analysis when the State alleges a habeas claim is precluded by procedural default. *Barton v. Warden, S. Ohio Corr. Facility*, 786 F.3d 450, 464 (6th Cir. 2015); *Guilmette v. Howes*, 624 F.3d 286, 290 (6th Cir. 2010)(en banc); *Eley v. Bagley*, 604 F.3d 958, 965 (6th Cir. 2010); *Reynolds v. Berry*, 146 F.3d 345, 347-48 (6th\nCir. 1998), citing Maupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986); accord Lott v. Coyle, 261 F.3d 594, 601-02 (6th Cir. 2001); Jacobs v. Mohr, 265 F.3d 407, 417 (6th Cir. 2001).\n\nFirst the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner's claim and that the petitioner failed to comply with the rule.\n\nSecond, the court must decide whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction, citing County Court of Ulster County v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 149, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979).\n\nThird, the court must decide whether the state procedural forfeiture is an \"adequate and independent\" state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim.\n\nOnce the court determines that a state procedural rule was not complied with and that the rule was an adequate and independent state ground, then the petitioner must demonstrate under Sykes that there was \"cause\" for him to not follow the procedural rule and that he was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.\n\nMaupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986); accord, Hartman v. Bagley, 492 F.3d 347, 357 (6th Cir. 2007), quoting Monzo v. Edwards, 281 F.3d 568, 576 (6th Cir. 2002).\n\nOhio has a relevant procedural rule: claims which can be decided on the direct appeal record, such as claims of insufficient evidence, must be presented there or be barred by res judicata from consideration in later proceedings. State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St. 2d 175 (1967). The Perry rule has been repeatedly held to be an adequate and independent state ground of decision. Durr v. Mitchell, 487 F.3d 423, 432 (6th Cir. 2007); Buell v. Mitchell, 274 F.3d 337 (6th Cir. 2001); Coleman v. Mitchell, 268 F.3d 417 (6th Cir. 2001); Byrd v. Collins, 209 F.3d 486, 521-22 (6th Cir. 2000); Rust v. Zent, 17 F.3d 155, 160-61 (6th Cir. 1994)(citation omitted); Van Hook v. Anderson, 127 F. Supp. 2d 899, 913 (S.D. Ohio 2001). The Ohio courts have consistently enforced the Perry rule. State v. Cole, 2 Ohio St. 3d 112 (1982); State v. Ishmail, 67 Ohio St. 2d 16 (1981). Thus\nthere is no doubt they would have found an insufficient evidence claim barred by *res judicata* if Redic had ever made a sufficiency claim in any proceeding subsequent to direct appeal, which he did not.\n\nA habeas petitioner can overcome a procedural default by showing cause for the default and prejudice from the asserted error. *Atkins v. Holloway*, 792 F.3d 654, 657 (6th Cir. 2015). Ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute excusing case. *Murray v. Carrier*, 477 U.S. 478, 494-95 (1986). However such a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must be first submitted to the state courts and exhausted as required by state procedure. *Edwards v. Carpenter*, 529 U.S. 446 (2000). In this case Redic properly presented his ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim in his 26(B) Application, but then procedurally defaulted that claim by failing to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio from denial of his 26(B) Application.\n\nIn sum, Petitioner\u2019s First Ground for Relief should be denied because the claim it raises prima facie \u2013 verdict against the manifest weight of the evidence \u2013 is not a federal constitutional claim. Construed as an insufficient evidence claim, it is without merit and is also procedurally defaulted.\n\n**Ground Two: Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel**\n\nIn his Second Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Although Redic captions his claims as ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims, the issues raised in the supporting facts are claims of (a) prosecutorial misconduct (overcharging), (b) trial counsel error (not moving for a preliminary hearing), (c) ineffective assistance of trial counsel (not renewing the Rule 29 motion), and (d) trial court error (denying the\nRule 29 motion). He makes no effort to connect these four sub-claims to anything his appellate attorney did or did not do. In any event, any claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is barred by Redic\u2019s procedural default in failing to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio from denial of his 26(B) Application.\n\nTo the extent these four sub-claims raise issues other than ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, they also are procedurally defaulted and/or without merit.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s claim that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by overcharging him is grounded in his claim that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of anal rape. As explained above, there was sufficient evidence of anal rape not just for charging purposes, but also for conviction. It cannot be prosecutorial misconduct to charge a defendant with an offense wholly supported by the evidence. Thus this sub-claim is without merit; it is also procedurally defaulted by Redic\u2019s failure to raise it on direct appeal.\n\nPetitioner\u2019s claim that he should have been given a preliminary hearing is without merit because Ohio law does not provide for such a hearing when the charges result from a grand jury indictment. Moreover there is no federal constitutional right to a preliminary hearing.\n\nRedic\u2019s third sub-claim is that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel when his attorney did not renew the Rule 29 motion. To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, a defendant must show that his attorney performed deficiently and that he was prejudiced by the deficient performance. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Because there plainly was sufficient evidence of anal rape, a renewed Rule 29 motion would undoubtedly have been denied and Redic was not prejudice by the failure.\n\nRedic\u2019s fourth sub-claim fails for the same reason: it would have been error for the trial court to grant the Rule 29 motion because there was sufficient evidence.\nTherefore Redic\u2019s Second Ground for Relief should be dismissed.\n\n**Ground Three: Due process, prosecutor misconduct.**\n\nAlthough Redic labels his Third Ground as about prosecutor misconduct, it is never a prosecutor\u2019s responsibility to call a defense witness. From the way the supporting facts are worded, the Court reads this as a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In the Petition Redic states the claim was not made on direct appeal because it depends on facts outside the appellate record, supporting this reading.\n\nPetitioner raised this as his second claim in his Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, blaming his trial attorney for not calling Detective Kraker as a defense witness and also for not complaining of prosecutorial misconduct \u201c[b]ecause, the Prosecutor presented Detective Alan Kraker to the Court as the State's key witness, and motioned the Court that Detective Kraker be permitted to sit at Prosecutor's table throughout the Court proceedings. (State Court Record, ECF No. 4, PageID 207 et seq.)\n\nIn deciding this claim, Common Pleas Judge Buckwalter held:\n\nRedic's second claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is that his trial counsel was ineffective because his attorney failed to call a Detective Alan Kraker as a defense witness at trial or to object to the State's failure to call Det. Kraker at trial. Redic argues that had Kraker testified on direct or cross examination, his testimony \"would have clearly demonstrated the victim's perjury, or falsification and prior inconsistent statements.\" Post Conviction Petition, p. 5.\n\nRedic's petition includes a copy of a Narrative Supplement to the Fairborn Police Department investigative report prepared by Det. Kraker, which includes descriptions of Det. Kraker's discussions with Y.M. Redic, however, fails to describe or to bring to the Court's attention any claimed inconsistencies between the victim's\ntestimony at trial and her statements to Det. Kraker which might have constituted material with which Y.M. could have been impeached at trial. In this matter in which Redic claims ineffective assistance of counsel, it is Redic's burden to prove his allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, including a description of any claimed inconsistencies between statements by the victim in Det. Kraker's narrative report and her testimony at trial. The Court, on its own review, does not discern any material or significant inconsistencies which might have provided material for impeachment.\n\nThe Court does not find any ground for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in regard to Redic's allegation that his trial counsel failed to object to the State's not calling Det. Kraker as a witness at trial. The State bore no duty to Defendant to call any particular witness, including Det. Kraker, at trial. More importantly, any objection by Defendant to the State's omission of Det. Kraker as a witness at trial would have been to no avail and could not have served as a means by which Defendant could have made the State call Det. Kraker as its witness at trial.\n\nThe Court does not find that Redic's trial counsel's failure to call Det. Kraker as a witness at trial fell below any objective standard of reasonableness, and does not find that Defendant has demonstrated prejudice in this regard, in that the Court does not find a probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different had Defendant called Det. Kraker as a witness at trial.\n\n(Judgment Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Ex. 31, PageID 310-11.)\n\nRedic did not appeal from dismissal of his post-conviction Petition, so the claims in Ground Three are procedurally defaulted. If the Court were to reach the merits, it would be bound to defer under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) to Judge Buckwalter\u2019s decision because that decision is not an objectively unreasonable application of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). In particular, the State is under no obligation to call as a witness the law enforcement officer designated as the State\u2019s representative at trial, so an objection to that effect by trial counsel would have been meritless. It is extremely risky for the defense to call the State\u2019s representative as a defense witness because defense counsel cannot know what he or she will say. Finally, if the\npurpose was to show inconsistencies between the victim\u2019s testimony at trial and what she said to Detective Kraker, she could have been confronted with those inconsistencies from the record Kraker made of her statements (attached to Redic\u2019s post-conviction petition) without ever calling him to the stand.\n\nTherefore Ground Three should be dismissed as procedurally defaulted and without merit.\n\n**Ground Four: Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel**\n\nIn his Fourth Ground for Relief, Redic claims he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel when his trial attorney failed to (1) introduce the victim\u2019s mental health records from Eastway, (2) failed to present testimony from Jason Wiseman, and (3) failed to cross-examine the victim with records from the Dayton Police Department.\n\nRedic raised this as his third claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in post-conviction and Judge Buckwalter decided it as follows:\n\nRedic alleges that he received ineffective assistance at trial because his counsel failed to introduce medical records of Y.M. from Eastway Mental Health Center and failed to call Jason Wiseman, a counselor or doctor who performed an examination of Y.M. at Eastway, as a witness at trial. Redic also argues that counsel was ineffective by failing to introduce Dayton Police Department records of reports, apparently of previous complaints to the Police Department made by the victim.\n\nRedic argues that Eastway records and records of an examination of Y.M. by Jason Wiseman, a physician at Eastway, would have contradicted the victim's testimony at trial that she had no mental health problems other than anxiety.\n\nAt trial, however, Redic's counsel cross-examined Y.M. based upon a medical record which stated that Y.M. had a history of visual hallucinations and a diagnosis of Schizoaffective [sic] Disorder. [footnote omitted] Tr. 173~182. Y.M. denied a history of\nhallucinations and denied a history of schizophrenia [sic]. Tr. 178, 181. Therefore, trial counsel did impeach Y.M. at trial based upon discrepancies between her trial testimony and statements in her medical record.\n\nRedic claims that statements made by the victim in the record prepared by Jason Wiseman would have impeached Y.M., but again, Redic fails to meet his burden of specifically delineating the areas of claimed inconsistency.\n\nThe Court notes also that at trial Redic's counsel called an expert in schizoaffective disorders, Julie Ross Messinger, to the stand, who testified as to potential adverse effects of a schizoaffective [sic] disorder upon a person's ability to accurately observe and recollect events.\n\nRedic does not specify any reason why it was allegedly ineffective assistance of counsel to introduce Dayton Police Department reports into evidence at trial. Redic does state that the Police Department report of the subject incident states that Y.M. was on social security disability for bipolar and schizophrenia [sic]. These diagnoses had already come in, however, in Defendant's Exhibit C.\n\nIn sum, the Court finds that Redic has failed to meet his burden of showing ineffective assistance of counsel on any of the claims in this regard set forth in his petition for postconviction relief. The Court does not find that Redic has shown that any of the alleged errors of counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and does not find that Redic has shown that any of the claimed errors of counsel would have materially altered the outcome of the trial had counsel proceeded differently.\n\n(Judgment Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 4, Ex. 31, PageID 311-13).\n\nAs with Ground Three, Redic has procedurally defaulted this claim by failing to appeal from denial of his post-conviction petition to the Second District Court of Appeals. Moreover, as the final state court decision on the merits, Judge Buckwalter\u2019s decision is entitled to deference under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) as a reasonable application of Strickland. It cannot be ineffective assistance of trial counsel to fail to \u201cgild the lilly\u201d by introducing repetitive evidence.\nConclusion\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the Magistrate Judge respectfully recommends that the Petition be dismissed with prejudice. Because reasonable jurists would not disagree with this conclusion, it is also recommended that Petitioner be denied a certificate of appealability and that the Court certify to the Sixth Circuit that any appeal would be objectively frivolous and should not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis.\n\nNovember 22, 2021.\n\ns/ Michael R.

{"Index": "051-Kitchen", "Context": "[Cite as State v. Kitchen, 2018-Ohio-5244.] \n \nIN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO \nFOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT \nROSS COUNTY \n \nSTATE OF OHIO,    : Case No. 18CA3640 \n \n Plaintiff-Appellee,   : \n \nv.      : DECISION AND \n       J U D G M E N T  E N T R Y  \nMICHAEL KITCHEN,   : \n \n Defendant-Appellant.  : RELEASED: 12/07/2018 \nAPPEARANCES: \n \nMichael L. Benson and Mark D. Tolles, II, Benson & Sesser, L.L.C., Chillicothe, Ohio, \nfor appellant. \n \nMatthew S. Schmidt, Ross County Prosecuting Attorney, and Pamela C. Wells, Ross \nCounty Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, Chillicothe, Ohio, for appellee. \nHarsha, J. \n{\u00b61} Following a declaration of a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct \nand scheduling of a new jury trial, the Ross County Court of Common Pleas denied \nKitchen\u2019s motions to dismiss the charge against him based on double-jeopardy and \nconstitutional speedy-trial claims. \n{\u00b62} Because the common pleas court\u2019s interlocutory entry denying his motion \nto dismiss based on the constitutional right to a speedy trial does not constitute a final, \nappealable order, we lack jurisdiction to address the merits of that assignment of error.  \n{\u00b63} We do have jurisdiction to address Kitchen\u2019s assertion that the trial court \nerred by denying his motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy.  However, we reject it \nbecause in general, there is no double-jeopardy bar to a retrial following a trial court\u2019s \ngranting of a criminal defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.  And he has not established the \nnarrow exception to the general rule, which requires the request for a mistrial be Ross App. No. 18CA3640                                                                                        2 \n \nprecipitated by prosecutorial misconduct that was intentionally calculated to cause or \ninvite a mistrial.   \n{\u00b64} Here, the state committed prosecutorial misconduct by violating the trial \ncourt\u2019s order barring it from introducing any evidence of what Kitchen said in recorded \nfootage that was not disclosed to him before trial.  However, there is no evidence that \nthe state intended to cause a mistrial by asking an officer one question regarding a \nstatement Kitchen made on the undisclosed footage. Specifically, (1) there was no \nsequence of overreaching before the single question; (2) the state resisted Kitchen\u2019s \nrequest for a mistrial and appeared genuinely surprised that it had violated the court\u2019s \norder; and (3) the trial court concluded that although the state had committed \nprosecutorial misconduct by eliciting testimony that violated its order, it was not the \nstate\u2019s intent to cause the mistrial.  We overrule Kitchen\u2019s first assignment of error and \naffirm the trial court\u2019s judgment denying the double-jeopardy motion to dismiss. \nI. FACTS \n{\u00b65} The Ross County Grand Jury returned a secret indictment charging \nMichael Kitchen with one count of sexual battery in violation of R.C. 2907.03, a third-\ndegree felony.  The Ross County Sheriff\u2019s Office arrested Kitchen and following his \narraignment the next day, he was released from custody upon posting a recognizance \nbond.  In its bill of particulars the state alleged that Kitchen engaged in vaginal \nintercourse with Sara Howell, who was not his spouse, when he knew that she was \nunaware that the act was being committed. \n{\u00b66} In its opening statement at the jury trial, the state asserted Sara Howell \nand her boyfriend let Kitchen, her high school friend, sleep over on a couch in their Ross App. No. 18CA3640                                                                                        3 \n \napartment in Chillicothe after going to eat.  After her boyfriend left the next morning for \nwork, Howell awoke in her bedroom to discover that Kitchen was engaged in sex with \nher without her consent.  Kitchen finished the sexual act, left the room, and went back to \nsleep on the couch in another room.  After exchanging text messages with her father \nand a friend, Howell contacted the police, made a report, and was administered a rape \nkit.  The testing determined that Kitchen\u2019s DNA was found in semen in both Howell\u2019s \nvaginal and anal cavities.   \n{\u00b67} In Kitchen\u2019s counsel\u2019s opening statement, he contended that Kitchen and \nHowell engaged in consensual sex, which had been initiated by Howell.  He further \nconceded that when Kitchen was awakened by three law enforcement officers \nresponding to Howell\u2019s report of sexual battery, he lied that he did not have sex with \nHowell because he was terrified and did not know what Howell had told them.   \n{\u00b68} The state\u2019s first witness, Chillicothe Police Officer Shane Simmons, \ntestified that he and Officer Chip Campbell were dispatched to Howell\u2019s apartment to \nrespond to a reported sexual assault.  They talked to Howell and then entered the \napartment, where they observed Kitchen asleep on a couch.  Then they contacted \nDetective Twila Goble, who arrived and with Officer Campbell, they began questioning \nKitchen after advising him of his Miranda rights.  Officer Simmons\u2019s body camera was \nactivated during his interaction with both Howell and Kitchen.  On cross-examination \nKitchen\u2019s attorney played the body camera footage that had been provided to him by \nthe state in discovery.  However, Officer Simmons testified that the footage shown was \nnot the end of his body camera footage.  He indicated he had viewed other footage from \nhis body camera concerning the reported sexual battery.   Ross App. No. 18CA3640                                                                                        4 \n \n{\u00b69} Outside the presence of the jury Officer Simmons explained that there was \napproximately 21 minutes of additional footage of Officer Campbell interrogating Kitchen \nthat the police had failed to disclose to the prosecutor because the old body cameras \nwould download footage to the server in multiple sections when it became too lengthy.  \nKitchen moved for a mistrial based on the state\u2019s failure to disclose this evidence in \ndiscovery.  The trial court overruled Kitchen\u2019s motion, ordered the state to provide \nKitchen with a copy of the undisclosed body camera footage, and continued the case \nuntil the next morning to permit Kitchen and his counsel to review the footage.     \n{\u00b610} The next morning after receiving the previously undisclosed recording of \nOfficer Simmons\u2019s body camera footage, Kitchen\u2019s attorney again asked for a mistrial, \ngenerally asserting that \u201cthere would have been different statements and procedure and \nstrategy in this case had we been provided it.\u201d  He claimed that even if this additional \nundisclosed footage was excluded, \u201cit still doesn\u2019t alleviate the issue that the jury knows \na video exists and is not going to be play[ed] and I\u2019ve made statements, or \nrepresentations, that the video would be played * * *.\u201d  Significantly, the parties and the \ntrial court agreed that the state\u2019s failure to provide this footage to the defense was \nunintentional.   \n{\u00b611} The state noted Officer Simmons\u2019s and Detective Gobles\u2019s statements in a \nMaster Incident Report, which the state had provided to Kitchen and his counsel, \nreferenced several of Kitchen\u2019s statements from the undisclosed body camera footage:  \n(1) Kitchen told the officers that he did not remember having sex with Sara; (2) Kitchen \ntold Officer Campbell he had a dream last night about having sex with his girlfriend; and Ross App. No. 18CA3640                                                                                        5 \n \n(3) Kitchen stated that his girlfriend had told him that he had groped her in his sleep \nbefore.   \n{\u00b612} The trial court denied Kitchen\u2019s second motion for mistrial because:  (1) \ndespite his concession that he initially told police he did not have sex with Howell, \nKitchen\u2019s defense of consensual sex was consistent with what both the undisclosed and \ndisclosed portion of Officer Simmons\u2019s body camera footage revealed; (2) portions of \nthe undisclosed body camera footage were disclosed to Kitchen in the police reports the \nstate gave to the defense in discovery; and (3) although there were discrepancies and \ninconsistencies created by the state\u2019s Crim.R. 16 violation, they were not substantially \nmaterial to Kitchen\u2019s defense.   \n{\u00b613} Nevertheless, the trial court prohibited the state \u201cfrom utilizing any portion \nof the undiscovered video in any way, shape or form,\u201d but permitted the defense to use \nit in any way it felt necessary.  The court finally noted that it had not had an opportunity \nto review the undisclosed footage, but that it would reserve further ruling until the court \nhad the chance to compare it with the reports that were provided in discovery.  \n{\u00b614} Upon return from recess the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[b]ased \nupon the State\u2019s failure, not the defense, * * * to provide the remainder of the video, this \nCourt has ruled that the undisclosed portion will not be admitted into evidence.  \nTherefore, you are not to draw any inference that the Defendant has failed to produce \nthe remainder of the video * * *.\u201d  The parties then concluded their examination of \nOfficer Simmons.   \n{\u00b615} On the state\u2019s direct examination of its next witness, Officer Campbell, it \nquestioned him about statements Kitchen had made addressing why he stayed at Ross App. No. 18CA3640                                                                                        6 \n \nHowell\u2019s apartment that night.  Apparently, Kitchen told the officers that he and Howell \nhad been friends for a while and they had not spoken for some time.  Kitchen\u2019s counsel \nobjected to this testimony on the basis that it had not been disclosed in discovery, but \nthe state countered that Kitchen\u2019s statement was contained on the disclosed body \ncamera footage.  The trial court overruled the objection, but again warned the state that \n\u201cif this officer testified about anything said only on the undisclosed portion, that is a \nviolation of my order and if he violates my order or any other officer violates my order, I \nwill grant a mistrial.\u201d   \n{\u00b616} Subsequently, the state asked Officer Campbell \u201cwhen you were speaking \nwith the Defendant in this case, did you happen to ask him about any dreams he might \nhave had?\u201d and the officer responded that he had.  Kitchen objected and moved for a \nmistrial.  \n{\u00b617} The assistant prosecutor opposed the motion and stated that it was her \nunderstanding that she was permitted to ask about statements that were on the \nundisclosed part of the body camera footage if they were in fact contained in the police \nreports provided in discovery.  Kitchen\u2019s statement about the dream was on both the \nundisclosed footage and the disclosed police reports.  The assistant prosecutor stated \nthat it was not her intent to violate the court\u2019s order and moved to strike her question \nand Officer Campbell\u2019s answer, and release the witness.  The trial court noted that it did \nnot understand how the assistant prosecutor had misinterpreted its order; it granted the \nmistrial.  In its entry declaring the mistrial the court noted that it initially overruled \nKitchen\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on the state\u2019s violation of Crim.R. 16, but granted \nKitchen\u2019s renewed motion when the state violated the court\u2019s curative order.   Ross App. No. 18CA3640                                                                                        7 \n \n{\u00b618} Subsequently, the trial court set the retrial date.  Over four months after \nthe mistrial and two months after rescheduling of the trial Kitchen filed motions to \ndismiss based on double-jeopardy and his constitutional speedy-trial rights.  Kitchen \nclaimed that the state intentionally goaded him to request a mistrial because of its \nprosecutorial misconduct and that the over five-month delay between the mistrial and \nthe scheduled retrial was constitutionally unreasonable.  The state responded.   \n{\u00b619} After the state responded the trial court denied Kitchen\u2019s motions to \ndismiss in two separate entries issued on the same date.  Addressing double jeopardy \nthe court concluded that \u201c[a]lthough this Court cannot understand how his ruling was \nmisinterpreted by the Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, this Court cannot find that the \noffending question was designed to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial.  It \ncertainly was prosecutorial misconduct, but this Court cannot find that i[t] was the \nintention of the Assistant Prosecuting Attorney to cause a mistrial.\u201d  On the \nconstitutional speedy-trial claim the court concluded \u201cthe five month delay in \nrescheduling the Defendant\u2019s trial does not constitute presumptive prejudice\u201d and \n\u201c[e]ven in considering the four factor balancing test this Court cannot determine that the \nfive month delay is constitutionally unreasonable.\u201d   \nII. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR \n{\u00b620} Kitchen assigns the following errors for our review: \n1. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING DEFENDANT-\nAPPELLANT MICHAEL KITCHEN\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS ON \nDOUBLE JEOPARDY GROUNDS. \n  \n2. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING DEFENDANT-\nAPPELLANT MICHAEL KITCHEN\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS ON \nSPEEDY TRIAL GROUNDS. \n Ross App. No. 18CA3640                                                                                        8 \n \nIII. LAW AND ANALYSIS \nA. Jurisdiction \n{\u00b621}  Kitchen contests the trial court\u2019s entries denying his motions to dismiss on \ndouble-jeopardy and constitutional speedy-trial claims.  Before addressing the merits of \nthe assignments of error, we must determine whether this appeal is properly before us.  \nAlthough the parties do not suggest that we lack jurisdiction, \u201clitigants cannot vest a \ncourt with subject-matter jurisdiction by agreement\u201d; subject-matter jurisdiction is \nproperly raised by an appellate court sua sponte.  See Cheap Escape Co., Inc. v. \nHaddox, L.L.C., 120 Ohio St.3d 493, 2008-Ohio-6323, 900 N.E.2d 601, \u00b6 22; State ex \nrel. Dunlap v. Sarko, 135 Ohio St.3d 171, 2013-Ohio-67, 985 N.E.2d 450, \u00b6 13. \n{\u00b622} Courts of appeals have \u201csuch jurisdiction as may be provided by law to \nreview and affirm, modify, or reverse judgments or final orders of the courts of record \ninferior to the court of appeals within the district.\u201d Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section \n3(B)(2).  \u201cR.C. 2505.03(A) limits the appellate jurisdiction of courts of appeals to the \nreview of final orders, judgments, or decrees.\u201d  See State ex rel. Bd. of State Teachers \nRetirement Sys. of Ohio v. Davis, 113 Ohio St.3d 410, 2007-Ohio-2205, 865 N.E.2d \n1289, \u00b6 44. \n{\u00b623} Clearly \u201cthe denial of a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds is a \nfinal, appealable order.\u201d  State v. Anderson, 138 Ohio St.3d 264, 2014-Ohio-542, 6 \nN.E.3d 23, \u00b6 6. Therefore, we have jurisdiction to address the merits of Kitchen\u2019s first \nassignment of error. \n{\u00b624} However, \u201can order denying a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds is \nnot a final appealable order * * *.\u201d  See State v. Payne, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 16CA3, Ross App. No. 18CA3640                                                                                        9 \n \n2016-Ohio-1411, and cases cited there.  Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to address \nthe merits of Kitchen\u2019s second assignment of error, which we dismiss.    \nB. Double Jeopardy \n{\u00b625} Kitchen asserts that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to \ndismiss, which was based on double-jeopardy grounds.  We apply a de novo standard \nof review to address the denial of that motion.  State v. Anderson, 148 Ohio St.3d 74, \n2016-Ohio-5791, 68 N.E.3d 790, \u00b6 20.   \n{\u00b626} The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice \nput in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d  This protection applies to Ohio citizens through the \nFourteenth Amendment and is additionally guaranteed by Article I, Section 10 of the \nOhio Constitution, and prohibits the state from subjecting a defendant to multiple trials \nfor the same offense.  See Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 38, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 \n(1978) as cited in Katz & Giannelli, Baldwin\u2019s Oh. Prac. Crim. L., Section 72:2 (3d \nEd.2018).   \n{\u00b627} Generally, \u201c[w]hen a trial court grants a criminal defendant\u2019s request for a \nmistrial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a retrial.\u201d  State v. Loza, 71 Ohio \nSt.3d 61, 70, 641 N.E.2d 1082 (1994), citing Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 673, \n102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982); Katz & Giannelli, Baldwin\u2019s Oh. Prac. Crim. L., \nSection 74:5 (3d Ed.2018) (\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has never been willing to \naccept a rigid rule that would automatically bar retrial under any circumstance following \na mistrial, holding, instead, that in most instances a mistrial granted with the consent or \non the motion of a defendant does not bar retrial under the Double Jeopardy Clause\u201d). Ross App. No. 18CA3640                                                                                        10 \n \n{\u00b628} Nevertheless, the United States and Ohio Supreme Courts have \nrecognized a narrow exception to the general rule exists when prosecutorial misconduct \ngiving rise to a successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke or goad the \ndefendant into moving for a mistrial.  Kennedy at 676, 679; Loza at 186.  This \ndetermination requires the trial court to examine the totality of the circumstances to \nmake a factual finding of the prosecutor\u2019s intent; it is entitled to great deference on \nappeal notwithstanding our general de novo review.  See, e.g., State v. Webster, 1st \nDist. Hamilton No. C-130700, 2014-Ohio-5647,\u00b6 10, citing Kennedy at 675; see also \nPhillips v. Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton Cty., Ohio, 668 F.3d 804, 812 (6th \nCir.2012) (\u201cAlthough we review the state proceedings de novo, we nevertheless find it \nappropriate to give deference to the trial court's factual finding regarding the intent of the \nprosecutor because it was in the best position to make the finding\u201d). \n{\u00b629} \u201cA reviewing court may consider the following factors in determining \nwhether the required intent to provoke a mistrial existed:  (1) whether there was a \nsequence of overreaching prior to the single prejudicial incident; (2) whether the \nprosecutor resisted or was surprised by the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial; and (3) the \nfindings of the trial and appellate courts concerning the intent of the prosecutor.\u201d  State \nv. Betts, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 88607, 2007-Ohio-5533, \u00b6 27, citing State v. Girts, 121 \nOhio App.3d 539, 553, 700 N.E.2d 395 (8th Dist. 1997); see also Kennedy at 680 \n(Powell, J., concurring); State v. Greene, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 02 CA 122, 2005-\nOhio-2420, \u00b6 24.  \n{\u00b630} In reviewing these factors here, we find no sequence of overreaching by \nthe prosecuting attorney before the single question concerning whether Officer Ross App. No. 18CA3640                                                                                        11 \n \nCampbell had asked Kitchen about any dreams he might have had.  The trial court had \npreviously determined that the state had failed to provide discovery of the 21 additional \nminutes of Officer Simmons\u2019s body camera footage, but the parties agreed, and the \ncourt found, that the discovery violation was unintentional and caused by the recording \nsystem used at the time.  See Betts at \u00b6 26, citing Girts at 553 (\u201cMere negligence will \nnot suffice to show intent to provoke a mistrial\u201d).  The next instance of misconduct that \nKitchen cites is when the assistant prosecutor asked Officer Campbell what statements \nKitchen had made about why he stayed at Howell\u2019s apartment the night before the \nincident.  But the trial court overruled his objection to this question, and the record does \nnot contain any evidence that would contradict that ruling\u2014the state represented that \nthis evidence was contained in the body camera footage that had been properly \ndisclosed to Kitchen in discovery.  Therefore, there was no sequence of overreaching \nby the prosecutor before the question that prompted the mistrial. \n{\u00b631} Moreover, even assuming that Kitchen could have established a sequence \nof overreaching before the conduct that resulted in the mistrial, the Supreme Court of \nthe United States held in Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, at 675-676, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 \nL.Ed.2d 416, that \u201c[p]rosecutorial conduct that might be viewed as harassment or \noverreaching, even if sufficient to justify a mistrial on defendant\u2019s motion * * * does not \nbar retrial absent intent on the part of the prosecutor to subvert the protections afforded \nby the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d  See also State v. Hodges, 2018-Ohio-447, 105 \nN.E.3d 543, \u00b6 18 (7th Dist.).  \n{\u00b632} Looking at the second factor, the record establishes that the state \nconsistently and vehemently resisted Kitchen\u2019s motions for mistrial.  And it apparently Ross App. No. 18CA3640                                                                                        12 \n \nwas genuinely surprised by the motion and the trial court\u2019s declaration of a mistrial.  The \nassistant prosecutor professed confusion over whether she was permitted to elicit \ntestimony concerning dreams when the substance of those same statements was \npreviously disclosed in discovery through police reports.  Although this did not prevent \nthe trial court\u2019s declaration of mistrial, the state\u2019s confusion and its resistance does \nindicate that the state was surprised by it.   \n{\u00b633} On the final factor the trial court found that although the prosecutor\u2019s \nviolation of its order warranted a mistrial, the solitary question to Officer Campbell \nconcerning Kitchen\u2019s dreams was not intended by the prosecutor to force a mistrial as a \nstrategic trial tactic.  This line of questioning concerned peripheral evidence that did not \nsubstantially detract from Kitchen\u2019s stated defense of consensual sex and his admission \nthat he had initially lied to the officers that he did not have sex with Howell.  Because \nthe trial court\u2019s conclusion on this issue is supported by the record, we accord it the \ndeference it is entitled to.  Webster, 2014-Ohio-5647, at \u00b6 10, citing Kennedy, 456 U.S. \n667, 675, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416. \n{\u00b634} Based on our de novo review we agree with the trial court that this case \ndoes not fit within \u201cthe narrow exception adopted by the United States Supreme Court in \nKennedy * * * reserved for the limited set of circumstances where the nature of the \nstate\u2019s misconduct clearly and unquestionably demonstrates its intent to cause or invite \na mistrial.\u201d  See State v. Kelly, 2015-Ohio-1948, 34 N.E.3d 513, \u00b6 19 (1st Dist.).1  We \noverrule Kitchen\u2019s first assignment of error. \n                                                           \n1 Although the parties assert that no Ohio case has ever found that this strict standard to prove a double-\njeopardy violation based upon prosecutorial misconduct was satisfied, our own research uncovered at \nleast one case.  In State v. Owens, 127 Ohio App.3d 65, 711 N.E.2d 767 (6th Dist.), an appellate court \nheld that the state goaded a defendant into seeking a mistrial when the prosecutor vigorously fought for Ross App. No. 18CA3640                                                                                        13 \n \nV. CONCLUSION \n{\u00b635} For lack of jurisdiction, we dismiss Kitchen\u2019s second assignment of error, \nwhich contests the denial of his motion to dismiss on constitutional speedy-trial grounds.  \nHaving overruled Kitchen\u2019s first assignment of error, we affirm the judgment of the trial \ncourt denying his motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds.     \nAPPEAL DISMISSED IN PART AND \nJUDGMENT AFFIRMED. \n \n  \n                                                           \nmore than three months and won the right to retain the confidentiality of an informant\u2019s identity, but the \nprosecutor then revealed the name of the informant during the state\u2019s opening statement.

However, we reject it because in general, there is no double-jeopardy bar to a retrial following a trial court's granting of a criminal defendant's motion for a mistrial. And he has not established the narrow exception to the general rule, which requires the request for a mistrial be\nprecipitated by prosecutorial misconduct that was intentionally calculated to cause or invite a mistrial.\n\n{\u00b64} Here, the state committed prosecutorial misconduct by violating the trial court\u2019s order barring it from introducing any evidence of what Kitchen said in recorded footage that was not disclosed to him before trial. However, there is no evidence that the state intended to cause a mistrial by asking an officer one question regarding a statement Kitchen made on the undisclosed footage. Specifically, (1) there was no sequence of overreaching before the single question; (2) the state resisted Kitchen\u2019s request for a mistrial and appeared genuinely surprised that it had violated the court\u2019s order; and (3) the trial court concluded that although the state had committed prosecutorial misconduct by eliciting testimony that violated its order, it was not the state\u2019s intent to cause the mistrial. We overrule Kitchen\u2019s first assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment denying the double-jeopardy motion to dismiss.\n\nI. FACTS\n\n{\u00b65} The Ross County Grand Jury returned a secret indictment charging Michael Kitchen with one count of sexual battery in violation of R.C. 2907.03, a third-degree felony. The Ross County Sheriff\u2019s Office arrested Kitchen and following his arraignment the next day, he was released from custody upon posting a recognizance bond. In its bill of particulars the state alleged that Kitchen engaged in vaginal intercourse with Sara Howell, who was not his spouse, when he knew that she was unaware that the act was being committed.\n\n{\u00b66} In its opening statement at the jury trial, the state asserted Sara Howell and her boyfriend let Kitchen, her high school friend, sleep over on a couch in their\napartment in Chillicothe after going to eat. After her boyfriend left the next morning for work, Howell awoke in her bedroom to discover that Kitchen was engaged in sex with her without her consent. Kitchen finished the sexual act, left the room, and went back to sleep on the couch in another room. After exchanging text messages with her father and a friend, Howell contacted the police, made a report, and was administered a rape kit. The testing determined that Kitchen\u2019s DNA was found in semen in both Howell\u2019s vaginal and anal cavities.\n\n{\u00b67} In Kitchen\u2019s counsel\u2019s opening statement, he contended that Kitchen and Howell engaged in consensual sex, which had been initiated by Howell. He further conceded that when Kitchen was awakened by three law enforcement officers responding to Howell\u2019s report of sexual battery, he lied that he did not have sex with Howell because he was terrified and did not know what Howell had told them.\n\n{\u00b68} The state\u2019s first witness, Chillicothe Police Officer Shane Simmons, testified that he and Officer Chip Campbell were dispatched to Howell\u2019s apartment to respond to a reported sexual assault. They talked to Howell and then entered the apartment, where they observed Kitchen asleep on a couch. Then they contacted Detective Twila Goble, who arrived and with Officer Campbell, they began questioning Kitchen after advising him of his Miranda rights. Officer Simmons\u2019s body camera was activated during his interaction with both Howell and Kitchen. On cross-examination Kitchen\u2019s attorney played the body camera footage that had been provided to him by the state in discovery. However, Officer Simmons testified that the footage shown was not the end of his body camera footage. He indicated he had viewed other footage from his body camera concerning the reported sexual battery.\nOutside the presence of the jury Officer Simmons explained that there was approximately 21 minutes of additional footage of Officer Campbell interrogating Kitchen that the police had failed to disclose to the prosecutor because the old body cameras would download footage to the server in multiple sections when it became too lengthy. Kitchen moved for a mistrial based on the state's failure to disclose this evidence in discovery. The trial court overruled Kitchen's motion, ordered the state to provide Kitchen with a copy of the undisclosed body camera footage, and continued the case until the next morning to permit Kitchen and his counsel to review the footage.\n\nThe next morning after receiving the previously undisclosed recording of Officer Simmons's body camera footage, Kitchen's attorney again asked for a mistrial, generally asserting that \u201cthere would have been different statements and procedure and strategy in this case had we been provided it.\u201d He claimed that even if this additional undisclosed footage was excluded, \u201cit still doesn't alleviate the issue that the jury knows a video exists and is not going to be play[ed] and I've made statements, or representations, that the video would be played * * *.\u201d Significantly, the parties and the trial court agreed that the state's failure to provide this footage to the defense was unintentional.\n\nThe state noted Officer Simmons's and Detective Gobles's statements in a Master Incident Report, which the state had provided to Kitchen and his counsel, referenced several of Kitchen's statements from the undisclosed body camera footage: (1) Kitchen told the officers that he did not remember having sex with Sara; (2) Kitchen told Officer Campbell he had a dream last night about having sex with his girlfriend; and\n(3) Kitchen stated that his girlfriend had told him that he had groped her in his sleep before.\n\n{\u00b612} The trial court denied Kitchen\u2019s second motion for mistrial because: (1) despite his concession that he initially told police he did not have sex with Howell, Kitchen\u2019s defense of consensual sex was consistent with what both the undisclosed and disclosed portion of Officer Simmons\u2019s body camera footage revealed; (2) portions of the undisclosed body camera footage were disclosed to Kitchen in the police reports the state gave to the defense in discovery; and (3) although there were discrepancies and inconsistencies created by the state\u2019s Crim.R. 16 violation, they were not substantially material to Kitchen\u2019s defense.\n\n{\u00b613} Nevertheless, the trial court prohibited the state \u201cfrom utilizing any portion of the undiscovered video in any way, shape or form,\u201d but permitted the defense to use it in any way it felt necessary. The court finally noted that it had not had an opportunity to review the undisclosed footage, but that it would reserve further ruling until the court had the chance to compare it with the reports that were provided in discovery.\n\n{\u00b614} Upon return from recess the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[b]ased upon the State\u2019s failure, not the defense, * * * to provide the remainder of the video, this Court has ruled that the undisclosed portion will not be admitted into evidence. Therefore, you are not to draw any inference that the Defendant has failed to produce the remainder of the video * * *.\u201d The parties then concluded their examination of Officer Simmons.\n\n{\u00b615} On the state\u2019s direct examination of its next witness, Officer Campbell, it questioned him about statements Kitchen had made addressing why he stayed at\nHowell\u2019s apartment that night. Apparently, Kitchen told the officers that he and Howell had been friends for a while and they had not spoken for some time. Kitchen\u2019s counsel objected to this testimony on the basis that it had not been disclosed in discovery, but the state countered that Kitchen\u2019s statement was contained on the disclosed body camera footage. The trial court overruled the objection, but again warned the state that \u201cif this officer testified about anything said only on the undisclosed portion, that is a violation of my order and if he violates my order or any other officer violates my order, I will grant a mistrial.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, the state asked Officer Campbell \u201cwhen you were speaking with the Defendant in this case, did you happen to ask him about any dreams he might have had?\u201d and the officer responded that he had. Kitchen objected and moved for a mistrial.\n\nThe assistant prosecutor opposed the motion and stated that it was her understanding that she was permitted to ask about statements that were on the undisclosed part of the body camera footage if they were in fact contained in the police reports provided in discovery. Kitchen\u2019s statement about the dream was on both the undisclosed footage and the disclosed police reports. The assistant prosecutor stated that it was not her intent to violate the court\u2019s order and moved to strike her question and Officer Campbell\u2019s answer, and release the witness. The trial court noted that it did not understand how the assistant prosecutor had misinterpreted its order; it granted the mistrial. In its entry declaring the mistrial the court noted that it initially overruled Kitchen\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on the state\u2019s violation of Crim.R. 16, but granted Kitchen\u2019s renewed motion when the state violated the court\u2019s curative order.\nSubsequently, the trial court set the retrial date. Over four months after the mistrial and two months after rescheduling of the trial Kitchen filed motions to dismiss based on double-jeopardy and his constitutional speedy-trial rights. Kitchen claimed that the state intentionally goaded him to request a mistrial because of its prosecutorial misconduct and that the over five-month delay between the mistrial and the scheduled retrial was constitutionally unreasonable. The state responded.\n\nAfter the state responded the trial court denied Kitchen\u2019s motions to dismiss in two separate entries issued on the same date. Addressing double jeopardy the court concluded that \u201c[a]lthough this Court cannot understand how his ruling was misinterpreted by the Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, this Court cannot find that the offending question was designed to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial. It certainly was prosecutorial misconduct, but this Court cannot find that it was the intention of the Assistant Prosecuting Attorney to cause a mistrial.\u201d On the constitutional speedy-trial claim the court concluded \u201cthe five month delay in rescheduling the Defendant\u2019s trial does not constitute presumptive prejudice\u201d and \u201c[e]ven in considering the four factor balancing test this Court cannot determine that the five month delay is constitutionally unreasonable.\u201d\n\nII. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\nKitchen assigns the following errors for our review:\n\n1. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING DEFENDANT-APPELLANT MICHAEL KITCHEN\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS ON DOUBLE JEOPARDY GROUNDS.\n\n2. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING DEFENDANT-APPELLANT MICHAEL KITCHEN\u2019S MOTION TO DISMISS ON SPEEDY TRIAL GROUNDS.\nIII. LAW AND ANALYSIS\n\nA. Jurisdiction\n\n{\u00b621} Kitchen contests the trial court\u2019s entries denying his motions to dismiss on double-jeopardy and constitutional speedy-trial claims. Before addressing the merits of the assignments of error, we must determine whether this appeal is properly before us. Although the parties do not suggest that we lack jurisdiction, \u201clitigants cannot vest a court with subject-matter jurisdiction by agreement\u201d; subject-matter jurisdiction is properly raised by an appellate court sua sponte. See Cheap Escape Co., Inc. v. Haddox, L.L.C., 120 Ohio St.3d 493, 2008-Ohio-6323, 900 N.E.2d 601, \u00b6 22; State ex rel. Dunlap v. Sarko, 135 Ohio St.3d 171, 2013-Ohio-67, 985 N.E.2d 450, \u00b6 13.\n\n{\u00b622} Courts of appeals have \u201csuch jurisdiction as may be provided by law to review and affirm, modify, or reverse judgments or final orders of the courts of record inferior to the court of appeals within the district.\u201d Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 3(B)(2). \u201cR.C. 2505.03(A) limits the appellate jurisdiction of courts of appeals to the review of final orders, judgments, or decrees.\u201d See State ex rel. Bd. of State Teachers Retirement Sys. of Ohio v. Davis, 113 Ohio St.3d 410, 2007-Ohio-2205, 865 N.E.2d 1289, \u00b6 44.\n\n{\u00b623} Clearly \u201cthe denial of a motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds is a final, appealable order.\u201d State v. Anderson, 138 Ohio St.3d 264, 2014-Ohio-542, 6 N.E.3d 23, \u00b6 6. Therefore, we have jurisdiction to address the merits of Kitchen\u2019s first assignment of error.\n\n{\u00b624} However, \u201can order denying a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds is not a final appealable order ***.\u201d See State v. Payne, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 16CA3,\n2016-Ohio-1411, and cases cited there. Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to address the merits of Kitchen's second assignment of error, which we dismiss.\n\nB. Double Jeopardy\n\n{\u00b625} Kitchen asserts that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss, which was based on double-jeopardy grounds. We apply a de novo standard of review to address the denial of that motion. State v. Anderson, 148 Ohio St.3d 74, 2016-Ohio-5791, 68 N.E.3d 790, \u00b6 20.\n\n{\u00b626} The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d This protection applies to Ohio citizens through the Fourteenth Amendment and is additionally guaranteed by Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution, and prohibits the state from subjecting a defendant to multiple trials for the same offense. See Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 38, 98 S.Ct. 2156, 57 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978) as cited in Katz & Giannelli, Baldwin\u2019s Oh. Prac. Crim. L., Section 72:2 (3d Ed.2018).\n\n{\u00b627} Generally, \u201c[w]hen a trial court grants a criminal defendant's request for a mistrial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a retrial.\u201d State v. Loza, 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 70, 641 N.E.2d 1082 (1994), citing Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 673, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982); Katz & Giannelli, Baldwin\u2019s Oh. Prac. Crim. L., Section 74:5 (3d Ed.2018) (\u201cThe United States Supreme Court has never been willing to accept a rigid rule that would automatically bar retrial under any circumstance following a mistrial, holding, instead, that in most instances a mistrial granted with the consent or on the motion of a defendant does not bar retrial under the Double Jeopardy Clause\u201d).\nNevertheless, the United States and Ohio Supreme Courts have recognized a narrow exception to the general rule exists when prosecutorial misconduct giving rise to a successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke or goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial. *Kennedy* at 676, 679; *Loza* at 186. This determination requires the trial court to examine the totality of the circumstances to make a factual finding of the prosecutor\u2019s intent; it is entitled to great deference on appeal notwithstanding our general de novo review. See, e.g., *State v. Webster*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-130700, 2014-Ohio-5647, \u00b6 10, citing *Kennedy* at 675; see also *Phillips v. Court of Common Pleas, Hamilton Cty., Ohio*, 668 F.3d 804, 812 (6th Cir.2012) (\u201cAlthough we review the state proceedings de novo, we nevertheless find it appropriate to give deference to the trial court's factual finding regarding the intent of the prosecutor because it was in the best position to make the finding\u201d).\n\n\u201cA reviewing court may consider the following factors in determining whether the required intent to provoke a mistrial existed: (1) whether there was a sequence of overreaching prior to the single prejudicial incident; (2) whether the prosecutor resisted or was surprised by the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial; and (3) the findings of the trial and appellate courts concerning the intent of the prosecutor.\u201d *State v. Betts*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 88607, 2007-Ohio-5533, \u00b6 27, citing *State v. Girts*, 121 Ohio App.3d 539, 553, 700 N.E.2d 395 (8th Dist. 1997); see also *Kennedy* at 680 (Powell, J., concurring); *State v. Greene*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 02 CA 122, 2005-Ohio-2420, \u00b6 24.\n\nIn reviewing these factors here, we find no sequence of overreaching by the prosecuting attorney before the single question concerning whether Officer\nCampbell had asked Kitchen about any dreams he might have had. The trial court had previously determined that the state had failed to provide discovery of the 21 additional minutes of Officer Simmons's body camera footage, but the parties agreed, and the court found, that the discovery violation was unintentional and caused by the recording system used at the time. See Betts at \u00b6 26, citing Girts at 553 (\u201cMere negligence will not suffice to show intent to provoke a mistrial\u201d). The next instance of misconduct that Kitchen cites is when the assistant prosecutor asked Officer Campbell what statements Kitchen had made about why he stayed at Howell's apartment the night before the incident. But the trial court overruled his objection to this question, and the record does not contain any evidence that would contradict that ruling\u2014the state represented that this evidence was contained in the body camera footage that had been properly disclosed to Kitchen in discovery. Therefore, there was no sequence of overreaching by the prosecutor before the question that prompted the mistrial.\n\nMoreover, even assuming that Kitchen could have established a sequence of overreaching before the conduct that resulted in the mistrial, the Supreme Court of the United States held in Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, at 675-676, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416, that \u201c[p]rosecutorial conduct that might be viewed as harassment or overreaching, even if sufficient to justify a mistrial on defendant\u2019s motion * * * does not bar retrial absent intent on the part of the prosecutor to subvert the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d See also State v. Hodges, 2018-Ohio-447, 105 N.E.3d 543, \u00b6 18 (7th Dist.).\n\nLooking at the second factor, the record establishes that the state consistently and vehemently resisted Kitchen's motions for mistrial. And it apparently\nwas genuinely surprised by the motion and the trial court\u2019s declaration of a mistrial. The assistant prosecutor professed confusion over whether she was permitted to elicit testimony concerning dreams when the substance of those same statements was previously disclosed in discovery through police reports. Although this did not prevent the trial court\u2019s declaration of mistrial, the state's confusion and its resistance does indicate that the state was surprised by it.\n\n{\u00b633} On the final factor the trial court found that although the prosecutor\u2019s violation of its order warranted a mistrial, the solitary question to Officer Campbell concerning Kitchen\u2019s dreams was not intended by the prosecutor to force a mistrial as a strategic trial tactic. This line of questioning concerned peripheral evidence that did not substantially detract from Kitchen\u2019s stated defense of consensual sex and his admission that he had initially lied to the officers that he did not have sex with Howell. Because the trial court's conclusion on this issue is supported by the record, we accord it the deference it is entitled to.

In State v. Owens, 127 Ohio App.3d 65, 711 N.E.2d 767 (6th Dist.), an appellate court held that the state goaded a defendant into seeking a mistrial when the prosecutor vigorously fought for\nV. CONCLUSION\n\n{\u00b635} For lack of jurisdiction, we dismiss Kitchen\u2019s second assignment of error, which contests the denial of his motion to dismiss on constitutional speedy-trial grounds. Having overruled Kitchen\u2019s first assignment of error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court denying his motion to dismiss on double-jeopardy grounds.\n\nAPPEAL DISMISSED IN PART AND\nJUDGMENT AFFIRMED.\n\nmore than three months and won the right to retain the confidentiality of an informant\u2019s identity, but the prosecutor then revealed the name of the informant during the state\u2019s opening statement.

Glass (\u201cGlass\u201d) brings this appeal from \nthe judgment of the Paulding County Court finding him guilty of one count of \nfalsification and sentencing him to 20 days in jail and a $300 fine.  Glass argues on \nappeal that the State provided an inadequate bill of particulars and that the trial court \nerred by excluding exculpatory evidence.  For the reasons set forth below, the \njudgment is affirmed. \n{\u00b62} On April 26, 2017, Glass was charged by complaint with one count of \nFalsification in violation of R.C. 2921.13(A)(2), a misdemeanor of the first degree.    \nGlass filed a request for a bill of particulars on May 11, 2017.  The State filed its \nresponse on January 19, 2018, with an amended response filed on April 27, 2018.  \nOn July 12, 2017, Glass filed a motion for a handwriting expert to be appointed.  \nThe motion was granted and the expert\u2019s findings were that although there were \nsome similarities, the evidence was far from conclusive.   \n{\u00b63} A jury trial was held on May 2, 2018, and the jury found Glass guilty.  \nOn June 4, 2018, Glass was sentenced to 20 days in jail and a $300 fine.  Glass then \nfiled a timely notice of appeal.  On appeal, Glass raises the following assignments \nof error. \nFirst Assignment of Error \n \nThe trial court erred in failing to grant [Glass\u2019] pretrial motion \n[to] dismiss based upon an inadequate bill of particulars and an  \nCase No. 11-18-07 \n \n \n-3- \n \namended bill of particulars that was filed by the State without \nleave of the court. \n \nSecond Assignment of Error \n \nThe trial court erred in excluding exculpatory evidence pursuant \nto Evidence Rule 801. \n \nThird Assignment of Error \n \nThe trial court erred in excluding exculpatory evidence pursuant \nto Evidence Rule 403(A). \n \nFourth Assignment of Error \n \nThe trial court denied [Glass] a fair trial by excluding exculpatory \nevidence and allowing the trial to proceed despite not granting \nleave to file an amended bill of particulars. \n \nBill of Particulars \n{\u00b64} In the first assignment of error, Glass claims that the trial court erred by \nfailing to dismiss the case due to the State\u2019s filing both an inadequate bill of \nparticulars and then filing a subsequent bill of particulars without leave of the trial \ncourt.  The assignment of error raises the question of what the appropriate remedy \nis if an inadequate bill of particulars is filed.  Initially, this Court notes that Glass \ndid not raise this issue before the trial court by complaining about the adequacy of \nthe initial bill of particulars.  No motion to dismiss was ever filed with the trial court.  \nInstead, Glass merely raised the issue of the filing of the amended bill of particulars \nwithout permission of the court at the beginning of the trial.  Although Glass argued  \nCase No. 11-18-07 \n \n \n-4- \n \nthat this might be inappropriate, he did not request that the matter be dismissed or \nthat a continuance be granted when he addressed the trial court.  Tr. 31-33. \nThe purpose of a bill of particulars is \u201cto clarify the allegations in \nthe indictment so that the accused may know with what he is \ncharged in order to prepare his defense.\u201d  Foutty v. Maxwell, 174 \nOhio St. 35, 38 (1962).  \u201cAlthough Crim.R. 7 provides a criminal \ndefendant with the right to obtain a bill of particulars, the failure \nto provide such does not automatically constitute reversible \nerror.\u201d  State v. Ray , 12 th Dist. No. CA2009-06-022, 2010-Ohio-\n2434, \u001f 11.  \u201cAn appellate court may only reverse a conviction for \na failure to provide a timely requested bill of particulars if \nappellant demonstrates that his \u2018lack of knowledge concerning \nthe specific facts a bill of particulars would have provided him \nactually prejudiced him in his ability to fairly defend himself.\u2019\u201d  \nId. quoting State v. Chinn, 85 Ohio St.3d 548, 569 (1999). \n \nState v. Shirley , 12 th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-07-127, 2013-Ohio-1948, \u001f 20.  \nWhen no bill of particulars or an inadequate bill of particulars is filed, a defendant \nshould file a motion to compel compliance with the request.  Id. at \u001f21.  \u201cBecause \na request for a bill of particulars, like a demand for discovery, is filed with the court \nbut made directly to the prosecutor, the defendant is required to bring the state\u2019s \nfailure to respond to the trial court\u2019s attention at a time when the error can be \nremedied.\u201d  State v. Sims , 9th Dist. No. 94CA005797, 1994 WL 581408 (Oct. 19, \n1994).  A defendant waives any claim of error regarding the inadequacy of the bill \nof particulars by proceeding to trial without bringing the matter to the attention of \nthe trial court.  Shirly, supra at \u001f 23.  Since Glass did not raise the compliance of \nthe State with the request for a bill of particulars in a timely manner with the trial  \nCase No. 11-18-07 \n \n \n-5- \n \ncourt, he has waived the right to raise it now.  For this reason, the first assignment \nof error is overruled. \nExclusion of Evidence \n{\u00b65} In the second and third assignments of error, Glass claims that the trial \ncourt erred by excluding evidence.  The admission of evidence is left to the sound \ndiscretion of the trial court.  State v. Trimble, 122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, \n911 N.E.2d 242, \u001f 104.  The trial court\u2019s judgment shall not be reversed absent a \nshowing that the trial court abused its discretion.  State v. Thompson, 3d Dist. Henry \nNo. 7-16-10, 2017-Ohio-792, 85 N.E.3d 1108, \u001f 18.  \u201cAn abuse of discretion is \nmore than an error of judgment; rather, it implies that the trial court's decision was \nunreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.\u201d  Id.  Glass argues that the trial court\u2019s \ndecision to exclude portions of a video were contradictory to the Rules of Evidence.  \nIn the second assignment of error, Glass argues that he should have been permitted \nto show the video because Evidence Rule 806 allows one to impeach a witness with \nprior inconsistent statements.  There is no dispute that the Rules of Evidence allow \nfor impeachment of a witness through the use of inconsistent statements.  However, \na review of the transcript shows that Glass was playing the video for more than three \nminutes without asking any questions.  Tr. 115.  When the State objected, Glass\u2019s \nattorney asked the witness \u201cDo you recall saying in the interview that you didn\u2019t \nknow who, who Jim Glass was?  At the time of the signing of these documents on \nJuly 6th?\u201d  Tr. 116.  After that question, the following dialogue occurred.  \nCase No. 11-18-07 \n \n \n-6- \n \n[Witness]:  As I explained earlier in my testimony, the individual \nthat represented himself to me to be James Glass is the same \nindividual that\u2019s sitting here.  I don\u2019t know that that is indeed \nJames Glass, unless someone says yes, this conclusively is him; I \ndidn\u2019t know it at the time in the divorce proceeding either.  I still, \nunless someone tells me that\u2019s James Glass I don\u2019t know.  But I \nknow that the individual that signed the mortgage, signed the \nother documents was James Glass that\u2019s sitting here if that\u2019s who \nyou\u2019re identifying it is.   \n \n[Attorney]:  Sir do you realize under 147.53 of the Ohio Revised \nCode that a person acknowledge ah, acknowledging ah, a \nsignature ah has to be known to that person or there has to be \nsatisfactory evidence that that person acknowledging that is the \nperson described in and who executed the instrument.  At that \npoint you\u2019re saying you didn\u2019t know for certain who James Glass \nwas and did not ask for a driver\u2019s license. \n \n[Witness]:  No, that\u2019s incorrect. \n \n[Attorney]:  Ok \n \n[Witness]:  I based it on Jim, this individual coming to my office \nand presenting a check and providing the information for BP that \nhe was indeed James Glass, he introduced himself to me as James \nGlass.  This same individual then met with me outside the \ncourtroom during his divorce proceedings and again the case was \ncalled as James Glass.  Mr. Troth was there and so was his wife, \nbased on all of those things I believe that this indeed was James \nGlass.  That\u2019s why I took his signature and notarized it. \n \nTr. 116-17.  At no time during the questioning did Glass attempt to use the video to \nimpeach the witness with an inconsistent statement.  Glass does not indicate any \nspecific statement that he wished to use to impeach the witness.  Given that Glass \ndoes not point to any specific error and apparently was able to question the witness  \nCase No. 11-18-07 \n \n \n-7- \n \nabout the believed inconsistency, this court does not find any error.  The second \nassignment of error is overruled. \n{\u00b66} Glass argues in the third assignment of error that the trial court erred by \nexcluding Ex. D, which was a check in which Glass\u2019 ex-wife signed his name.  The \ncheck was excluded because there was no expert to compare the signature on the \ncheck with the signature on the mortgage.  Glass argues that pursuant to the holding \nin Bell v. Brewster, 44 Ohio St.690, 10 N.E. 679 (1887), the check should have been \nadmitted even without an expert\u2019s analysis of the signatures.  However, the holding \nof Bell does not leave the issue of comparing handwriting to just any non-expert.  \nInstead it held that a non-expert is permitted to compare a genuine sample of one\u2019s \nhandwriting with a handwriting in question if the non-expert has first-hand \nknowledge of the alleged author\u2019s handwriting.  Id.  There is no question that Glass\u2019 \nex-wife signed the check shown in Ex. D as she testified to such.  However, the jury \nwas not familiar with either her handwriting or Glass\u2019 handwriting.  Thus, the \nholding of Bell does not require the admission of the exhibit.  The record does not \npersuade this Court that the trial court\u2019s determination to exclude the admission of \nthe exhibit was an abuse of discretion.  The third assignment of error is overruled. \nCumulative Error \n{\u00b67} Finally, Glass argues that the cumulative errors of the trial court denied \nhim a fair trial.  Under the doctrine of cumulative error \u201ca conviction will be \nreversed when the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of a fair  \nCase No. 11-18-07 \n \n \n-8- \n \ntrial even though each of the numerous instances of trial-court error does not \nindividually constitute cause for reversal.\u201d  State v. Powell , 132 Ohio St.3d 233, \n2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, \u001f 223.  This doctrine does not apply absent \nmultiple instances of harmless error.  State v. Wesson, 137 Ohio St.3d 309, 2013-\nOhio-4575, 999 N.E.2d 557, \u001f 88.  Having found no errors in the prior assignments, \nthis Court does not find that multiple instances of harmless error occurred in this \ncase.  Thus, the doctrine of cumulative error does not apply and the fourth \nassignment of error is overruled. \n{\u00b68} Having found no prejudicial error in the particulars assigned and \nargued, the judgment of the Paulding County Court is affirmed. \nJudgment Affirmed \nZIMMERMAN and SHAW, J.J., concur. \n/hls \n \n \n ", "case_juv": "0", "case_crim": "0", "case_2001": "0", "case_app": "0", "case_pros": "0", "aoe_none": "0", "aoe_grandjury": "0", "aoe_court": "0", "aoe_defense": "0", "aoe_procbar": "1", "aoe_prochist": "0", "case_timeframe": "0", "other": "342    0\nName: other, dtype: int64", "olmocr_text": "IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\nTHIRD APPELLATE DISTRICT\nPAULDING COUNTY\n\nSTATE OF OHIO,\n\nPLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,\n\nv.\n\nJAMES A.

For this reason, the first assignment of error is overruled.\n\nExclusion of Evidence\n\nIn the second and third assignments of error, Glass claims that the trial court erred by excluding evidence. The admission of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Trimble, 122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, 104. The trial court\u2019s judgment shall not be reversed absent a showing that the trial court abused its discretion. State v. Thompson, 3d Dist.

Glass argues that the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude portions of a video were contradictory to the Rules of Evidence.

However, a review of the transcript shows that Glass was playing the video for more than three minutes without asking any questions. Tr. 115. When the State objected, Glass\u2019s attorney asked the witness \u201cDo you recall saying in the interview that you didn\u2019t know who, who Jim Glass was? At the time of the signing of these documents on July 6th?\u201d Tr. 116. After that question, the following dialogue occurred.\n[Witness]: As I explained earlier in my testimony, the individual that represented himself to me to be James Glass is the same individual that\u2019s sitting here. I don\u2019t know that that is indeed James Glass, unless someone says yes, this conclusively is him; I didn\u2019t know it at the time in the divorce proceeding either. I still, unless someone tells me that\u2019s James Glass I don\u2019t know. But I know that the individual that signed the mortgage, signed the other documents was James Glass that\u2019s sitting here if that\u2019s who you\u2019re identifying it is.\n\n[Attorney]: Sir do you realize under 147.53 of the Ohio Revised Code that a person acknowledge ah, acknowledging ah, a signature ah has to be known to that person or there has to be satisfactory evidence that that person acknowledging that is the person described in and who executed the instrument. At that point you\u2019re saying you didn\u2019t know for certain who James Glass was and did not ask for a driver\u2019s license.\n\n[Witness]: No, that\u2019s incorrect.\n\n[Attorney]: Ok\n\n[Witness]: I based it on Jim, this individual coming to my office and presenting a check and providing the information for BP that he was indeed James Glass, he introduced himself to me as James Glass. This same individual then met with me outside the courtroom during his divorce proceedings and again the case was called as James Glass. Mr. Troth was there and so was his wife, based on all of those things I believe that this indeed was James Glass. That\u2019s why I took his signature and notarized it.\n\nTr. 116-17. At no time during the questioning did Glass attempt to use the video to impeach the witness with an inconsistent statement. Glass does not indicate any specific statement that he wished to use to impeach the witness. Given that Glass does not point to any specific error and apparently was able to question the witness\nabout the believed inconsistency, this court does not find any error. The second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n{\u00b66} Glass argues in the third assignment of error that the trial court erred by excluding Ex. D, which was a check in which Glass\u2019 ex-wife signed his name. The check was excluded because there was no expert to compare the signature on the check with the signature on the mortgage. Glass argues that pursuant to the holding in Bell v. Brewster, 44 Ohio St.690, 10 N.E. 679 (1887), the check should have been admitted even without an expert\u2019s analysis of the signatures. However, the holding of Bell does not leave the issue of comparing handwriting to just any non-expert. Instead it held that a non-expert is permitted to compare a genuine sample of one\u2019s handwriting with a handwriting in question if the non-expert has first-hand knowledge of the alleged author\u2019s handwriting. Id. There is no question that Glass\u2019 ex-wife signed the check shown in Ex. D as she testified to such. However, the jury was not familiar with either her handwriting or Glass\u2019 handwriting. Thus, the holding of Bell does not require the admission of the exhibit. The record does not persuade this Court that the trial court\u2019s determination to exclude the admission of the exhibit was an abuse of discretion. The third assignment of error is overruled.\n\nCumulative Error\n\n{\u00b67} Finally, Glass argues that the cumulative errors of the trial court denied him a fair trial. Under the doctrine of cumulative error \u201ca conviction will be reversed when the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of a fair\ntrial even though each of the numerous instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute cause for reversal.\u201d State v. Powell, 132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, 223. This doctrine does not apply absent multiple instances of harmless error. State v.

No. 28953 \n \n \n \nAPPEAL FROM JUDGMENT \nENTERED IN THE \nCOURT OF COMMON PLEAS \nCOUNTY OF SUMMIT, OHIO \nCASE No. CR-2012-12-3669 \n \nDECISION AND JOURNAL ENTRY \n \nDated: December 19, 2018 \n             \n \nSCHAFER, Presiding Judge. \n{\u00b61} Appellant, Bryan S. Sparks, appeals th e decision of the Summit County Court of \nCommon Pleas denying his motion to compel.  For the reasons that follow, this Court affirms.    \nI. \n{\u00b62} This matter originated with a December 2002 indictment charging Mr. Sparks \nwith multiple sex offenses.  This Court previously summarized in part the lengthy procedural \nhistory as follows: \nFollowing a trial to the bench in 2004, th e trial court found Mr. Sparks guilty of \ntwo counts of rape, two count s of corruption of a minor , and one count of illegal \nuse or possession of drug para phernalia.  It sentenced him to life in prison and \nadjudicated him a sexual predator under Revised Code Section 2950.09.  This \nCourt upheld his convictions on appeal, but  remanded for resentencing on one of \nthe rape counts.  The trial court resentenced him on that count in June 2005. \n \nIn January 2010, Mr. Sparks petitioned for post-conviction relief.  In its brief \nopposing the petition, the State pointed out that the trial court had incorrectly \nimposed post-release control when it sentenced Mr. Sparks.  It argued that his \nsentence, therefore, was void, which made his petition premature.  In March 2010, \nthe trial court resentenced Mr. Sparks, correcting the post-release control error 2 \n          \n \nand imposing the same prison terms as before.  It also classified him as a Tier III \nsex offender under the Adam Walsh Act.  On  appeal, this Court affirmed in part \nand reversed in part, explaining that, under State v. Fischer , 128 Ohio St.3d 92, \n2010-Ohio-6238, the trial court di d not have authority to assign Mr. Sparks a sex \noffender classification.  On remand, the trial court corrected its entry. \n \nIn October 2011, Mr. Sparks petitioned for post-conviction relief, arguing that his \ntrial counsel was ineffective.  The trial court denied his petiti on as untimely.  Mr. \nSparks moved for reconsideration, but th e trial court denied his motion.  Mr. \nSparks did not appeal either of the trial court\u2019s decisions. \n \nState v. Sparks, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27292, 2014-Ohio-5017, \u00b6 2-5 (\u201cSparks III\u201d).  \n{\u00b63} In February of 2014, Mr. Sparks moved th e trial court to correct his sentence \nraising multiple issues, and the trial court denied his motion.  Mr. Sparks appealed the trial \ncourt\u2019s denial of his motion to correct his sentence and argued that the trial court erred by not \nholding a hearing on his motion and not making sp ecific findings of fact and conclusions of law \nin its journal entry.  Sparks III at \u00b6 6.  We determined that the trial court properly treated Mr. \nSparks\u2019s motion to correct his sentence as a successive motion for postconviction relief and \ncorrectly determined that it lacked authority to grant the motion.  Id. at \u00b6 9.  We also concluded \nthat the trial court had no duty to hold a hearing or issue findings of fact or conclusions of law on \nMr. Sparks\u2019s successive or untimely petition for postconviction relief.  Id. at \u00b6 10.  We overruled \nall of Mr. Sparks\u2019s assignments of error and affirmed the judgment in that appeal.  Id. at \u00b6 11.  \n{\u00b64} Following our November 12, 2014 decision in Sparks III , Mr. Sparks filed \nnumerous motions and requests in the trial court.  He also filed two attempted appeals, which this \nCourt dismissed.  On May 11, 2017, Mr. Sparks filed a motion captioned \u201cmotion to compel\u201d \nwherein he challenged his sentence and alleged the denial of due pro cess.  The trial court \nsummarily denied this motion in a journal entry dated January 17, 2018.  Mr. Sparks now \nappeals that ruling, presenting four assignments of error for our review.  For ease of analysis, we \nelect to address those assignments of error together.          3 \n          \n \nII. \nAssignment of Error I \nThe trial court erred when it sentenced [Mr. Sparks] using SB2 guidelines on \ncount one when documentation shows th at HB511 guidelines must be used \nviolating [Mr. Sparks\u2019s] right to due process in accordance with the Sixth \nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution[.] \n \nAssignment of Error II \nThe trial court erred when it sentenced [Mr. Sparks] to life in regards to a \ncriminal element that was never mentioned in the original complaint nor was \nit mentioned during the current sentencing nor is it stated anywhere in the \nsentencing transcripts or in the sentencing journal entry violating [Mr. \nSparks\u2019s] right to due process in accordance with the Sixth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution[.]  \n \nAssignment of Error III \nThe trial court erred several times when it failed to appoint trial and \nappellate counsel competent to handle [Mr. Sparks\u2019s] case and appeals \nviolating the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution[.] \n \nAssignment of Error IV \nThe trial court erred when it failed to state the findings of facts and \nconclusions of law when it denied [Mr. Sparks\u2019s] motion to compel several \nmonths after the time had r[u]n out to rule on that moti on violating [Mr. \nSparks\u2019s] right to due process in accordance with the Sixth and Fourteenth \nAmendments to the United States Constitution[.]  \n \n{\u00b65} Mr. Sparks\u2019s first three assignments of error relate to the trial court\u2019s denial of his \nmotion to compel. The fourth assignment of error challenges that the trial court erred when it \nfailed to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law in the journal entry denying that motion.  \n{\u00b66} In his motion to compel, Mr. Sparks argued that he was improperly sentenced \nbased on the wrong statute and an element not include d in the indictment.  He also contends that \nhe was denied due process base d on alleged prosecutorial misconduc t and ineffective assistance \nof counsel.  \u201c\u2018A vaguely titled motion * * * may be construed as a pe tition for post-conviction 4 \n          \n \nrelief under R.C. 2953.21(A)(1) where (1) the motion was filed subsequent to a direct appeal, (2) \nclaimed a denial of constitutional rights, (3) sought to render the judgment void [or voidable], \nand (4) asked for a vacation of the judgment and sentence.\u2019\u201d  State v. Gordon, 9th Dist. Summit \nNo. 29009, 2018-Ohio-4311, \u00b6 5, quoting State v. Davis , 9th Dist. Medina No. 15C0004-M, \n2015-Ohio-5182, \u00b6 6.  We conclude that Mr. Sp arks\u2019s motion meets these requirements.  \nAccordingly, we construe his motion to compel as a petition for postconviction relief.   \n{\u00b67} R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) provides that a trial c ourt may entertain a successive petition \nfor postconviction relief only when the following criteria are met:        \n(a) Either the petitioner shows that the petitioner was unavoidably prevented from \ndiscovery of the facts upon which the petitione r must rely to present the claim for \nrelief, or, subsequent to the period pr escribed in division (A)(2) of section \n2953.21 of the Revised Code or to the f iling of an earlier petition, the United \nStates Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies \nretroactively to persons in the petitioner\u2019s situation, and the petition asserts a \nclaim based on that right. \n \n(b) The petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that, but for \nconstitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found the \npetitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted * * *.  \n \nMr. Sparks\u2019s motion, being a successive petition for postconviction relief, \u201cdid not offer an \nexplanation regarding why he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts upon which \nhis petition was based, nor did it identify a retroactive right that has been recognized by the \nUnited States Supreme Court.\u201d  State v. Wright, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27880, 2016-Ohio-3542, \u00b6 \n9.  Thus, we conclude that the trial court lacked authority to consider the merits of Mr. Sparks\u2019s \nsuccessive petition and, therefore, did not err by denying his motion.  Mr. Sparks\u2019s first, second, \nand third assignments of error are overruled. 5 \n          \n \n{\u00b68} Additionally, we must address Mr. Sparks\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by \nfailing to include findings of fact and conclusions of law in its denial of his motion.  As this \nCourt stated in Sparks III,  \nthe Ohio Supreme Court has held that a trial court \u201chas no duty to issue findings \nof fact and conclusions of law on successive or untimely petitions for \npostconviction relief.\u201d  State ex rel. George v. Burnside , 118 Ohio St.3d 406, \n2008-Ohio-2702, \u00b6 6.   \n \nSparks III at \u00b6 10.  Here again we conclude that the trial court was not obligated to issue findings \nof fact or conclusions of law.  Mr. Sparks\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled. \nIII. \n{\u00b69} All four of Mr. Sparks\u2019s assignments of error are overruled.  The judgment of the \nSummit County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.  \nJudgment affirmed. \n \n  \n \n There were reasonable grounds for this appeal. \n We order that a special mandate issue out of this Court, directing the Court of Common \nPleas, County of Summit, State of Ohio, to carry this judgment into execution.

Two issues are raised in this appeal.  The first is whether the trial court abused its \ndiscretion in dismissing the petition.  The second issue is whether the trial court properly \nmade findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by R.C . 2953.21(D) when it \ndismissed the petition.  For the reasons expressed below, the t rial court\u2019s decision is \naffirmed. \nStatement of the Facts and Case \n{\u00b62} The following facts are taken from our direct appeal in State v. Heckathorn, \n7th Dist. Columbiana No. 17 CO 0011, 2019-Ohio-1086. \n{\u00b63} On Sunday, March 8, 2015, a distressed man appeared at the Columbiana \nCounty Sheriff's Department to report that his neighbor, Daniel  Landsberger, confessed \nto killing a black male. \n{\u00b64} A team from the sheriff's department went to Landsberger's trailer on March \n9; Landsberger, who had four scratches on the side of his neck,  provided consent to \nsearch.  The remains of a mattress and box spring were found sm oldering in a fire pit in \nthe yard.  In the trailer, officers discovered blood in a bedro om containing an empty bed \nframe, and there was blood spatter on the walls and \u201ccast-off\u201d blood on the ceiling.  An \narea of the carpet was also saturated with blood.  In Landsberger's SUV, officers found a \nsmall area saturated with blood in the cargo hold.  Smears of b lood were discovered on \nboth rear passenger lower door frames and the inside of the bac k hatch.  In the shed, a \nbag of dog food contained bloody items such as bed sheets, plastic sheeting, a garbage \nbag, and clothing (with an open condom in the pocket).  Another  condom and wrapper \nwere recovered from the bedroom floor.  No body or bloody weapo n was discovered on \nthe property. \n{\u00b65} Appellant, who was identified as Landsberger's female friend, w as \ninterviewed on Tuesday, March 10, 2015.  During that interview she stated that when   \u2013 3 \u2013 \nCase No. 19 CO 0004 \nLandsberger picked her up on Thursday he had a black male named  \u201cQ\u201d (the victim) in \nhis car.  She indicated she and Landsberger used cocaine that night which she believed \nthe victim provided.  She asserted the condom in the bedroom ma y have been hers but \nwas not from that night.  She stated that when Q and Landsberger were taking her home, \nLandsberger stopped the car, told the victim to get out of the car, and proceeded to beat \nhim; the victim had a bloody nose and Landsberger had scratches on his neck.  After the \nfight, the two men returned acting friendly to each other and Landsberger took Appellant \nhome. \n{\u00b66} When a detective expressed he did not believe her story, Appellant admitted \nshe had intercourse with both Landsberger and the victim that night, stating her services \nconstituted her payment for drugs.  She said Landsberger \u201crippe d\u201d the victim out of the \ncar and beat him up in order to rob him; she also said the vict im lost the crack cocaine \nduring the fight, but they subsequently found it.  She claimed the beating occurred at a \npull-off for a recreation area, pointed out the area on a map, and said she could bring \nthem to the location.  She disclosed there was blood on the snow.  She insisted the victim \nwas awake when they dropped her off at home around 2:00 a.m. \n{\u00b67} The detective showed Appellant a photograph of Quinn Wilson; sh e \nidentified Quinn Wilson as Q, the victim.  She then announced t hat she had the victim's \nphone, stating she used it because her phone had no service.  When asked if she deleted \nmessages from the victim's phone, she assured the detective she had not. \n{\u00b68} Appellant then added a new part to her story; she said Landsber ger \ninstructed her to drive the car down the road during the beatin g.  When confronted with \nher different versions of the story, she stated that she though t Landsberger was joking \nwhen he texted her to say he would beat the victim up and \u201ctake  h i s  s h i t . \u201d   S h e  \nsubsequently admitted going to Landsberger's residence a second time, after having sex \nin the bedroom but before the robbery. \n{\u00b69} A detective brought Appellant to the recreation area so she could direct him \nto the pull-off area where the incident allegedly occurred.  A search was conducted that \nday and the next day, but no evidence of an altercation was uncovered. \n{\u00b610} On Wednesday, March 11, 2015, the victim\u2019s body was found on a hill by a \ndirt road in Columbiana County, Ohio.  The victim\u2019s body was cut in half.  The location of   \u2013 4 \u2013 \nCase No. 19 CO 0004 \nthe body was 1.7 miles from where Appellant resided and 8.8 mil es from Landsberger's \ntrailer. \n{\u00b611} The medical examiner concluded someone cut the body in half at the waist \nafter death, using a sharp knife-like instrument and then a saw .  The victim suffered \nmultiple (at least 19) chopping \u201cblunt-force injuries\u201d to the h ead with \u201cfeatures of sharp-\nforce injury\u201d caused by an instrument such as a hatchet.  The b lows caused: a broken \nlower jaw on the left side; a left forehead injury; a base skull fracture which radiated from \na hit on the top of the head; open skull fractures oozing brain  tissue; seven overlapping \nblows to the right forehead and eye; blows to the right back of  the head; crushed bones \nof the nose and cheeks; and a split maxilla caused by two chops to the upper lip.  Death \noccurred within seconds to a few minutes after these blows.  Th e victim also suffered a \nfractured right forearm prior to death which was not caused by a sharp object (but could \nhave been caused by the opposite side of the sharp-edged object).  The medical examiner \nfound no evidence of blows from a fist. \n{\u00b612}  The blood evidence from Landsberger's property matched the vict im's \nDNA. Appellant was a major contributor to the DNA on the condom  from the bedroom \nfloor. DNA on the condom from the pocket of the victim's sweats h i r t  w a s  a  m i x t u r e  \nconsistent with the victim, Landsberger, and Appellant. \n{\u00b613} The police conducted a second interview of Appellant on April 2 4, 2015. \nAppellant mentioned a conversation on robbing the victim they h ad in person before the \ntexts on the subject.  In describing the victim's condition aft er the robbery, she said he \n\u201cwas messed up\u201d but not \u201cterminal.\u201d  She said Landsberger asked the victim if he wanted \nto go to the hospital. \n{\u00b614} The data recovered from the victim\u2019s cell phone included forty-four contacts \nbetween Appellant and the victim.  Some texts were able to be recovered from Appellant \nand Landsberger\u2019s cell phones.  The texts that were recovered s uggest that the victim \nand Appellant discussed a drug dealing operation where Appellan t and Landsberger \nwould provide the victim a place to operate his drug business.  While those texts were \noccurring Appellant and Landsberger were separately texting abo ut the victim and \nAppellant was encouraging Landsberger to rob the victim.  Besides texts, the phones also \nshowed calls between Appellant and the victim and between Appellant and Landsberger.   \u2013 5 \u2013 \nCase No. 19 CO 0004 \n{\u00b615} After receiving the information extracted from the three phones , the police \nconducted a third interview with Appellant.  She reiterated her  story that she only saw a \nfight and robbery at the recreation area.  She expressed the robbery was not premeditated \nbefore the victim entered the car; she also said she was not aware Landsberger planned \nto hurt the victim.  Some texts were then read to her to dispute this. \n{\u00b616} When asked about the text telling Landsberger he may \u201chave to knock him \nout in here,\u201d she claimed \u201cin here\u201d referred to the car at the recreation area, not while they \nwere at the trailer.  She denied being in the bedroom or present when Landsberger killed \nthe victim, claiming he was alive when they brought her home sometime before 3:00 a.m.  \nShe remembered the text she had sent about a crowbar, noting th e plan was to beat up \nthe victim.  Upon being asked why she had texted Landsberger to  say the night did not \ngo as planned, she replied, \u201cI didn't expect him to beat the living shit out of the guy.\u201d  After \nit was pointed out that she suggested the crowbar, she responde d, \u201cI'm thinking knock \nhim out.  Not beat 'em till he's almost dead.\u201d  She said Landsb erger was supposed to \n\u201cconk 'em in the head a couple times and grab his stuff and we were gonna go.\u201d \n{\u00b617} On November 18, 2015, Appellant was indicted on seven counts: (1) murder \n(for purposely causing the death of another by aiding and abett ing Landsberger); (2) \ntampering with evidence (for deleting evidence from the victim' s phone), a third degree \nfelony; (3) conspiracy to commit robbery (for inflicting, attempting to inflict, or threatening \nphysical harm while committing, attempting, or fleeing a theft offense), a third degree \nfelony; (4) complicity to the same robbery (by aiding and abetting Landsberger), a second \ndegree felony; and (5-7) obstructing justice (corresponding to the three police interviews), \nthird degree felonies due to the type of offense being investigated. \n{\u00b618} The case was tried to a jury.  In addition to all of the eviden ce reviewed \nabove, the state presented the testimony of a witness, Brandi C ope, who testified the \nvictim was one of her drug dealers.  She said he was not a typical dealer as he was caring \nand was not violent even when he was owed money.  Although the victim was generous, \nshe said he would not lend out his phone. She bought crack from  the victim on the \nafternoon of March 5, 2015, hours before his death.  She therea fter went to her uncle's \nresidence where she saw Appellant.  Appellant indicated she wou ld see the victim that   \u2013 6 \u2013 \nCase No. 19 CO 0004 \nnight to repay a favor she owed him.  Brandi Cope learned the v ictim was dead the next \nday. \n{\u00b619} The jury found Appellant guilty of all charges.  The court sent enced \nAppellant to: 15 years to life for murder; 12 months for tamper ing with evidence; 6 years \nfor robbery; and 12 months on each of the three counts of obstr ucting justice.  The \nconspiracy to commit robbery count was merged with the robbery count prior to \nsentencing.  The court ordered the sentences to run consecutively for a total sentence of \n25 years to life. \n{\u00b620} Appellant filed a timely appeal raising six assignments of error.  We affirmed \nthe convictions, but remanded the case to the trial court for i t to issue a nunc pro tunc \nsentencing entry incorporating the consecutive sentence findings made at the sentencing \nhearing.  Heckathorn, 2019-Ohio-1086. \n{\u00b621} Appellant filed a motion for post-conviction relief requesting an evidentiary \nhearing on October 30, 2018 and November 2, 2018.  In addition to other arguments, \nAppellant asserted trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move for a change of venue \nbased on the amount of pretrial publicity, for failing to intro duce Brandi Cope\u2019s criminal \nrecord, and for failing to demonstrate how the prosecution enga ged in misconduct as to \nthe text messages that showcased the victim\u2019s drug use, which she claimed was in direct \nconflict with the coroner\u2019s report.  Attached were statements of dates when media covered \nthe murder, Brandi Cope\u2019s record, and text messages that were a llegedly not disclosed \nthat purportedly demonstrated the victim\u2019s drug use. Appellant requested an investigator \nto help her support her petition with evidence. Appellant also moved to have counsel \nappointed to represent her on her petition. 11/2/18 Motion. \n{\u00b622} In response, the state filed a motion to dismiss.  11/28/18 Mot ion.  It \nasserted Appellant failed to raise a sufficient constitutional challenge that would require \na hearing.  As to community bias, it argued the allegation is not a constitutional issue and \nfurthermore, the trial court over saw the voir dire process and  the record demonstrated \nthe jury was not biased.  As to Cope\u2019s testimony, the state not ed that Cope appeared in \njail clothes and testified as to her incarceration.  The state asserted the arguments \nregarding Cope are unsubstantiated speculation.  As to the text  messages, the state \nasserted Appellant had access to all text messages through discovery.  Furthermore, her   \u2013 7 \u2013 \nCase No. 19 CO 0004 \nargument was based upon the meaning and context of the text mes sages and thus, did \nnot provide a constitutional foundation for post-conviction.  11/28/18 Motion. \n{\u00b623} The trial court dismissed the petition without an evidentiary h earing for the \nreasons stated in the state\u2019s dismissal motion.  12/27/18 J.E. \n{\u00b624} Appellant timely appealed the trial court\u2019s decision. \nFirst Assignment of Error \n\u201cThe lower court erred by summarily dismissing Heckathorn\u2019s pet ition for post-\nconviction relief without an evidentiary hearing.\u201d \n{\u00b625} Post-conviction relief is a collateral civil attack on a criminal judgment.  State \nv. Steffen, 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410, 639 N.E.2d 67 (1994).  R.C. 2953.21 t hrough R.C. \n2953.23 govern petitions for post-conviction and provide that \u201c any defendant who has \nbeen convicted of a criminal offense and who claims to have exp erienced a denial or \ninfringement of his or her constitutional rights may petition t he trial court to vacate or set \naside the judgment and sentence.\u201d  State v. Martin, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 12 MA 167, \n2013\u2013Ohio\u20132881, \u00b6 13. \n{\u00b626} Our review of a trial court's denial of a petition for post-con viction relief is \nfor an abuse of discretion. State v. Gondor , 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 \nN.E.2d 77, \u00b6 58.  Abuse of discretion connotes more than an err or of law; it implies the \ntrial court acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or unconscionably. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 \nOhio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). \n{\u00b627} Regarding ineffective assistance of counsel claims and post-con viction \nrelief, the Twelfth Appellate District has explained: \n \nCounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistan ce and \nmade all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable pr ofessional \njudgment. State v. Hendrix, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012\u201305\u2013109, 2012\u2013\nOhio\u20135610, \u00b6 14. In turn, in a postconviction petition assertin g ineffective \nassistance of counsel, the petitioner must first show that \u201chis trial counsel's \nperformance was deficient; and second, that the deficient perfo rmance \nprejudiced the defense to the point of depriving the appellant of a fair trial.\u201d \nWidmer, 2013\u2013Ohio\u201362 at \u00b6 132. A petitioner's failure to satisfy either prong \nis fatal to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. State v. Ayers,  12th   \u2013 8 \u2013 \nCase No. 19 CO 0004 \nDist. Warren Nos. CA2010\u201312\u2013119 and CA2010\u201312\u2013120, 2011\u2013Ohio\u2013\n4719, \u00b6 49. A trial court's decision resolving a postconviction  claim of \nineffective assistance of counsel will be upheld absent an abus e of \ndiscretion when the trial court's finding is supported by compe tent and \ncredible evidence. State v. Davis,  12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012\u201312\u2013258, \n2013\u2013Ohio\u20133878, \u00b6 14. \n \nState v. McKelton, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-02-028, 2015-Ohio-4228, \u00b6 25. \n{\u00b628} We have explained that generally, a claim of ineffective assist ance of trial \ncounsel should be raised in a direct appeal.  State v. Dillard, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 12 \nJE 29, 2014-Ohio-439, \u00b6 21, 27; State v. Delgado , 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 15 MA 26, \n2015-Ohio-5006, \u00b6 18.  A trial court properly dismisses a petition for post-conviction relief \nbased on res judicata \u201cwhen the defendant, represented by new counsel on direct appeal, \nfails to raise therein the issue of competent trial counsel and  the issue could fairly have \nbeen determined without resort to evidence outside the record.\u201d  State v. Carosiello, 7th \nDist. Columbiana No. 18 CO 0018, 2019-Ohio-2705, \u00b6 28, quoting State v. Sturgill, 12th \nDist. Clermont Nos. CA2014-01-003 and CA2014-07-049, 2014-Ohio-5082, \u00b6 13. \n{\u00b629} Here, the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is based o n trial \ncounsel\u2019s failure to move for a change of venue, failure to obt ain Brandi Cope\u2019s record, \nand failure to raise prosecutorial misconduct by failing to dis close all text messages \nrecovered from the victim\u2019s phone.  The evidence supporting the s e  a l l e g a t i o n s  o f  \nineffective assistance of counsel are alleged to be outside the record.  Regarding venue, \nAppellant asserts there was a basis to move for change of venue  because of extensive \npretrial coverage of the crime.  Regarding Cope\u2019s record, Appel lant claims the witness\u2019 \ncriminal record is outside the record on appeal.  As to the text messages, Appellant claims \nthat there were text messages indicating the victim\u2019s drug use,  which was not disclosed \nto her and were in conflict with the coroner\u2019s report. \n{\u00b630} Starting with venue, the news articles and reports referenced in her petition \nare outside the record and thus, the issue is potentially a post-conviction issue.  That said, \nas the state points out, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated that the \u201cvoir dire examination \nprovides the best test as to whether adverse publicity necessit ates a change of venue.\u201d  \nState v. Issa, 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 62, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001). Accordingly, the  issue was   \u2013 9 \u2013 \nCase No. 19 CO 0004 \nnot a matter for post-conviction relief and is barred by res ju dicata since the voir dire \ntranscript is part of the record. \n{\u00b631} Regardless, even if post-conviction is the proper avenue for th e argument \nraised, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismiss ing the petition based on this \nclaim.  We have explained that a trial court is not required to  grant a change of venue \nmerely because of extensive pretrial coverage.  State v. Todd, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. \n12 CO 28, 2015-Ohio-2682, \u00b6 17, citing State v. McKnight, 107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005\u2013\nOhio\u20136046, 837 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 60. \u201c[E]ven pervasive adverse pret rial publicity \u2018does not \ninevitably lead to an unfair trial.\u2019\u201d  State v. Gilbert,  7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 206, \n2012\u2013Ohio\u20131165, \u00b6 95.  The trial court oversaw the voir dire an d the record of voir dire \nindicates that the jurors could render a fair and impartial ver dict. Accordingly, even \nconsidering there may have been pretrial publicity, Appellant c annot demonstrate the \nprejudice prong on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.   Failing one prong of the \nineffective assistance of counsel test is fatal to the entire claim. \n{\u00b632} As to Brandi Cope\u2019s criminal record claim, Appellant argues her trial counsel \ndid not have this record.  First, it is noted that the criminal  record Appellant attached to \nthe post-conviction petition that allegedly her counsel did not  have is a print out of the \nmunicipal court online docket that is available to the public a nd was available to her and \nher counsel.  Also, it is noted that the record indicates that information was provided \nduring discovery.  Consequently, considering this information was provided in discovery, \nwas a public record, and there was no indication that counsel did not have the information, \nit does not provide a basis for granting a petition for post-conviction relief. \n{\u00b633} Regardless, it could not be determined that Appellant was preju diced \nregarding this matter.  As the state pointed out in its motion to dismiss the petition, Cope \nwas in jail clothes when she testified and she testified about her incarceration. In our \nopinion, we noted that Cope testified the victim was one of her drug dealers. Heckathorn, \n7th Dist. Columbiana No. 17 CO 0011, 2019-Ohio-1086, \u00b6 30.  The  jury and counsel \nclearly were aware the witness had a prior record, was a drug u ser, and was in jail.  \nFurthermore, Cope\u2019s testimony merely established that Heckathorn was meeting with the \nvictim on the day of his murder.  However, text messages betwee n Landsberger, \nAppellant and the victim, and Appellant\u2019s own statement to the police established that   \u2013 10 \u2013 \nCase No. 19 CO 0004 \nfact, too.  Consequently, Appellant cannot meet the prejudice p rong of the ineffective \nassistance of counsel test. \n{\u00b634} The last claim concerns text messages that were allegedly recov ered, but \nnot disclosed to Appellant through discovery.  Appellant claims  the undisclosed text \nmessages show the victim used drugs.  In the messages provided,  the victim does talk \nabout smoking and \u201csmke [sic] a blunt.\u201d  The claim that they were not disclosed, however, \nappears to be unfounded.  The alleged text messages that were a llegedly not disclosed \nthrough discovery are attached to the petition.  Appellant does  n o t  s t a t e  h o w  s h e  \nuncovered these messages if they were not provided during discovery. Furthermore, the \nrecord indicates that text messages (in general) were disclosed to counsel and Appellant.  \nCounsel was aware of the text messages and referenced the text messages in the \nopening statement.  Thus, there is nothing in the record to suggest these text messages \nwere not disclosed other than her mere allegation that they were not. \n{\u00b635} If the messages were disclosed, counsel\u2019s failure to ask questi ons about \nthe victim\u2019s drug use was an issue that should have been and could have been raised in \nthe direct appeal.  That said, an argument that counsel was ineffective on this basis would \nprobably have been meritless; it would be difficult to conclude prejudice resulted from not \ntrying to show the victim used drugs.  It was readily admitted the victim was a drug dealer.  \nFurthermore, the text messages between Landsberger and Appellan t established the \nrobbery and murder as discussed in our opinion in Heckathorn, 2019-Ohio-1086. \n{\u00b636} The argument regarding the text messages does not indicate the trial court \nabused its discretion in dismissing the petition. \n{\u00b637} In conclusion, when considering the arguments, it could be determined that \nmost, if not all, of these arguments could have been made in th e direct appeal and thus, \nwere not matters outside the scope of the record.  Accordingly,  they were barred by res \njudicata.  However, even if these arguments were proper for a p ost-conviction relief \npetition, Appellant cannot demonstrate counsel was deficient and/or she was prejudiced.  \nThus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the petition. \nSecond Assignment of Error \n\u201cThe lower court erred by summarily dismissing Heckathorn\u2019s pet ition for post-\nconviction relief without making and filing findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d   \u2013 11 \u2013 \nCase No. 19 CO 0004 \n{\u00b638} Appellant argues the trial court\u2019s judgment entry does not make findings of \nfact and conclusions of law as required by R.C. 2953.21(D).  Th e state asserts the \njudgment entry is sufficient because it adopts the state\u2019s reasoning. \n{\u00b639} The trial court\u2019s judgment entry dismissing the petition stated: \n \nThe State argues that the Defendant has failed to allege the de nial of a \nconstitutional right and to allege an evidentiary basis or oper ative facts to \nsupport the alleged denial.  The State cites the fact that argu ments raised \nby the Defendant are not issues outside the scope of the trial and thus are \nnot properly raised in a petition for post-conviction relief.  It is the State\u2019s \nposition that the Defendant merely wants to re-litigate the trial and perhaps \ntry out a new defense that was previously available to her.  In summary, the \nState argues that by the petition for post-conviction relief th e supplement, \nthe Defendant alleges grounds that are improper for the grantin g of such \nrelief. \n \nThe Court agrees with the State\u2019s arguments. \n \nThe Petition, Supplement, and related motions are dismissed. \n \n12/27/18 J.E. \n{\u00b640} Pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(D): \n \nThe court shall consider a petition that is timely filed under division (A)(2) of \nthis section even if a direct appeal of the judgment is pending . Before \ngranting a hearing on a petition filed under division (A) of th is section, the \ncourt shall determine whether there are substantive grounds for  relief. In \nmaking such a determination, the court shall consider, in addit ion to the \npetition, the supporting affidavits, and the documentary eviden ce, all the \nfiles and records pertaining to the proceedings against the pet itioner, \nincluding, but not limited to, the indictment, the court's jour nal entries, the \njournalized records of the clerk of the court, and the court re porter's \ntranscript. The court reporter's transcript, if ordered and cer tified by the   \u2013 12 \u2013 \nCase No. 19 CO 0004 \ncourt, shall be taxed as court costs. If the court dismisses th e petition, it \nshall make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law wit h respect to \nsuch dismissal. If the petition was filed by a person who has been sentenced \nto death, the findings of fact and conclusions of law shall sta te specifically \nthe reasons for the dismissal of the petition and of each claim it contains. \nR.C. 2953.21(D). \n{\u00b641} Accordingly, the trial court was required to make findings of f act and \nconclusions of law when it dismissed the petition.  However, gi ven the last sentence of \nthe above enumerated section, since this is not a death case, t he findings of fact and \nconclusions of law were not needed for each claim.  Rather, the y were needed for the \nentire dismissal. \n{\u00b642} Appellate courts have stated that when a trial court finds that  a hearing is \nnot warranted and dismissed the petition, the trial court must issue findings of fact and \nconclusions of law sufficient to enable meaningful appellate re view.  State v. Hull, 11th \nDist. Lake No. 2018-L-050, 2019-Ohio-23, \u00b6 38, citing R.C. 2953 .21(D) and State v. \nCalhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 291-292, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999); State v. Beckwith, 8th Dist. \nCuyahoga No. 106479, 2018-Ohio-2227, \u00b6 13 (\u201cInsofar as R.C. 295 3.21(D) instructs the \ntrial court to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the dismissal of \na petition, \u2018[t]hese findings and conclusions need only \u201cappris e the petitioner of the \nreasons for the trial court's judgment [in order] to permit meaningful appellate review.\u201d\u2019\u201d). \nA sufficiently detailed judgment entry permits meaningful appel late review.  State v. \nDennison, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 18CA6, 2018-Ohio-4502, \u00b6 30, citing State ex rel. \nCarrion v. Harris, 40 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 530 N.E.2d 1330 (1988). \n{\u00b643} The trial court does state that the arguments raised by Appella nt are not \nissues outside the scope of the trial and thus, are not properly raised in a post-conviction \nrelief petition.  The first portion of that sentence could be d eemed a finding of fact.  The \nsecond portion would be a conclusion of law.  While the finding  of fact may have been \ncorrect to many of the arguments raised in the petition, potent ially (and argued by \nAppellant in the first assignment of error) it was not correct to the ineffective assistance \nof counsel arguments that are raised on appeal because Appellan t does appear to be \nrelying on matters outside the record.  However, an incorrect finding on those claims does   \u2013 13 \u2013 \nCase No. 19 CO 0004 \nnot mean the judgment entry was inadequate. Rather, it would me an it was potentially \nincorrect, but reviewable by this court. \n{\u00b644} Furthermore, the trial court stated that it agreed with the sta te\u2019s argument \nand dismissed the petition.  That statement, given the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, could be \ndeemed a finding of fact and conclusion of law.  The trial court\u2019s statement in conjunction \nwith the state\u2019s motion permits meaningful appellate review.  T he state\u2019s opposition \nmotion is well detailed.  As set forth above, the state\u2019s motio n to dismiss asserted \nAppellant failed to raise a sufficient constitutional challenge that would require a hearing. \nAs to community bias, it argued the allegation was not a consti tutional issue and \nfurthermore, the trial court over saw the voir dire process and  the record demonstrated \nthe jury was not biased.  As to Cope\u2019s testimony, the state not ed that Cope appeared in \njail clothes and testified as to her incarceration.  The state asserted the arguments \nregarding Cope were unsubstantiated speculation.  As to the tex t messages, the state \nasserted Appellant had access to all text messages through discovery.  Furthermore, her \nargument was an argument regarding the meaning and context of the text messages and \nthus, did not provide a constitutional foundation for post-conv iction review.  11/28/18 \nMotion. \n{\u00b645} As discussed above, the state\u2019s reasoning is the correct basis for \ndetermining that the petition should be dismissed without a hea ring.  The trial court\u2019s \njudgment could be meaningfully reviewed.  Accordingly, this ass ignment of error is \nmeritless. \nConclusion \n{\u00b646} Both assignments of error lack merit.  The trial court\u2019s decision is affirmed.  \n \nWaite, P.J., concurs. \nD\u2019Apolito, J., concurs. \n \n [Cite as State v.

Brandt, 629 Main Street, Suite B, Covington, Kentucky 41011 for\nDefendant-Appellant.\nRobb, J.\n\n\u00b61 Defendant-Appellant Danielle Heckathorn appeals the decision of Columbiana County Common Pleas Court dismissing her petition for post-conviction relief. Two issues are raised in this appeal. The first is whether the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the petition. The second issue is whether the trial court properly made findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by R.C. 2953.21(D) when it dismissed the petition. For the reasons expressed below, the trial court\u2019s decision is affirmed.\n\nStatement of the Facts and Case\n\n\u00b62 The following facts are taken from our direct appeal in State v. Heckathorn, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 17 CO 0011, 2019-Ohio-1086.\n\n\u00b63 On Sunday, March 8, 2015, a distressed man appeared at the Columbiana County Sheriff's Department to report that his neighbor, Daniel Landsberger, confessed to killing a black male.\n\n\u00b64 A team from the sheriff's department went to Landsberger's trailer on March 9; Landsberger, who had four scratches on the side of his neck, provided consent to search. The remains of a mattress and box spring were found smoldering in a fire pit in the yard. In the trailer, officers discovered blood in a bedroom containing an empty bed frame, and there was blood spatter on the walls and \u201ccast-off\u201d blood on the ceiling. An area of the carpet was also saturated with blood. In Landsberger's SUV, officers found a small area saturated with blood in the cargo hold. Smears of blood were discovered on both rear passenger lower door frames and the inside of the back hatch. In the shed, a bag of dog food contained bloody items such as bed sheets, plastic sheeting, a garbage bag, and clothing (with an open condom in the pocket). Another condom and wrapper were recovered from the bedroom floor. No body or bloody weapon was discovered on the property.\n\n\u00b65 Appellant, who was identified as Landsberger's female friend, was interviewed on Tuesday, March 10, 2015. During that interview she stated that when\nLandsberger picked her up on Thursday he had a black male named \u201cQ\u201d (the victim) in his car. She indicated she and Landsberger used cocaine that night which she believed the victim provided. She asserted the condom in the bedroom may have been hers but was not from that night. She stated that when Q and Landsberger were taking her home, Landsberger stopped the car, told the victim to get out of the car, and proceeded to beat him; the victim had a bloody nose and Landsberger had scratches on his neck. After the fight, the two men returned acting friendly to each other and Landsberger took Appellant home.\n\nWhen a detective expressed he did not believe her story, Appellant admitted she had intercourse with both Landsberger and the victim that night, stating her services constituted her payment for drugs. She said Landsberger \u201cripped\u201d the victim out of the car and beat him up in order to rob him; she also said the victim lost the crack cocaine during the fight, but they subsequently found it. She claimed the beating occurred at a pull-off for a recreation area, pointed out the area on a map, and said she could bring them to the location. She disclosed there was blood on the snow. She insisted the victim was awake when they dropped her off at home around 2:00 a.m.\n\nThe detective showed Appellant a photograph of Quinn Wilson; she identified Quinn Wilson as Q, the victim. She then announced that she had the victim's phone, stating she used it because her phone had no service. When asked if she deleted messages from the victim's phone, she assured the detective she had not.\n\nAppellant then added a new part to her story; she said Landsberger instructed her to drive the car down the road during the beating. When confronted with her different versions of the story, she stated that she thought Landsberger was joking when he texted her to say he would beat the victim up and \u201ctake his shit.\u201d She subsequently admitted going to Landsberger's residence a second time, after having sex in the bedroom but before the robbery.\n\nA detective brought Appellant to the recreation area so she could direct him to the pull-off area where the incident allegedly occurred. A search was conducted that day and the next day, but no evidence of an altercation was uncovered.\n\nOn Wednesday, March 11, 2015, the victim's body was found on a hill by a dirt road in Columbiana County, Ohio. The victim's body was cut in half. The location of\nthe body was 1.7 miles from where Appellant resided and 8.8 miles from Landsberger's trailer.\n\n{\u00b611} The medical examiner concluded someone cut the body in half at the waist after death, using a sharp knife-like instrument and then a saw. The victim suffered multiple (at least 19) chopping \u201cblunt-force injuries\u201d to the head with \u201cfeatures of sharp-force injury\u201d caused by an instrument such as a hatchet. The blows caused: a broken lower jaw on the left side; a left forehead injury; a base skull fracture which radiated from a hit on the top of the head; open skull fractures oozing brain tissue; seven overlapping blows to the right forehead and eye; blows to the right back of the head; crushed bones of the nose and cheeks; and a split maxilla caused by two chops to the upper lip. Death occurred within seconds to a few minutes after these blows. The victim also suffered a fractured right forearm prior to death which was not caused by a sharp object (but could have been caused by the opposite side of the sharp-edged object). The medical examiner found no evidence of blows from a fist.\n\n{\u00b612} The blood evidence from Landsberger's property matched the victim's DNA. Appellant was a major contributor to the DNA on the condom from the bedroom floor. DNA on the condom from the pocket of the victim's sweatshirt was a mixture consistent with the victim, Landsberger, and Appellant.\n\n{\u00b613} The police conducted a second interview of Appellant on April 24, 2015. Appellant mentioned a conversation on robbing the victim they had in person before the texts on the subject. In describing the victim's condition after the robbery, she said he \u201cwas messed up\u201d but not \u201cterminal.\u201d She said Landsberger asked the victim if he wanted to go to the hospital.\n\n{\u00b614} The data recovered from the victim\u2019s cell phone included forty-four contacts between Appellant and the victim. Some texts were able to be recovered from Appellant and Landsberger\u2019s cell phones. The texts that were recovered suggest that the victim and Appellant discussed a drug dealing operation where Appellant and Landsberger would provide the victim a place to operate his drug business. While those texts were occurring Appellant and Landsberger were separately texting about the victim and Appellant was encouraging Landsberger to rob the victim. Besides texts, the phones also showed calls between Appellant and the victim and between Appellant and Landsberger.\nAfter receiving the information extracted from the three phones, the police conducted a third interview with Appellant. She reiterated her story that she only saw a fight and robbery at the recreation area. She expressed the robbery was not premeditated before the victim entered the car; she also said she was not aware Landsberger planned to hurt the victim. Some texts were then read to her to dispute this.\n\nWhen asked about the text telling Landsberger he may \u201chave to knock him out in here,\u201d she claimed \u201cin here\u201d referred to the car at the recreation area, not while they were at the trailer. She denied being in the bedroom or present when Landsberger killed the victim, claiming he was alive when they brought her home sometime before 3:00 a.m. She remembered the text she had sent about a crowbar, noting the plan was to beat up the victim. Upon being asked why she had texted Landsberger to say the night did not go as planned, she replied, \u201cI didn't expect him to beat the living shit out of the guy.\u201d After it was pointed out that she suggested the crowbar, she responded, \u201cI'm thinking knock him out. Not beat 'em till he's almost dead.\u201d She said Landsberger was supposed to \u201cconk 'em in the head a couple times and grab his stuff and we were gonna go.\u201d\n\nOn November 18, 2015, Appellant was indicted on seven counts: (1) murder (for purposely causing the death of another by aiding and abetting Landsberger); (2) tampering with evidence (for deleting evidence from the victim\u2019s phone), a third degree felony; (3) conspiracy to commit robbery (for inflicting, attempting to inflict, or threatening physical harm while committing, attempting, or fleeing a theft offense), a third degree felony; (4) complicity to the same robbery (by aiding and abetting Landsberger), a second degree felony; and (5-7) obstructing justice (corresponding to the three police interviews), third degree felonies due to the type of offense being investigated.\n\nThe case was tried to a jury. In addition to all of the evidence reviewed above, the state presented the testimony of a witness, Brandi Cope, who testified the victim was one of her drug dealers. She said he was not a typical dealer as he was caring and was not violent even when he was owed money. Although the victim was generous, she said he would not lend out his phone. She bought crack from the victim on the afternoon of March 5, 2015, hours before his death. She thereafter went to her uncle\u2019s residence where she saw Appellant. Appellant indicated she would see the victim that\nnight to repay a favor she owed him. Brandi Cope learned the victim was dead the next day.\n\n{\u00b619} The jury found Appellant guilty of all charges. The court sentenced Appellant to: 15 years to life for murder; 12 months for tampering with evidence; 6 years for robbery; and 12 months on each of the three counts of obstructing justice. The conspiracy to commit robbery count was merged with the robbery count prior to sentencing. The court ordered the sentences to run consecutively for a total sentence of 25 years to life.\n\n{\u00b620} Appellant filed a timely appeal raising six assignments of error. We affirmed the convictions, but remanded the case to the trial court for it to issue a nunc pro tunc sentencing entry incorporating the consecutive sentence findings made at the sentencing hearing. Heckathorn, 2019-Ohio-1086.\n\n{\u00b621} Appellant filed a motion for post-conviction relief requesting an evidentiary hearing on October 30, 2018 and November 2, 2018. In addition to other arguments, Appellant asserted trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move for a change of venue based on the amount of pretrial publicity, for failing to introduce Brandi Cope\u2019s criminal record, and for failing to demonstrate how the prosecution engaged in misconduct as to the text messages that showcased the victim\u2019s drug use, which she claimed was in direct conflict with the coroner\u2019s report. Attached were statements of dates when media covered the murder, Brandi Cope\u2019s record, and text messages that were allegedly not disclosed that purportedly demonstrated the victim\u2019s drug use. Appellant requested an investigator to help her support her petition with evidence. Appellant also moved to have counsel appointed to represent her on her petition. 11/2/18 Motion.\n\n{\u00b622} In response, the state filed a motion to dismiss. 11/28/18 Motion. It asserted Appellant failed to raise a sufficient constitutional challenge that would require a hearing. As to community bias, it argued the allegation is not a constitutional issue and furthermore, the trial court over saw the voir dire process and the record demonstrated the jury was not biased. As to Cope\u2019s testimony, the state noted that Cope appeared in jail clothes and testified as to her incarceration. The state asserted the arguments regarding Cope are unsubstantiated speculation. As to the text messages, the state asserted Appellant had access to all text messages through discovery. Furthermore, her\nargument was based upon the meaning and context of the text messages and thus, did not provide a constitutional foundation for post-conviction. 11/28/18 Motion.\n\n\u00b623 The trial court dismissed the petition without an evidentiary hearing for the reasons stated in the state\u2019s dismissal motion. 12/27/18 J.E.\n\n\u00b624 Appellant timely appealed the trial court\u2019s decision.\n\nFirst Assignment of Error\n\n\u201cThe lower court erred by summarily dismissing Heckathorn\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing.\u201d\n\n\u00b625 Post-conviction relief is a collateral civil attack on a criminal judgment. State v. Steffen, 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410, 639 N.E.2d 67 (1994). R.C. 2953.21 through R.C. 2953.23 govern petitions for post-conviction and provide that \u201cany defendant who has been convicted of a criminal offense and who claims to have experienced a denial or infringement of his or her constitutional rights may petition the trial court to vacate or set aside the judgment and sentence.\u201d State v. Martin, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 12 MA 167, 2013\u2013Ohio\u20132881, \u00b6 13.\n\n\u00b626 Our review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a petition for post-conviction relief is for an abuse of discretion. State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 58. Abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law; it implies the trial court acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or unconscionably. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983).\n\n\u00b627 Regarding ineffective assistance of counsel claims and post-conviction relief, the Twelfth Appellate District has explained:\n\nCounsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment. State v. Hendrix, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012\u201305\u2013109, 2012\u2013Ohio\u20135610, \u00b6 14. In turn, in a postconviction petition asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner must first show that \u201chis trial counsel's performance was deficient; and second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense to the point of depriving the appellant of a fair trial.\u201d Widmer, 2013\u2013Ohio\u201362 at \u00b6 132. A petitioner's failure to satisfy either prong is fatal to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. State v. Ayers, 12th\nDist. Warren Nos. CA2010\u201312\u2013119 and CA2010\u201312\u2013120, 2011\u2013Ohio\u20134719, \u00b6 49. A trial court's decision resolving a postconviction claim of ineffective assistance of counsel will be upheld absent an abuse of discretion when the trial court's finding is supported by competent and credible evidence. State v. Davis, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012\u201312\u2013258, 2013\u2013Ohio\u20133878, \u00b6 14.\n\nState v. McKelton, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-02-028, 2015-Ohio-4228, \u00b6 25.\n\n{\u00b628} We have explained that generally, a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel should be raised in a direct appeal. State v. Dillard, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 12 JE 29, 2014-Ohio-439, \u00b6 21, 27; State v. Delgado, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 15 MA 26, 2015-Ohio-5006, \u00b6 18. A trial court properly dismisses a petition for post-conviction relief based on res judicata \u201cwhen the defendant, represented by new counsel on direct appeal, fails to raise therein the issue of competent trial counsel and the issue could fairly have been determined without resort to evidence outside the record.\u201d State v. Carosiello, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 18 CO 0018, 2019-Ohio-2705, \u00b6 28, quoting State v. Sturgill, 12th Dist. Clermont Nos. CA2014-01-003 and CA2014-07-049, 2014-Ohio-5082, \u00b6 13.\n\n{\u00b629} Here, the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to move for a change of venue, failure to obtain Brandi Cope\u2019s record, and failure to raise prosecutorial misconduct by failing to disclose all text messages recovered from the victim\u2019s phone. The evidence supporting these allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are alleged to be outside the record. Regarding venue, Appellant asserts there was a basis to move for change of venue because of extensive pretrial coverage of the crime. Regarding Cope\u2019s record, Appellant claims the witness\u2019 criminal record is outside the record on appeal. As to the text messages, Appellant claims that there were text messages indicating the victim\u2019s drug use, which was not disclosed to her and were in conflict with the coroner\u2019s report.\n\n{\u00b630} Starting with venue, the news articles and reports referenced in her petition are outside the record and thus, the issue is potentially a post-conviction issue. That said, as the state points out, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated that the \u201cvoir dire examination provides the best test as to whether adverse publicity necessitates a change of venue.\u201d State v. Issa, 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 62, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001). Accordingly, the issue was\nnot a matter for post-conviction relief and is barred by res judicata since the voir dire transcript is part of the record.\n\n{\u00b631} Regardless, even if post-conviction is the proper avenue for the argument raised, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the petition based on this claim. We have explained that a trial court is not required to grant a change of venue merely because of extensive pretrial coverage. State v. Todd, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 12 CO 28, 2015-Ohio-2682, \u00b6 17, citing State v. McKnight, 107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005\u2013Ohio\u20136046, 837 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 60. \u201c[E]ven pervasive adverse pretrial publicity \u2018does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.\u2019\u201d State v. Gilbert, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 206, 2012\u2013Ohio\u20131165, \u00b6 95. The trial court oversaw the voir dire and the record of voir dire indicates that the jurors could render a fair and impartial verdict. Accordingly, even considering there may have been pretrial publicity, Appellant cannot demonstrate the prejudice prong on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Failing one prong of the ineffective assistance of counsel test is fatal to the entire claim.\n\n{\u00b632} As to Brandi Cope\u2019s criminal record claim, Appellant argues her trial counsel did not have this record. First, it is noted that the criminal record Appellant attached to the post-conviction petition that allegedly her counsel did not have is a print out of the municipal court online docket that is available to the public and was available to her and her counsel. Also, it is noted that the record indicates that information was provided during discovery. Consequently, considering this information was provided in discovery, was a public record, and there was no indication that counsel did not have the information, it does not provide a basis for granting a petition for post-conviction relief.\n\n{\u00b633} Regardless, it could not be determined that Appellant was prejudiced regarding this matter. As the state pointed out in its motion to dismiss the petition, Cope was in jail clothes when she testified and she testified about her incarceration. In our opinion, we noted that Cope testified the victim was one of her drug dealers. Heckathorn, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 17 CO 0011, 2019-Ohio-1086, \u00b6 30. The jury and counsel clearly were aware the witness had a prior record, was a drug user, and was in jail. Furthermore, Cope\u2019s testimony merely established that Heckathorn was meeting with the victim on the day of his murder. However, text messages between Landsberger, Appellant and the victim, and Appellant\u2019s own statement to the police established that\nfact, too. Consequently, Appellant cannot meet the prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance of counsel test.\n\n\u00b634 The last claim concerns text messages that were allegedly recovered, but not disclosed to Appellant through discovery. Appellant claims the undisclosed text messages show the victim used drugs. In the messages provided, the victim does talk about smoking and \u201csmke [sic] a blunt.\u201d The claim that they were not disclosed, however, appears to be unfounded. The alleged text messages that were allegedly not disclosed through discovery are attached to the petition. Appellant does not state how she uncovered these messages if they were not provided during discovery. Furthermore, the record indicates that text messages (in general) were disclosed to counsel and Appellant. Counsel was aware of the text messages and referenced the text messages in the opening statement. Thus, there is nothing in the record to suggest these text messages were not disclosed other than her mere allegation that they were not.\n\n\u00b635 If the messages were disclosed, counsel's failure to ask questions about the victim's drug use was an issue that should have been and could have been raised in the direct appeal. That said, an argument that counsel was ineffective on this basis would probably have been meritless; it would be difficult to conclude prejudice resulted from not trying to show the victim used drugs. It was readily admitted the victim was a drug dealer. Furthermore, the text messages between Landsberger and Appellant established the robbery and murder as discussed in our opinion in Heckathorn, 2019-Ohio-1086.\n\n\u00b636 The argument regarding the text messages does not indicate the trial court abused its discretion in dismissing the petition.\n\n\u00b637 In conclusion, when considering the arguments, it could be determined that most, if not all, of these arguments could have been made in the direct appeal and thus, were not matters outside the scope of the record. Accordingly, they were barred by res judicata. However, even if these arguments were proper for a post-conviction relief petition, Appellant cannot demonstrate counsel was deficient and/or she was prejudiced. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the petition.\n\nSecond Assignment of Error\n\n\u201cThe lower court erred by summarily dismissing Heckathorn\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief without making and filing findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d\nAppellant argues the trial court\u2019s judgment entry does not make findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by R.C. 2953.21(D). The state asserts the judgment entry is sufficient because it adopts the state\u2019s reasoning.\n\nThe trial court\u2019s judgment entry dismissing the petition stated:\n\nThe State argues that the Defendant has failed to allege the denial of a constitutional right and to allege an evidentiary basis or operative facts to support the alleged denial. The State cites the fact that arguments raised by the Defendant are not issues outside the scope of the trial and thus are not properly raised in a petition for post-conviction relief. It is the State\u2019s position that the Defendant merely wants to re-litigate the trial and perhaps try out a new defense that was previously available to her. In summary, the State argues that by the petition for post-conviction relief the supplement, the Defendant alleges grounds that are improper for the granting of such relief.\n\nThe Court agrees with the State\u2019s arguments.\n\nThe Petition, Supplement, and related motions are dismissed.\n\n12/27/18 J.E.\n\nPursuant to R.C. 2953.21(D):\n\nThe court shall consider a petition that is timely filed under division (A)(2) of this section even if a direct appeal of the judgment is pending. Before granting a hearing on a petition filed under division (A) of this section, the court shall determine whether there are substantive grounds for relief. In making such a determination, the court shall consider, in addition to the petition, the supporting affidavits, and the documentary evidence, all the files and records pertaining to the proceedings against the petitioner, including, but not limited to, the indictment, the court\u2019s journal entries, the journalized records of the clerk of the court, and the court reporter\u2019s transcript. The court reporter\u2019s transcript, if ordered and certified by the\ncourt, shall be taxed as court costs. If the court dismisses the petition, it shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to such dismissal. If the petition was filed by a person who has been sentenced to death, the findings of fact and conclusions of law shall state specifically the reasons for the dismissal of the petition and of each claim it contains.\n\nR.C. 2953.21(D).\n\n{\u00b641} Accordingly, the trial court was required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law when it dismissed the petition. However, given the last sentence of the above enumerated section, since this is not a death case, the findings of fact and conclusions of law were not needed for each claim. Rather, they were needed for the entire dismissal.\n\n{\u00b642} Appellate courts have stated that when a trial court finds that a hearing is not warranted and dismissed the petition, the trial court must issue findings of fact and conclusions of law sufficient to enable meaningful appellate review. State v. Hull, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2018-L-050, 2019-Ohio-23, \u00b6 38, citing R.C. 2953.21(D) and State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 291-292, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999); State v. Beckwith, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106479, 2018-Ohio-2227, \u00b6 13 (\u201cInsofar as R.C. 2953.21(D) instructs the trial court to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to the dismissal of a petition, \u2018[t]hese findings and conclusions need only \u201capprise the petitioner of the reasons for the trial court's judgment [in order] to permit meaningful appellate review.\u201d\u2019\u201d). A sufficiently detailed judgment entry permits meaningful appellate review. State v. Dennison, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 18CA6, 2018-Ohio-4502, \u00b6 30, citing State ex rel. Carrion v. Harris, 40 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 530 N.E.2d 1330 (1988).\n\n{\u00b643} The trial court does state that the arguments raised by Appellant are not issues outside the scope of the trial and thus, are not properly raised in a post-conviction relief petition. The first portion of that sentence could be deemed a finding of fact. The second portion would be a conclusion of law. While the finding of fact may have been correct to many of the arguments raised in the petition, potentially (and argued by Appellant in the first assignment of error) it was not correct to the ineffective assistance of counsel arguments that are raised on appeal because Appellant does appear to be relying on matters outside the record. However, an incorrect finding on those claims does\nnot mean the judgment entry was inadequate. Rather, it would mean it was potentially incorrect, but reviewable by this court.\n\n{\u00b644} Furthermore, the trial court stated that it agreed with the state\u2019s argument and dismissed the petition. That statement, given the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, could be deemed a finding of fact and conclusion of law. The trial court\u2019s statement in conjunction with the state\u2019s motion permits meaningful appellate review. The state\u2019s opposition motion is well detailed. As set forth above, the state\u2019s motion to dismiss asserted Appellant failed to raise a sufficient constitutional challenge that would require a hearing. As to community bias, it argued the allegation was not a constitutional issue and furthermore, the trial court oversaw the voir dire process and the record demonstrated the jury was not biased. As to Cope\u2019s testimony, the state noted that Cope appeared in jail clothes and testified as to her incarceration. The state asserted the arguments regarding Cope were unsubstantiated speculation. As to the text messages, the state asserted Appellant had access to all text messages through discovery. Furthermore, her argument was an argument regarding the meaning and context of the text messages and thus, did not provide a constitutional foundation for post-conviction review. 11/28/18 Motion.\n\n{\u00b645} As discussed above, the state\u2019s reasoning is the correct basis for determining that the petition should be dismissed without a hearing. The trial court\u2019s judgment could be meaningfully reviewed. Accordingly, this assignment of error is meritless.\n\nConclusion\n\n{\u00b646} Both assignments of error lack merit. The trial court\u2019s decision is affirmed.\n\nWaite, P.J., concurs.\n\nD\u2019Apolito, J., concurs.\nFor the reasons stated in the Opinion rendered herein, the assignments of error are overruled and it is the final judgment and order of this Court that the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Columbiana County, Ohio, is affirmed. Costs taxed against Appellant.\n\nA certified copy of this opinion and judgment entry shall constitute the mandate in this case pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. It is ordered that a certified copy be sent by the clerk to the trial court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\nNOTICE TO COUNSEL\n\nThis document constitutes a final judgment entry."}

GALLAGHER, J.: \n \n On October 14, 2021, the applicant, Alonzo Thorpe, Jr., pursuant to  \nApp.R. 26(B), applied to reopen this court\u2019s judgment in State v. Thorpe, 8th Dist. \nCuyahoga No. 109238, 2021-Ohio-1295, in which this court affirmed his conviction  \nfor reckless homicide.  He now argues that his appellate counsel should have raised \nthe following:  (1) the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the lesser included \noffense of reckless homicide, (2) prosecutorial misconduct denied him his right to a \nfair trial, and (3) appellate counsel failed to secure a complete record, especially \nregarding a juvenile\u2019s testimony.  On November 12, 2021, the state of Ohio filed its \nbrief in opposition.  For the following reasons, this court denies the application. \n On January 6, 2018, then 15-year-old Thorpe went to Garfield \nHeights to babysit his aunt\u2019s daughter, while the aunt went out with a friend.  \nBecause the aunt did not return until after 2:00 a.m., Thorpe stayed the night and \ninto January 7.  Thorpe was still at his aunt\u2019s house when the daughter\u2019s father \npicked her up in the afternoon.  Thorpe later called a friend and briefly showed the \nfriend his aunt\u2019s dead body.  The friend testified that Thorpe was crying and did not \nknow what to do.  The aunt\u2019s body was found on January 8, 2018.  A search of \nThorpe\u2019s room discovered a handgun with Thorpe\u2019s DNA on it and on a round in the \nmagazine.  Forensic testing showed that this handgun fired the shot that killed the \naunt.  \n After being bound over from the juvenile court to the common pleas \ncourt, Thorpe faced two charges of murder and two counts of felonious assault.  The \ntrial judge instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of reckless homicide. \nThe jury convicted him of that charge and found him not guilty on the other three \ncharges.  The trial judge sentenced him to three years on the firearm specification \nconsecutive to 36 months for reckless homicide.   \n Appellate counsel argued the following:  (1) the trial court erred in \ninstructing the jury on the lesser included offense of reckless homicide, (2) the trial \ncourt erred in not instructing the jury on negligent homicide, (3) the trial court erred \nin allowing the ballistics expert to testify in conflict with the court\u2019s ruling on a \nmotion in limine, (4) the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct, (5) the trial \ncourt erred in permitting the ballistics expert to testify outside the scope of his expert \nopinion, (6) the trial court improperly denied the defense\u2019s motion to suppress \nwithout a hearing, and (7) cumulative errors demanded reversal.  \n App.R. 26(B)(1) and (2)(b) require applications claiming ineffective \nassistance of appellate counsel to be filed within 90 days from the journalization of \nthe appellate judgment unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later \ntime.  The Supreme Court of Ohio has ruled that this deadline must be strictly \nenforced.  State v. LaMar, 102 Ohio St.3d 467, 2004-Ohio-3976, 812 N.E.2d 970, \nState v.

In the present case, \nthis court journalized its decision on Apri l 15, 2021.   Thus, the October 14, 2021 \napplication is untimely on its face. \n Thorpe asserts that the application is timely pursuant to App.R. 4, \nwhich is the rule governing when to file the initial appeal, not an application to \nreopen.  Beyond this, he does not discuss timeliness.   \n The court notes that on April 26, 2021, he filed motions for \nreconsideration, for certification of confli ct, and for en banc consideration.

Merz \n \nWARDEN, Chillicothe  \n   Correctional Institution, \n   \n : \n    Respondent. \n REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS  \n  \n This habeas corpus case, brought pro se by Petitioner Danny Green pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254, is before the Court for decision on the merits on the Petition (ECF No. 1), the State Court \nRecord (ECF No. 6) the Return of Writ (ECF No. 7) and Petitioner\u2019s Re ply (ECF No. 8).  The \nMagistrate Judge reference in the case has recen tly been transferred to the undersigned to help \nbalance the Magistrate Judge workload in the Di strict.  Final decision of the case remains with \nDistrict Judge Black. \n \nLitigation History \n \n On  March 6, 2013, a Butler County, Ohio, grand jury indicted Green on four counts of rape of \na person less than 13 years of age in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.02(A)(1)(b); one count of \nattempted sexual battery in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2923.02(A)/2907.03(A)(5); one count of \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 1 of 24  PAGEID #: 10512 \n \ngross sexual imposition in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.05(A)(4); and one count of rape in \nviolation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.02(A)(2)(Indictment, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 1). \n On April 24, 2013, Green pleaded guilty to Counts 1 and 6, charging him with rape in violation \nof Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.02(A)(1)(c). Id. Ex. 10.  Green was sentenced to nine years imprisonment \non each count, to be served concurrently. Id. at Ex. 19.  Green did not file a timely direct appeal.   \n On June 6, 2014, Green filed a pro se Motion to Dismiss the Indictment. Id. at Ex. 22.  The \ntrial court denied the motion (Id. at Ex. 25) and Green did not appeal.  On July 29, 2014, Green filed \nhis first pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea under Ohio R. Crim. P. 32.1.  Id. at Ex. 26.  The trial \ncourt denied the motion and this time Green did appeal, but the Twelfth District Court of Appeals \naffirmed.  State v. Green, 2015-Ohio-2576 (Ohio App. 12 th Dist. 2015).  The appellate court denied \nmotions to certify a conflict and for reconsideration and Green appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio \nwhich declined to accepted jurisdiction.  State v. Green, 143 Ohio St.3d 1502 (2015).   \n On December 11, 2015, Green filed a state court habeas petition in the Ross County Court of \nCommon Pleas which the trial court dismissed (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 87).  Green did \nnot appeal from the dismissal.  However, he file d a second state court habeas corpus petition March \n15, 2019, in the Ohio Court of Appeals for the Fourth District (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. \n88).  That court denied relief. Id. at Ex. 91.  Green appealed and the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed.  \nGreen v. Shoop, 159 Ohio St.3d 439 (2020). \n On May 16, 2016, Green filed a second pro se motion to withdraw guilty plea pursuant to Ohio \nCrim.R. 32.1 (Motion, State Court Record, ECF No. 7, Ex. 51).  The trial court denied the motion. Id. \nat Ex. 57.  Green appealed, but the appellate court affirmed the judgment.  State v. Green, 2017-Ohio-\n2800 (Ohio App. 12th Dist. 2017).  The Twelfth District again denied motions to certify a conflict and \nfor reconsideration (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 62) and Green did not appeal. \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 2 of 24  PAGEID #: 10523 \n \n On August 14, 2017, Green filed a motion for leave to file a delayed direct appeal (State Court \nRecord, Ex. 81) which the appellate court denied. Id. at Ex. 84.  Green did not appeal to the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio. \n On November 29, 2017, Green filed a pro se motion for new sentencing hearing. Id. at Ex. 71.  \nThe trial court denied relief and Green appealed.  However the appellate court affirmed.  State v. Green, \n12th Dist. Butler Cty. No. CA2018-03-051(Aug. 6, 2018)(State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 79) and \nGreen did not appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio. \n The Petition in this case was deposited  in the mail on May 11, 2020 (See postmark at \nPageID 31), and received and docketed by the Clerk on May 13, 2020.  Green pleads the following \ngrounds for relief: \nGround One: The trial court violated Articles I and II of the United \nStates Constitution and the separation of powers doctrine when it \nignored statutory law to unlawfully invoke subject matter \njurisdiction to prosecute and c onvict petitioner denying him due \nprocess and equal protection in vi olation of the Fifth, Sixth and \nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \n \nSupporting Facts: In the present case, no affidavit or complaint \nwas filed to invoke subject matter jurisdiction on the municipal court \nor initiate prosecution. This fact has not been disputed by the State \nin any previous proceedings. After Petitioner\u2019s arrest, the municipal \ncourt, without jurisdiction held a preliminary hearing and bound the \ncase over to the grand jury of the Common Pleas Court for the return \nof the indictment where Petiti oner was subsequently indicted, \nconvicted, and sentenced. All of the proceedings subsequent to \nPetitioner\u2019s arrest were contrary to statutory law and in violation of \nPetitioner\u2019s constitutional due process rights. \n \nGround Two: Petitioner\u2019s gu ilty plea was not  knowingly and \nvoluntarily entered which denied him due process in violation of the \nFifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Am endments to the United States \nConstitution. \n \nSupporting Facts:  Petitioner was indicted on seven counts on \nMarch 13, 2013.  Some of the char ges in the indict ment were the \nsame as allegations that had been  made in the past and had been \ninvestigated by Warren County Children Services (WCCS) in 2005.  \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 3 of 24  PAGEID #: 10534 \n \nAs a result of the investigati on, Petitioner was cleared of any \nwrongdoing.  At his direction, counsel  filed a motion with the trial \ncourt to obtain the WCCS investigative file.  The court denied the \nmotion on April 12, stating it had no jurisdiction to order production \nof WCCS records. \n \nBeing denied proof of his innocence and at the urging of counsel, \nPetitioner reluctantly entered into a plea agreement on April 24.  At \nthe change of plea hearing and as an inducement to enter the guilty \nplea, the court incorrectly informed him that he would be entitled to \nearn credit against his sentence while on good behavior and could \npossibly be released early on e ssentially probation. (The court \ndescribed judicial release.)  In reality the sentence is statutorily \ninelligible [sic] for either earned credit or early release of any kind.   \n \nOne week prior to sentencing, Pe titioner received a copy of the \ntermination letter from the 2005 WCCS investigation.  He promptly \nturned over the letter to counsel who immediately filed a motion to \nwithdraw plea based on the newl y discovered evidence.  At the \nhearing on the motion, the court stayed the proceedings until it could \norder the records produced from WCCS.  (This was what the court \nsaid it had no jurisdiction to do two months earlier.) \n \nAt the continued hearing on the morning of July 22, the court stated \nit was continuing the matter until the afternoon so the parties could \nhave an opportunity to review the file.  Before adjourning, the court \nfelt it was necessary \u201cto take this opportunity\u201d to relay certain \ninformation for Petitioner to cons ider during the break.  The court \ntold him that while certain of the information in the file did appear \nto be favorable, the court considered the motion \u201cto be a be-careful- \nwhat-you-wish-for\u201d motion.  The court went on to say whether the \nmotion were ruled on for or against him, the sentence would likely \nend up resulting in \u201ca graver sentence\u201d than what the court intended \nto impose otherwise.   \n \nOnly a few minutes after adjourning and before Petitioner and \ncounsel had an opportunity to review the file, counsel and the \nprosecuting attorney were called into chambers for a conference.  \nUpon returning, counsel informed Petitioner that the judge had \nreviewed the file and offered th at in exchange for voluntarily \ndismissing the motion, the court wo uld find him the lowest level \noffender and run the sentences concurrent.  Petitioner objected in \nlight of the evidence that proved him innocent on some of the \ncharges and called the remaining ones into que stion.  Counsel told \nhim that the judge had indicated he tended to agree with the State\u2019s \nargument to deny the motions and if they were not voluntarily \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 4 of 24  PAGEID #: 10545 \n \ndismissed, he would most likely deny the motions and sentence the \nPetitioner to the maximum on both charges and run the sentences \nconsecutively; a twenty year agregate [sic] sentence.  Under duress \nand with no real choice, Petitioner agreed to dismiss the motions and \ncontinue with the plea. \n \nWith the exception of the conversation with counsel, all of these \nfacts are in the record.  The plea was not knowing when exculpatory \ninformation that Petitioner s ought to prove his innocence was \nwithheld from him.  Had the WCCS file been available when it was \nrequested, he would not have entered in to the plea agreement and \nwould have insisted on going to trial.  The plea was further not \nknowingly entered when the trial court gave incorrect sentencing \ninformation to induce the plea.  The voluntary nature of the plea was \nremoved when the judge threatened a \u201cgraver sentence\u201d if the \nPetitioner went forward with the motions and insisted on exercising \nhis constitutional rights.    \n \nGround Three: Petitioner has been deni ed due process and equal \nprotection in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution where he has been denied the right to an appeal of \nhis conviction.  \n \nSupporting Facts: Ohio has guaranteed to all criminal defendants the \nright to appeal their conviction or sentence. Federal Courts have held \nthat this right does not exist in a vacuum and criminal defendants must \nbe notified of their appellate rights before they can be waived or \nforfeited.  \n \nAt the sentencing hearing the court did not inform Petitioner of his \nappellate rights nor was he informed of those rights anytime by his \ncounsel. After learning of his right to request leave to file delayed \nappeal, Petitioner did so, which motion the appellate court denied. \nFollowing well established case law precedent, he filed a motion for a \nlimited new sentencing hearing for the court to advise him of his \nappellate rights. The trial court denied the motion and the appellate \ncourt affirmed without publication or serving Petitioner with a copy of \nits decision. \n \n(Petition, ECF No. 1, PageID 7-13.) \n \n \n \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 5 of 24  PAGEID #: 10556 \n \nAnalysis \n \nStatute of Limitations \n \n Respondent asserts that the Pe tition was not timely filed and is therefore barred under the \nstatute of limitations (Answer/Return of Writ, ECF No. 7, PageID 939-46).  \n Petitioner divides his response on this issue between appeal-based claims (Ground Three) \nand conviction-based claims (Grounds One and Two).  As to the former, he asserts the trigger date \nis September 12, 2017 (Reply, ECF No. 11, PageID 1028) .  As to the latter, he claims a trigger \ndate of November 13, 2014, but the benefit of both statutory and equitable tolling; he forgoes any \nactual innocence argument. Id. at PageID 1028-31.   \n A statute of limitations was first enacted for habeas corpus cases in the Antiterrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214)(the \"AEDPA\").  As \ncodified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), the AEDPA provides: \n(1) A 1-year period of limitation shal l apply to an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus by a pe rson in custody pursuant to the \njudgment of a State court.  The limitation period shall run from \nthe latest of \u2014 \n \n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the \nconclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for \nseeking such review; \n \n(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an \napplication created by State action in violation of the \nConstitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the \napplicant was prevented from filing by such State action; \n \n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was \ninitially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has \nbeen newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made \nretroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 6 of 24  PAGEID #: 10567 \n \n \n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or \nclaims presented could have  been discovered through the \nexercise of due diligence. \n \n(2) The time during which a properly filed application for State post-\nconviction or other coll ateral review with respect to the pertinent \njudgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period \nof limitation under this subsection. \n \n Green\u2019s appeal-based claim is his Ground Three where he a sserts the trial court did not \ninform him at sentencing of his right to appeal, the Twelfth District denied him a delayed appeal, \nand the trial court later refused to reopen the judgment and re-sentence him to start the appeal time \nrunning again.  He asserts the \u201ctrigger date\u201d for this claim is September 12, 2017, which is the date \nthe Twelfth District denied leave for a delayed appeal (Reply, ECF No. 11, PageID 1028, relying \non DiCenzi v. Rose, 452 F.3d 465 (6th Cir. 2006), which supports that proposition).  See also Sexton \nv. Wainwright, 968 F.3d 607 (6th Cir. 2020).   \n Prima facie, Green\u2019s appeal-b ased claim is barred by the statute of limitations because 972 \ndays elapsed between September 12, 2017, and May 11, 2020.  However,  Green claims that only \n198 of those days are not tolled (ECF No. 11, PageID 1028).  With respect to his conviction-based \nclaims, he asserts only 245 non-tolled days have expired. Id. at PageID 1030.  Green claims his \nright to tolling is \u201cestablished in his Petition\u201d (Reply, ECF No. 11, PageID 1027).  His reference \nis presumably to his Case History Timeline, a ta ble appearing as an att achment to the Petition \n(ECF No. 1, PageID 20).  For reasons set forth be low, the Magistrate Judge is not persuaded the \ntable shows the tolling times Petitioner claims.   \n Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), the statute of lim itations begins to run when a conviction is \nfinal on direct review unless a later date is show n.  In this case that date is August 30, 2013, the \ndate on which his time to file an appeal of right expired.  With that as the finality date, the \u201ctrigger \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 7 of 24  PAGEID #: 10578 \n \ndate\u201d for \u00a7 2244(d) purposes, th e statute would have expired September 1, 2014, as to Grounds \nOne and Two. \n Before then, on June 6, 2014, Green filed a mo tion to dismiss the indictment.  Respondent \nargues that this filing did not toll the statute of  limitations because it wa s not \u201cproperly filed\u201d \nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) in that the trial court denied it as untimely (Return, ECF No. \n7, PageID 943).  Petitioner refers to this argument in his Reply where he asserts \u201cDanny\u2019s motion \nwas not a collateral filing, was not considered untimely by the court, and was in fact properly filed \nin accordance with state law.\u201d (ECF No. 11, PageID 1028-29). \n Green made this Motion under Ohio R. Crim.  P. 48(B)(Motion to Dismiss, State Court \nRecord, ECF No. 6, PageID 92).  In opposing the Motion, the prosecutor argued the trial court was \nrequired to treat it as a peti tion for post-conviction relief un der Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2953.21 \n(Memo Contra, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, PageID 133, relying on State v. Schlee, 117 Ohio \nSt. 3d 153 (2008)).  The trial cour t found this argument persuasive  and that Green\u2019s Motion to \nDismiss was required to have been filed by February 26, 2014 1 (Decision, State Court Record, \nECF No. 6, PageID 142).  Since it had not been filed until June 6, 2014, it was untimely and the \ncourt was without jurisdiction to entertain it, per Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2953.23. Id. at PageID 143.  \nGreen did not appeal, making the trial court\u2019s decisi on on this point final.  On questions of state \nlaw, federal habeas courts ar e bound by state court decisions.  Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U.S. 74 \n(2005).  In Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408 (2005), the Court held that a postconviction petition \nrejected by the state courts as untimely is not \u201cproperly filed\u201d within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).  \nAccord, Allen v. Siebert,  552 U.S. 3 (2007)(an untimely post-c onviction petition is not properly \n \n1 The statute of limitations for a petition under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2953.21 was at the time 180 days from the date \non which the defendant\u2019s time to appeal expired if no appeal had been taken.  That date has subsequently been amended \nto 365 days. \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 8 of 24  PAGEID #: 10589 \n \nfiled regardless of whether the time element is jurisdictional or an affirmative defense).  Since the \nMotion to Dismiss was not properly filed, it does not toll the time under \u00a7 2244(d)(2). \n Green\u2019s second attempt to set aside his conviction was his first Motion to withdraw his \nguilty plea, filed July 29, 2014, which he made under Ohio R. Crim. P. 32.1 (State Court Record, ECF \nNo. 6, Ex. 26).  By this time 333 days had expired of the one-year statute and only thirty-two days \nremained.  The trial court did not find the Motion untimely, but dealt with it on the merits, albeit finding \nmost claims were barred by res judicata (Decision, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 30).  The \nTwelfth District Court of Appeals also affirmed on the merits.  State v. Green, 2015-Ohio-2576 (Ohio \nApp. 12th Dist. 2015).  The Supreme Court of Ohio declined jurisdiction on October 28, 2015 (Entry, \nState Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 50).  None of th e Ohio courts involved disposed of Green\u2019s first \nMotion to Withdraw as improperly filed.  Therefore under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) he is entitled to statutory tolling \nfrom July 29, 2014, through October 28, 2015. \n Green\u2019s next filing was his first state habeas  corpus petition filed December 11, 2015.  (State \nCourt Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 87).  That was forty-four days after the Supreme Court Entry on the \nMotion to Withdraw Plea and therefore twelve days after the statute had run.  Whether or not state \nhabeas corpus is a qualifying post-conviction filing under \u00a7 2244(d)(2), no such filing revives a claim \nwhich is already time barred. \n Since the statute of limitations, tolled by the First Motion to Withdraw, expired on November \n29, 2015, Green must excuse the delay between then and May 11, 2020, more than four years, by \nequitable tolling.  The Supreme Court has confirmed that equitable tolling is available to toll the \u00a7 \n2244 statute of limitations.  Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S.  631, 645 (2010). \n \u201cEquitable tolling allows courts to review ti me-barred habeas petitions \u2018provided that a \nlitigant\u2019s failure to meet a legally-mandated deadline unavoidably aros e from circumstances \nbeyond that litigant\u2019s control.\u2019\u201d  Keeling v. Warden , 673 F.3d 452, 462 (6 th Cir. 2012), quoting \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 9 of 24  PAGEID #: 105910 \n \nRobertson v. Simpson , 624 F.3d 781, 783 (6th Cir. 2010)) .  A petitioner\u2019s pro se status, limited \nlaw library access, and lack of knowledge of the law do not constitute extraordinary circumstances \nto excuse late filing.  Keeling, Hall v. Warden, 662 F.3d 745, 751-52 (6th Cir. 2011). \n Green does little to flesh out his claim of equitable tolling, apparently because he believes \nhe is entitled to statutory tolling for most of the time after November 13, 2014,  based on the many \nstate court challenges he filed after his First Motion to Withdraw (See Reply, ECF No. 11, PageID \n1030).  But the question must be whether these we re properly filed efforts to set aside the \nconviction.  They were not. \n As noted above Green filed his first state court habeas petition on December 11, 2015.  That \nwas after expiration of the statute as calculated above.  But even if it were not, any statutory tolling \nwould have expired when Green failed to appeal from denial of the petition; his time to do so expired \nMay 19, 2016, thirty days after the trial court deni ed the petition (Journal Entry, State Court Record, \nECF No. 6, Ex. 87). \n Green filed a second state court habeas corpus petition March 15, 2019, in the Ohio Court of \nAppeals for the Fourth District (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 88).  That court denied relief. Id. \nat Ex. 91.  It reasoned that habeas corpus was not a proper remedy for claims that could have been \nraised on direct appeal or petition for post-c onviction relief under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2953.21. Id. \nat PageID 751-52.  It also found the claims procedurally barred by res judicata because of Green\u2019s first \nhabeas petition.  Id. at PageID 752.  Green appealed and the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed on both \ngrounds.  Green v. Shoop, 159 Ohio St.3d 439 (2020).   \n Applying the logic of DiCenzi and Sexton, supra, to the extent Green is claiming the denial \nof a delayed appeal violated his constitutional rights, he knew of the fact of that denial \u2013 a factual \npremise for that claim \u2013 shortly after it occurred on September 12, 2017.  Green did not appeal and \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 10 of 24  PAGEID #: 106011 \n \nhis time to do so expired forty- five days later on October 27, 2017.  He did not file his appeal-\nbased claim here until he included it in his Petition on May 11, 2020, thirty months later.   \n It is certainly true that Petitioner initiated a great many state court filings attempting to get \nhis conviction overturned.  However, that does not, indeed cannot, constitute due diligence.  To \ncount them in that way would completely undermine the statute of limitations.  Green was rebuffed \nin every one of his state filings, either procedur ally or substantively.  If a petitioner could get \nequitable tolling credit for ever y state court filing, regardless of  how outside ordinary state post-\nconviction practice or how many tim es he had been turned down on the merits, the statute of \nlimitations would run forever as long as some  clerk of courts w ould accept a filing from a \ndefendant with his original case number on it. \n It is no answer for Green to claim that he wa s required to exhaust state court remedies.  The \npendency of a state court proceeding attacking a cr iminal judgment is no bar to filing a habeas \npetition and the Supreme Court ha s expressly recognized that such  premature petitions can be \nstayed pending the outcome of state exhaustion efforts.  Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269 (2005).   \n It is therefore recommended that the Petition herein be dismissed as  to all three Grounds \nfor Relief as barred by the statute of limitations. \n \nGround One:  Lack of Trial Court Jurisdiction \n \n In his First Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims the trial court, the Butler County Court of \nCommon Pleas, did not have jurisd iction to try and convict him because of lack of a proper \naffidavit and complaint in the municipal court to initiate these proceedings. \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 11 of 24  PAGEID #: 106112 \n \n The State Court Record contains a Transcript  of Proceedings in the Middletown Municipal \nCourt in this case (State Court R ecord, ECF No. 6, Ex. 1).  The Tran script recites that an Officer \nJanice Jones appeared before a Deputy Clerk of that  court on January 23, 2013, and made some \nallegation, not disclosed, against Green having to do with a charge of rape.  The Transcript recites \nfurther that an arrest warrant was issued to Officer Jones, that Green was arrested on the warrant \nand arraigned on January 25, 2013, that a preliminary hearing was held on February 1, 2013, that \nGreen was then bound over to the Butler County grand jury and committed to jail in lieu of bond.  \nThe Transcript contains the conformed signature of Middletown Municipal Judge Mark Wall and \nthe February 6, 2013, Certificate of the Clerk of the Municipal Court, Stephen Longworth.  The \nTranscript was filed the next day with the Butler County Clerk of Courts Mary Swain. Id.  \n Although Green filed a post-conviction Motion to Dismiss the Indictment on June 6, 2014, \nhe raised no claim about the m unicipal court process (State C ourt Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 22).  \nNor did he raised this claim in his First Motion to Withdraw (Id. at Ex. 26) or his Second Motion \nto Withdraw ( Id. at Ex. 51).  The claim is  not mentioned in the deci sion denying his First State \nHabeas Corpus Petition. Id. at Ex. 87.  The claim was apparent ly first raised in Green\u2019s Second \nState Habeas Corpus Petition filed March 15, 2019. Id. at Ex. 88.  The Fourth District decided that \nclaim as follows: \nIn his petition , Green asserts that his conviction is void because the \ntrial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and therefore he is being \ndetained illegally and entitled to release. Specifically, Green asserts \nthat the State of Ohio failed to file a criminal complaint against him \nand, accordingly, \"the jurisdiction of the Middletown Municipal \nCourt was never invoked and all subsequent proceedings were void \nab initio and a nullity.\" And because no criminal complaint was \nfiled, the case was not properly before the grand jury and no proper \nindictment was returned.  Green c ontends that he has no remedy in \nthe ordinary course of law becau se no appeal can be taken from a \nvoid judgment and claims regarding subject matter jurisdiction are \nnot barred by res judicata. \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 12 of 24  PAGEID #: 106213 \n \n \nAs Warden Shoop notes in his motion, it  is well settled that \"(a]ny \ndefect cause[d] by the alleged failure to file criminal complaints or \nthe claimed impropriety of the municipal court's assumption of \njurisdiction over (criminal] charge s is not cognizable in habeas \ncorpus.\" Boylen v. Bradshaw, 108 Ohio St .3d 184, 2006-Ohio-181, \n842 N.E.2d 49, at \u00b6 5. citing Harris v. Bagley , 97 Ohio St.3d 98, \n2002-0hio-5369, 776 N.E.2d 490 at \u00b6 3, quoting Taylor v. Mitchell \n(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 453, 454, 727 N.E.2d 905.  Further, Green \nentered into a plea agreement with the State whereby the originally \ncharged and indicted offenses were amended to reduce the \nmaximum potential prison sentence. Green at \u00b6 25 . By pleading to \nthe amended charges, Green waived any challenges to the \nindictment. Id. \n \nRes judicata also bars Green's petition insofar as he raises claims \nthat he raised or could have raised  in his previous petition filed in \nthe Ross County Court of Common Pleas. Nedea v. Cook. 4th Dist. \nHocking No. 15CA 12, 2015-0hio-3668, at \u00b6 12 (citations omitted). \nRes judicata  \"is applicable to successi ve habeas corpus petitions \nbecause habeas corpus petitioners have the right to appeal adverse \njudgments in habeas corpus cases.\" Id., citing State ex rel. Childs v \nLazaroff, 90 Ohio St.3d 519, 520, 739 N.E.2d 802 (2001). Thus, \neven if Green's claim regarding the lack of a criminal complaint was \ncognizable in habeas corpus, he could have raised this claim in his \nearlier petition and it is now barred by res judicata. \n \n(Decision, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, PageID 752-53). \n This time Green did appeal to the Ohio S upreme Court which affirmed on both points made \nby the Fourth District, holding: \n [*P6]  The court of appeals' analysis is correct in both respects. Res \njudicata bars Green's 2019 habeas corpus petition because he filed \nan earlier petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he could have \nraised any cognizable claim that he had, Bevins v. Richard, 144 Ohio \nSt. 3d 54, 2015-Ohio-2832, 40 N.E.3d 1108, \u00b6 4 . In addition, the \nclaims raised in Green's 2019 petition were not cognizable in habeas \ncorpus. \"Any defect caused by the a lleged failure to file criminal \ncomplaints or the  claimed impropriety of the municipal court's \nassumption of jurisdiction over * * * rape charges is not cognizable \nin habeas corpus.\" Taylor v. Mitchell, 88 Ohio St.3d 453, 454, 2000-\nOhio-380, 727 N.E.2d 905 (2000) . Green was convicted and \nsentenced upon indictments, and the trial court had jurisdiction over \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 13 of 24  PAGEID #: 106314 \n \nhis case. Boylen v. Bradshaw, 108 Ohio St. 3d 181, 2006-Ohio-549, \n842 N.E.2d 49, \u00b6 5. \n \nGreen v. Shoop, 159 Ohio St. 439 (2020). \n \n The question of which Ohio courts have subj ect matter jurisdiction over what kinds of cases \nand what are the prerequisites for exercise of that jurisdiction are questions of state law on which \nthe federal courts  are bound by state court decisions.  Bradshaw, supra.  Federal courts cannot \nsecond guess those decisions or review them as if we sat as appellate courts.  Rather, habeas corpus \ncourts sit only to decide wh ether persons are confined in violation of the United States \nConstitution.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); Wilson v. Corcoran, 562 U.S. 1 (2010); Lewis v. Jeffers, 497 \nU.S. 764, 780 (1990); Smith v. Phillips , 455 U.S. 209 (1982), Barclay v. Florida, 463 U.S. 939 \n(1983).    \n In his Reply Green states the truism that courts are obliged to follow the law.  True as that \nmay be, not every failure of a stat e court to follow state law results  in a violation of the United \nStates Constitution.  \u201cA state cannot be said to have a federal due process obligation to follow all \nof its procedures; such a system would result in  the constitutionalizing of every state rule, and \nwould not be administrable.\u201d  Levine v. Torvik, 986 F.2d 1506, 1515 (6th Cir. 1993). \n Green\u2019s First Ground for Relief therefore fails  on the merits and should be dismissed on \nthat basis.  Alternatively, it is also barred by his procedural defau lt in failing to raise it any time \nbefore his Second State Habeas Corpus Petition.  As both appellate cour ts held, the claim was \nbarred by res judicata.  Ohio\u2019s doctrine of res judicata in criminal case s, enunciated in State v. \nPerry, 10 Ohio St. 2d 175 (1967), has been repeatedly held by the Sixth Circuit to be an adequate \nand independent state ground of decision.  Durr v. Mitchell , 487 F.3d 423, 432 (6 th Cir. 2007); \nBuell v. Mitchell, 274 F.3d 337 (6th Cir. 2001); Coleman v. Mitchell, 268 F.3d 417 (6th Cir. 2001); \nByrd v. Collins, 209 F.3d 486, 521-22 (6 th Cir. 2000); Rust v. Zent, 17 F.3d 155, 160-61 (6 th Cir. \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 14 of 24  PAGEID #: 106415 \n \n1994)(citation omitted); Van Hook v. Anderson, 127 F. Supp. 2d 899, 913 (S.D. Ohio 2001). \n \nGround Two:  Invalid Guilty Plea \n \n In his Second Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts his guilty plea is invalid.  In his \nSupporting Facts he asserts that records of an investigation conducted by the Warren County, Ohio, \nChildren Services (\u201cWCCS\u201d) in 2005 cleared him of at least some of the wrongdoing alleged in \nthe Indictment.  Despite an effort to obtain that file, his trial judge held on April 12, 2013, that he \ndid not have jurisdiction to obtain those records.  Green pleaded guilty on April 24, 2013.  Then, \na week prior to sentencing, he received the termination letter from the WCCS investigation.  On \nthat basis his counsel filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea. At a chambers conference during \na hearing on that motion, the tria l judge allegedly made promises about leniency in sentencing if \nthe motion to withdraw the plea were itself withdrawn.  On advice of counsel, Green withdrew the \nmotion.  He now claims his guilty plea was unknow ing because (1) the exculpatory WCCS file \nwas withheld (2) the judge misstated sentencing in formation to induce the plea.  Furthermore the \nplea became involuntary when the judge threatened a graver sentence if the motion were not \nwithdrawn.  \n Green first raised related claims in his first post-conviction Motion to Withdraw Guilty \nPlea filed June 29, 2014 (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 26).  He reiterated the arguments he \nhad made in his post-convicti on Motion to Dismiss Indictment  about the vagueness of the \nIndictment. Id. at PageID 147.  He complains that on th e day of the heari ng on the motion to \nwithdraw, he was only allowed to  see a small portion of the W CCS file and given only twenty \nminutes to make up his mind about whether to go forward. Id. at PageID 148.  He structured a \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 15 of 24  PAGEID #: 106516 \n \nlarge part of his argument  around the claim that he wa s entitled to relief under State v. Mancini, \n1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 17 (8th Dist. 1993). Id. at PageID 149-51.  Next he accused his attorney of \nineffective assistance of trial counsel for not sharing the WCCS file with him until January 2014. \nId. at PageID 152.  He also accused the prosecutor of misconduct under Brady v. Maryland, 373 \nU.S. 83 (1963).  Significantly, neither the Motion  nor Green\u2019s supporting Affidavit contains any \nallegations of threats by the trial judge of the sort alleged in the Petition. \n In denying the Motion to Withdr aw, the trial court found that Mancini was not the \ncontrolling law on lesser includ ed offenses in light of Stacy v. Van Coren , 18 Ohio St. 2d 188 \n(1969), and the remainder of Green\u2019s  claims were barred by res judicata because they could have \nbeen raised on direct appeal but were not (Decision, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 30). \n On appeal, Green argued as his First Assignmen t of Error that his first Motion to Withdraw \nshould have been treated as a pre-sentence motion -- which is subject to different standards than a \npost-sentence motion to withdraw -- because the judgment of the trial court imposing sentence was \nnot a final appealable order.  The appellate c ourt overruled that Assignment on the basis of Ohio \nlaw.  State v. Green, 2015-Ohio-2576, \u00b6\u00b6 7-17 (Ohio App. 12th Dist. 2015).  In his Second Assignment \nof Error he claimed the trial court had not properly applied Mancini, supra.  The Twelfth District held \nthat Van Coren rather than Mancini was the applicable precedent and that Green\u2019s guilty plea was \nknowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 18-27.  The Supreme Court of Ohio declined review \n(Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 50). \n Green filed his second post-conviction Motion to Withdraw on May 16, 2016 (State Court \nRecord, ECF No. 6, Ex. 51).  He claimed it should be treated as a pre-sentence motion to withdraw \ndespite the prior ruling of the Twelfth District that the sentencing judgment was a final appealable \norder.  He complained that the trial judge had misinformed him about the possible sentences.  He still \nmade no claim that the trial judge had threatened him with a \u201cgraver sentence\u201d to get him to withdraw \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 16 of 24  PAGEID #: 106617 \n \nhis pre-sentence motion to withdraw.  The trial judge held that, under the law of the case doctrine, he \nwas bound by the prior finding of the appellate court that Green\u2019s plea was knowing, intelligent, and \nvoluntary (Decision, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 57). \n On appeal, Green argued that neither res judicata nor the law of the case doctrine applied \nbecause the sentencing judgment was void.  State v. Green, 2017-Ohio-2800, \u00b68 (Ohio App. 12th Dist. \n2017).  The appellate court found several of Green\u2019s assertions about the sentencing judgment to be \ncorrect, but that did not lead to the judgment\u2019s being void: \n [*P10]  Appellant is correct that hi s conviction for rape carried a \nmandatory prison sentence under R.C. 2929.13(F)(2)  and that he \nwas not eligible for community control, judicial release, or earned \ncredit. See State v. Silvers , 181 Ohio App.3d 26, 2009-Ohio-687, \n907 N.E.2d 805 (2d Dist.) . Appellant is also correct that the trial \ncourt failed to comply with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a)  during its plea \ncolloquy when it misinform ed appellant he coul d be eligible for \nearned credit and could receive community control. However, \ncontrary to appellant's assertion, the trial cour t's failure to comply \nwith Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) did not result in his guilty plea being void. \n \nId. The trial court\u2019s errors, the Twelfth District found, rendered the sentencing judgment voidable, \nbut not void. Id. at \u00b6 12.  Therefore Green\u2019s claims in his second motion to withdraw were found \nbarred by res judicata. Id. at \u00b6 14.  Green did not appeal.   \n Green next moved for a new sentencing hearing because of asserted infirmities in the \nsentencing entry (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 71).  In this Moti on Green again attacked \nthe sentencing judgment and the trial judge\u2019s failure to advise him orally of his right to appeal, but \nnot of any colloquy at the pre- sentence motion to withdraw h earing.  He again claimed the \nsentencing judgment was void, despite  the Twelfth District\u2019s holding to the contrary that it was \nmerely voidable. Id. at PageID 510.  The trial judge denied the Motion on the basis of res judicata \nand the \u201cwell-established law that failure to advise a defendant of his right to appeal does not void \na sentence.\u201d  (Decision, State Court Record, ECF No. 6-1, Ex. 74, Page ID 570).  The Twelfth \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 17 of 24  PAGEID #: 106718 \n \nDistrict affirmed without opinion. Id. at Ex. 79.   \n In his first State Habeas Corpus Petition, Green  raised the \u201cgraver sentence\u201d threat and the \nBrady claim.  The trial court 2 held habeas corpus was not an available remedy because the \nconvicting court had subject matte r jurisdiction and Green was not  claiming he was being held \nbeyond expiration of his sentenced  term of imprisonm ent (Journal Entry, ECF No. 6-1, Ex. 87, \nPageID 675).   \n Green did not appeal, but filed his second state habeas corpus petition in the Fourth District \nCourt of Appeals3.  As noted above, that petition focused on the claim that the Butler County Court \nof Common Pleas did not have subject matter jurisdiction because of the incomplete filings in the \nMiddletown Municipal Court (State Court Record, ECF No. 6-1, Ex. 88, PageID 682).  The Fourth \nDistrict found that Ohio habeas corpus relief was limited in the same ways the Ross County Court \nof Common Pleas had found as to the first state habeas petition, i.e., lack of subject matter \njurisdiction in the convicting court or expiration of the sentence.  State v. Green,  Case No. \n19CA3675 (4th Dist. Jun. 28, 2019)(unreported; copy at State Court Record 6-1, Ex. 91, PageID \n750, citing Heddleston v . Mack, 84 Ohio St.3d 213,214 (1998).  The Fourth District rejected \nGreen\u2019s lack of jurisdiction argument. Id.  The Supreme Court of Ohio  affirmed on the basis of \nthe Fourth District\u2019s analysis.  Green v. Shoop, supra. \n From this lengthy review of th e litigation history, the Magistrate Judge concludes Petitioner \nhas procedurally defaulted in presenting this claim to the state courts.  His claim that the sentencing \njudgment is void for various reasons has been repeatedly rejected by the Ohio courts on the basis \nof Ohio criminal res judicata.  His \u201cgraver sentence\u201d threat claim was presented in his first state \n \n2 In this case the Court of Common Pleas of Ross County, Ohio, which has jurisdiction of habeas claims filed by \nprisoners at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution. \n \n3 The Fourth District includes Ross County, the county in which Green was then and is now incarcerated. \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 18 of 24  PAGEID #: 106819 \n \nhabeas petition, but he did not appeal from the adverse decision and thereby procedurally defaulted \nthat claim by not fairly presenting it to the Oh io courts for one full round of review.  His Brady \nclaim relating to the WCCS  file and his related cl aim of ineffective assi stance of trial counsel \nbecause his attorney did not share the file with  him has, so far as the Magistrate Judge can \ndetermine, never been presented to the Ohio courts. \n Therefore in addition to recommending Ground Two be dismissed as barred by the statute \nof limitations, the Magistrate Judge recommends it be dismissed with prej udice as procedurally \ndefaulted. \n \nGround Three:  Denial of Right to Appeal \n \n In his Third Ground for Relief, Green claims he was unconstitutionally denied his right to \nappeal his conviction. \n Green never attempted to appeal from his Ju ly 2013 Judgment of Conviction until he filed \nhis Motion for Leave to File Delayed Appeal  on August 14, 2017, more than four years later \n(Motion for Delayed Appeal, State Court Recor d, ECF No. 6-1, Ex. 81).  In the Motion Green \nacknowledged his understanding that to warrant a delayed appeal, he would have to show why he \ndid not appeal within the thirty  days to appeal of right. Id. at PageID 651.  He claimed it was \nbecause he had not been notified \u201cof his appellate rights at the sentencing hearing.\u201d Id.  As to the \nfour-year subsequent delay, he noted the many other filings he had made during the interim.  He \nclaimed he became aware of the possibility of a delayed appeal only when the Twelfth District \naffirmed denial of his second motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Id. at PageID 652.  The Twelfth \nDistrict denied the delayed appeal without opinion on September 12, 2017.  \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 19 of 24  PAGEID #: 106920 \n \n As noted above, Green did not appeal from this decision.  He claims that is because the \ndecision was never served on him and the non-service constitutes a state-created impediment to \nexhausting his remedies (Petition, ECF No. 1, PageID 13).  However,  this claim is not plausible \nbecause Green plainly knew of the Twelfth District\u2019s decision:  on September 29, 2017, he filed a \nRequest for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law which references the September 12, 2017, \ndecision (Request, ECF No. 6-1, Ex. 85).  He does not explain how he knew of the decision if he \nwas not served a copy.  He claims he twice asked for copies (Petition, ECF No. 1, PageID 13), but \ndoes not say when or provide any corroborative documentation. \n Green asserts that is it \u201cwell settled that this Court has held that a trial court\u2019s failure to \ninform a defendant of his appellate rights is cause for [to excuse] procedural default.\u201d (Reply, ECF \nNo. 11, PageID 1042, citing Walker v. Warden, Lake Erie Cor. Inst., 2016 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 33265 \n(S.D. Ohio Mar. 15, 2016)).  In that decision, Di strict Judge Michael R. Barrett of this Court \nadopted a recommendation by the undersigned that  Petitioner Walker be granted an appeal.  \nWalker\u2019s claim was not that he had been denied an appeal, but that he had been denied appointment \nof counsel on appeal, a right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment on criminal appeals of right.  \nDouglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963).  The undersigned had initially recommended the claim \nbe dismissed because Walker had never requested appointment of counsel, but then Walker filed \nan additional document showing he had made the request and the tr ial judge had not acted on it.  \nWalker, supra, at *3-4. \nIn the course of adopting the undersigne d\u2019s recommendation, Judge Barrett wrote \u201cThere \nis no dispute in this case that the trial court fa iled to inform Petitioner of his right to counsel on \nappeal.\u201d  Id. at *13.  He noted that Walker had signed a form much like the one signed by Green \nthat acknowledged he had been advised of his appellate rights. Id. at n.1.  However, apparently \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 20 of 24  PAGEID #: 107021 \n \nRespondent did not claim that acknowledgement was sufficient and Judge Barrett did not want to \nreach that conclusion sua sponte.  In this case the Respondent has claimed the acknowledgement \nis sufficient and a number of the state decisions in this case have relied on the acknowledgment. \nIn the absence of some showing that a defendant is illiterate, there is no reason why an oral \nadvisement of the right to appeal should be considered superior to a written advisement, much less \nthat both should be required. \nGreen claims that the Sixth Circuit has held  that written acknowledgement of the type \nsigned by Green is not sufficient (Reply, ECF No. 11, PageID 1043).  However, he cites no \nauthority for that proposition.   \n The Magistrate Judge concludes that, in addition to being barred by the statute of \nlimitations, Ground Three is also barred by Green\u2019s procedural default in not appealing to the Ohio \nSupreme Court. \n Alternatively, Ground Three is without merit.  Green\u2019s premise for this Ground for Relief \nis that he was never notified of his right to appeal.  That premise is belied by the following language \nin the Plea of Guilty and Jury Waiver:  \u201cI understand my right to appeal a maximum sentence and \nmy other limited appellate rights, and further understand that any appeal must be filed within thirty \n(30) days of my sentence.\u201d This language a ppears immediately above Green\u2019s signature on the \nform. (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 10, PageID 64).  Green was not given a maximum \nsentence and thus he is correct in  saying that he did not have a righ t to appeal on that basis.  But \nthe acknowledgement goes on to speak of \u201cother limited appellate rights,\u201d i.e., appellate rights on \na basis other than imposition of the maximum sentence.  And the acknowledgment continue to say \nthat \u201cany appeal must be filed within thirty (3 0) days,\u201d reinforcing th e distinction between an \nappeal based on imposition of the maximum sentence and other appeals. \nCase: 1:20-cv-00381-TSB-MRM Doc #: 15 Filed: 01/13/21 Page: 21 of 24  PAGEID #: 107122 \n \n Of course a person who pleads gu ilty has only \u201climited appellate rights.\u201d  He or she cannot \ncomplain on appeal, for example, that the Stat e presented insufficient evidence or intentionally \nexcluded Black people from the jury.  Those cons titutional claims would be fully preserved for \nappeal if a defendant had gone to trial (See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979), and Batson \nv. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986)).   \n The Guilty Plea and Jury Waiver form is probably the most important piece of paper \nPetitioner has ever signed.  He will not be heard to say he did not read it carefully.  In fact he \nrepresented to Judge Powers that he had read it (Transcript, State C ourt Record, ECF No. 6-2, \nPageID 915).  If he did not understand his appellate rights, despite acknowledging that he did, he \nshould certainly have asked his lawy er or the trial judge what thos e rights were.  In fact, Judge \nPowers asked him if he had any questions before taking his plea.  Id. at PageID 916.  He does not \nclaim he ever asked any questions.   \n Instead he claims the trial judge never orally advised him of his \u201climited appellate rights.\u201d \nNo such advice appears in the Transcript of Sentencing Hearing (State Court Record, ECF No. 6-\n2, PageID 877, et seq., incorrectly labeled in the State Court Record as \u201cChange of Plea Hearing\u201d).  \nNor does it appear in the Transcript of Change of Plea Hearing4 (State Court Record, ECF No. 6-\n2, PageID 914, et seq. incorrectly labeled as \u201cSentencing Hearing.\u201d)  But as noted above, Green \ncites no authority for the propositio n that an oral advice of a ppellate rights is constitutionally \nrequired. \n At a more fundamental level, there is no federal constitutional right to appellate review of \na criminal judgment.

Durston, 153 U.S. 684 (1894), ci ted as still good law in  Lopez \n \n4 The copy of this transcript in the State Court Record is incomplete, beginning on page 11 as the court reporter \nnumbered the pages.

GREEN,\n\nPetitioner, : Case No. 1:20-cv-381\n\n- vs -\n\nWARDEN, Chillicothe\nCorrectional Institution,\n\n: Respondent.\n\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThis habeas corpus case, brought pro se by Petitioner Danny Green pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, is before the Court for decision on the merits on the Petition (ECF No. 1), the State Court Record (ECF No. 6) the Return of Writ (ECF No. 7) and Petitioner\u2019s Reply (ECF No. 8). The Magistrate Judge reference in the case has recently been transferred to the undersigned to help balance the Magistrate Judge workload in the District. Final decision of the case remains with District Judge Black.\n\nLitigation History\n\nOn March 6, 2013, a Butler County, Ohio, grand jury indicted Green on four counts of rape of a person less than 13 years of age in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.02(A)(1)(b); one count of attempted sexual battery in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2923.02(A)/2907.03(A)(5); one count of\ngross sexual imposition in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.05(A)(4); and one count of rape in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.02(A)(2)(Indictment, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 1).\n\nOn April 24, 2013, Green pleaded guilty to Counts 1 and 6, charging him with rape in violation of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2907.02(A)(1)(c). Id. Ex. 10. Green was sentenced to nine years imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently. Id. at Ex. 19. Green did not file a timely direct appeal.\n\nOn June 6, 2014, Green filed a pro se Motion to Dismiss the Indictment. Id. at Ex. 22. The trial court denied the motion (Id. at Ex. 25) and Green did not appeal. On July 29, 2014, Green filed his first pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea under Ohio R. Crim. P. 32.1. Id. at Ex. 26. The trial court denied the motion and this time Green did appeal, but the Twelfth District Court of Appeals affirmed. State v. Green, 2015-Ohio-2576 (Ohio App. 12th Dist. 2015). The appellate court denied motions to certify a conflict and for reconsideration and Green appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio which declined to accepted jurisdiction. State v. Green, 143 Ohio St.3d 1502 (2015).\n\nOn December 11, 2015, Green filed a state court habeas petition in the Ross County Court of Common Pleas which the trial court dismissed (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 87). Green did not appeal from the dismissal. However, he filed a second state court habeas corpus petition March 15, 2019, in the Ohio Court of Appeals for the Fourth District (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 88). That court denied relief. Id. at Ex. 91. Green appealed and the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed. Green v. Shoop, 159 Ohio St.3d 439 (2020).\n\nOn May 16, 2016, Green filed a second pro se motion to withdraw guilty plea pursuant to Ohio Crim.R. 32.1 (Motion, State Court Record, ECF No. 7, Ex. 51). The trial court denied the motion. Id. at Ex. 57. Green appealed, but the appellate court affirmed the judgment. State v. Green, 2017-Ohio-2800 (Ohio App. 12th Dist. 2017). The Twelfth District again denied motions to certify a conflict and for reconsideration (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 62) and Green did not appeal.\nOn August 14, 2017, Green filed a motion for leave to file a delayed direct appeal (State Court Record, Ex. 81) which the appellate court denied. *Id.* at Ex. 84. Green did not appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n\nOn November 29, 2017, Green filed a *pro se* motion for new sentencing hearing. *Id.* at Ex. 71. The trial court denied relief and Green appealed. However the appellate court affirmed. *State v. Green*, 12th Dist. Butler Cty. No. CA2018-03-051(Aug. 6, 2018)(State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 79) and Green did not appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n\nThe Petition in this case was deposited in the mail on May 11, 2020 (See postmark at PageID 31), and received and docketed by the Clerk on May 13, 2020. Green pleads the following grounds for relief:\n\n**Ground One:** The trial court violated Articles I and II of the United States Constitution and the separation of powers doctrine when it ignored statutory law to unlawfully invoke subject matter jurisdiction to prosecute and convict petitioner denying him due process and equal protection in violation of the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** In the present case, no affidavit or complaint was filed to invoke subject matter jurisdiction on the municipal court or initiate prosecution. This fact has not been disputed by the State in any previous proceedings. After Petitioner\u2019s arrest, the municipal court, without jurisdiction held a preliminary hearing and bound the case over to the grand jury of the Common Pleas Court for the return of the indictment where Petitioner was subsequently indicted, convicted, and sentenced. All of the proceedings subsequent to Petitioner\u2019s arrest were contrary to statutory law and in violation of Petitioner\u2019s constitutional due process rights.\n\n**Ground Two:** Petitioner\u2019s guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily entered which denied him due process in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** Petitioner was indicted on seven counts on March 13, 2013. Some of the charges in the indictment were the same as allegations that had been made in the past and had been investigated by Warren County Children Services (WCCS) in 2005.\nAs a result of the investigation, Petitioner was cleared of any wrongdoing. At his direction, counsel filed a motion with the trial court to obtain the WCCS investigative file. The court denied the motion on April 12, stating it had no jurisdiction to order production of WCCS records.\n\nBeing denied proof of his innocence and at the urging of counsel, Petitioner reluctantly entered into a plea agreement on April 24. At the change of plea hearing and as an inducement to enter the guilty plea, the court incorrectly informed him that he would be entitled to earn credit against his sentence while on good behavior and could possibly be released early on essentially probation. (The court described judicial release.) In reality the sentence is statutorily ineligible [sic] for either earned credit or early release of any kind.\n\nOne week prior to sentencing, Petitioner received a copy of the termination letter from the 2005 WCCS investigation. He promptly turned over the letter to counsel who immediately filed a motion to withdraw plea based on the newly discovered evidence. At the hearing on the motion, the court stayed the proceedings until it could order the records produced from WCCS. (This was what the court said it had no jurisdiction to do two months earlier.)\n\nAt the continued hearing on the morning of July 22, the court stated it was continuing the matter until the afternoon so the parties could have an opportunity to review the file. Before adjourning, the court felt it was necessary \u201cto take this opportunity\u201d to relay certain information for Petitioner to consider during the break. The court told him that while certain of the information in the file did appear to be favorable, the court considered the motion \u201cto be a be-careful-what-you-wish-for\u201d motion. The court went on to say whether the motion were ruled on for or against him, the sentence would likely end up resulting in \u201ca graver sentence\u201d than what the court intended to impose otherwise.\n\nOnly a few minutes after adjourning and before Petitioner and counsel had an opportunity to review the file, counsel and the prosecuting attorney were called into chambers for a conference. Upon returning, counsel informed Petitioner that the judge had reviewed the file and offered that in exchange for voluntarily dismissing the motion, the court would find him the lowest level offender and run the sentences concurrent. Petitioner objected in light of the evidence that proved him innocent on some of the charges and called the remaining ones into question. Counsel told him that the judge had indicated he tended to agree with the State\u2019s argument to deny the motions and if they were not voluntarily\ndismissed, he would most likely deny the motions and sentence the Petitioner to the maximum on both charges and run the sentences consecutively; a twenty year aggregate [sic] sentence. Under duress and with no real choice, Petitioner agreed to dismiss the motions and continue with the plea.\n\nWith the exception of the conversation with counsel, all of these facts are in the record. The plea was not knowing when exculpatory information that Petitioner sought to prove his innocence was withheld from him. Had the WCCS file been available when it was requested, he would not have entered in to the plea agreement and would have insisted on going to trial. The plea was further not knowingly entered when the trial court gave incorrect sentencing information to induce the plea. The voluntary nature of the plea was removed when the judge threatened a \u201cgraver sentence\u201d if the Petitioner went forward with the motions and insisted on exercising his constitutional rights.\n\n**Ground Three**: Petitioner has been denied due process and equal protection in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution where he has been denied the right to an appeal of his conviction.\n\n**Supporting Facts**: Ohio has guaranteed to all criminal defendants the right to appeal their conviction or sentence. Federal Courts have held that this right does not exist in a vacuum and criminal defendants must be notified of their appellate rights before they can be waived or forfeited.\n\nAt the sentencing hearing the court did not inform Petitioner of his appellate rights nor was he informed of those rights anytime by his counsel. After learning of his right to request leave to file delayed appeal, Petitioner did so, which motion the appellate court denied. Following well established case law precedent, he filed a motion for a limited new sentencing hearing for the court to advise him of his appellate rights. The trial court denied the motion and the appellate court affirmed without publication or serving Petitioner with a copy of its decision.\n\n(Petition, ECF No. 1, PageID 7-13.)\nAnalysis\n\nStatute of Limitations\n\nRespondent asserts that the Petition was not timely filed and is therefore barred under the statute of limitations (Answer/Return of Writ, ECF No. 7, PageID 939-46).\n\nPetitioner divides his response on this issue between appeal-based claims (Ground Three) and conviction-based claims (Grounds One and Two). As to the former, he asserts the trigger date is September 12, 2017 (Reply, ECF No. 11, PageID 1028). As to the latter, he claims a trigger date of November 13, 2014, but the benefit of both statutory and equitable tolling; he forgoes any actual innocence argument. Id. at PageID 1028-31.\n\nA statute of limitations was first enacted for habeas corpus cases in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214)(the \"AEDPA\"). As codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), the AEDPA provides:\n\n(1) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court. The limitation period shall run from the latest of \u2014\n\n(A) the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review;\n\n(B) the date on which the impediment to filing an application created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the applicant was prevented from filing by such State action;\n\n(C) the date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if the right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or\n(D) the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\n\n(2) The time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation under this subsection.\n\nGreen\u2019s appeal-based claim is his Ground Three where he asserts the trial court did not inform him at sentencing of his right to appeal, the Twelfth District denied him a delayed appeal, and the trial court later refused to reopen the judgment and re-sentence him to start the appeal time running again. He asserts the \u201ctrigger date\u201d for this claim is September 12, 2017, which is the date the Twelfth District denied leave for a delayed appeal (Reply, ECF No. 11, PageID 1028, relying on DiCenzi v. Rose, 452 F.3d 465 (6th Cir. 2006), which supports that proposition). See also Sexton v. Wainwright, 968 F.3d 607 (6th Cir. 2020).\n\nPrima facie, Green\u2019s appeal-based claim is barred by the statute of limitations because 972 days elapsed between September 12, 2017, and May 11, 2020. However, Green claims that only 198 of those days are not tolled (ECF No. 11, PageID 1028). With respect to his conviction-based claims, he asserts only 245 non-tolled days have expired. Id. at PageID 1030. Green claims his right to tolling is \u201cestablished in his Petition\u201d (Reply, ECF No. 11, PageID 1027). His reference is presumably to his Case History Timeline, a table appearing as an attachment to the Petition (ECF No. 1, PageID 20). For reasons set forth below, the Magistrate Judge is not persuaded the table shows the tolling times Petitioner claims.\n\nUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), the statute of limitations begins to run when a conviction is final on direct review unless a later date is shown. In this case that date is August 30, 2013, the date on which his time to file an appeal of right expired. With that as the finality date, the \u201ctrigger\ndate\u201d for \u00a7 2244(d) purposes, the statute would have expired September 1, 2014, as to Grounds One and Two.\n\nBefore then, on June 6, 2014, Green filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. Respondent argues that this filing did not toll the statute of limitations because it was not \u201cproperly filed\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2) in that the trial court denied it as untimely (Return, ECF No. 7, PageID 943). Petitioner refers to this argument in his Reply where he asserts \u201cDanny\u2019s motion was not a collateral filing, was not considered untimely by the court, and was in fact properly filed in accordance with state law.\u201d (ECF No. 11, PageID 1028-29).\n\nGreen made this Motion under Ohio R. Crim. P. 48(B)(Motion to Dismiss, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, PageID 92). In opposing the Motion, the prosecutor argued the trial court was required to treat it as a petition for post-conviction relief under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2953.21 (Memo Contra, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, PageID 133, relying on State v. Schlee, 117 Ohio St. 3d 153 (2008)). The trial court found this argument persuasive and that Green\u2019s Motion to Dismiss was required to have been filed by February 26, 20141 (Decision, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, PageID 142). Since it had not been filed until June 6, 2014, it was untimely and the court was without jurisdiction to entertain it, per Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2953.23. Id. at PageID 143. Green did not appeal, making the trial court\u2019s decision on this point final. On questions of state law, federal habeas courts are bound by state court decisions. Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U.S. 74 (2005). In Pace v. DiGuglielmo, 544 U.S. 408 (2005), the Court held that a postconviction petition rejected by the state courts as untimely is not \u201cproperly filed\u201d within 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). Accord, Allen v. Siebert, 552 U.S. 3 (2007)(an untimely post-conviction petition is not properly\n\n---\n\n1 The statute of limitations for a petition under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2953.21 was at the time 180 days from the date on which the defendant\u2019s time to appeal expired if no appeal had been taken. That date has subsequently been amended to 365 days.\nfiled regardless of whether the time element is jurisdictional or an affirmative defense). Since the Motion to Dismiss was not properly filed, it does not toll the time under \u00a7 2244(d)(2).\n\nGreen\u2019s second attempt to set aside his conviction was his first Motion to withdraw his guilty plea, filed July 29, 2014, which he made under Ohio R. Crim. P. 32.1 (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 26). By this time 333 days had expired of the one-year statute and only thirty-two days remained. The trial court did not find the Motion untimely, but dealt with it on the merits, albeit finding most claims were barred by res judicata (Decision, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 30). The Twelfth District Court of Appeals also affirmed on the merits. State v. Green, 2015-Ohio-2576 (Ohio App. 12th Dist. 2015). The Supreme Court of Ohio declined jurisdiction on October 28, 2015 (Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 50). None of the Ohio courts involved disposed of Green\u2019s first Motion to Withdraw as improperly filed. Therefore under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) he is entitled to statutory tolling from July 29, 2014, through October 28, 2015.\n\nGreen\u2019s next filing was his first state habeas corpus petition filed December 11, 2015. (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 87). That was forty-four days after the Supreme Court Entry on the Motion to Withdraw Plea and therefore twelve days after the statute had run. Whether or not state habeas corpus is a qualifying post-conviction filing under \u00a7 2244(d)(2), no such filing revives a claim which is already time barred.\n\nSince the statute of limitations, tolled by the First Motion to Withdraw, expired on November 29, 2015, Green must excuse the delay between then and May 11, 2020, more than four years, by equitable tolling. The Supreme Court has confirmed that equitable tolling is available to toll the \u00a7 2244 statute of limitations. Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 645 (2010).\n\n\u201cEquitable tolling allows courts to review time-barred habeas petitions \u2018provided that a litigant\u2019s failure to meet a legally-mandated deadline unavoidably arose from circumstances beyond that litigant\u2019s control.\u2019\u201d Keeling v. Warden, 673 F.3d 452, 462 (6th Cir. 2012), quoting\nRobertson v. Simpson, 624 F.3d 781, 783 (6th Cir. 2010)). A petitioner\u2019s pro se status, limited law library access, and lack of knowledge of the law do not constitute extraordinary circumstances to excuse late filing. Keeling, Hall v. Warden, 662 F.3d 745, 751-52 (6th Cir. 2011).\n\nGreen does little to flesh out his claim of equitable tolling, apparently because he believes he is entitled to statutory tolling for most of the time after November 13, 2014, based on the many state court challenges he filed after his First Motion to Withdraw (See Reply, ECF No. 11, PageID 1030). But the question must be whether these were properly filed efforts to set aside the conviction. They were not.\n\nAs noted above Green filed his first state court habeas petition on December 11, 2015. That was after expiration of the statute as calculated above. But even if it were not, any statutory tolling would have expired when Green failed to appeal from denial of the petition; his time to do so expired May 19, 2016, thirty days after the trial court denied the petition (Journal Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 87).\n\nGreen filed a second state court habeas corpus petition March 15, 2019, in the Ohio Court of Appeals for the Fourth District (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 88). That court denied relief. Id. at Ex. 91. It reasoned that habeas corpus was not a proper remedy for claims that could have been raised on direct appeal or petition for post-conviction relief under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2953.21. Id. at PageID 751-52. It also found the claims procedurally barred by res judicata because of Green\u2019s first habeas petition. Id. at PageID 752. Green appealed and the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed on both grounds. Green v. Shoop, 159 Ohio St.3d 439 (2020).\n\nApplying the logic of DiCenzi and Sexton, supra, to the extent Green is claiming the denial of a delayed appeal violated his constitutional rights, he knew of the fact of that denial \u2013 a factual premise for that claim \u2013 shortly after it occurred on September 12, 2017. Green did not appeal and\nhis time to do so expired forty-five days later on October 27, 2017. He did not file his appeal-based claim here until he included it in his Petition on May 11, 2020, thirty months later.\n\nIt is certainly true that Petitioner initiated a great many state court filings attempting to get his conviction overturned. However, that does not, indeed cannot, constitute due diligence. To count them in that way would completely undermine the statute of limitations. Green was rebuffed in every one of his state filings, either procedurally or substantively. If a petitioner could get equitable tolling credit for every state court filing, regardless of how outside ordinary state post-conviction practice or how many times he had been turned down on the merits, the statute of limitations would run forever as long as some clerk of courts would accept a filing from a defendant with his original case number on it.\n\nIt is no answer for Green to claim that he was required to exhaust state court remedies. The pendency of a state court proceeding attacking a criminal judgment is no bar to filing a habeas petition and the Supreme Court has expressly recognized that such premature petitions can be stayed pending the outcome of state exhaustion efforts. *Rhines v. Weber*, 544 U.S. 269 (2005).\n\nIt is therefore recommended that the Petition herein be dismissed as to all three Grounds for Relief as barred by the statute of limitations.\n\n**Ground One: Lack of Trial Court Jurisdiction**\n\nIn his First Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims the trial court, the Butler County Court of Common Pleas, did not have jurisdiction to try and convict him because of lack of a proper affidavit and complaint in the municipal court to initiate these proceedings.\nThe State Court Record contains a Transcript of Proceedings in the Middletown Municipal Court in this case (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 1). The Transcript recites that an Officer Janice Jones appeared before a Deputy Clerk of that court on January 23, 2013, and made some allegation, not disclosed, against Green having to do with a charge of rape. The Transcript recites further that an arrest warrant was issued to Officer Jones, that Green was arrested on the warrant and arraigned on January 25, 2013, that a preliminary hearing was held on February 1, 2013, that Green was then bound over to the Butler County grand jury and committed to jail in lieu of bond. The Transcript contains the conformed signature of Middletown Municipal Judge Mark Wall and the February 6, 2013, Certificate of the Clerk of the Municipal Court, Stephen Longworth. The Transcript was filed the next day with the Butler County Clerk of Courts Mary Swain. Id.\n\nAlthough Green filed a post-conviction Motion to Dismiss the Indictment on June 6, 2014, he raised no claim about the municipal court process (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 22). Nor did he raised this claim in his First Motion to Withdraw (Id. at Ex. 26) or his Second Motion to Withdraw (Id. at Ex. 51). The claim is not mentioned in the decision denying his First State Habeas Corpus Petition. Id. at Ex. 87. The claim was apparently first raised in Green\u2019s Second State Habeas Corpus Petition filed March 15, 2019. Id. at Ex. 88. The Fourth District decided that claim as follows:\n\nIn his petition, Green asserts that his conviction is void because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and therefore he is being detained illegally and entitled to release. Specifically, Green asserts that the State of Ohio failed to file a criminal complaint against him and, accordingly, \"the jurisdiction of the Middletown Municipal Court was never invoked and all subsequent proceedings were void ab initio and a nullity.\" And because no criminal complaint was filed, the case was not properly before the grand jury and no proper indictment was returned. Green contends that he has no remedy in the ordinary course of law because no appeal can be taken from a void judgment and claims regarding subject matter jurisdiction are not barred by res judicata.\nAs Warden Shoop notes in his motion, it is well settled that \"(a)ny defect cause[d] by the alleged failure to file criminal complaints or the claimed impropriety of the municipal court's assumption of jurisdiction over (criminal) charges is not cognizable in habeas corpus.\" Boylen v. Bradshaw, 108 Ohio St.3d 184, 2006-Ohio-181, 842 N.E.2d 49, at \u00b6 5. citing Harris v. Bagley, 97 Ohio St.3d 98, 2002-Ohio-5369, 776 N.E.2d 490 at \u00b6 3, quoting Taylor v. Mitchell (2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 453, 454, 727 N.E.2d 905. Further, Green entered into a plea agreement with the State whereby the originally charged and indicted offenses were amended to reduce the maximum potential prison sentence. Green at \u00b6 25. By pleading to the amended charges, Green waived any challenges to the indictment. Id.\n\nRes judicata also bars Green's petition insofar as he raises claims that he raised or could have raised in his previous petition filed in the Ross County Court of Common Pleas. Nedea v. Cook. 4th Dist. Hocking No. 15CA 12, 2015-Ohio-3668, at \u00b6 12 (citations omitted). Res judicata \"is applicable to successive habeas corpus petitions because habeas corpus petitioners have the right to appeal adverse judgments in habeas corpus cases.\" Id., citing State ex rel. Childs v Lazaroff, 90 Ohio St.3d 519, 520, 739 N.E.2d 802 (2001). Thus, even if Green's claim regarding the lack of a criminal complaint was cognizable in habeas corpus, he could have raised this claim in his earlier petition and it is now barred by res judicata.\n\n(Decision, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, PageID 752-53).\n\nThis time Green did appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court which affirmed on both points made by the Fourth District, holding:\n\n[*P6] The court of appeals' analysis is correct in both respects. Res judicata bars Green's 2019 habeas corpus petition because he filed an earlier petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he could have raised any cognizable claim that he had, Bevins v. Richard, 144 Ohio St. 3d 54, 2015-Ohio-2832, 40 N.E.3d 1108, \u00b6 4. In addition, the claims raised in Green's 2019 petition were not cognizable in habeas corpus. \"Any defect caused by the alleged failure to file criminal complaints or the claimed impropriety of the municipal court's assumption of jurisdiction over * * * rape charges is not cognizable in habeas corpus.\" Taylor v. Mitchell, 88 Ohio St.3d 453, 454, 2000-Ohio-380, 727 N.E.2d 905 (2000). Green was convicted and sentenced upon indictments, and the trial court had jurisdiction over\nhis case. *Boylen v. Bradshaw*, 108 Ohio St. 3d 181, 2006-Ohio-549, 842 N.E.2d 49, \u00b6 5.\n\n*Green v. Shoop*, 159 Ohio St. 439 (2020).\n\nThe question of which Ohio courts have subject matter jurisdiction over what kinds of cases and what are the prerequisites for exercise of that jurisdiction are questions of state law on which the federal courts are bound by state court decisions. *Bradshaw, supra*. Federal courts cannot second guess those decisions or review them as if we sat as appellate courts. Rather, habeas corpus courts sit only to decide whether persons are confined in violation of the United States Constitution. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a); *Wilson v. Corcoran*, 562 U.S. 1 (2010); *Lewis v. Jeffers*, 497 U.S. 764, 780 (1990); *Smith v. Phillips*, 455 U.S. 209 (1982), *Barclay v. Florida*, 463 U.S. 939 (1983).\n\nIn his Reply Green states the truism that courts are obliged to follow the law. True as that may be, not every failure of a state court to follow state law results in a violation of the United States Constitution. \u201cA state cannot be said to have a federal due process obligation to follow all of its procedures; such a system would result in the constitutionalizing of every state rule, and would not be administrable.\u201d *Levine v. Torvik*, 986 F.2d 1506, 1515 (6th Cir. 1993).\n\nGreen\u2019s First Ground for Relief therefore fails on the merits and should be dismissed on that basis. Alternatively, it is also barred by his procedural default in failing to raise it any time before his Second State Habeas Corpus Petition. As both appellate courts held, the claim was barred by *res judicata*. Ohio\u2019s doctrine of *res judicata* in criminal cases, enunciated in *State v. Perry*, 10 Ohio St. 2d 175 (1967), has been repeatedly held by the Sixth Circuit to be an adequate and independent state ground of decision. *Durr v. Mitchell*, 487 F.3d 423, 432 (6th Cir. 2007); *Buell v. Mitchell*, 274 F.3d 337 (6th Cir. 2001); *Coleman v. Mitchell*, 268 F.3d 417 (6th Cir. 2001); *Byrd v. Collins*, 209 F.3d 486, 521-22 (6th Cir. 2000); *Rust v. Zent*, 17 F.3d 155, 160-61 (6th Cir.\nGround Two: Invalid Guilty Plea\n\nIn his Second Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts his guilty plea is invalid. In his Supporting Facts he asserts that records of an investigation conducted by the Warren County, Ohio, Children Services (\u201cWCCS\u201d) in 2005 cleared him of at least some of the wrongdoing alleged in the Indictment. Despite an effort to obtain that file, his trial judge held on April 12, 2013, that he did not have jurisdiction to obtain those records. Green pleaded guilty on April 24, 2013. Then, a week prior to sentencing, he received the termination letter from the WCCS investigation. On that basis his counsel filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea. At a chambers conference during a hearing on that motion, the trial judge allegedly made promises about leniency in sentencing if the motion to withdraw the plea were itself withdrawn. On advice of counsel, Green withdrew the motion. He now claims his guilty plea was unknowing because (1) the exculpatory WCCS file was withheld (2) the judge misstated sentencing information to induce the plea. Furthermore the plea became involuntary when the judge threatened a graver sentence if the motion were not withdrawn.\n\nGreen first raised related claims in his first post-conviction Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea filed June 29, 2014 (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 26). He reiterated the arguments he had made in his post-conviction Motion to Dismiss Indictment about the vagueness of the Indictment. Id. at PageID 147. He complains that on the day of the hearing on the motion to withdraw, he was only allowed to see a small portion of the WCCS file and given only twenty minutes to make up his mind about whether to go forward. Id. at PageID 148. He structured a\nlarge part of his argument around the claim that he was entitled to relief under *State v. Mancini*, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 17 (8th Dist. 1993). *Id.* at PageID 149-51. Next he accused his attorney of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for not sharing the WCCS file with him until January 2014. *Id.* at PageID 152. He also accused the prosecutor of misconduct under *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). Significantly, neither the Motion nor Green\u2019s supporting Affidavit contains any allegations of threats by the trial judge of the sort alleged in the Petition.\n\nIn denying the Motion to Withdraw, the trial court found that *Mancini* was not the controlling law on lesser included offenses in light of *Stacy v. Van Coren*, 18 Ohio St. 2d 188 (1969), and the remainder of Green\u2019s claims were barred by *res judicata* because they could have been raised on direct appeal but were not (Decision, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 30).\n\nOn appeal, Green argued as his First Assignment of Error that his first Motion to Withdraw should have been treated as a pre-sentence motion -- which is subject to different standards than a post-sentence motion to withdraw -- because the judgment of the trial court imposing sentence was not a final appealable order. The appellate court overruled that Assignment on the basis of Ohio law. *State v. Green*, 2015-Ohio-2576, \u00b6\u00b6 7-17 (Ohio App. 12th Dist. 2015). In his Second Assignment of Error he claimed the trial court had not properly applied *Mancini, supra*. The Twelfth District held that *Van Coren* rather than *Mancini* was the applicable precedent and that Green\u2019s guilty plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. *Id.* at \u00b6\u00b6 18-27. The Supreme Court of Ohio declined review (Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 50).\n\nGreen filed his second post-conviction Motion to Withdraw on May 16, 2016 (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 51). He claimed it should be treated as a pre-sentence motion to withdraw despite the prior ruling of the Twelfth District that the sentencing judgment was a final appealable order. He complained that the trial judge had misinformed him about the possible sentences. He still made no claim that the trial judge had threatened him with a \u201cgraver sentence\u201d to get him to withdraw\nhis pre-sentence motion to withdraw. The trial judge held that, under the law of the case doctrine, he was bound by the prior finding of the appellate court that Green\u2019s plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary (Decision, State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 57).\n\nOn appeal, Green argued that neither res judicata nor the law of the case doctrine applied because the sentencing judgment was void. State v. Green, 2017-Ohio-2800, \u00b68 (Ohio App. 12th Dist. 2017). The appellate court found several of Green\u2019s assertions about the sentencing judgment to be correct, but that did not lead to the judgment\u2019s being void:\n\n[*P10] Appellant is correct that his conviction for rape carried a mandatory prison sentence under R.C. 2929.13(F)(2) and that he was not eligible for community control, judicial release, or earned credit. See State v. Silvers, 181 Ohio App.3d 26, 2009-Ohio-687, 907 N.E.2d 805 (2d Dist.). Appellant is also correct that the trial court failed to comply with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) during its plea colloquy when it misinformed appellant he could be eligible for earned credit and could receive community control. However, contrary to appellant's assertion, the trial court's failure to comply with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) did not result in his guilty plea being void.\n\nId. The trial court\u2019s errors, the Twelfth District found, rendered the sentencing judgment voidable, but not void. Id. at \u00b6 12. Therefore Green\u2019s claims in his second motion to withdraw were found barred by res judicata. Id. at \u00b6 14. Green did not appeal.\n\nGreen next moved for a new sentencing hearing because of asserted infirmities in the sentencing entry (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 71). In this Motion Green again attacked the sentencing judgment and the trial judge\u2019s failure to advise him orally of his right to appeal, but not of any colloquy at the pre-sentence motion to withdraw hearing. He again claimed the sentencing judgment was void, despite the Twelfth District\u2019s holding to the contrary that it was merely voidable. Id. at PageID 510. The trial judge denied the Motion on the basis of res judicata and the \u201cwell-established law that failure to advise a defendant of his right to appeal does not void a sentence.\u201d (Decision, State Court Record, ECF No. 6-1, Ex. 74, PageID 570). The Twelfth\nDistrict affirmed without opinion. *Id.* at Ex. 79.\n\nIn his first State Habeas Corpus Petition, Green raised the \u201cgraver sentence\u201d threat and the *Brady* claim. The trial court\\(^2\\) held habeas corpus was not an available remedy because the convicting court had subject matter jurisdiction and Green was not claiming he was being held beyond expiration of his sentenced term of imprisonment (Journal Entry, ECF No. 6-1, Ex. 87, PageID 675).\n\nGreen did not appeal, but filed his second state habeas corpus petition in the Fourth District Court of Appeals\\(^3\\). As noted above, that petition focused on the claim that the Butler County Court of Common Pleas did not have subject matter jurisdiction because of the incomplete filings in the Middletown Municipal Court (State Court Record, ECF No. 6-1, Ex. 88, PageID 682). The Fourth District found that Ohio habeas corpus relief was limited in the same ways the Ross County Court of Common Pleas had found as to the first state habeas petition, i.e., lack of subject matter jurisdiction in the convicting court or expiration of the sentence. *State v. Green*, Case No. 19CA3675 (4th Dist. Jun. 28, 2019)(unreported; copy at State Court Record 6-1, Ex. 91, PageID 750, citing *Heddleston v. Mack*, 84 Ohio St.3d 213,214 (1998). The Fourth District rejected Green\u2019s lack of jurisdiction argument. *Id.* The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed on the basis of the Fourth District\u2019s analysis. *Green v. Shoop*, *supra*.\n\nFrom this lengthy review of the litigation history, the Magistrate Judge concludes Petitioner has procedurally defaulted in presenting this claim to the state courts. His claim that the sentencing judgment is void for various reasons has been repeatedly rejected by the Ohio courts on the basis of Ohio criminal *res judicata*. His \u201cgraver sentence\u201d threat claim was presented in his first state\n\n\\(^2\\) In this case the Court of Common Pleas of Ross County, Ohio, which has jurisdiction of habeas claims filed by prisoners at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution.\n\n\\(^3\\) The Fourth District includes Ross County, the county in which Green was then and is now incarcerated.\nhabeas petition, but he did not appeal from the adverse decision and thereby procedurally defaulted that claim by not fairly presenting it to the Ohio courts for one full round of review. His Brady claim relating to the WCCS file and his related claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel because his attorney did not share the file with him has, so far as the Magistrate Judge can determine, never been presented to the Ohio courts.\n\nTherefore in addition to recommending Ground Two be dismissed as barred by the statute of limitations, the Magistrate Judge recommends it be dismissed with prejudice as procedurally defaulted.\n\n**Ground Three: Denial of Right to Appeal**\n\nIn his Third Ground for Relief, Green claims he was unconstitutionally denied his right to appeal his conviction.\n\nGreen never attempted to appeal from his July 2013 Judgment of Conviction until he filed his Motion for Leave to File Delayed Appeal on August 14, 2017, more than four years later (Motion for Delayed Appeal, State Court Record, ECF No. 6-1, Ex. 81). In the Motion Green acknowledged his understanding that to warrant a delayed appeal, he would have to show why he did not appeal within the thirty days to appeal of right. *Id.* at PageID 651. He claimed it was because he had not been notified \u201cof his appellate rights at the sentencing hearing.\u201d *Id.* As to the four-year subsequent delay, he noted the many other filings he had made during the interim. He claimed he became aware of the possibility of a delayed appeal only when the Twelfth District affirmed denial of his second motion to withdraw his guilty plea. *Id.* at PageID 652. The Twelfth District denied the delayed appeal without opinion on September 12, 2017.\nAs noted above, Green did not appeal from this decision. He claims that is because the decision was never served on him and the non-service constitutes a state-created impediment to exhausting his remedies (Petition, ECF No. 1, PageID 13). However, this claim is not plausible because Green plainly knew of the Twelfth District\u2019s decision: on September 29, 2017, he filed a Request for Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law which references the September 12, 2017, decision (Request, ECF No. 6-1, Ex. 85). He does not explain how he knew of the decision if he was not served a copy. He claims he twice asked for copies (Petition, ECF No. 1, PageID 13), but does not say when or provide any corroborative documentation.\n\nGreen asserts that it \u201cwell settled that this Court has held that a trial court\u2019s failure to inform a defendant of his appellate rights is cause for [to excuse] procedural default.\u201d (Reply, ECF No. 11, PageID 1042, citing Walker v. Warden, Lake Erie Cor. Inst., 2016 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 33265 (S.D. Ohio Mar. 15, 2016)). In that decision, District Judge Michael R. Barrett of this Court adopted a recommendation by the undersigned that Petitioner Walker be granted an appeal. Walker\u2019s claim was not that he had been denied an appeal, but that he had been denied appointment of counsel on appeal, a right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment on criminal appeals of right. Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353 (1963). The undersigned had initially recommended the claim be dismissed because Walker had never requested appointment of counsel, but then Walker filed an additional document showing he had made the request and the trial judge had not acted on it. Walker, supra, at *3-4.\n\nIn the course of adopting the undersigned\u2019s recommendation, Judge Barrett wrote \u201cThere is no dispute in this case that the trial court failed to inform Petitioner of his right to counsel on appeal.\u201d Id. at *13. He noted that Walker had signed a form much like the one signed by Green that acknowledged he had been advised of his appellate rights. Id. at n.1. However, apparently\nRespondent did not claim that acknowledgement was sufficient and Judge Barrett did not want to reach that conclusion *sua sponte*. In this case the Respondent has claimed the acknowledgement is sufficient and a number of the state decisions in this case have relied on the acknowledgement.\n\nIn the absence of some showing that a defendant is illiterate, there is no reason why an oral advisement of the right to appeal should be considered superior to a written advisement, much less that both should be required.\n\nGreen claims that the Sixth Circuit has held that written acknowledgement of the type signed by Green is not sufficient (Reply, ECF No. 11, PageID 1043). However, he cites no authority for that proposition.\n\nThe Magistrate Judge concludes that, in addition to being barred by the statute of limitations, Ground Three is also barred by Green\u2019s procedural default in not appealing to the Ohio Supreme Court.\n\nAlternatively, Ground Three is without merit. Green\u2019s premise for this Ground for Relief is that he was never notified of his right to appeal. That premise is belied by the following language in the Plea of Guilty and Jury Waiver: \u201cI understand my right to appeal a maximum sentence and my other limited appellate rights, and further understand that any appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days of my sentence.\u201d This language appears immediately above Green\u2019s signature on the form. (State Court Record, ECF No. 6, Ex. 10, PageID 64). Green was not given a maximum sentence and thus he is correct in saying that he did not have a right to appeal on that basis. But the acknowledgement goes on to speak of \u201cother limited appellate rights,\u201d i.e., appellate rights on a basis other than imposition of the maximum sentence. And the acknowledgment continue to say that \u201cany appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days,\u201d reinforcing the distinction between an appeal based on imposition of the maximum sentence and other appeals.\nOf course a person who pleads guilty has only \u201climited appellate rights.\u201d He or she cannot complain on appeal, for example, that the State presented insufficient evidence or intentionally excluded Black people from the jury. Those constitutional claims would be fully preserved for appeal if a defendant had gone to trial (See *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307 (1979), and *Batson v. Kentucky*, 476 U.S. 79 (1986)).\n\nThe Guilty Plea and Jury Waiver form is probably the most important piece of paper Petitioner has ever signed. He will not be heard to say he did not read it carefully. In fact he represented to Judge Powers that he had read it (Transcript, State Court Record, ECF No. 6-2, PageID 915). If he did not understand his appellate rights, despite acknowledging that he did, he should certainly have asked his lawyer or the trial judge what those rights were. In fact, Judge Powers asked him if he had any questions before taking his plea. *Id.* at PageID 916. He does not claim he ever asked any questions.\n\nInstead he claims the trial judge never orally advised him of his \u201climited appellate rights.\u201d No such advice appears in the Transcript of Sentencing Hearing (State Court Record, ECF No. 6-2, PageID 877, *et seq.*, incorrectly labeled in the State Court Record as \u201cChange of Plea Hearing\u201d). Nor does it appear in the Transcript of Change of Plea Hearing\u2074 (State Court Record, ECF No. 6-2, PageID 914, *et seq.* incorrectly labeled as \u201cSentencing Hearing.\u201d) But as noted above, Green cites no authority for the proposition that an oral advice of appellate rights is constitutionally required.\n\nAt a more fundamental level, there is no federal constitutional right to appellate review of a criminal judgment. *McKane v. Durston*, 153 U.S. 684 (1894), cited as still good law in *Lopez*\n\n---\n\n\u2074 The copy of this transcript in the State Court Record is incomplete, beginning on page 11 as the court reporter numbered the pages. See PageID 915. Respondent is directed to supplement the record by filing the first ten pages of this transcript.\nv. Wilson, 426 F.3d 339, 355 (6th Cir. 2005); Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U.S. 605 (2005). \u201cDue process does not require a State to provide appellate process at all.\u201d Goeke v. Branch, 514 U.S. 115, 120 (1995). Of course when it does provide a right to appeal, the State cannot discriminate against the poor by failing to provide the necessary transcript. Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956). Counsel must be appointed on appeal of right for indigent criminal defendants. Douglas, supra. Because the State has no constitutional obligation to provide for appellate review in the first instance, it follows logically that it has no obligation to provide for a delayed appeal.\n\nConclusion\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, it is respectfully recommended that the Petition be dismissed with prejudice. Because reasonable jurists would not disagree with this conclusion, it is also recommended that Petitioner be denied a certificate of appealability and that the Court certify to the Sixth Circuit that any appeal would be objectively frivolous and should not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis.\n\nJanuary 13, 2021.\n\ns/ Michael R.

Gary Tyack ], Prosecuting Attorney, and \nSeth L. Gilbert, for appellee. \n \nOn brief:  Alphonso D. Mobley, Jr., pro se. \n          \n \nAPPEAL from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas \n \nKLATT, J. \n{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Alphonso D. Mobley, Jr., acting pro se, appeals from a \njudgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas denying his Crim.R. 32.1 motion \nto withdraw his guilty plea.  For the following reasons, we affirm.   \n{\u00b6 2} On April 15, 2016, appellant was charged in a six-count indictment, including \none count of aggravated arson in violation of R.C. 2909.02, and one count of criminal use \nof an explosive device in violation of R.C. 2909.27; each count also carried a firearm \nspecification.  On May 1, 2017, appellant ente red a counseled guilty plea to one count of \naggravated arson, with a firearm specification, and one count of criminal use of an explosive \ndevice.  On the same day, the trial court sentenced appellant to an aggregate prison term of \n14 years.  Appellant did not appeal the May 1, 2017 judgment of conviction.    No.  20AP-350  2 \n \n \n{\u00b6 3} On October 25, 2017, appellant filed a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty \nplea pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1, essentially arguing that the plea was involuntary because the \naggravated arson and criminal use of explosives should have merged pursuant to R.C. \n2941.145.  The trial court overruled the moti on on December 15, 2017, finding that res \njudicata barred appellant from raising the merger argument, as it could have been raised in \na direct appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence.  Alternatively, the trial court \ndetermined that appellant did not allege facts in his motion to support a finding of manifest \ninjustice, prosecutorial misconduct, or ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  Consequently, \nthe trial court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing.  Appellant timely appealed \nto this court.  In a decision rendered on September 25, 2018, we affirmed.  State v. Mobley, \n10th Dist. No. 18AP-23, 2018-Ohio-3880.   \n{\u00b6 4} In the interval between the trial court's denial of the Crim.R. 32.1 motion and \nour affirmance thereof, appellant, on July 6, 2018, filed a pro se motion for leave to file a \ndelayed appeal from the May 1, 2017 judgment of conviction.  In his motion, appellant set \nforth the reasons for his failure to timely perfect an appeal, as well as the substantive \nargument he proposed to raise on direct appeal, i.e., that the indictment was defective.  This \ncourt denied appellant's motion on grounds that he failed to meet his App.R. 5(A) burden \nof demonstrating a reasonable explanation for failure to perfect a timely appeal.  State v. \nMobley, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-539 (Oct. 25, 2018).   \n{\u00b6 5} On December 18, 2019, appellant filed a second Crim.R. 32.1 motion to \nwithdraw his guilty plea; he filed an amendment to his motion on January 10, 2020.  In his \nDecember 18, 2019 filing, appellant asserted that manifest injustice compelled the \nwithdrawal of his guilty plea, arguing that (1) he involuntarily waived his right to counsel \non appeal, resulting in a forfeiture of his right to a timely appeal; (2) he unintelligently pled \nguilty to less than all the elements of R.C. 2909.02(A)(1) and 2929.27(A); (3) the conditions \nof the plea agreement were not entered into the record, resulting in the involuntary waiver \nof the right to notice of the nature and cause of the allegations; and, (4) he was denied \neffective assistance of counsel due to counsel's failure to investigate evidence, object to \namendments of the indictment, file a notice of appeal, and request appointment of counsel \non appeal.  In his January 10, 2020 filing, appellant further asserted that he involuntarily \nwaived his rights (1) to have the trial court consider a victim impact statement and make \nfindings of harm, (2) to court approval of nolle prosequi of the firearm specification, and, No.  20AP-350  3 \n \n \n(3) regarding forfeiture of his property.  Appellant also asserted claims for fraud on the \ncourt perpetrated by the prosecutor and defense counsel and prejudicial conduct/bias on \nthe part of the trial judge.     \n{\u00b6 6} In its judgment denying appellant's motion, the trial court concluded that no \nmanifest injustice occurred, specifically finding that appellant's assertions that he waived \nhis right to appellate counsel, that he pled guilty to insufficient elements of the offenses, \nthat the terms of the plea agreement were not entered into the record, and that his counsel \nwas ineffective were unsupported by the record.  As noted above, these assertions were \nmade in appellant's initial filing on December 18, 2019.  The trial court did not expressly \naddress the additional assertions made in the January 10, 2020 amended filing.  In addition \nto finding no manifest injustice, the trial court determined that appellant's motion was \nuntimely, having been filed more than two and one-half years after entry of his guilty plea.  \nFinally, the trial court found that res judicata barred appellant from raising the claims \nunderlying his motion because those claims could have been raised in his prior motion to \nwithdraw his guilty plea.  Accordingly, the trial court denied the motion without an \nevidentiary hearing.   \n{\u00b6 7} Appellant timely appeals, advancing two assignments of error for our review:   \nI.  The trial court abused its discretion when it found: (1) No \nManifest Injustice; (2) Res judicata bars relief; (3) There  \nexist[s] an undue delay.   \n \nII.  The trial court abused its discretion when it failed to \nconsider: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Fraud on the Court by \nofficers of the Court and Defense Counsel.   \n \n{\u00b6 8} Appellant's assignments of error are interrelated and will be considered \ntogether.1  In them, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying \n                                                   \n1 We note that addition to his briefing, appellant has filed several documents in this court purportedly \nrelevant to his appeal.  On July 20, 2020, appellant  filed documents captioned \"Statement of Evidence \nPursuant to Ohio App.R. 9(C),\" \"Statement to the Clerk Pursuant to Ohio App.R. 9(B)(5),\" and \"Statement \nof Proceedings Pursuant to Ohio App.R. 9(C).\"  To the extent appellant intends these documents to be a \nsubstitute for the actual appellate record certified an d filed by the Franklin County Clerk of Courts, the \nfilings are improper.  The record certified and filed by the clerk is complete and includes a transcript of the \nplea and sentencing proceedings.  As such, the provisions in App.R. 9 are inapplicable.  Further, on \nAugust 6, 2020, appellant filed a document captioned \"Judicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts Ohio Evidence \nRule 201.\"  Attached to this document are various unauthenticated documents purporting to be responses \nto correspondence appellant sent to various public agencies, including the Columbus Division of Fire, Fire \nand Explosives Investigations Unit, the Franklin County Public Defender, the Ohio Public Defender, and \nthe Ohio Department of Commerce.  It does not appear that these documents are contained in the appellate No.  20AP-350  4 \n \n \nhis motion to withdraw his guilty plea on grounds of no manifest injustice, res judicata, and \nundue delay and in failing to consider his claims for breach of contract and fraud on the \ncourt.   \n{\u00b6 9} \"Motions to withdraw guilty pleas are governed by Crim.R. 32.1, which \np r o v i de s tha t the  mo tio n  'ma y b e ma de o n l y before sentence is imposed; but to correct \nmanifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and \npermit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.' \"  State v.

No. 11AP-375, 2011-Ohio-4986, \u00b6 8.   \n{\u00b6 10} \"An appellate court will not reverse a trial court's denial of a motion to \nwithdraw a plea absent an abuse of discretion.\"  State v. Muhumed, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-\n1001, 2012-Ohio-6155, \u00b6 8, citing State v. Totten, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-278, 2005-Ohio-\n6210, \u00b6 5.  An abuse of discretion connotes a decision that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or \nunconscionable.  State v. Wilson, 10th Dist. No. 19AP-536, 2020-Ohio-1136, \u00b6 14, citing \nBlakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219 (1983).  Where, however, the issue is the \napplicability of res judicata, which is a question of law, an appellate court conducts a de \nnovo review.  Muhumed at \u00b6 11, citing EMC Mtge. Corp v. Jenkins, 164 Ohio App.3d 240, \n249, 2005-Ohio-5799, \u00b6 15 (10th Dist.).    \n{\u00b6 11} Appellant's successive motion to withdraw his guilty plea (comprised of the \nDecember 18, 2019 and January 10, 2020 filing s) is barred by res judicata.  \"Under the \ndoctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was \nrepresented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from \n                                                   \nrecord.  Accordingly, appellant's reliance on these documents in support of his assignments of error is \nimproper.  State v. Ishmail, 54 Ohio St.2d 402 (1978), paragraph one of the syllabus.    No.  20AP-350  5 \n \n \nthat judgment, any defense or claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have \nbeen raised by the defendant at trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or on \nan appeal from that judgment.\" (Emphasis omitted.)  State v.

Walden, 3d Dist. \nNo. 4-15-13, 2016-Ohio-258, \u00b6 19, quoting State v. Schwieterman, 3d Dist. No. 10-09-12, \n2010-Ohio-102, \u00b6 23, quoting State v. Saxton, 109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, \u00b6 18.  \nConsistent with these principles, this court has repeatedly held that res judicata bars a party \nfrom raising issues in a postsentencing Crim.R. 32.1 motion that were or could have been \nraised in a direct appeal.  State v. Ikharo, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-967, 2011-Ohio-2746, \u00b6 11, \nciting State v. Hagler, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-291, 2010-Ohio-6123.  \n{\u00b6 12} Here, all of appellant's asserted claims appear on the face of the record and \ncould have been raised on direct appeal.  Appellant admits as much in his brief.  (Appellant's \nBrief at 2, 7, 13, 17, 19, and 32.)    \n{\u00b6 13} To the extent appellant argues that he could not have raised his claims on \ndirect appeal because he was not advised of his appellate rights at the time he entered his \nplea, we note that \" ' \"[t]he trial court's duty to advise a defendant of his right to appeal does \nnot arise until sentencing and, therefore, has no effect upon whether the defendant's guilty \nplea was entered knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.\" ' \"  State v. Allen, 9th Dist. No. \n27494, 2017-Ohio-2831, \u00b6 15, quoting State v. Jordan, 9th Dist. No. 27690,  2015-Ohio-\n4354, \u00b6 6, quoting State v. Meredith, 9th Dist. No. 25198, 2011-Ohio-1517, \u00b6 6.  See also \nState v. Tunstall, 2d Dist. No. 23730, 2010-Ohio-4926, \u00b6 35 (failure properly to advise a \ndefendant of his appellate rights has no bearing on the validity of a guilty plea).   \n{\u00b6 14} Moreover, the record includes appellant's signed, written plea of guilty, which \ndemonstrates that appellant was advised of his appellate rights.  Indeed, the plea agreement \nstates that \"I understand that I can appeal as a matter of right from my plea and sentence \nwithin thirty days of the filing of my judgment of conviction.\"  (May 1, 2017 Entry of Guilty \nPlea, at 2.)  Appellant admitted at the plea hearing that he signed the plea agreement, \nreviewed it with his attorney, and understood its contents.  (May 1, 2007 Tr. at 35.)  \nAppellant concedes that \"on page two of the plea agreement appellant acknowledges that \nhe has the right to appeal from his sentence and plea.\"  (Appellant's Brief at 5.)   No.  20AP-350  6 \n \n \n{\u00b6 15} In addition, appellant could have, but did not, assert the claims raised in his \nsecond Crim.R. 32.1 motion in his July 6, 2018 motion for leave to file a delayed appeal of \nhis May 1, 2017 judgment of conviction. As noted above, appellant's motion asserted as \ngrounds for appeal only that the indictment was defective.    \n{\u00b6 16} Finally, the claims appellant asserts in his second Crim.R. 32.1 motion are \nalso barred by res judicata because they could have been raised in his first Crim.R. 32.1 \nmotion.  Appellant acknowledges that he \"is aware that both of the claims could have been \npresented in his previous 32.1 motion.\"  (Appellant's Brief at 17.)  \"Res judicata * * * acts to \nbar raising issues in a successive Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw a plea of guilty where \nthose issues could have been raised in the prior Crim.R. 32.1 motion.\"  Ikaro, 10th Dist. No. \n10AP-967, 2011-Ohio-2746, at \u00b6 11, citing State v. Gallegos-Martinez, 5th Dist. No. 10-\nCAA-06-0043, 2010-Ohio-6463, \u00b6 12.  Appellant maintains that he could not have raised \nall of the claims in his first Crim.R. 32.1 motion because \"all of his claims are based on the \ntrial court[']s record\" and, accordingly, res judicata would have barred those claims.  \n(Appellant's Brief at 8-9.)  Appellant's argument suggests that because res judicata barred \nhim from raising his claims in his first Crim.R. 32.1 motion, he should be permitted to raise \nthe same claims in a successive motion to withdraw.  As observed by the state, \"[s]imply to \nstate this argument is enough to defeat it.\"  (Appellee's Brief at 8.) \n{\u00b6 17}   Appellant's successive motion to withdraw his guilty plea (comprised of both \nthe December 18, 2019 and January 10, 2020 filings) is barred by res judicata because the \nclaims asserted therein could have been raised on direct appeal or in his motion for delayed \nappeal and, further, could have been raised in his first motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  \nAccordingly, the trial court properly denied appellant's successive Crim.R. 32.1 motion to \nwithdraw his guilty plea.   \n{\u00b6 18} Having so determined, we overrule appellant's first and second assignments \nof error, and affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. \nJudgment affirmed. \nBROWN and SADLER, JJ., concur. \n    ", "case_juv": "0", "case_crim": "0", "case_2001": "0", "case_app": "0", "case_pros": "0", "aoe_none": "0", "aoe_grandjury": "0", "aoe_court": "0", "aoe_defense": "0", "aoe_procbar": "0", "aoe_prochist": "1", "case_timeframe": "0", "other": "69    0\nName: other, dtype: int64", "olmocr_text": "Defendant-appellant, Alphonso D. Mobley, Jr., acting pro se, appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas denying his Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty plea. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\nOn April 15, 2016, appellant was charged in a six-count indictment, including one count of aggravated arson in violation of R.C. 2909.02, and one count of criminal use of an explosive device in violation of R.C. 2909.27; each count also carried a firearm specification. On May 1, 2017, appellant entered a counseled guilty plea to one count of aggravated arson, with a firearm specification, and one count of criminal use of an explosive device. On the same day, the trial court sentenced appellant to an aggregate prison term of 14 years. Appellant did not appeal the May 1, 2017 judgment of conviction.\nOn October 25, 2017, appellant filed a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1, essentially arguing that the plea was involuntary because the aggravated arson and criminal use of explosives should have merged pursuant to R.C. 2941.145. The trial court overruled the motion on December 15, 2017, finding that res judicata barred appellant from raising the merger argument, as it could have been raised in a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence. Alternatively, the trial court determined that appellant did not allege facts in his motion to support a finding of manifest injustice, prosecutorial misconduct, or ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Consequently, the trial court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing. Appellant timely appealed to this court. In a decision rendered on September 25, 2018, we affirmed. State v. Mobley, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-23, 2018-Ohio-3880.\n\nIn the interval between the trial court\u2019s denial of the Crim.R. 32.1 motion and our affirmance thereof, appellant, on July 6, 2018, filed a pro se motion for leave to file a delayed appeal from the May 1, 2017 judgment of conviction. In his motion, appellant set forth the reasons for his failure to timely perfect an appeal, as well as the substantive argument he proposed to raise on direct appeal, i.e., that the indictment was defective. This court denied appellant\u2019s motion on grounds that he failed to meet his App.R. 5(A) burden of demonstrating a reasonable explanation for failure to perfect a timely appeal. State v. Mobley, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-539 (Oct. 25, 2018).\n\nOn December 18, 2019, appellant filed a second Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty plea; he filed an amendment to his motion on January 10, 2020. In his December 18, 2019 filing, appellant asserted that manifest injustice compelled the withdrawal of his guilty plea, arguing that (1) he involuntarily waived his right to counsel on appeal, resulting in a forfeiture of his right to a timely appeal; (2) he unintelligently pled guilty to less than all the elements of R.C. 2909.02(A)(1) and 2929.27(A); (3) the conditions of the plea agreement were not entered into the record, resulting in the involuntary waiver of the right to notice of the nature and cause of the allegations; and, (4) he was denied effective assistance of counsel due to counsel\u2019s failure to investigate evidence, object to amendments of the indictment, file a notice of appeal, and request appointment of counsel on appeal. In his January 10, 2020 filing, appellant further asserted that he involuntarily waived his rights (1) to have the trial court consider a victim impact statement and make findings of harm, (2) to court approval of nolle prosequi of the firearm specification, and,\n(3) regarding forfeiture of his property. Appellant also asserted claims for fraud on the court perpetrated by the prosecutor and defense counsel and prejudicial conduct/bias on the part of the trial judge.\n\n\u00b6 6 In its judgment denying appellant\u2019s motion, the trial court concluded that no manifest injustice occurred, specifically finding that appellant\u2019s assertions that he waived his right to appellate counsel, that he pled guilty to insufficient elements of the offenses, that the terms of the plea agreement were not entered into the record, and that his counsel was ineffective were unsupported by the record. As noted above, these assertions were made in appellant\u2019s initial filing on December 18, 2019. The trial court did not expressly address the additional assertions made in the January 10, 2020 amended filing. In addition to finding no manifest injustice, the trial court determined that appellant\u2019s motion was untimely, having been filed more than two and one-half years after entry of his guilty plea. Finally, the trial court found that res judicata barred appellant from raising the claims underlying his motion because those claims could have been raised in his prior motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Accordingly, the trial court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing.\n\n\u00b6 7 Appellant timely appeals, advancing two assignments of error for our review:\n\nI. The trial court abused its discretion when it found: (1) No Manifest Injustice; (2) Res judicata bars relief; (3) There exist[s] an undue delay.\n\nII. The trial court abused its discretion when it failed to consider: (1) Breach of Contract; (2) Fraud on the Court by officers of the Court and Defense Counsel.\n\n\u00b6 8 Appellant\u2019s assignments of error are interrelated and will be considered together.1 In them, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying\n\n---\n\n1 We note that addition to his briefing, appellant has filed several documents in this court purportedly relevant to his appeal. On July 20, 2020, appellant filed documents captioned \u201cStatement of Evidence Pursuant to Ohio App.R. 9(C),\u201d \u201cStatement to the Clerk Pursuant to Ohio App.R. 9(B)(5),\u201d and \u201cStatement of Proceedings Pursuant to Ohio App.R. 9(C).\u201d To the extent appellant intends these documents to be a substitute for the actual appellate record certified and filed by the Franklin County Clerk of Courts, the filings are improper. The record certified and filed by the clerk is complete and includes a transcript of the plea and sentencing proceedings. As such, the provisions in App.R. 9 are inapplicable. Further, on August 6, 2020, appellant filed a document captioned \u201cJudicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts Ohio Evidence Rule 201.\u201d Attached to this document are various unauthenticated documents purporting to be responses to correspondence appellant sent to various public agencies, including the Columbus Division of Fire, Fire and Explosives Investigations Unit, the Franklin County Public Defender, the Ohio Public Defender, and the Ohio Department of Commerce. It does not appear that these documents are contained in the appellate\nhis motion to withdraw his guilty plea on grounds of no manifest injustice, res judicata, and undue delay and in failing to consider his claims for breach of contract and fraud on the court.\n\n{\u00b6 9} \"Motions to withdraw guilty pleas are governed by Crim.R. 32.1, which provides that the motion 'may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.'\" State v. Spivakov, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-32, 2013-Ohio-3343, \u00b6 9, quoting Crim.R. 32.1. \"Manifest injustice relates to some fundamental flaw in the proceedings which results in a miscarriage of justice or is inconsistent with the demands of due process.\" Id. at \u00b6 10, citing State v. Williams, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1214, 2004-Ohio-6123, \u00b6 5. \"'[I]t is clear that under such standard, a postsentence withdrawal motion is allowable only in extraordinary cases.'\" Id., quoting State v. Gripper, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-1186, 2011-Ohio-3656, \u00b6 7, quoting State v. Smith, 49 Ohio St.2d 261, 264 (1977). \"A defendant seeking to withdraw a post-sentence guilty plea bears the burden of establishing a manifest injustice based on specific facts either contained in the record or supplied through affidavits attached to the motion.\" Id., citing State v. Barrett, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-375, 2011-Ohio-4986, \u00b6 8.\n\n{\u00b6 10} \"An appellate court will not reverse a trial court's denial of a motion to withdraw a plea absent an abuse of discretion.\" State v. Muhumed, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-1001, 2012-Ohio-6155, \u00b6 8, citing State v. Totten, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-278, 2005-Ohio-6210, \u00b6 5. An abuse of discretion connotes a decision that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. State v. Wilson, 10th Dist. No. 19AP-536, 2020-Ohio-1136, \u00b6 14, citing Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219 (1983). Where, however, the issue is the applicability of res judicata, which is a question of law, an appellate court conducts a de novo review. Muhumed at \u00b6 11, citing EMC Mtge. Corp v. Jenkins, 164 Ohio App.3d 240, 249, 2005-Ohio-5799, \u00b6 15 (10th Dist.).\n\n{\u00b6 11} Appellant's successive motion to withdraw his guilty plea (comprised of the December 18, 2019 and January 10, 2020 filings) is barred by res judicata. \"Under the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from record. Accordingly, appellant's reliance on these documents in support of his assignments of error is improper. State v. Ishmail, 54 Ohio St.2d 402 (1978), paragraph one of the syllabus.\nthat judgment, any defense or claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.\" (Emphasis omitted.) *State v. Perry*, 10 Ohio St.2d 175 (1967), paragraph nine of the syllabus. \"'\"[R]es judicata promotes the principles of finality and judicial economy by preventing endless relitigation of an issue on which a defendant has already received a full and fair opportunity to be heard.\"'\" *State v. Walden*, 3d Dist. No. 4-15-13, 2016-Ohio-258, \u00b6 19, quoting *State v. Schwieterman*, 3d Dist. No. 10-09-12, 2010-Ohio-102, \u00b6 23, quoting *State v. Saxton*, 109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, \u00b6 18.\n\nConsistent with these principles, this court has repeatedly held that res judicata bars a party from raising issues in a postsentencing Crim.R. 32.1 motion that were or could have been raised in a direct appeal. *State v. Ikharo*, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-967, 2011-Ohio-2746, \u00b6 11, citing *State v. Hagler*, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-291, 2010-Ohio-6123.\n\n{\u00b6 12} Here, all of appellant's asserted claims appear on the face of the record and could have been raised on direct appeal. Appellant admits as much in his brief. (Appellant's Brief at 2, 7, 13, 17, 19, and 32.)\n\n{\u00b6 13} To the extent appellant argues that he could not have raised his claims on direct appeal because he was not advised of his appellate rights at the time he entered his plea, we note that \"'\"[t]he trial court's duty to advise a defendant of his right to appeal does not arise until sentencing and, therefore, has no effect upon whether the defendant's guilty plea was entered knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.\"'\" *State v. Allen*, 9th Dist. No. 27494, 2017-Ohio-2831, \u00b6 15, quoting *State v. Jordan*, 9th Dist. No. 27690, 2015-Ohio-4354, \u00b6 6, quoting *State v. Meredith*, 9th Dist. No. 25198, 2011-Ohio-1517, \u00b6 6. See also *State v. Tunstall*, 2d Dist. No. 23730, 2010-Ohio-4926, \u00b6 35 (failure properly to advise a defendant of his appellate rights has no bearing on the validity of a guilty plea).\n\n{\u00b6 14} Moreover, the record includes appellant's signed, written plea of guilty, which demonstrates that appellant was advised of his appellate rights. Indeed, the plea agreement states that \"I understand that I can appeal as a matter of right from my plea and sentence within thirty days of the filing of my judgment of conviction.\" (May 1, 2017 Entry of Guilty Plea, at 2.) Appellant admitted at the plea hearing that he signed the plea agreement, reviewed it with his attorney, and understood its contents. (May 1, 2007 Tr. at 35.) Appellant concedes that \"on page two of the plea agreement appellant acknowledges that he has the right to appeal from his sentence and plea.\" (Appellant's Brief at 5.)\nIn addition, appellant could have, but did not, assert the claims raised in his second Crim.R. 32.1 motion in his July 6, 2018 motion for leave to file a delayed appeal of his May 1, 2017 judgment of conviction. As noted above, appellant\u2019s motion asserted as grounds for appeal only that the indictment was defective.\n\nFinally, the claims appellant asserts in his second Crim.R. 32.1 motion are also barred by res judicata because they could have been raised in his first Crim.R. 32.1 motion. Appellant acknowledges that he \"is aware that both of the claims could have been presented in his previous 32.1 motion.\" (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 17.) \"Res judicata *** acts to bar raising issues in a successive Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw a plea of guilty where those issues could have been raised in the prior Crim.R. 32.1 motion.\" Ikaro, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-967, 2011-Ohio-2746, at \u00b6 11, citing State v. Gallegos-Martinez, 5th Dist. No. 10-CAA-06-0043, 2010-Ohio-6463, \u00b6 12. Appellant maintains that he could not have raised all of the claims in his first Crim.R. 32.1 motion because \"all of his claims are based on the trial court[']s record\" and, accordingly, res judicata would have barred those claims. (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 8-9.) Appellant\u2019s argument suggests that because res judicata barred him from raising his claims in his first Crim.R. 32.1 motion, he should be permitted to raise the same claims in a successive motion to withdraw. As observed by the state, \"[s]imply to state this argument is enough to defeat it.\" (Appellee\u2019s Brief at 8.)\n\nAppellant\u2019s successive motion to withdraw his guilty plea (comprised of both the December 18, 2019 and January 10, 2020 filings) is barred by res judicata because the claims asserted therein could have been raised on direct appeal or in his motion for delayed appeal and, further, could have been raised in his first motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s successive Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty plea.\n\nHaving so determined, we overrule appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error, and affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nBROWN and SADLER, JJ., concur."}

Ct. 1698, 1703, 207 L.Ed. 2d 58 (2020). \nPetitioner begins his Motion by accusing the Court of bad faith, unethical conduct, and \nviolating its oath to uphold the Constitution (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6641-43).  As an \nexample, he claims that  the Court\u2019s Opinion and Order is \u201cbo ilerplate.\u201d That claim is belied by \nsimple examination of that document which consists sixteen pages of point-by-point consideration \nCase: 2:20-cv-01873-ALM-MRM Doc #: 99 Filed: 08/10/21 Page: 2 of 16  PAGEID #: 67333 \n \nof Petitioner\u2019s sixty-six page set of Objections to the Magistra te Judge\u2019s forty-nine page Report.  \nGarner\u2019s Modern Legal usage defines \u201cboilerplate\u201d as \u201cready-made or all-purpose language that \nwill fit in a variety of documents.\u201d   \nSometimes courts, because of the volume of cases they must decide, must use boilerplate.  \nAn example of boilerplate in this case is the decision of the Supreme C ourt of Ohio declining \njurisdiction over Shine-Johns on\u2019s appeal; the Entry r eads in its entirety \u201c Upon consideration of \nthe jurisdictional memoranda filed in this case, the court declines to accept jurisdiction of the \nappeal pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 7.08(B)(4).\u201d (ECF No. 45, Ex. 73).  This language is identical to \nthat ordinarily used by that court in declining jurisdiction.  It is nothing like the detailed opinions \nthe Court has produced in this case. \nThe gravamen of Petitioner\u2019s claim in the Motion seems to be that the Court ignored \n\u201cspecific legal issues\u201d in favor of deciding the case on the ba sis of \u201ctechnical aspects.\u201d (Motion, \nECF No. 98, PageID 6641-42).  The Court\u2019s Oath to defend the Constitution requires it to apply \nall the law that pertains to a case, both substantive and procedural, whether or not some aspects of \nthe applicable law seem \u201ctechnical\u201d.   \nPetitioner objects to the Court\u2019s conclusion that his attorney\u2019s omission of issues he wanted \nto have presented to the Suprem e Court of Ohio canno t be ineffective assistance of appellate \ncounsel because there is no constitutional right to appointed counsel on appeal to that court (ECF \nNo. 98, PageID 6643-44).  Petitioner opines  \nIt is an insult to the spirit of the judiciary to even suggest that such \na practice can exist in These [sic] United States. If there is no prior \nclear precedence [sic] on this issue, Shine-Johnson proffers that now \nis the time for someone in the judiciary to take the reigns' [sic] and \nbegin that precedent. \n \nId. However valuable such a change in constitutional law might be, this trial court must obey \nCase: 2:20-cv-01873-ALM-MRM Doc #: 99 Filed: 08/10/21 Page: 3 of 16  PAGEID #: 67344 \n \nexisting precedent from the Supreme Court of th e United States which hol ds there is no Sixth \nAmendment right to effective assistance of counsel beyond the first appeal of right.  Pennsylvania \nv. Finley, 481 U.S. 551, 555 (1987); Ross v. Moffitt , 417 U.S. 600 (1974).  That Court has also \nexpressly held ineffective assistance of counsel can excuse procedural default only when it occurs \nin a proceeding where a defendant is constit utionally entitled to counsel under the Sixth \nAmendment.   Wainwright v. Torna, 455 U.S. 586 (1982)(where there is no constitutional right to \ncounsel, there can be no deprivation of effective counsel).  If this law should be changed, it is the \nSupreme Court which must do so.  \"Unless we wish anarchy to prevail within the federal judicial \nsystem, a precedent of this Court must be foll owed by the lower federal courts no matter how \nmisguided the judges of those courts may think it to be.\"  Hutto v. Davis, 454 U.S. 370, 375 (1982). \nShine-Johnson reargues his Restatement of the La w (Agency) point at some length, but the \nRestatement does not establish constitutional law.  \n Petitioner claims that his actual innocence can and should excuse any procedural default \n(Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6657-62).  The C ourt analyzed Shine-Johnson\u2019s purported new \nevidence of actual innocence and adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s  rejection of it (Opinion and \nOrder, ECF No.96, PageID 6628).  Petitioner\u2019s Motion merely reargues this point without showing \nany manifest error of law in the Court\u2019s Opinion and Order.   \nThe Court remains unpersuaded that Shine-Johns on has established his actual innocence.  \nThere is no question that he shot his father to death.  He claims he did it in self-defense because \nhe reasonably believed it was nece ssary to keep his fath er from killing him.  He was entitled to \nmake that claim to the jury, but the jury did not accept it.   \n \n \n \nCase: 2:20-cv-01873-ALM-MRM Doc #: 99 Filed: 08/10/21 Page: 4 of 16  PAGEID #: 67355 \n \n \n \nGround One: Prosecutorial Misconduct \n \n \nIn his First Ground for Relief, Petitioner as serts his trial was rendered unfair by \nprosecutorial misconduct.  The Court rejected this claim as procedurally defaulted and also without \nmerit, deferring to the Tenth District\u2019s decision that the prosecutor did not misstate Ohio law.  \nPetitioner had claimed this Court was not bound by an intermediate court of appeals\u2019 decision \nwhen it was contrary to Supreme Court of Ohio  decisions.  The Court accepted that claim, but \nnoted Petitioner had cited no Supreme Court of Ohio decision which was to the contrary of what \nthe Tenth District decided (Opinion, ECF No. 96, PageID 6629). \nPetitioner now claims he did cite Supreme Court of Ohio law contrary to the Tenth \nDistrict\u2019s decision (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6673, citing State v. Williford, 49 Ohio St.3d 247 \n(1990); State v. Thomas, 77 Ohio St.3d 323 (1997); Marts v. State, 26 Ohio St. 162 (1875); Erwin \nv. State, 29 Ohio St. 186, 195 (1876); and Graham v. State, 98 Ohio St. 77, 79 (1918). \nIn deciding Petitioner\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim on direct appeal, the Tenth District \nexpressly held \u201cFurthermore, appe llant cites no authority to support his claim it is erroneous or \nprejudicial error for the prosecutor to impliedly connect the duty to avoid trouble with the not-at-\nfault element.\u201d State v. Shine-Johnson , 2018-Ohio-3347. \u00b6 78 (Ohio App. 10 th Dist. Aug. 21, \n2018).  Williford, Thomas, and Erwin were cited to the Tenth District; Graham and Marts were \nnot (Appellant\u2019s Brief, State Court Record, ECF No. 45, PageID 33562 et seq.)  Williford is not \nabout the duty to avoid danger or prosecutorial misconduct, but about the failure of the trial court \nto instruct on self-defense and the duty to retreat.  Thomas is also not about either prosecutorial \nmisconduct or the duty to avoid danger.  Erwin, from the late nineteenth  century, is about jury \ninstructions, not the duty to avoid danger, or prosecutorial misconduct.  Citing some Ohio Supreme \nCase: 2:20-cv-01873-ALM-MRM Doc #: 99 Filed: 08/10/21 Page: 5 of 16  PAGEID #: 67366 \n \nCourt cases having to do with various other aspects of the defense of self-defense does not establish \nthat there is Supreme Court of Ohio precedent proving the Tenth District was wrong in its analysis \nof Petitioner\u2019s First Assignment of Error.  Ab sent such proof, this Court is bound by the Tenth \nDistrict\u2019s decision. Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U.S. 74 (2005).  Petitione r has therefore shown no \nclear or manifest error of law in this Court\u2019s reliance on the Tenth Distri ct\u2019s conclusion that the \nprosecutor did not misstate Ohio law. \nAt the end of his argument on Ground One (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6683), Petitioner \nacknowledges the standard for ev aluating a claim of prosecutor ial misconduct is set forth in \nDarden v. Wainwright , 477 U.S. 168, 181 (1986):  On habeas review, \"the relevant question is \nwhether the prosecutor's comments 'so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction \na denial of due process.'\" 477 U.S. at 181, quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 643 \n(1974).  This is the standard the Tenth District applied, concluding at the first step of the analysis \nthat the prosecutor did not misstate Ohio law.  Petitioner has not shown this Court committed a \nclear error of law in deferring to that decision. \n \nGround Two: Failure to Give Curative Instructions \n \nIn his Second Ground for Relief, Shine-Johnson cl aims he was denied a fair trial because \nthe trial court failed to give a curative instru ction on the prosecutor\u2019s claim in closing argument \nthat Shine-Johnson had essentially admitted to murder, defined as Ohio law does as a \u201cpurposeful \nkilling.\u201d  The Tenth District found this cl aim procedurally defa ulted for want of a \ncontemporaneous objection and without merit, given the context in which the prosecutor used the \nword \u201cmurder,\u201d to wit, explaining self-defense  and the meaning of \u201cp urposeful killing\u201d  Shine-\nCase: 2:20-cv-01873-ALM-MRM Doc #: 99 Filed: 08/10/21 Page: 6 of 16  PAGEID #: 67377 \n \nJohnson I, \u00b6\u00b6 111-12. \n As with Ground One, the District Judge adopt ed the Magistrate Judg e\u2019s conclusions that \nGround Two was indeed procedurally defaulted and without merit (Opinion and Order, ECF No. \n96, PageID 6632-33).   \n Petitioner\u2019s Motion asserts there is no procedural default because he did not violate the \ncontemporaneous objection rule (ECF No. 98, PageID 6684).  Essentially he argues the Ohio rule \nis that an objection is \u201ccontemporaneous enough\u201d if the trial judge can still correct the error.  Id. \nrelying on State v. Tudor, 154 Ohio St. 249 (1950).  There is no such holding in Tudor; it reinforces \nan attorney\u2019s duty to object, but does not say when is soon enough.  Petitioner even claims \u201cThe \nrule is stated in unmistakable terms, both in Ohio Criminal Rule 30(A) and in countless decisions. \nSee, e.g., State v. Landrum. 53 Ohio St. 3d 107 (1990).\u201d  Crimin al Rule 30 provides a party may \nnot raise on appeal error in a jury instruction which was not called to the trial judge\u2019s attention \nbefore the jury retires.  But the omitted objection which led to procedural default of Ground One \nwas failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s claim in closing argument that Shine-Johnson had admitted \nto murder.  Ground One is about prosecutori al misconduct, not trial court error.  Landrum is not \nto the contrary; the phrase \u201ccontemporaneous objection\u201d does not even appear in that decision. \n At this stage of the case, the question is not  whether the Tenth District misconstrued Ohio \nlaw on contemporaneous objections.  A habeas court is not authorized to correct perceived errors \nof state law.  Rather our task in adjudicating procedural default defenses is to determine if the State \nhas a relevant procedural rule, whether it was in fact enforced against the petitioner, and whether \nit is adequate and independent of federal law.  Maupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986). \nThere is no doubt Ohio has a contemporaneous object ion rule and it was enforced against Shine-\nJohnson.  The Sixth Circuit has repeatedly upheld ap plication of that rule , including in capital \nCase: 2:20-cv-01873-ALM-MRM Doc #: 99 Filed: 08/10/21 Page: 7 of 16  PAGEID #: 67388 \n \ncases.

Mitchell, 209 F.3d 854 (6th Cir. \n2000), citing Engle v. Isaac,  456 U.S. 107, 124-29 (1982).  There was no clear error of law in \nfinding Ground Two procedurally defaulted.   \n \nGround Three: Failure to Give Requested Instructions \n \nIn his Third Ground for Relief, Shine-Johnson claims he was deprived of a fair trial when \nthe trial court refused to give certain requested jury instructions on the defense of self-defense.  As \nnoted in the Report, Shine-Johnson spent nearly fifty pages of his Traverse arguing this issue and \nadvocating for a \u201cno duty to retreat\u201d inst ruction (Report, ECF No. 85, PageID 6352, citing \nTraverse, ECF No. 81, PageID 6197-6241).  The Tent h District denied th is claim because the \nrecord established without contra diction that Petitioner had alr eady retreated from the home he \nshared with his father and shot his father from the ya rd of the house.  Id. at PageID 6352-54, \nquoting State v. Shine-Johnson I  at \u00b6\u00b6 27-33.  The Opinion and Order notes that Petitioner\u2019s \nObjections to the Report repeated his argument on this issue from the Traverse, but never \u201ccites a \nSupreme Court of Ohio decision th at there is no duty to retreat  when the shooting takes place \noutside the residence\u201d (ECF No. 98, PageID 6633-34).   \n Petitioner\u2019s Rule 59(e) Motion asserts: \nThe Trial Court nor the District Court have shown that the petitioner \nactually violated any state laws. The state used misconduct and \nadept trickery of the court to force the jury to believe that by law the \nCase: 2:20-cv-01873-ALM-MRM Doc #: 99 Filed: 08/10/21 Page: 8 of 16  PAGEID #: 67399 \n \npetitioner had a duty to retreat again after his first retreat failed \nbecause he was not in the confines  of his home, but outside while \nfaced with a loaded shotgun. \n \n(ECF No. 98, PageID 6687).  He again argues the \u201cno duty to retreat\u201d claim, but fails, as he had \nbefore the Tenth District, to cite any holding by the Supreme Court of Ohio that the no duty to \nretreat exception applies outsi de the home.  He does cite Beard v. United States , 158 U.S. 550 \n(1895).  Justice John Marshall Harlan tells us the case involved the killing of one \u201cwhite man\u201d by \nanother \u201cwhite man\u201d in Indian country, but does not say how this affects the choice of applicable \nlaw.  Instead Justice Harlan discusses common law authorities1 on self-defense and concludes that \nthey erect no duty to retreat on one\u2019s own property: \nIndeed, the tendency of the Amer ican mind seems to be very \nstrongly against the enforcement of any rule which requires a person \nto flee when assailed, to avoid ch astisement or even to save human \nlife, and that tendency is well illustrated by the recent decisions of \nour courts, bearing on the general subject of the right of self-defence. \n \n158 U.S. at 561-62.  Since the decision in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins , 304 U.S. 64 (1938), \nfederal courts have been much less likely to look to the common law in defining federal crimes \nand defenses.  And in any event this is not a federal criminal case like Beard, but an Ohio criminal \ncase in which the Ohio courts are authorized to say what Ohio law requires. \n Petitioner also claimed in this Ground for Re lief that the trial cour t erred by not giving a \nlimiting instruction regarding character evidence.  The Report, a dopted by Chief Judge Marbley, \nfound the claim was without merit because it was not contrary to any United States Supreme Court \nprecedent on character evidence (ECF No. 85, PageID 6358).  Petitioner\u2019s Motion merely reargues \nthis claim without citing any Supreme Court co nstitutional precedent to the contrary.  The Sixth \nCircuit has held \u201cThere is no clearly established Supreme Court precedent which holds that a state \n \n1 East's Pleas of the Crown; Foster's Crown Cases: Bishop's New Criminal Law; 2 Wharton on Crim.

Mitchell, 329 F.3d 496, 512 (6th Cir. 2003), noting that the Supreme Court refused to reach \nthe issue in Estelle v. McGuire. 502 U.S. 62 (1991). \n \nGround Four: Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel \n \n The Tenth District decided  that none of the objections Pet itioner alleges his trial counsel \nshould have made would likely have been successful.  The Report recommended dismissal of this \nclaim because \u201cIt cannot be deficient performance in violation of the first prong of Strickland [v. \nWashington] to fail to make an objection that was without merit. Neither Strickland nor any of its \nprogeny hold that a trial attorney performs deficien tly when he or she fails to make a meritless \nobjection.\u201d  (ECF No. 85, PageID 6362).  In th e instant Motion, Shine-Johnson merely reargues \nhis claims of prosecutorial misconduct (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6701-04).  He offers nothing \nnew to show this Court committed a clear error of law in deferring to the Tenth District. \n \nGround Five: Cumulative Trial Court Error \n \n The Report and the Opinion an d Order found this claim non-c ognizable.  Petitioner does \nnot move to amend the Court\u2019s decision on Ground Five. \n \nGround Six: Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel \n \n \nIn his Sixth Ground for Relief, Shine-Johnson claims he received ineffective assistance of \nappellate counsel when his appellate attorney faile d to raise as an assignment of error his trial \nCase: 2:20-cv-01873-ALM-MRM Doc #: 99 Filed: 08/10/21 Page: 10 of 16  PAGEID #: 674111 \n \ncounsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to dismiss because the State had destroyed exculpatory evidence.  \nThe Report found that Petitioner\u2019s late filing of his 26(B) Application to raise this claim was \nexcused by the State\u2019s conduct in mailing it late and the claim was therefore not procedurally \ndefaulted.  However, the Report rejected this claim on the merits, concluding Petitioner\u2019s assertion \nof destruction of exculpatory evidence would have failed on direct appeal for lack of evidence in \nthe record (ECF No. 85, PageID 6363-67).  Th e Court accepted this conclusion (Opinion and \nOrder, ECF No. 96, PageID  6636-38). \n Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Amend asserts \u201cThe petitioner has shown a genuine issue if trial \ncounsel was ineffective for allowing the State to alter exculpatory and/or impeaching evidence of \nthe 20-guage [sic] shotgun and introduce fraudulent false evidence of  the operability testing \nreport.\u201d (ECF No. 98, PageID 6705).  Shine- Johnson continues by asserting a due process \nviolation under Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959).  He concludes \u201cThe Court seems to find \nit is ok present false and tainted evidence at trial and it does not violate due process.\u201d   \n Petitioner\u2019s Motion assumes without proving the truth of the underlying claim that the \nshotgun, if it had not been disass embled, would have been exculpat ory and that disassembling it \nwas intended to destroy its exculpatory value and provide false information to be presented.  None \nof this was proved; all of it is assumed.   \nThe basis of the Court\u2019s decision on Ground Six is that there was no evidence in the record \nto prove any part of this Trombetta claim and therefore no basi s for an appellate claim of \nineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to raise the claim.  Appellate counsel have to work \nwith the record bequeathed to th em.  They cannot responsibly ma ke claims not supported by the \nrecord.  Petitioner has shown no clear error of law in the Court\u2019s dismissal of Ground Six on that \nbasis. \nCase: 2:20-cv-01873-ALM-MRM Doc #: 99 Filed: 08/10/21 Page: 11 of 16  PAGEID #: 674212 \n \n \nGround Seven: Mandatory Retroactive Application of a Change in the Burden of Proof on \nSelf-Defense \n \nIn his Seventh Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts that a change in the statutory burden of \nproof for self-defense must be applied retroactively to his case.  September 10, 2015, was the date \nof the offense and the defendant\u2019s date of c onviction was February 24, 2017 (Entry, State Court \nRecord ECF No. 45-1, PageID 4331).  H.B. 228, wh ich changed the burden of proof for self-\ndefense, became effective March 28, 2019, and was not made expressly retroactive by the General \nAssembly. Id.  As noted in the Report, unde r Ohio law, \u201cA statute is presumed to be prospective \nin its operation unless expressly made retrospective.\u201d (ECF No. 85, PageID 6368, citing Ohio Rev. \nCode \u00a7 1.48). \n In arguing for retroactivity, Shine-Johnson ma de no reference to le gislative intent, but \nclaimed due process required re troactive application, relying on Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. \n348 (2004), and United States v. United States Coin & Currency,. 401 U.S. 715 (1971).  The \nReport rejected this claim, notin g that the cited cases were about retroactive application of \ndecisions of the Supreme Court itself, not any statute (ECF No. 96, PageID 6369). \n The relevant statute, 2018 H.B. 288, is codifi ed at Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.05(B)(1) and  \nprovides: \nA person is allowed to act in sel f-defense, defense of another, or \ndefense of that person\u2019s residence.  If, at the trial of a person who is \naccused of an offense that involved the person\u2019s use of force against \nanother, there is evidence presented that tends  to support that the \naccused person used the force in self-defense, defense of another, or \ndefense of that person\u2019s residence, the prosecution must prove \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the accused person did not use the \nforce in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person\u2019s \nresidence, as the case may be. \n \nCase: 2:20-cv-01873-ALM-MRM Doc #: 99 Filed: 08/10/21 Page: 12 of 16  PAGEID #: 674313 \n \n H.B. 288 changes the law of self-defense in Ohio.  Prior to its effective date of March 28, \n2019, Ohio law provided: \n(A)  Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until \nproven guilty beyond a reasonable d oubt, and the burden of proof \nfor all elements of the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden \nof going forward with the evidence of an affirmative defense, and \nthe burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, for an \naffirmative defense, is upon the accused.  \n \nOhio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.05(A).  This prior statute was before the United States Supreme Court \nin Martin v. Ohio, 480 U.S. 228 (1987), and its constitutional ity of allocating both the burden of \nproduction and the burden of proof by a preponderan ce of the evidence to defendant was held to \nbe constitutional.  This was th e form of the statute on self-def ense in force when Shine-Johnson \nwas tried and convicted in 2015.   \n H.B. 288 changes the law of self-defense in at least two ways.  First of all a trial court could \ndecide that evidence presented by the prosecutor in the case in ch ief was sufficient to support a \nfinding that the accused acted in self-defense.  Second, regardless of which side presents that \n\u201csufficient evidence,\u201d once it is in the record, the burden is on the State to disprove self-defense to \nthe standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.   \n H.B. 288 is not a \u201cclarification\u201d  or \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the old statute, as Petitioner would \nhave it.  New constructions, interpretations, or clarifications of existing statutes come from courts \napplying those statutes.  Rather, in H.B. 288 the Ohio General Assembly enacted a distinct change \nin the law.   \n In his Motion to Amend, Petitioner asserts the Court made a clear  error of law by not \nrequiring Ohio to apply H.B. 288 retroactively.  As noted above, the Court already found Schriro \nand United States Coin and Currency  inapplicable because they did not deal with statutes.   \nCase: 2:20-cv-01873-ALM-MRM Doc #: 99 Filed: 08/10/21 Page: 13 of 16  PAGEID #: 674414 \n \nAgreeing that not every state statute must be applied retroactively, Sh ine-Johnson nonetheless \nargues:  \nOn the other hand, where the statut e pertains to an affirmative \ndefense and the statute is constr ued to make the absence of the \naffirmative defense an element of  proof of the crime itself; a \nDIFFERENT RESULT IS MANDATED. In such a case, the \nconstitutional doctrine announced in Mullaney v Wilbur , 421 U.S. \n684, 95 S. Ct. 1881. 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975). and in In re Winship, \n397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970), requiring the \nprosecution to prove every element of a crime beyond a reasonable \ndoubt, has application. Berrier v. Eseler, 583 F.2d 515 (\"6th Cir.\"). \ncert. denied, 439 U.S. 955. 99 S. Ct. 354. 58 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1978). \nand the Due Process Clause requires that the new interpretation be \napplied retroactively. Hankerson v. North Carolina , 432 U.S. 233. \n97 S. Ct. 2339. 53 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1977). \n \n(Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6716). \n None of the cited case law supports a consti tutional requirement that H.B. 288 be applied \nretroactively to Petitioner\u2019s case.  Winship establishes that, as a matter of due process, a State must \nprove every element of a criminal offense by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 397 U.S. at 364. \nMullaney followed Winship and held that the absence of pa ssion on sudden provocation was an \nelement that the State needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.   Both were followed by Martin, \nsupra, where the Court held the allocation of burden of production and proof of self-defense in \nOhio under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.05 as it stood when Shine-Johnson was tried was \nconstitutional.  None of these cases speaks to retroactivity of statues at all.  Neither does Berrier, \nwhich involved interpretation of Michigan\u2019s, not Ohio\u2019s, self-defense doctrine.  Hankerson also \nwas about retroactive application of the Supreme Court decision in Mullaney. \n Shine-Johnson criticizes the Court\u2019s reliance on \u201cold law\u201d as upheld in Martin and argues  \n\u201cWhere the major purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal \ntrial that substantially impairs its truth-finding function and so raises serious questions about the \nCase: 2:20-cv-01873-ALM-MRM Doc #: 99 Filed: 08/10/21 Page: 14 of 16  PAGEID #: 674515 \n \naccuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule has been given complete retroactive effect.\u201d \n(Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6717).  But H.B. 288 is not \u201cnew constitutional doctrine,\u201d but a \nnewly-enacted statute.  And even with respect to new constitutional doctrine, the Supreme Court \nhas held that new constitutional procedural ru les will never be given retroactive effect.  Edwards \nv. Vannoy, 593 U.S. ___, 141 S. Ct. 1547 (2021).   \n Shine-Johnson argues H.B. 288 is a substantive change in the law and now makes his \nconduct constitutionally immune from punishment (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6717).  Not so.  \nIf H.B. 288 had been the law at the time of trial, the State would ha ve been required to disprove \nself-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.  But that means it would have been required to persuade \na jury, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that Shine-Johnson was not acting in self-defense.  The \nnew statute does not immunize the use of deadly force from punish ment just because the killer \nclaims to have been acting in self-defense.  The jury could still reject that defense if the State \nproved what happened was not self-defense.   \n As noted in the Report, the fact that H. B. 288 requires the Stat e to disprove beyond a \nreasonable doubt if the evidence su fficiently raises the question does not make \u201cabsence of self-\ndefense\u201d an element of murder.  Every elemen t of a crime must be proved beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.  Winship.  But not everything the legislature requires to be proved beyond a reasonable \ndoubt thereby becomes an element. Were it otherwis e, the State would be required to disprove \nself-defense regardless of whether there was any evidence of it at all.  Obviously there are many \nmurders where the evidence raises no question of self-defense. \n Petitioner accuses the Court of misconstruing the record about when his conviction became \nfinal which he says did not happen until May 8, 2019 (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6724).   On \nthat date the Supreme C ourt of Ohio declined jurisdiction ove r his direct appeal. Actually his \nCase: 2:20-cv-01873-ALM-MRM Doc #: 99 Filed: 08/10/21 Page: 15 of 16  PAGEID #: 674616 \n \nconviction did not become final on direct appeal until ninety days later (August 6, 2019) when his \ntime to seek certiorari from the United States Supreme Court expired.  Therefore H.B. 288 did \nbecome effective before Petitioner\u2019s conviction became final on direct appeal.  New constitutional \ndecisions by the Supreme Court of the United States apply to cases still on direct review when the \nSupreme Court case is decided, but not to cases pending on collateral review.  Teague v. Lane, 489 \nU.S. 288 (1989).  But H.B. 288 is not a constitu tional decision of the Supreme Court, but an \nenactment of the Ohio General Assembly.   \n \nConclusion \n \n Petitioner has failed to show a clear error of law in the Court\u2019s disposition of his habeas \ncorpus petition.  Therefore the Motion to Amend should be denied. \n \nAugust 10, 2021. \n        s /  Michael R.

Ct. 1698, 1703, 207 L.Ed. 2d 58 (2020).\n\nPetitioner begins his Motion by accusing the Court of bad faith, unethical conduct, and violating its oath to uphold the Constitution (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6641-43). As an example, he claims that the Court\u2019s Opinion and Order is \u201cboilerplate.\u201d That claim is belied by simple examination of that document which consists sixteen pages of point-by-point consideration\nof Petitioner\u2019s sixty-six page set of Objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s forty-nine page Report. Garner\u2019s Modern Legal usage defines \u201cboilerplate\u201d as \u201cready-made or all-purpose language that will fit in a variety of documents.\u201d\n\nSometimes courts, because of the volume of cases they must decide, must use boilerplate. An example of boilerplate in this case is the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio declining jurisdiction over Shine-Johnson\u2019s appeal; the Entry reads in its entirety \u201cUpon consideration of the jurisdictional memoranda filed in this case, the court declines to accept jurisdiction of the appeal pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 7.08(B)(4).\u201d (ECF No. 45, Ex. 73). This language is identical to that ordinarily used by that court in declining jurisdiction. It is nothing like the detailed opinions the Court has produced in this case.\n\nThe gravamen of Petitioner\u2019s claim in the Motion seems to be that the Court ignored \u201cspecific legal issues\u201d in favor of deciding the case on the basis of \u201ctechnical aspects.\u201d (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6641-42). The Court\u2019s Oath to defend the Constitution requires it to apply all the law that pertains to a case, both substantive and procedural, whether or not some aspects of the applicable law seem \u201ctechnical\u201d.\n\nPetitioner objects to the Court\u2019s conclusion that his attorney\u2019s omission of issues he wanted to have presented to the Supreme Court of Ohio cannot be ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because there is no constitutional right to appointed counsel on appeal to that court (ECF No. 98, PageID 6643-44). Petitioner opines\n\nIt is an insult to the spirit of the judiciary to even suggest that such a practice can exist in These [sic] United States. If there is no prior clear precedence [sic] on this issue, Shine-Johnson proffers that now is the time for someone in the judiciary to take the reigns' [sic] and begin that precedent.\n\nId. However valuable such a change in constitutional law might be, this trial court must obey\nexisting precedent from the Supreme Court of the United States which holds there is no Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel beyond the first appeal of right. *Pennsylvania v. Finley*, 481 U.S. 551, 555 (1987); *Ross v. Moffitt*, 417 U.S. 600 (1974). That Court has also expressly held ineffective assistance of counsel can excuse procedural default only when it occurs in a proceeding where a defendant is constitutionally entitled to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. *Wainwright v. Torna*, 455 U.S. 586 (1982)(where there is no constitutional right to counsel, there can be no deprivation of effective counsel). If this law should be changed, it is the Supreme Court which must do so. \"Unless we wish anarchy to prevail within the federal judicial system, a precedent of this Court must be followed by the lower federal courts no matter how misguided the judges of those courts may think it to be.\" *Hutto v. Davis*, 454 U.S. 370, 375 (1982).\n\nShine-Johnson reargues his Restatement of the Law (Agency) point at some length, but the Restatement does not establish constitutional law.\n\nPetitioner claims that his actual innocence can and should excuse any procedural default (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6657-62). The Court analyzed Shine-Johnson\u2019s purported new evidence of actual innocence and adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s rejection of it (Opinion and Order, ECF No.96, PageID 6628). Petitioner\u2019s Motion merely reargues this point without showing any manifest error of law in the Court\u2019s Opinion and Order.\n\nThe Court remains unpersuaded that Shine-Johnson has established his actual innocence. There is no question that he shot his father to death. He claims he did it in self-defense because he reasonably believed it was necessary to keep his father from killing him. He was entitled to make that claim to the jury, but the jury did not accept it.\nGround One: Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\nIn his First Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts his trial was rendered unfair by prosecutorial misconduct. The Court rejected this claim as procedurally defaulted and also without merit, deferring to the Tenth District\u2019s decision that the prosecutor did not misstate Ohio law. Petitioner had claimed this Court was not bound by an intermediate court of appeals\u2019 decision when it was contrary to Supreme Court of Ohio decisions. The Court accepted that claim, but noted Petitioner had cited no Supreme Court of Ohio decision which was to the contrary of what the Tenth District decided (Opinion, ECF No. 96, PageID 6629).\n\nPetitioner now claims he did cite Supreme Court of Ohio law contrary to the Tenth District\u2019s decision (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6673, citing State v. Williford, 49 Ohio St.3d 247 (1990); State v. Thomas, 77 Ohio St.3d 323 (1997); Marts v. State, 26 Ohio St. 162 (1875); Erwin v. State, 29 Ohio St. 186, 195 (1876); and Graham v. State, 98 Ohio St. 77, 79 (1918).\n\nIn deciding Petitioner\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim on direct appeal, the Tenth District expressly held \u201cFurthermore, appellant cites no authority to support his claim it is erroneous or prejudicial error for the prosecutor to impliedly connect the duty to avoid trouble with the not-at-fault element.\u201d State v. Shine-Johnson, 2018-Ohio-3347. \u00b6 78 (Ohio App. 10th Dist. Aug. 21, 2018). Williford, Thomas, and Erwin were cited to the Tenth District; Graham and Marts were not (Appellant\u2019s Brief, State Court Record, ECF No. 45, PageID 33562 et seq.) Williford is not about the duty to avoid danger or prosecutorial misconduct, but about the failure of the trial court to instruct on self-defense and the duty to retreat. Thomas is also not about either prosecutorial misconduct or the duty to avoid danger. Erwin, from the late nineteenth century, is about jury instructions, not the duty to avoid danger, or prosecutorial misconduct. Citing some Ohio Supreme\nCourt cases having to do with various other aspects of the defense of self-defense does not establish that there is Supreme Court of Ohio precedent proving the Tenth District was wrong in its analysis of Petitioner\u2019s First Assignment of Error. Absent such proof, this Court is bound by the Tenth District\u2019s decision. *Bradshaw v. Richey*, 546 U.S. 74 (2005). Petitioner has therefore shown no clear or manifest error of law in this Court\u2019s reliance on the Tenth District\u2019s conclusion that the prosecutor did not misstate Ohio law.\n\nAt the end of his argument on Ground One (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6683), Petitioner acknowledges the standard for evaluating a claim of prosecutorial misconduct is set forth in *Darden v. Wainwright*, 477 U.S. 168, 181 (1986): On habeas review, \"the relevant question is whether the prosecutor's comments 'so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.'\" 477 U.S. at 181, quoting *Donnelly v. DeChristoforo*, 416 U.S. 637, 643 (1974). This is the standard the Tenth District applied, concluding at the first step of the analysis that the prosecutor did not misstate Ohio law. Petitioner has not shown this Court committed a clear error of law in deferring to that decision.\n\n**Ground Two: Failure to Give Curative Instructions**\n\nIn his Second Ground for Relief, Shine-Johnson claims he was denied a fair trial because the trial court failed to give a curative instruction on the prosecutor\u2019s claim in closing argument that Shine-Johnson had essentially admitted to murder, defined as Ohio law does as a \u201cpurposeful killing.\u201d The Tenth District found this claim procedurally defaulted for want of a contemporaneous objection and without merit, given the context in which the prosecutor used the word \u201cmurder,\u201d to wit, explaining self-defense and the meaning of \u201cpurposeful killing\u201d *Shine-\nAs with Ground One, the District Judge adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s conclusions that Ground Two was indeed procedurally defaulted and without merit (Opinion and Order, ECF No. 96, PageID 6632-33).\n\nPetitioner\u2019s Motion asserts there is no procedural default because he did not violate the contemporaneous objection rule (ECF No. 98, PageID 6684). Essentially he argues the Ohio rule is that an objection is \u201ccontemporaneous enough\u201d if the trial judge can still correct the error. *Id.* relying on *State v. Tudor*, 154 Ohio St. 249 (1950). There is no such holding in *Tudor*; it reinforces an attorney\u2019s duty to object, but does not say when is soon enough. Petitioner even claims \u201cThe rule is stated in unmistakable terms, both in Ohio Criminal Rule 30(A) and in countless decisions. See, e.g., *State v. Landrum*, 53 Ohio St. 3d 107 (1990).\u201d Criminal Rule 30 provides a party may not raise on appeal error in a jury instruction which was not called to the trial judge\u2019s attention before the jury retires. But the omitted objection which led to procedural default of Ground One was failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s claim in closing argument that Shine-Johnson had admitted to murder. Ground One is about prosecutorial misconduct, not trial court error. *Landrum* is not to the contrary; the phrase \u201ccontemporaneous objection\u201d does not even appear in that decision.\n\nAt this stage of the case, the question is not whether the Tenth District misconstrued Ohio law on contemporaneous objections. A habeas court is not authorized to correct perceived errors of state law. Rather our task in adjudicating procedural default defenses is to determine if the State has a relevant procedural rule, whether it was in fact enforced against the petitioner, and whether it is adequate and independent of federal law. *Maupin v. Smith*, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986). There is no doubt Ohio has a contemporaneous objection rule and it was enforced against Shine-Johnson. The Sixth Circuit has repeatedly upheld application of that rule, including in capital\ncases. *Wogenstahl v. Mitchell*, 668 F.3d 307, 334 (6th Cir. 2012), citing *Keith v. Mitchell*, 455 F.3d 662, 673 (6th Cir. 2006); *Goodwin v. Johnson*, 632 F.3d 301, 315 (6th Cir. 2011); *Smith v. Bradshaw*, 591 F.3d 517, 522 (6th Cir. 2010); *Nields v. Bradshaw*, 482 F.3d 442 (6th Cir. 2007); *Biros v. Bagley*, 422 F.3d 379, 387 (6th Cir. 2005); *Mason v. Mitchell*, 320 F.3d 604 (6th Cir. 2003), citing *Hinkle v. Randle*, 271 F.3d 239, 244 (6th Cir. 2001); *Scott v. Mitchell*, 209 F.3d 854 (6th Cir. 2000), citing *Engle v. Isaac*, 456 U.S. 107, 124-29 (1982). There was no clear error of law in finding Ground Two procedurally defaulted.\n\n**Ground Three: Failure to Give Requested Instructions**\n\nIn his Third Ground for Relief, Shine-Johnson claims he was deprived of a fair trial when the trial court refused to give certain requested jury instructions on the defense of self-defense. As noted in the Report, Shine-Johnson spent nearly fifty pages of his Traverse arguing this issue and advocating for a \u201cno duty to retreat\u201d instruction (Report, ECF No. 85, PageID 6352, citing Traverse, ECF No. 81, PageID 6197-6241). The Tenth District denied this claim because the record established without contradiction that Petitioner had already retreated from the home he shared with his father and shot his father from the yard of the house. *Id.* at PageID 6352-54, quoting *State v. Shine-Johnson I* at \u00b6\u00b6 27-33. The Opinion and Order notes that Petitioner\u2019s Objections to the Report repeated his argument on this issue from the Traverse, but never \u201ccites a Supreme Court of Ohio decision that there is no duty to retreat when the shooting takes place outside the residence\u201d (ECF No. 98, PageID 6633-34).\n\nPetitioner\u2019s Rule 59(e) Motion asserts:\n\nThe Trial Court nor the District Court have shown that the petitioner actually violated any state laws. The state used misconduct and adept trickery of the court to force the jury to believe that by law the\npetitioner had a duty to retreat again after his first retreat failed because he was not in the confines of his home, but outside while faced with a loaded shotgun.\n\n(ECF No. 98, PageID 6687). He again argues the \u201cno duty to retreat\u201d claim, but fails, as he had before the Tenth District, to cite any holding by the Supreme Court of Ohio that the no duty to retreat exception applies outside the home. He does cite *Beard v. United States*, 158 U.S. 550 (1895). Justice John Marshall Harlan tells us the case involved the killing of one \u201cwhite man\u201d by another \u201cwhite man\u201d in Indian country, but does not say how this affects the choice of applicable law. Instead Justice Harlan discusses common law authorities\\(^1\\) on self-defense and concludes that they erect no duty to retreat on one\u2019s own property:\n\n> Indeed, the tendency of the American mind seems to be very strongly against the enforcement of any rule which requires a person to flee when assailed, to avoid chastisement or even to save human life, and that tendency is well illustrated by the recent decisions of our courts, bearing on the general subject of the right of self-defence.\n\n158 U.S. at 561-62. Since the decision in *Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins*, 304 U.S. 64 (1938), federal courts have been much less likely to look to the common law in defining federal crimes and defenses. And in any event this is not a federal criminal case like *Beard*, but an Ohio criminal case in which the Ohio courts are authorized to say what Ohio law requires.\n\nPetitioner also claimed in this Ground for Relief that the trial court erred by not giving a limiting instruction regarding character evidence. The Report, adopted by Chief Judge Marbly, found the claim was without merit because it was not contrary to any United States Supreme Court precedent on character evidence (ECF No. 85, PageID 6358). Petitioner\u2019s Motion merely reargues this claim without citing any Supreme Court constitutional precedent to the contrary. The Sixth Circuit has held \u201cThere is no clearly established Supreme Court precedent which holds that a state\n\n\\(^1\\) East's Pleas of the Crown; Foster's Crown Cases: Bishop's New Criminal Law; 2 Wharton on Crim. Law, \u00a7 1019, 7th rev. ed. Phila. 1874.\nviolates due process by permitting propensity evidence in the form of other bad acts evidence.\u201d\n\n_Bugh v. Mitchell_, 329 F.3d 496, 512 (6th Cir. 2003), noting that the Supreme Court refused to reach the issue in _Estelle v. McGuire_. 502 U.S. 62 (1991).\n\n**Ground Four: Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel**\n\nThe Tenth District decided that none of the objections Petitioner alleges his trial counsel should have made would likely have been successful. The Report recommended dismissal of this claim because \u201cIt cannot be deficient performance in violation of the first prong of _Strickland v. Washington_ to fail to make an objection that was without merit. Neither _Strickland_ nor any of its progeny hold that a trial attorney performs deficiently when he or she fails to make a meritless objection.\u201d (ECF No. 85, PageID 6362). In the instant Motion, Shine-Johnson merely reargues his claims of prosecutorial misconduct (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6701-04). He offers nothing new to show this Court committed a clear error of law in deferring to the Tenth District.\n\n**Ground Five: Cumulative Trial Court Error**\n\nThe Report and the Opinion and Order found this claim non-cognizable. Petitioner does not move to amend the Court\u2019s decision on Ground Five.\n\n**Ground Six: Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel**\n\nIn his Sixth Ground for Relief, Shine-Johnson claims he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel when his appellate attorney failed to raise as an assignment of error his trial\ncounsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to dismiss because the State had destroyed exculpatory evidence. The Report found that Petitioner\u2019s late filing of his 26(B) Application to raise this claim was excused by the State\u2019s conduct in mailing it late and the claim was therefore not procedurally defaulted. However, the Report rejected this claim on the merits, concluding Petitioner\u2019s assertion of destruction of exculpatory evidence would have failed on direct appeal for lack of evidence in the record (ECF No. 85, PageID 6363-67). The Court accepted this conclusion (Opinion and Order, ECF No. 96, PageID 6636-38).\n\nPetitioner\u2019s Motion to Amend asserts \u201cThe petitioner has shown a genuine issue if trial counsel was ineffective for allowing the State to alter exculpatory and/or impeaching evidence of the 20-guage [sic] shotgun and introduce fraudulent false evidence of the operability testing report.\u201d (ECF No. 98, PageID 6705). Shine-Johnson continues by asserting a due process violation under Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264 (1959). He concludes \u201cThe Court seems to find it is ok present false and tainted evidence at trial and it does not violate due process.\u201d\n\nPetitioner\u2019s Motion assumes without proving the truth of the underlying claim that the shotgun, if it had not been disassembled, would have been exculpatory and that disassembling it was intended to destroy its exculpatory value and provide false information to be presented. None of this was proved; all of it is assumed.\n\nThe basis of the Court\u2019s decision on Ground Six is that there was no evidence in the record to prove any part of this Trombetta claim and therefore no basis for an appellate claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to raise the claim. Appellate counsel have to work with the record bequeathed to them. They cannot responsibly make claims not supported by the record. Petitioner has shown no clear error of law in the Court\u2019s dismissal of Ground Six on that basis.\nGround Seven: Mandatory Retroactive Application of a Change in the Burden of Proof on Self-Defense\n\nIn his Seventh Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts that a change in the statutory burden of proof for self-defense must be applied retroactively to his case. September 10, 2015, was the date of the offense and the defendant\u2019s date of conviction was February 24, 2017 (Entry, State Court Record ECF No. 45-1, PageID 4331). H.B. 228, which changed the burden of proof for self-defense, became effective March 28, 2019, and was not made expressly retroactive by the General Assembly. Id. As noted in the Report, under Ohio law, \u201cA statute is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless expressly made retrospective.\u201d (ECF No. 85, PageID 6368, citing Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 1.48).\n\nIn arguing for retroactivity, Shine-Johnson made no reference to legislative intent, but claimed due process required retroactive application, relying on Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348 (2004), and United States v. United States Coin & Currency, 401 U.S. 715 (1971). The Report rejected this claim, noting that the cited cases were about retroactive application of decisions of the Supreme Court itself, not any statute (ECF No. 96, PageID 6369).\n\nThe relevant statute, 2018 H.B. 288, is codified at Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.05(B)(1) and provides:\n\nA person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person\u2019s residence. If, at the trial of a person who is accused of an offense that involved the person\u2019s use of force against another, there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person\u2019s residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person\u2019s residence, as the case may be.\nH.B. 288 changes the law of self-defense in Ohio. Prior to its effective date of March 28, 2019, Ohio law provided:\n\n(A) Every person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, for an affirmative defense, is upon the accused.\n\nOhio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.05(A). This prior statute was before the United States Supreme Court in *Martin v. Ohio*, 480 U.S. 228 (1987), and its constitutionality of allocating both the burden of production and the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to defendant was held to be constitutional. This was the form of the statute on self-defense in force when Shine-Johnson was tried and convicted in 2015.\n\nH.B. 288 changes the law of self-defense in at least two ways. First of all a trial court could decide that evidence presented by the prosecutor in the case in chief was sufficient to support a finding that the accused acted in self-defense. Second, regardless of which side presents that \u201csufficient evidence,\u201d once it is in the record, the burden is on the State to disprove self-defense to the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nH.B. 288 is not a \u201cclarification\u201d or \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the old statute, as Petitioner would have it. New constructions, interpretations, or clarifications of existing statutes come from courts applying those statutes. Rather, in H.B. 288 the Ohio General Assembly enacted a distinct change in the law.\n\nIn his Motion to Amend, Petitioner asserts the Court made a clear error of law by not requiring Ohio to apply H.B. 288 retroactively. As noted above, the Court already found *Schriro* and *United States Coin and Currency* inapplicable because they did not deal with statutes.\nAgreeing that not every state statute must be applied retroactively, Shine-Johnson nonetheless argues:\n\nOn the other hand, where the statute pertains to an affirmative defense and the statute is construed to make the absence of the affirmative defense an element of proof of the crime itself; a DIFFERENT RESULT IS MANDATED. In such a case, the constitutional doctrine announced in *Mullaney v Wilbur*, 421 U.S. 684, 95 S. Ct. 1881. 44 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1975), and in *In re Winship*, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970), requiring the prosecution to prove every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, has application. *Berrier v. Eseler*, 583 F.2d 515 (\"6th Cir.\"). cert. denied, 439 U.S. 955. 99 S. Ct. 354. 58 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1978). and the Due Process Clause requires that the new interpretation be applied retroactively. *Hankerson v. North Carolina*, 432 U.S. 233. 97 S. Ct. 2339. 53 L. Ed. 2d 306 (1977).\n\n(Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6716).\n\nNone of the cited case law supports a constitutional requirement that H.B. 288 be applied retroactively to Petitioner\u2019s case. *Winship* establishes that, as a matter of due process, a State must prove every element of a criminal offense by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 397 U.S. at 364. *Mullaney* followed *Winship* and held that the absence of passion on sudden provocation was an element that the State needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. Both were followed by *Martin*, *supra*, where the Court held the allocation of burden of production and proof of self-defense in Ohio under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2901.05 as it stood when Shine-Johnson was tried was constitutional. None of these cases speaks to retroactivity of statues at all. Neither does *Berrier*, which involved interpretation of Michigan\u2019s, not Ohio\u2019s, self-defense doctrine. *Hankerson* also was about retroactive application of the Supreme Court decision in *Mullaney*.\n\nShine-Johnson criticizes the Court\u2019s reliance on \u201cold law\u201d as upheld in *Martin* and argues \u201cWhere the major purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth-finding function and so raises serious questions about the\naccuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule has been given complete retroactive effect.\u201d (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6717). But H.B. 288 is not \u201cnew constitutional doctrine,\u201d but a newly-enacted statute. And even with respect to new constitutional doctrine, the Supreme Court has held that new constitutional procedural rules will never be given retroactive effect. *Edwards v. Vannoy*, 593 U.S. ___, 141 S. Ct. 1547 (2021).\n\nShine-Johnson argues H.B. 288 is a substantive change in the law and now makes his conduct constitutionally immune from punishment (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6717). Not so. If H.B. 288 had been the law at the time of trial, the State would have been required to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. But that means it would have been required to persuade a jury, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that Shine-Johnson was not acting in self-defense. The new statute does not immunize the use of deadly force from punishment just because the killer claims to have been acting in self-defense. The jury could still reject that defense if the State proved what happened was not self-defense.\n\nAs noted in the Report, the fact that H.B. 288 requires the State to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt if the evidence sufficiently raises the question does not make \u201cabsence of self-defense\u201d an element of murder. Every element of a crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. *Winship*. But not everything the legislature requires to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt thereby becomes an element. Were it otherwise, the State would be required to disprove self-defense regardless of whether there was any evidence of it at all. Obviously there are many murders where the evidence raises no question of self-defense.\n\nPetitioner accuses the Court of misconstruing the record about when his conviction became final which he says did not happen until May 8, 2019 (Motion, ECF No. 98, PageID 6724). On that date the Supreme Court of Ohio declined jurisdiction over his direct appeal. Actually his\nconviction did not become final on direct appeal until ninety days later (August 6, 2019) when his time to seek certiorari from the United States Supreme Court expired. Therefore H.B. 288 did become effective before Petitioner\u2019s conviction became final on direct appeal. New constitutional decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States apply to cases still on direct review when the Supreme Court case is decided, but not to cases pending on collateral review. *Teague v. Lane*, 489 U.S. 288 (1989). But H.B. 288 is not a constitutional decision of the Supreme Court, but an enactment of the Ohio General Assembly.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nPetitioner has failed to show a clear error of law in the Court\u2019s disposition of his habeas corpus petition. Therefore the Motion to Amend should be denied.\n\nAugust 10, 2021.\n\ns/ Michael R. Merz\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\n**NOTICE REGARDING OBJECTIONS**\n\nPursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

STEWART, J.: \n{\u00b61} Deafred C. Hardman, a.k.a. Dealfred Hardman,  has file d a timely application for \nreopening pursuant to App.R. 26(B) .  Hardman is attempting to reopen the appellate judgment, \nrendered in State v. Hardman , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105810, 2018-Ohio-2062, that affirmed \nhis convictions for the offenses of compe lling prostitution (R.C. 2907.21(A)(2)(a)) and unlawful \nsexual conduct with a minor (2907.04(A)).  We d ecline to reopen Hardman\u2019s original appeal. \nI. Standard of Review Applicable to App.R. 26(B) Application for Reopening \n \n{\u00b62} In order to establish a claim of ineffec tive assistance of appe llate counsel, Hardman \nis required to establish that the performance of  his appellate counsel was deficient and the \ndeficiency resulted in prejudice.  Strickland v. Washington , 466 U.S. 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 \nL.Ed.2d 674 (1984);  State v. Bradley , 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), cert. denied, \n497 U.S. 1011, 110 S.Ct. 3258, 111 L.Ed.2d 767 (1990). {\u00b63} In Strickland, the United States Supreme Court he ld that a court\u2019s scrutiny of an \nattorney\u2019s work must be highly deferential.  The court further stated that it is all too tempting \nfor a defendant to second-guess his attorney after conviction and that it would be too easy for a \ncourt to conclude that a specific act or omission was deficient, especially when examining the \nmatter in hindsight.  Thus, a court must indulge in a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct \nfalls within the wide range of reasonable profe ssional assistance; that is, the defendant must \novercome the presumption that , under the circumstances, the challenged action might be \nconsidered sound trial strategy.  Strickland. \nII. State\u2019s Failure to Provide Discovery \n{\u00b64} Hardman has raised three proposed assignments of error in support of his application \nfor reopening. Hardman\u2019s first proposed assignment of error is that: \nThe state committed prosecutorial mis conduct by deliberately violating \nappellant\u2019s [rights under] 5th, 6th, and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution \nand admitting inadmissable hearsay evidence to the jury only to withdraw that \nevidence once inadmissable hearsay testimony had been elicited regarding the \nsame. \n \n{\u00b65} Hardman, through his initial assi gnment of error, argues that appellate counsel was \nineffective by not challenging the state\u2019s failure to provide his dental r ecords during discovery.  \nSpecifically, Hardman argues that the state was prohibited from in troducing his dental records at \nthe retrial because the prosecution had promised not to introduce any exhibits from the original \ntrial. \n{\u00b66} The Supreme Court of Ohio, in  O\u2019Nesti v. DeBartolo Realty Corp., 113 Ohio St.3d \n59, 2007-Ohio-1102, 862 N.E.3d 803, reaffirmed the app lication of the doctrine of res judicata \nand held that: The doctrine of res judicata encompasses the two related concepts of claim \npreclusion, also known as res judicata or estoppel by judgment, and issue \npreclusion, also known as collateral estoppel. Grava v. Parkman Twp. (1995), 73 \nOhio St.3d 379, 381, 1995-Ohio-331, 653 N.E.2d 226. Claim preclusion prevents \nsubsequent actions, by the same parties or their pr ivies, based upon any claim \narising out of a transaction that was the subject matter of a previous action. Fort \nFrye Teachers Assn., OEA/NEA v. State Emp. Relations Bd. (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d \n392, 395, 1998-Ohio-435, 692 N.E.2d 140. Where a claim could have been \nlitigated in the previous suit, claim preclusion also bars subsequent actions on that \nmatter. Grava, 73 Ohio St.3d at 382, 653 N.E.2d 226.  \n  \nIssue preclusion, on the other hand, serves to prevent relitigation of any fact or \npoint that was determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a previous action \nbetween the same parties or their privies. Fort Frye, 81 Ohio St.3d at 395, 692 \nN.E.2d 140. Issue preclusion applies even if the causes of action differ. Id. \n \nO\u2019Nesti, supra, at \u00b6 6. \n{\u00b67} Herein, Hardman has already attempted to litigate the claim that the state was \nprecluded from introducing any exhibits at the second trial that had been previously admitted into \nevidence during the course of the original trial. \nDuring the first trial, Hardman introduced his own dental records into evidence \nwithout objection from the state. During retr ial, a police detective testified that a \ntelephone number given in conjunction with the ad for the victim\u2019s escort services \nwas the same number appearing on Hardma n\u2019s dental records. Hardman claims \nthat the records were inadmissible because the state did not disclose those dental \nrecords to him in pretrial discovery and the state reneged on its representation to \nthe court that it would not introduce any exhibits from the first trial. \n \nThe state did not promise that it would not introduce any exhibits from the first \ntrial. As part of his motion in limine, Hardman asked that the state be precluded \nfrom introducing his testimony from the first trial because he would not be \ntestifying in the second trial. The state told the court that it \u201cdoes not have any \nintention of introducing any pa st testimony in its case in chief.\u201d  At no point did \nthe state agree not to introduce any exhibits that were admitted at the first trial. \nIndeed, an agreement to that effect would have doomed the state\u2019s case \u2014 it \nwould have prohibited the state from intr oducing the ad for escort services, a \ncrucial piece of evidence. \n \nHardman\u2019s claim that the state did not produce the dental records in discovery is \nequally without merit. The point of pretrial discovery is to prevent unfair surprise. \nState v. Howard , 56 Ohio St.2d 328, 333, 383 N.E.2d 912 (1978). Not only did the dental records belong to Hardman, he introduced them in the first trial. We are \nhard-pressed to understand how Hardman would have been surprised that the state \nused them in the second trial.   \n  \nHardman, supra, at \u00b6 18. \n{\u00b68} The doctrine of res judicata bars Hardman from once again raising the issue of the \nimproper admission into evidence of his dental records because the issue was previously \nadjudicated before this court on appeal.  Hardman has failed to estab lish any prejudice through \nhis first proposed assignment of error. \nIII. Failure of State to Authenticate Record \n{\u00b69} Hardman\u2019s second proposed assignment of error is that: \nThe trial court erred when it overruled appellant\u2019s motion in limine and objection \nto state exhibit (2) the Backpage advertisement as it violated Evid.R. 902, 403(A), \nR.C. 2921.12, R.C. 2945.82 and Evid.R. 1003. \n \n{\u00b610} Hardman, through his second proposed assign ment of error, st ates his appellate \ncounsel was ineffective on appeal  by failing to argue that a Backpage.com advertisement, \nintroduced by the state at trial as state\u2019s exhibit No. 2, was not properly authenticated.   \n{\u00b611} Evid.R. 901(A) deals with the authentication of evidence prior to admission at trial. \n The authenticity requirement is satisfied by \u201cevidence sufficient to s upport a finding that the \nmatter in question is what the proponent cla ims.\u201d  Evid.R. 901(A). Evid.R. 901(B) and 902 \nestablish methods by which a document may be au thenticated by extrinsic evidence or by which \nit may be self-authenticated so extrinsic evidence is not required because the document possesses \non its face indicia of authenticity which are suffici ent to support the finding that the document is \nwhat it purports to be. State v. Smith, 63 Ohio App.3d 71, 74, 577 N.E.2d 1152 (11th Dist.1989). \n Evid.R. 901 provides a liberal standard  for the authentication of evidence. State v. Pruitt , 8th \nDist. Cuyahoga No. 98080, 2012-Ohio-5418, \u00b6 11, citing State v. Teague , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90801, 2009-Ohio-129.  In addition, the decision to admit or exclude evidence rests within \nthe trial court\u2019s sound discretion. State v. McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 686 N.E.2d 1112 (1997). \nThus, a reviewing court will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision absent an abuse of discretion.    \n{\u00b612} This court has also stated that:  \nCircumstantial evidence, as well as direct, may be used to show authenticity. State \nv. Williams, supra, 64 Ohio App.2d 271, 274, 413 N.E.2d 1212 (8th Dist. 1979).  \nMoreover, the threshold standard for au thenticating evidence pursuant to Evid.R. \n901(A) is low, and \u201cdoes not require c onclusive proof of authenticity, but only \nsufficient foundational evidence for the trier of fact to conclude that * * * [the \nevidence] is what its proponent claims it to be. State v. Easter , 75 Ohio App.3d \n22, 25, 598 N.E.2d 845 (4th Dist. 1991).\u201d State v. Trice, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. \n89933, 2008-Ohio-2930, \u00b6 22. \n \nPruitt at \u00b6 11, quoting Teague at \u00b6 7. \n{\u00b613} Herein, Nathan Yockey authenticated state\u2019s exhibit No. 2 by direct testimony.  \nYockey testified that: 1) he is the custodian of records for Backpage.com (tr. 351); 2) he has been \nemployed by Backpage.com as the custodian of records for 6.5 years (tr. 351); 3) Backpage.com \nis an online classified advertisement website (t r. 351); 4) in order to place an advertisement on \nBackpage.com, an account must be created (tr. 352); 5) Backpage.com received a subpoena from \nthe Cuyahoga County Prosecutor in 2014 for record s relating to an adve rtisement posted under \nI.D. No. 17654164 (tr. 353);  \n6) records associated with I.D. No. 17654164 were provided to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor \n(tr. 353); 7) the records provided to the Cuyahog a County Prosecutor consisted of ten pages and \nincluded the advertisement placed  on Backpage.com, the title of the advertisement, the posted \ndate of the advertisement, an invoice, multiple images associated  with the advertisement, and \nadministrative data (tr. 353 - 355); 8) the adminis trative data includes the posting region for the \nadvertisement, the amount paid for the advertisem ent, the name of the person that ordered the advertisement, the email address associated with  the person that ordered the advertisement, and \nthe date the advertisement was created (tr. 356 - 357); and 9) the advertisement was posted in the \nescort section of Backpage.com in the Cleveland, Ohio area (tr. 316). \n{\u00b614} We find that the direct testimony of Nathan Yockey satisfied the requirement of \nauthentication for state\u2019s exhi bit No. 2 under Evid.R. 901(A).  State v. Inkton , 8th Dist. \nCuyahoga No. 102706, 2016-Ohio-693.  Hardman has fa iled to establish any prejudice through \nhis second proposed assignment of error. \nIV. Trial Court was Biased Toward Defendant \n{\u00b615} Hardman\u2019s third proposed assignment of error is that: \nWhether the trial judge committed structural error by being bias[ed] toward the \nappellant. \n \n{\u00b616} Hardman, through his third propos ed assignment of error, states that his appellate \ncounsel was ineffective on appeal by failing to ar gue that the trial court was biased during the \ncourse of trial resulting in prejudice.  This court, with regard to the issue of judicial bias, has \nstated that: \nDue process requires that a criminal defendant be tried before an impartial judge. \nState v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 34. If the \nrecord evidence indicates that the trial was infected by judicial bias, the remedy is \na new trial. State v. Dean, 127 Ohio St.3d 140, 2010 Ohio 5070, 937 N.E.2d 97, \u00b6 \n2. Judicial bias is defined as \u201ca hostile  feeling or spirit of ill will or undue \nfriendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the \nformation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge * * * .\u201d Id. at \u00b6 \n48, quoting Pratt v. Weygandt , 164 Ohio St. 463, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956), \nparagraph four of the syllabus. Judicial bias is \u201ccontradistinguished from an open \nstate of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.\u201d Id., quoting Pratt \nat paragraph four of the syllabus. \n \nState v. Hough, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 98480 and 98482, 2013-Ohio-1543, 990 N.E.2d 653, \u00b6 \n10. {\u00b617} Our review of the record fails to disclose that the trial court judge harbored any ill \nwill or hostility toward Hardman during the course of trial.  We find that the alleged comments \nmade by the trial court that referenced retrial following reversal by this court for a new trial, lack \nof recollection, and placing the burden upon the defendant to secure the attendance of a witness, \nall fail to establish bias toward Hardman.  In addition, we fail to find that the trial court uttered \n\u201cepithets, slurs, demeaning nicknames, [or] negative stereotyping\u201d against Hardman.  Lamar, \nsupra; State v. Jackson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104132, 2017- Ohio-2651.  Hardman has failed \nto establish that he was prejudiced through his third proposed assignment of error. \n{\u00b618} Accordingly, the application for reopening is denied. \n \n             \nMELODY J.

STEWART, J.:\n\n{\u00b61} Deafred C. Hardman, a.k.a. Dealfred Hardman, has filed a timely application for reopening pursuant to App.R. 26(B). Hardman is attempting to reopen the appellate judgment, rendered in State v. Hardman, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105810, 2018-Ohio-2062, that affirmed his convictions for the offenses of compelling prostitution (R.C. 2907.21(A)(2)(a)) and unlawful sexual conduct with a minor (2907.04(A)). We decline to reopen Hardman\u2019s original appeal.\n\nI. Standard of Review Applicable to App.R. 26(B) Application for Reopening\n\n{\u00b62} In order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, Hardman is required to establish that the performance of his appellate counsel was deficient and the deficiency resulted in prejudice. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1011, 110 S.Ct. 3258, 111 L.Ed.2d 767 (1990).\nIn *Strickland*, the United States Supreme Court held that a court\u2019s scrutiny of an attorney\u2019s work must be highly deferential. The court further stated that it is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess his attorney after conviction and that it would be too easy for a court to conclude that a specific act or omission was deficient, especially when examining the matter in hindsight. Thus, a court must indulge in a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. *Strickland*.\n\nII. State\u2019s Failure to Provide Discovery\n\nHardman has raised three proposed assignments of error in support of his application for reopening. Hardman\u2019s first proposed assignment of error is that:\n\nThe state committed prosecutorial misconduct by deliberately violating appellant\u2019s [rights under] 5th, 6th, and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution and admitting inadmissible hearsay evidence to the jury only to withdraw that evidence once inadmissible hearsay testimony had been elicited regarding the same.\n\nHardman, through his initial assignment of error, argues that appellate counsel was ineffective by not challenging the state\u2019s failure to provide his dental records during discovery. Specifically, Hardman argues that the state was prohibited from introducing his dental records at the retrial because the prosecution had promised not to introduce any exhibits from the original trial.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Ohio, in *O\u2019Nesti v. DeBartolo Realty Corp.*, 113 Ohio St.3d 59, 2007-Ohio-1102, 862 N.E.3d 803, reaffirmed the application of the doctrine of res judicata and held that:\nThe doctrine of res judicata encompasses the two related concepts of claim preclusion, also known as res judicata or estoppel by judgment, and issue preclusion, also known as collateral estoppel. *Grava v. Parkman Twp.* (1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 381, 1995-Ohio-331, 653 N.E.2d 226. Claim preclusion prevents subsequent actions, by the same parties or their privies, based upon any claim arising out of a transaction that was the subject matter of a previous action. *Fort Frye Teachers Assn., OEA/NEA v. State Emp. Relations Bd.* (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 392, 395, 1998-Ohio-435, 692 N.E.2d 140. Where a claim could have been litigated in the previous suit, claim preclusion also bars subsequent actions on that matter. *Grava*, 73 Ohio St.3d at 382, 653 N.E.2d 226.\n\nIssue preclusion, on the other hand, serves to prevent relitigation of any fact or point that was determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a previous action between the same parties or their privies. *Fort Frye*, 81 Ohio St.3d at 395, 692 N.E.2d 140. Issue preclusion applies even if the causes of action differ. *Id.*\n\n*O\u2019Nesti, supra*, at \u00b6 6.\n\nHerein, Hardman has already attempted to litigate the claim that the state was precluded from introducing any exhibits at the second trial that had been previously admitted into evidence during the course of the original trial.\n\nDuring the first trial, Hardman introduced his own dental records into evidence without objection from the state. During retrial, a police detective testified that a telephone number given in conjunction with the ad for the victim\u2019s escort services was the same number appearing on Hardman\u2019s dental records. Hardman claims that the records were inadmissible because the state did not disclose those dental records to him in pretrial discovery and the state reneged on its representation to the court that it would not introduce any exhibits from the first trial.\n\nThe state did not promise that it would not introduce any exhibits from the first trial. As part of his motion in limine, Hardman asked that the state be precluded from introducing his testimony from the first trial because he would not be testifying in the second trial. The state told the court that it \u201cdoes not have any intention of introducing any past testimony in its case in chief.\u201d At no point did the state agree not to introduce any exhibits that were admitted at the first trial. Indeed, an agreement to that effect would have doomed the state\u2019s case \u2014 it would have prohibited the state from introducing the ad for escort services, a crucial piece of evidence.\n\nHardman\u2019s claim that the state did not produce the dental records in discovery is equally without merit. The point of pretrial discovery is to prevent unfair surprise. *State v. Howard*, 56 Ohio St.2d 328, 333, 383 N.E.2d 912 (1978). Not only did\nthe dental records belong to Hardman, he introduced them in the first trial. We are hard-pressed to understand how Hardman would have been surprised that the state used them in the second trial.\n\n*Hardman, supra*, at \u00b6 18.\n\n{\u00b68} The doctrine of res judicata bars Hardman from once again raising the issue of the improper admission into evidence of his dental records because the issue was previously adjudicated before this court on appeal. Hardman has failed to establish any prejudice through his first proposed assignment of error.\n\n**III. Failure of State to Authenticate Record**\n\n{\u00b69} Hardman\u2019s second proposed assignment of error is that:\n\nThe trial court erred when it overruled appellant\u2019s motion in limine and objection to state exhibit (2) the Backpage advertisement as it violated Evid.R. 902, 403(A), R.C. 2921.12, R.C. 2945.82 and Evid.R. 1003.\n\n{\u00b610} Hardman, through his second proposed assignment of error, states his appellate counsel was ineffective on appeal by failing to argue that a Backpage.com advertisement, introduced by the state at trial as state\u2019s exhibit No. 2, was not properly authenticated.\n\n{\u00b611} Evid.R. 901(A) deals with the authentication of evidence prior to admission at trial. The authenticity requirement is satisfied by \u201cevidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims.\u201d Evid.R. 901(A). Evid.R. 901(B) and 902 establish methods by which a document may be authenticated by extrinsic evidence or by which it may be self-authenticated so extrinsic evidence is not required because the document possesses on its face indicia of authenticity which are sufficient to support the finding that the document is what it purports to be. *State v. Smith*, 63 Ohio App.3d 71, 74, 577 N.E.2d 1152 (11th Dist.1989).\n\nEvid.R. 901 provides a liberal standard for the authentication of evidence. *State v. Pruitt*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98080, 2012-Ohio-5418, \u00b6 11, citing *State v. Teague*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga\nIn addition, the decision to admit or exclude evidence rests within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion. *State v. McGuire*, 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 686 N.E.2d 1112 (1997). Thus, a reviewing court will not reverse the trial court\u2019s decision absent an abuse of discretion.\n\nThis court has also stated that:\n\nCircumstantial evidence, as well as direct, may be used to show authenticity. *State v.

No. 17654164 (tr. 353); 6) records associated with I.D. No. 17654164 were provided to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor (tr. 353); 7) the records provided to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor consisted of ten pages and included the advertisement placed on Backpage.com, the title of the advertisement, the posted date of the advertisement, an invoice, multiple images associated with the advertisement, and administrative data (tr. 353 - 355); 8) the administrative data includes the posting region for the advertisement, the amount paid for the advertisement, the name of the person that ordered the\nadvertisement, the email address associated with the person that ordered the advertisement, and the date the advertisement was created (tr. 356 - 357); and 9) the advertisement was posted in the escort section of Backpage.com in the Cleveland, Ohio area (tr. 316).\n\n\u00b614 We find that the direct testimony of Nathan Yockey satisfied the requirement of authentication for state\u2019s exhibit No. 2 under Evid.R. 901(A).

This court, with regard to the issue of judicial bias, has stated that:\n\nDue process requires that a criminal defendant be tried before an impartial judge. State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 34. If the record evidence indicates that the trial was infected by judicial bias, the remedy is a new trial. State v.

We find that the alleged comments made by the trial court that referenced retrial following reversal by this court for a new trial, lack of recollection, and placing the burden upon the defendant to secure the attendance of a witness, all fail to establish bias toward Hardman. In addition, we fail to find that the trial court uttered \u201cepithets, slurs, demeaning nicknames, [or] negative stereotyping\u201d against Hardman. Lamar, supra; State v. Jackson, 8th Dist.

O\u2019Malley, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor, and \nKatherine Mullin, Assistant County Prosecutor, for \nappellee.   \n \nAllison S. Breneman, for appellant.   \n \n \nFRANK D. CELEBREZZE, JR., P.J.: \n \n Defendant-appellant, George Cole (\u201cappellant\u201d), brings the instant \nappeal challenging the trial court\u2019s judgment denying his petition for postconviction \nrelief.  Specifically, appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that \nappellant failed to attach supporting affidavits to his petition, the trial court erred in  \nfinding that appellant failed to present sufficient evidence demonstrating \nsubstantive grounds for relief, and that the trial court erred and abused its discretion \nin denying appellant\u2019s petition without holding a hearing.  After a thorough review \nof the record and law, this court reverses and remands for further proceedings \nconsistent with this opinion.   \nI.  Factual and Procedural History \n The instant appeal pertains to a string of six burglaries that occurred \nbetween July 2014 and August 2014 in Cleveland, Fairview Park, and Rocky River, \nOhio.  Appellant was charged in three separate criminal cases for his involvement in \nthe burglaries: Cuyahoga C.P. Nos. CR-14-590944-B, CR-14-588878-B, and CR-14-\n589681-A.   \n Appellant\u2019s girlfriend, Danielle Panagopoulos (\u201cDanielle\u201d), and his \nbrother, John Cole (\u201cJohn\u201d), were also charged in the three criminal cases as \ncodefendants.  Danielle and John entered guilty pleas.   \n Unlike his codefendants, appellant defended against the charges.  A \njury trial on all three criminal cases commenced on June 8, 2015.  Danielle testified \non behalf of the state.   \n At the close of trial, the jury found appellant guilty on all counts.  On \nJune 15, 2015, the trial court imposed an aggregate prison sentence of 48 years.  \n On June 25, 2015, appellant filed a direct appeal challenging his \nconvictions and the trial court\u2019s sentence.  State v. Cole, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos.  \n103187, 103188, 103189, and 103190, 2016-Ohio-2936.1  On May 12, 2016, this court \nmodified appellant\u2019s burglary convictions on Counts 26 and 29 in CR-14-590944-B \nfrom second-degree felonies to third-degree felonies and remanded the case for \nresentencing on these modified convicti ons.  This court otherwise affirmed \nappellant\u2019s convictions and the trial court\u2019s sentence.  Finally, this court ordered the \ntrial court to issue a nunc pro tunc sentencing entry incorporating its consecutive-\nsentence findings.  \n While his appeal was pending, appellant filed a petition for \npostconviction relief on April 7, 2016.  In his petition for postconviction relief, \ncaptioned \u201cpetition to vacate or set aside judgment of conviction or sentence,\u201d \na p p e l l a n t  a s s e r t e d  t h a t  h e  w a s  e n t i t l e d  t o  r e l i e f  u n d e r  R .

Subsequently, on February 20, 2018, the trial court \nissued findings of fact and conclusions of law pertaining to appellant\u2019s petition for \npostconviction relief.2   \n                                                \n1 See appellant\u2019s direct appeal for a full recitation of the factual history and the \nevidence adduced at trial.   \n2 The trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law after appellant \nsought a writ of mandamus based, in part, on the trial court\u2019s failure to issue findings of \nfact and conclusions of law in denying the petition for postconviction relief.  State ex rel. \nCole v. Shirley Strickland Saffold, Judge , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106443, 2018-Ohio-\n1625.    \n On March 13, 2018, appellant, acting  pro se, filed the instant appeal \nchallenging the trial court\u2019s February 20, 2018 judgment.  Appellant assigns three \nerrors for review: \nI. The [a]ppellant was denied due process protection pursuant to the \nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution right to a fair hearing \nwhere the trial court abused its discretion and intentionally \nlied/falsified records when it ruled that [a]ppellant did not \nsubmit/attach the sworn affidavits of [Danielle] and [John] to the \npostconviction petition. \nII. The trial court committed prejudicial error in its judgment, when \nthe trial court ruled that [a]ppellant\u2019s petition failed to contain \nsufficient evidence to support his request for an evidentiary hearing.   \nIII. The trial court erred by denying [a]ppellant\u2019s motion for post-\nconviction relief without an evidentiary hearing.   \nII.  Law and Analysis \n  Appellant\u2019s three assignments of error pertain to the trial court\u2019s \njudgment denying his petition for postconviction relief.  \nA. Standard of Review \n This court reviews a trial court\u2019s ruling on a petition for postconviction \nrelief for an abuse of discretion.  State v. White , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90544, \n2008-Ohio-4228, \u00b6 19, citing State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 714 N.E.2d \n905 (1999).  A trial court abuses its discre tion when its decision is unreasonable, \narbitrary, or unconscionable.  State ex rel. Shisler v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement \nSys., 122 Ohio St.3d 148, 2009-Ohio-2522, 909 N.E.2d 610, \u00b6 11. \nUnder R.C. 2953.21, a prisoner may obtain postconviction relief \u201conly \nif the court can find that there was such a denial or infringement of the \nrights of the prisoner as to render the judgment void or voidable under \nthe Ohio Constitution or the United States Constitution.\u201d  State v.  \nPerry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph four of the \nsyllabus.  A postconviction petition does not provide a petitioner a \nsecond opportunity to litigate his or her conviction.  State v. Steffen, 70 \nOhio St.3d 399, 410, 639 N.E.2d 67 (1994); State v. Smith, 8th Dist. \nCuyahoga No. 93534, 2010-Ohio-1869, \u00b6 11.  Rather, it is a means to \nreach constitutional issues that would otherwise be impossible to reach \nbecause the evidence supporting those issues is not contained in the \nrecord.  Id. at \u00b6 12. \nState v. Obermiller, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101456, 2019-Ohio-1234, \u00b6 7-8.   \nB. Supporting Affidavits \n In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court \nerred in finding that appellant failed to attach supporting affidavits to his petition.  \nSpecifically, appellant asserts that the trial court \u201cabused [its] discretion and \nintentionally lied/falsified records when it ruled that [a]ppellant did not \nsubmit/attach the sworn [affidavits] of [Danielle] and [John] to the postconviction \npetition[.]\u201d  Appellant\u2019s brief at 3.  \n As an initial matter, we categorically and unequivocally reject \nappellant\u2019s argument that the trial court \u201clied/falsified records\u201d in finding that \nappellant failed to present supporting evidentiary documents \u2014 the affidavits of \nDanielle, John, and appellant \u2014 in support of the petition for postconviction relief.  \nThis assertion is entirely unsupported by the record.  The petition for postconviction \nrelief that appellant filed on April 7, 2016, did not contain any supporting \nattachments, exhibits, or affidavits.   \n The record reflects, however, that these affidavits were, in fact, \nattached to the motion for appointment of counsel that appellant filed on the same  \nday, April 7, 2016.  In his motion for appointment of counsel, appellant requested \n\u201can order appointing counsel to represent [a]ppellant on the accompanying \n[p]etition for [p]ostconviction [r]elief.\u201d The state acknowledges that appellant did, \nin fact, attach the affidavits of Danielle and John to his motion for appointment of \ncounsel, filed on the same day as the petition for postconviction relief.3   \n Danielle\u2019s affidavit, executed on August 28, 2015, averred, in relevant \npart,  \nI testified in [George Cole\u2019s] trial and what I said was untrue.  I was \ncoached into saying false statements by the prosecutors [and] \ndetectives and was promised that if I said what they coached me to say \nI was promised to get a deal for my part in the case.  George Cole never \ntold me anything pertaining this case he never told me any information.  \nWhat I said in court that was all false statements against George Cole.   \n John\u2019s affidavit, executed on February 25, 2016, averred, in relevant \npart, \u201cI was willing to give my testimony in said case * * * George had no knowledge \nand wasn[\u2019]t present for these burglar[ies] I would call or text Danielle\u2019s phone * * * \nto set up times and dates[.]  I can go into further details in my testimony.  I told \n[G]eorge\u2019s attorney * * * that I would testif[y] to what happened.  But I was never \ncalled to court.\u201d   \n Finally, appellant\u2019s affidavit, executed on February 25, 2016, averred, \ni n  r e l e v a n t  p a r t ,  \u201c I  t o l d  m y  [ a t t o r n e y ]  t h a t  I  w a n t e d  m y  b r o t h e r  J o h n  C o l e  a s  a  \n                                                \n3  We note that appellant did not have a right to counsel for purposes of filing his \npetition for postconviction relief, nor was he entitled to have counsel appointed for any \npostconviction proceedings, which are civil in nature.  See State v. Carter , 8th Dist. \nCuyahoga No. 106690, 2018-Ohio-4115, \u00b6 16; State ex rel. Jenkins v. Stern, 33 Ohio St.3d \n108, 110, 515 N.E.2d 928 (1987).  \nwitness in my trial.  I don[\u2019]t know why counsel failed to call any of my witnesses to \nmy defense.  I provided [counsel] with names and info of my [witnesses] that was \nwilling to testif[y] on my behalf[.]\u201d   \n We further note that appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief and \nmotion for appointment of counsel were filed pro se.  It is well-established that pro \nse litigants must follow the same procedures as litigants that are represented by \ncounsel.  See State ex rel. Gessner v. Vore, 123 Ohio St.3d 96, 2009-Ohio-4150, 914 \nN.E.2d 376, \u00b6 5.  \u201c\u2018It is well established that pro se litigants are presumed to have \nknowledge of the law and legal procedures and that they are held to the same \nstandard as litigants who are represented by counsel.\u2019\u201d  (Emphasis deleted.)  State \nex rel. Fuller v. Mengel, 100 Ohio St.3d 352, 2003-Ohio-6448, 800 N.E.2d 25, \u00b6 10, \nquoting Sabouri v. Ohio Dept. of Job & Family Servs. , 145 Ohio App.3d 651, 654, \n763 N.E.2d 1238 (10th Dist.2001).   \n In the instant matter, the record reflects that appellant attached the \nsupporting affidavits to the wrong filing.  Appellant should have attached the \nsupporting affidavits to his petition for postconviction relief, rather than his motion \nfor appointment of counsel.  As noted above, appellant did not have a right to \ncounsel for purposes of postconviction relief proceedings.  Furthermore, R.C. \n2953.21(A)(1)(a), governing petitions for postconviction relief, provides, in relevant \npart, \u201c[t]he petitioner may file a supporting affidavit and other documentary \nevidence in support of the claim for relief.\u201d    \n Although appellant\u2019s failure to follow the proper procedure would \nordinarily not be excused based on the fact that appellant filed his petition and \nmotion for appointment of counsel pro se, after reviewing the record in this case, we \nfind that the trial court erred by denying appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief \nwithout considering the supporting affidavits that appellant submitted with the \nwrong filing. \n First, appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief and motion for \nappointment of counsel were filed on the same day, April 7, 2016.  Furthermore, the \nmotion for appointment of counsel to which the supporting affidavits were attached \nspecifically referenced the \u201caccompanying [p]etition for [p]ostconviction [r]elief.\u201d  \n Second, the record reflects that the trial court denied appellant\u2019s \npetition primarily on the basis that appellant did not support his petition with \ndocumentary evidence \u2014 particularly the affidavits of Danielle and John or an \naffidavit of his own \u2014 demonstrating that he is entitled to relief.  See conclusions of \nlaw 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.  The record further reflects that this is not a case in which the \ntrial court considered the affidavits and determined that they were unreliable or not \ncredible.  See State v. Lewis , 4th Dist. Ross No. 10CA3181, 2011-Ohio-5224, \u00b6 21 \n(although the trial court could have found that the supporting affidavit lacked \ncredibility for \u201cany number of reasons,\u201d the trial court discounted a supporting \naffidavit for an incorrect reason, and abused its discretion by not considering the \nevidence).      \n The trial court summarily denied appellant\u2019s petition for \npostconviction relief and motion for appointment of counsel on April 15, 2016.  The \ntrial court\u2019s judgment entry does not reference the affidavits of Danielle, John, or \nappellant, which appellant attached to his motion for appointment of counsel.  \nAlthough the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law reference \nappellant\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, they do not reference the affidavits \nthat had been attached thereto.  See findings of fact 8, 11.   \n Finally, the trial court does not reference the fact that appellant \nattached the supporting affidavits to the wrong filing.  There is no indication in the \nrecord before this court that the trial court received, reviewed, or was aware that \nappellant had, in fact, submitted the supporting affidavits \u2014 albeit to the wrong \nfiling. \n For all of the foregoing reasons, we find that the trial court erred in \ndenying appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief without considering the \nsupporting affidavits that appellant attached to the accompanying motion for \nappointment of counsel.  We emphasize that our decision is not based on the merits \nof appellant\u2019s petition, his claims of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective \nassistance of counsel, or the assertions of Danielle, John, and appellant in the \nsupporting affidavits.   \n Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.  In light of our \nresolution of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, appellant\u2019s second and third \nassignments of error are moot.    \n The trial court\u2019s judgment denying appellant\u2019s petition for \npostconviction relief is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for \nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.  On remand, the trial court shall \ndetermine whether appellant is entitled to postconviction relief based on the \narguments raised in his petition and the supporting affidavits of Danielle, John, and \nappellant.   \n Judgment is reversed and remanded. \nIt is ordered that appellant recover from appellee costs herein taxed. \nThe court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal. \nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue of this court directing the common \npleas court to carry this judgment into execution.  \nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 \nof the Rules of Appellate Procedure. \n \n          \nFRANK D.

Specifically, appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that appellant failed to attach supporting affidavits to his petition, the trial court erred in\nfinding that appellant failed to present sufficient evidence demonstrating substantive grounds for relief, and that the trial court erred and abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s petition without holding a hearing. After a thorough review of the record and law, this court reverses and remands for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nI. Factual and Procedural History\n\n\u00b6 2 The instant appeal pertains to a string of six burglaries that occurred between July 2014 and August 2014 in Cleveland, Fairview Park, and Rocky River, Ohio. Appellant was charged in three separate criminal cases for his involvement in the burglaries: Cuyahoga C.P. Nos. CR-14-590944-B, CR-14-588878-B, and CR-14-589681-A.\n\n\u00b6 3 Appellant\u2019s girlfriend, Danielle Panagopoulos (\u201cDanielle\u201d), and his brother, John Cole (\u201cJohn\u201d), were also charged in the three criminal cases as codefendants. Danielle and John entered guilty pleas.\n\n\u00b6 4 Unlike his codefendants, appellant defended against the charges. A jury trial on all three criminal cases commenced on June 8, 2015. Danielle testified on behalf of the state.\n\n\u00b6 5 At the close of trial, the jury found appellant guilty on all counts. On June 15, 2015, the trial court imposed an aggregate prison sentence of 48 years.\n\n\u00b6 6 On June 25, 2015, appellant filed a direct appeal challenging his convictions and the trial court\u2019s sentence. State v. Cole, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos.\n103187, 103188, 103189, and 103190, 2016-Ohio-2936. On May 12, 2016, this court modified appellant\u2019s burglary convictions on Counts 26 and 29 in CR-14-590944-B from second-degree felonies to third-degree felonies and remanded the case for resentencing on these modified convictions. This court otherwise affirmed appellant\u2019s convictions and the trial court\u2019s sentence. Finally, this court ordered the trial court to issue a nunc pro tunc sentencing entry incorporating its consecutive-sentence findings.\n\nWhile his appeal was pending, appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief on April 7, 2016. In his petition for postconviction relief, captioned \u201cpetition to vacate or set aside judgment of conviction or sentence,\u201d appellant asserted that he was entitled to relief under R.C. 2953.21 based on (1) prosecutorial misconduct and (2) ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nThe trial court summarily denied appellant\u2019s petition on April 15, 2016, without holding a hearing. Subsequently, on February 20, 2018, the trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law pertaining to appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.2\n\n---\n\n1 See appellant\u2019s direct appeal for a full recitation of the factual history and the evidence adduced at trial.\n\n2 The trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law after appellant sought a writ of mandamus based, in part, on the trial court\u2019s failure to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law in denying the petition for postconviction relief. State ex rel. Cole v. Shirley Strickland Saffold, Judge, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106443, 2018-Ohio-1625.\nOn March 13, 2018, appellant, acting pro se, filed the instant appeal challenging the trial court's February 20, 2018 judgment. Appellant assigns three errors for review:\n\nI. The appellant was denied due process protection pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution right to a fair hearing where the trial court abused its discretion and intentionally lied/falsified records when it ruled that appellant did not submit/attach the sworn affidavits of [Danielle] and [John] to the postconviction petition.\n\nII. The trial court committed prejudicial error in its judgment, when the trial court ruled that appellant\u2019s petition failed to contain sufficient evidence to support his request for an evidentiary hearing.\n\nIII. The trial court erred by denying appellant\u2019s motion for post-conviction relief without an evidentiary hearing.\n\nII. Law and Analysis\n\nAppellant\u2019s three assignments of error pertain to the trial court\u2019s judgment denying his petition for postconviction relief.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\nThis court reviews a trial court\u2019s ruling on a petition for postconviction relief for an abuse of discretion. State v. White, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90544, 2008-Ohio-4228, \u00b6 19, citing State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999). A trial court abuses its discretion when its decision is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. State ex rel. Shisler v. Ohio Pub. Emps. Retirement Sys., 122 Ohio St.3d 148, 2009-Ohio-2522, 909 N.E.2d 610, \u00b6 11.\n\nUnder R.C. 2953.21, a prisoner may obtain postconviction relief \u201conly if the court can find that there was such a denial or infringement of the rights of the prisoner as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the United States Constitution.\u201d State v.\nPerry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph four of the syllabus. A postconviction petition does not provide a petitioner a second opportunity to litigate his or her conviction. State v. Steffen, 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410, 639 N.E.2d 67 (1994); State v. Smith, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 93534, 2010-Ohio-1869, \u00b6 11. Rather, it is a means to reach constitutional issues that would otherwise be impossible to reach because the evidence supporting those issues is not contained in the record. Id. at \u00b6 12.\n\nState v. Obermiller, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101456, 2019-Ohio-1234, \u00b6 7-8.\n\nB. Supporting Affidavits\n\n\u00b6 12 In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that appellant failed to attach supporting affidavits to his petition. Specifically, appellant asserts that the trial court \u201cabused [its] discretion and intentionally lied/falsified records when it ruled that [a]ppellant did not submit/attach the sworn [affidavits] of [Danielle] and [John] to the postconviction petition[.]\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 3.\n\n\u00b6 13 As an initial matter, we categorically and unequivocally reject appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court \u201clied/falsified records\u201d in finding that appellant failed to present supporting evidentiary documents \u2014 the affidavits of Danielle, John, and appellant \u2014 in support of the petition for postconviction relief. This assertion is entirely unsupported by the record. The petition for postconviction relief that appellant filed on April 7, 2016, did not contain any supporting attachments, exhibits, or affidavits.\n\n\u00b6 14 The record reflects, however, that these affidavits were, in fact, attached to the motion for appointment of counsel that appellant filed on the same\nday, April 7, 2016. In his motion for appointment of counsel, appellant requested \u201can order appointing counsel to represent [a]ppellant on the accompanying [p]etition for [p]ostconviction [r]elief.\u201d The state acknowledges that appellant did, in fact, attach the affidavits of Danielle and John to his motion for appointment of counsel, filed on the same day as the petition for postconviction relief.3\n\nDanielle\u2019s affidavit, executed on August 28, 2015, averred, in relevant part,\n\nI testified in [George Cole\u2019s] trial and what I said was untrue. I was coached into saying false statements by the prosecutors [and] detectives and was promised that if I said what they coached me to say I was promised to get a deal for my part in the case. George Cole never told me anything pertaining this case he never told me any information. What I said in court that was all false statements against George Cole.\n\nJohn\u2019s affidavit, executed on February 25, 2016, averred, in relevant part, \u201cI was willing to give my testimony in said case *** George had no knowledge and wasn\u2019t present for these burglar[ies] I would call or text Danielle\u2019s phone *** to set up times and dates[.] I can go into further details in my testimony. I told [G]eorge\u2019s attorney * * * that I would testify to what happened. But I was never called to court.\u201d\n\nFinally, appellant\u2019s affidavit, executed on February 25, 2016, averred, in relevant part, \u201cI told my [attorney] that I wanted my brother John Cole as a\n\n3 We note that appellant did not have a right to counsel for purposes of filing his petition for postconviction relief, nor was he entitled to have counsel appointed for any postconviction proceedings, which are civil in nature. See State v. Carter, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106690, 2018-Ohio-4115, \u00b6 16; State ex rel. Jenkins v. Stern, 33 Ohio St.3d 108, 110, 515 N.E.2d 928 (1987).\nwitness in my trial. I don\u2019t know why counsel failed to call any of my witnesses to my defense. I provided [counsel] with names and info of my [witnesses] that was willing to testif[y] on my behalf[.]\n\n\u00b6 18 We further note that appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief and motion for appointment of counsel were filed pro se. It is well-established that pro se litigants must follow the same procedures as litigants that are represented by counsel. See State ex rel. Gessner v. Vore, 123 Ohio St.3d 96, 2009-Ohio-4150, 914 N.E.2d 376, \u00b6 5. \u201cIt is well established that pro se litigants are presumed to have knowledge of the law and legal procedures and that they are held to the same standard as litigants who are represented by counsel.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) State ex rel. Fuller v. Mengel, 100 Ohio St.3d 352, 2003-Ohio-6448, 800 N.E.2d 25, \u00b6 10, quoting Sabouri v. Ohio Dept. of Job & Family Servs., 145 Ohio App.3d 651, 654, 763 N.E.2d 1238 (10th Dist.2001).\n\n\u00b6 19 In the instant matter, the record reflects that appellant attached the supporting affidavits to the wrong filing. Appellant should have attached the supporting affidavits to his petition for postconviction relief, rather than his motion for appointment of counsel. As noted above, appellant did not have a right to counsel for purposes of postconviction relief proceedings. Furthermore, R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a), governing petitions for postconviction relief, provides, in relevant part, \u201c[t]he petitioner may file a supporting affidavit and other documentary evidence in support of the claim for relief.\u201d\nAlthough appellant\u2019s failure to follow the proper procedure would ordinarily not be excused based on the fact that appellant filed his petition and motion for appointment of counsel pro se, after reviewing the record in this case, we find that the trial court erred by denying appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief without considering the supporting affidavits that appellant submitted with the wrong filing.\n\nFirst, appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief and motion for appointment of counsel were filed on the same day, April 7, 2016. Furthermore, the motion for appointment of counsel to which the supporting affidavits were attached specifically referenced the \u201caccompanying [p]etition for [p]ostconviction [r]elief.\u201d\n\nSecond, the record reflects that the trial court denied appellant\u2019s petition primarily on the basis that appellant did not support his petition with documentary evidence \u2014 particularly the affidavits of Danielle and John or an affidavit of his own \u2014 demonstrating that he is entitled to relief. See conclusions of law 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The record further reflects that this is not a case in which the trial court considered the affidavits and determined that they were unreliable or not credible. See State v. Lewis, 4th Dist. Ross No. 10CA3181, 2011-Ohio-5224, \u00b6 21 (although the trial court could have found that the supporting affidavit lacked credibility for \u201cany number of reasons,\u201d the trial court discounted a supporting affidavit for an incorrect reason, and abused its discretion by not considering the evidence).\nThe trial court summarily denied appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief and motion for appointment of counsel on April 15, 2016. The trial court\u2019s judgment entry does not reference the affidavits of Danielle, John, or appellant, which appellant attached to his motion for appointment of counsel. Although the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law reference appellant\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel, they do not reference the affidavits that had been attached thereto. See findings of fact 8, 11.\n\nFinally, the trial court does not reference the fact that appellant attached the supporting affidavits to the wrong filing. There is no indication in the record before this court that the trial court received, reviewed, or was aware that appellant had, in fact, submitted the supporting affidavits \u2014 albeit to the wrong filing.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, we find that the trial court erred in denying appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief without considering the supporting affidavits that appellant attached to the accompanying motion for appointment of counsel. We emphasize that our decision is not based on the merits of appellant\u2019s petition, his claims of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel, or the assertions of Danielle, John, and appellant in the supporting affidavits.\n\nAppellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained. In light of our resolution of appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, appellant\u2019s second and third assignments of error are moot.\nThe trial court\u2019s judgment denying appellant\u2019s petition for postconviction relief is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the trial court shall determine whether appellant is entitled to postconviction relief based on the arguments raised in his petition and the supporting affidavits of Danielle, John, and appellant.\n\nJudgment is reversed and remanded.\n\nIt is ordered that appellant recover from appellee costs herein taxed.\n\nThe court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue of this court directing the common pleas court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\nFRANK D.

INSTITUTION \n164 East Jackson Street 2500 South Avon-Belden Road \nMillersburg, Ohio  44654 Grafton, Ohio  44044 \n Holmes County, Case No. 17 CA 22 2\nWise, P. J. \n \n{\u00b61} Defendant-Appellant Timothy D. Steiner appeals from the decision of the \nCourt of Common Pleas, Holmes County, denying his motion to correct his 2015 sentence \nfor attempted rape and several counts of importuning. Appellee is the State of Ohio. The \nrelevant facts leading to this appeal are as follows. \n{\u00b62} In the spring of 2015, appellant began using social media to inappropriately \ncommunicate with a nine-year-old girl. The child's mother discovered the messages and \ncontacted the Holmes County Sheriff's Office. An officer with the Wooster Police \nDepartment trained in handling internet crime cases thereupon assumed the child's online \nrole for purposes of an investigation. At some point, appellant attempted to set up a \nmeeting at the child\u2019s home. The Holmes County Sheriff's Office utilized a vacant house \nas a mock residence and placed surveillance teams nearby to record appellant\u2019s actions. \nOn or about May 22, 2015, after appellant approached the house and attempted to open \na pre-arranged window, he was placed under arrest. \n{\u00b63} On June 29, 2015, the Holmes County Grand Jury indicted appellant on one \ncount of attempted rape, four counts of importuning, and one count of burglary.  \n{\u00b64} Appellant thereafter chose to attempt a plea deal, and he signed a guilty \nplea form. Prior to the plea, the prosecuting attorney amended Count 1 of the indictment \n(attempted rape) to a felony of the first degree. Based on plea negotiations, appellant \nentered a plea of guilty to Counts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Count 6 (burglary) was dismissed by \nthe State. On September 22, 2015, the trial court sentenced appellant to nine years in \nprison on Count 1 and twenty-four months on each of the importuning counts to be served \nconsecutively, for a total of seventeen years in prison. Holmes County, Case No.  17 CA 22 3\n{\u00b65} Appellant subsequently appealed his conviction and sentence to this Court, \nraising one assigned error on the issue of consecutive sentences. We overruled \nappellant's sole assignment of error and affirmed via an opinion issued on June 27, 2016. \nSee State v. Steiner, 5th Dist. Holmes No. 15CA17, 2016\u2013Ohio\u20134648. Appellant pursued \nan appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. However, on December 28, 2016, the Ohio \nSupreme Court declined jurisdiction. See State v. Steiner , 147 Ohio St.3d 1475, 65 \nN.E.3d 778 (Table), 2016-Ohio-8438. \n{\u00b66} On September 21, 2016, appellant filed a pro se \u201cpetition to vacate or set \naside judgment of conviction or sentence,\u201d citing R.C. 2953.21. Appellant therein claimed \nineffective assistance of trial counsel, a Miranda violation, prosecutorial misconduct, and \nillegal sentencing. The State of Ohio filed a memorandum in opposition and motion to \ndismiss the petition on October 19, 2016, arguing inter alia that appellant's claims were \nbarred by res judicata. The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss on October \n25, 2016. \n{\u00b67} Appellant appealed said decision to this Court, arguing in his sole assigned \nerror that the trial court had erred in granting the State\u2019s motion to dismiss his petition \nwithout making findings of fact and conclusions of law. On May 22, 2017, we affirmed, \nnoting in particular that during the pendency of that appeal, the State had requested and \nobtained a limited remand so that the trial court could prepare findings of fact and \nconclusions of law to support its dismissal. See State v. Steiner , 5th Dist. Holmes No. \n16CA012, 2017-Ohio-2947. \n{\u00b68} In the meantime, on January 27, 2017, appellant filed a pro se motion to \nwithdraw guilty plea under Crim.R. 32.1. The State filed a memorandum in opposition on Holmes County, Case No.  17 CA 22 4\nFebruary 7, 2017. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion on July 12, 2017. The record \ndoes not indicate an appeal therefrom. \n{\u00b69} On September 27, 2017, appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion to correct sentence \npursuant to section 2929.14(B)(3).\u201d The State filed a memorandum in opposition on \nOctober 30, 2017. The trial court issued a judgment entry denying appellant\u2019s motion to \ncorrect sentence on October 31, 2017. \n{\u00b610} Appellant filed a pro se notice of appeal on November 17, 2017. He herein \nraises the following sole Assignment of Error: \n{\u00b611} \u201cI.  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW, WHEN IT \nDENIED STEINER\u2019S MOTION TO CORRECT SENTENCE PURSUANT TO R.C. \n2929.14(B)(3).\u201d \nI. \n{\u00b612} In his sole Assignment of Error, appellant contends the trial court erred in \ndenying his post-conviction \u201cmotion to correct sentence.\u201d We disagree. \n{\u00b613} The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized: \u201c* * * [I]n the normal course, \nsentencing errors are not jurisdictional and do not render a judgment void. * * * But in the \nmodern era, Ohio law has consistently recognized a narrow, and imperative, exception to \nthat general rule: a sentence that is not in accordance with statutorily mandated terms is \nvoid.\u201d State v. Fischer,  128 Ohio St.3d 92, 94, 2010\u2013Ohio\u20136238, \u00b6 7\u2013\u00b6 8. The rule of \nFischer was supposed to be limited to \u201ca discrete vein of cases: those in which a court \ndoes not properly impose a statutorily mandated period of postrelease control.\u201d See \nFischer at \u00b6 31. However, the Ohio Supreme Court has since indicated a willingness, \nalbeit a limited one, to expand its \u201cvoid sentence\u201d jurisprudence to other situations. See Holmes County, Case No.  17 CA 22 5\nState v. Williams, 148 Ohio St.3d 403, 2016-Ohio-7658, 71 N.E.3d 234, \u00b621, citing State \nv. Harris, 132 Ohio St.3d 318, 2012-Ohio-1908, 972 N.E.2d 509, paragraph one of the \nsyllabus, and State v. Moore,  135 Ohio St.3d 151, 2012-Ohio-5479, 985 N.E.2d 432, \nsyllabus. \n{\u00b614} Appellant\u2019s September 27, 2017 motion to correct his 2015 sentence was \nmade in reference to R.C. 2929.14(B)(3), which states in pertinent part as follows: \nExcept when an offender commits a violation of section 2903.01 or \n2907.02 of the Revised Code and the penalty imposed for the violation is \nlife imprisonment or commits a violation of section 2903.02 of the Revised \nCode, *** if the offender is guilty of an attempted violation of section 2907.02 \nof the Revised Code and, had the offender completed the violation of \nsection 2907.02 of the Revised Code that was attempted, the offender \nwould have been subject to a sentence of life imprisonment or life \nimprisonment without parole for the violation of section 2907.02 of the \nRevised Code, the court shall impose upon the offender for the felony \nviolation a mandatory prison term of the maximum prison term prescribed \nfor a felony of the first degree that, subject to divisions (C) to (I) of section \n2967.19 of the Revised Code, cannot be reduced pursuant to section \n2929.20, section 2967.19, or any other provision of Chapter 2967. or 5120. \nof the Revised Code.  \n{\u00b615} (Emphasis added). \n{\u00b616} The term \u201csubject to\u201d means \u201cliable, subordinate, subservient, inferior, \nobedient to; governed or affected by; provided that; provided; answerable.\u201d St. Augustine Holmes County, Case No.  17 CA 22 6\nPools, Inc. v. James M. Barker, Inc., 687 So.2d 957, 958 (Fla.App.1997), quoting Black's \nLaw Dictionary 1425 (6th ed.1990). \n{\u00b617} In a nutshell, appellant in the case sub judice proposed in his motion to \ncorrect sentence that under the aforesaid provision and given the age of the victim (nine \nyears old at the time of the offense), the trial court in 2015 was required to render a \nmandatory maximum sentence (eleven years) for his offense of first-degree felony \nattempted rape (R.C. 2923.02 / R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b)). 1 Appellant therefore maintains \nthat his nine-year sentence for attempted rape was void and is subject to review at any \ntime.   \n{\u00b618} This Court has observed: \u201c*** R.C. 2971.03(B)(1)(b) states that if a person \nis convicted of or pleads guilty to rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), committed on \nor after January 2, 2007, the sentencing court shall, with certain qualifications, impose \nupon the person, if the victim was less than ten years of age, an indefinite prison term \nconsisting of a minimum term of fifteen years and a maximum of life imprisonment.\u201d In re \nN.S., 5th Dist. Coshocton No. 2016 CA 0005, 2017-Ohio-163, \u00b6 17. As comprehensively \nsummarized by the Second District Court of Appeals,  a  trial court actually has three \nsentencing options for a defendant convicted of raping a child under ten years of age: \u201c1) \n[P]ursuant to R.C. 2907.02(B), the trial court can impose a sentence of life imprisonment \nwithout the possibility of parole; 2) pursuant to R.C. 2971.03(B)(1)(b), the trial court can \nsentence the defendant to life imprisonment with  the possibility of parole after fifteen \nyears; or 3) the trial court can sentence the defendant to an indefinite prison term with a \n                                            \n1   Appellant in his motion erroneously indicated ten years would be the maximum \nsentence for attempted rape as a felony of the first degree.   Holmes County, Case No.  17 CA 22 7\nminimum of fifteen years\u201d State v. Gibson, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2013 CA 112, 2014-Ohio-\n5573, \u00b6 13 (emphasis deleted).  \n{\u00b619} Accordingly, we are not persuaded that appellant herein necessarily \u201cwould \nhave been subject to a sentence of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without parole\u201d \nunder R.C. 2929.14(B)(3), supra, had his attempted rape been carried out. By extension, \nwe are not persuaded that the trial court was mandated to order a maximum sentence of \neleven years for his attempted rape, and we therefore do not find his nine-year sentence \nwas void or illegal. \n{\u00b620} However, even if we accept, arguendo, appellant\u2019s interpretation of R.C. \n2929.14(B)(3), supra, we are not inclined to expand the \u201cdiscrete vein\u201d of Fischer to the \npresent scenario absent additional guidance from the Ohio Supreme Court. Therefore, \nwe hold appellant\u2019s sentencing claim could have been raised on direct appeal and is thus \nbarred by the doctrine of res judicata. The trial court therefore did not err in denying his \npost-conviction \u201cmotion to correct sentence\u201d filed more than two years after his sentence \nwas ordered. \n  Holmes County, Case No.  17 CA 22 8\n{\u00b621} Appellant's sole Assignment of Error is therefore overruled. \n{\u00b622} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, \nHolmes County, Ohio, is hereby affirmed. \n \nBy: Wise, P.

We overruled appellant's sole assignment of error and affirmed via an opinion issued on June 27, 2016. See State v. Steiner, 5th Dist. Holmes No. 15CA17, 2016\u2013Ohio\u20134648. Appellant pursued an appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. However, on December 28, 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court declined jurisdiction. See State v. Steiner, 147 Ohio St.3d 1475, 65 N.E.3d 778 (Table), 2016-Ohio-8438.\n\nOn September 21, 2016, appellant filed a pro se \u201cpetition to vacate or set aside judgment of conviction or sentence,\u201d citing R.C. 2953.21.

On May 22, 2017, we affirmed, noting in particular that during the pendency of that appeal, the State had requested and obtained a limited remand so that the trial court could prepare findings of fact and conclusions of law to support its dismissal. See State v. Steiner, 5th Dist. Holmes No. 16CA012, 2017-Ohio-2947.\n\nIn the meantime, on January 27, 2017, appellant filed a pro se motion to withdraw guilty plea under Crim.R. 32.1. The State filed a memorandum in opposition on\nFebruary 7, 2017. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion on July 12, 2017. The record does not indicate an appeal therefrom.\n\n{\u00b69} On September 27, 2017, appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion to correct sentence pursuant to section 2929.14(B)(3).\u201d The State filed a memorandum in opposition on October 30, 2017. The trial court issued a judgment entry denying appellant\u2019s motion to correct sentence on October 31, 2017.\n\n{\u00b610} Appellant filed a pro se notice of appeal on November 17, 2017. He herein raises the following sole Assignment of Error:\n\n{\u00b611} \u201cI. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW, WHEN IT DENIED STEINER\u2019S MOTION TO CORRECT SENTENCE PURSUANT TO R.C. 2929.14(B)(3).\u201d\n\nI.\n\n{\u00b612} In his sole Assignment of Error, appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his post-conviction \u201cmotion to correct sentence.\u201d We disagree.\n\n{\u00b613} The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized: \u201c* * * [I]n the normal course, sentencing errors are not jurisdictional and do not render a judgment void. * * * But in the modern era, Ohio law has consistently recognized a narrow, and imperative, exception to that general rule: a sentence that is not in accordance with statutorily mandated terms is void.\u201d State v. Fischer, 128 Ohio St.3d 92, 94, 2010\u2013Ohio\u20136238, \u00b6 7\u2013\u00b6 8. The rule of Fischer was supposed to be limited to \u201ca discrete vein of cases: those in which a court does not properly impose a statutorily mandated period of postrelease control.\u201d See Fischer at \u00b6 31. However, the Ohio Supreme Court has since indicated a willingness, albeit a limited one, to expand its \u201cvoid sentence\u201d jurisprudence to other situations. See\nState v. Williams, 148 Ohio St.3d 403, 2016-Ohio-7658, 71 N.E.3d 234, \u00b621, citing State v. Harris, 132 Ohio St.3d 318, 2012-Ohio-1908, 972 N.E.2d 509, paragraph one of the syllabus, and State v. Moore, 135 Ohio St.3d 151, 2012-Ohio-5479, 985 N.E.2d 432, syllabus.\n\n\u00b614 Appellant\u2019s September 27, 2017 motion to correct his 2015 sentence was made in reference to R.C. 2929.14(B)(3), which states in pertinent part as follows:\n\nExcept when an offender commits a violation of section 2903.01 or 2907.02 of the Revised Code and the penalty imposed for the violation is life imprisonment or commits a violation of section 2903.02 of the Revised Code, *** if the offender is guilty of an attempted violation of section 2907.02 of the Revised Code and, had the offender completed the violation of section 2907.02 of the Revised Code that was attempted, the offender would have been subject to a sentence of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without parole for the violation of section 2907.02 of the Revised Code, the court shall impose upon the offender for the felony violation a mandatory prison term of the maximum prison term prescribed for a felony of the first degree that, subject to divisions (C) to (I) of section 2967.19 of the Revised Code, cannot be reduced pursuant to section 2929.20, section 2967.19, or any other provision of Chapter 2967. or 5120. of the Revised Code.\n\n\u00b615 (Emphasis added).\n\n\u00b616 The term \u201csubject to\u201d means \u201cliable, subordinate, subservient, inferior, obedient to; governed or affected by; provided that; provided; answerable.\u201d St. Augustine\nIn a nutshell, appellant in the case *sub judice* proposed in his motion to correct sentence that under the aforesaid provision and given the age of the victim (nine years old at the time of the offense), the trial court in 2015 was required to render a mandatory maximum sentence (eleven years) for his offense of first-degree felony attempted rape (R.C. 2923.02 / R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b)). Appellant therefore maintains that his nine-year sentence for attempted rape was void and is subject to review at any time.\n\nThis Court has observed: \u201c*** R.C. 2971.03(B)(1)(b) states that if a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), committed on or after January 2, 2007, the sentencing court shall, with certain qualifications, impose upon the person, if the victim was less than ten years of age, an indefinite prison term consisting of a minimum term of fifteen years and a maximum of life imprisonment.\u201d *In re N.S.*, 5th Dist. Coshocton No. 2016 CA 0005, 2017-Ohio-163, \u00b6 17. As comprehensively summarized by the Second District Court of Appeals, a trial court actually has three sentencing options for a defendant convicted of raping a child under ten years of age: \u201c1) [P]ursuant to R.C. 2907.02(B), the trial court can impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole; 2) pursuant to R.C. 2971.03(B)(1)(b), the trial court can sentence the defendant to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after fifteen years; or 3) the trial court can sentence the defendant to an indefinite prison term with a\n\n---\n\n1 Appellant in his motion erroneously indicated ten years would be the maximum sentence for attempted rape as a felony of the first degree.\nminimum of fifteen years\u201d State v. Gibson, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2013 CA 112, 2014-Ohio-5573, \u00b6 13 (emphasis deleted).\n\n{\u00b619} Accordingly, we are not persuaded that appellant herein necessarily \u201cwould have been subject to a sentence of life imprisonment or life imprisonment without parole\u201d under R.C. 2929.14(B)(3), supra, had his attempted rape been carried out. By extension, we are not persuaded that the trial court was mandated to order a maximum sentence of eleven years for his attempted rape, and we therefore do not find his nine-year sentence was void or illegal.\n\n{\u00b620} However, even if we accept, arguendo, appellant\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 2929.14(B)(3), supra, we are not inclined to expand the \u201cdiscrete vein\u201d of Fischer to the present scenario absent additional guidance from the Ohio Supreme Court. Therefore, we hold appellant\u2019s sentencing claim could have been raised on direct appeal and is thus barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The trial court therefore did not err in denying his post-conviction \u201cmotion to correct sentence\u201d filed more than two years after his sentence was ordered.\nAppellant's sole Assignment of Error is therefore overruled.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Holmes County, Ohio, is hereby affirmed.\n\nBy: Wise, P. J.\n\nDelaney, J., and\n\nBaldwin, J., concur.\n\nJWW/d 0214"}

POWELL, P.J.  \n{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Damon Shawn Lloyd (\"Lloyd\"), appeals from an \namended and corrected judgment entry of sentence issued by the Warren County Court of \nCommon Pleas convicting and sentencing him to serve an aggregate term of 18 years in \nprison after he was found guilty of murder with an accompanying firearm specification \nfollowing a bench trial.  For the reasons outlined below, we affirm. Warren CA2017-07-104 \n \n - 2 - \nThe Murder of David Richardson \n{\u00b6 2} On November 9, 2006, the Warren County Grand Jury returned an indictment \ncharging Lloyd with murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A), an unclassified felony, with an \naccompanying firearm specification.  The charges arose after Lloyd fatally shot David \nRichardson (\"Richardson\") with his Smith & Wesson nine-millimeter semi-automatic \nhandgun on the afternoon of Wednesday, November 1, 2006.  It is undisputed that the \nshooting occurred at Lloyd's residence.  Following his arraignment, Lloyd pled not guilty \nand waived his right to a jury trial.  The matter was then tried to the bench, during which the \ntrial court was presented with extensive testimony and evidence regarding Richardson's \nmurder.  This includes lengthy testimony from Lloyd, who described the events leading up \nto Richardson's murder as follows. \n{\u00b6 3} Lloyd and Richardson had known each other since childhood.  In the summer \nof 2006, Lloyd asked Richardson, who was having marital and financial difficulties, to move \nin with him and his family.  Richardson had been a boxer, a bodyguard, and a bouncer, and \naccording to Lloyd, would brag about beating up people.  Richardson, who was wanted for \nnonpayment of child support, was also known to carry a .45 handgun with him.  During that \nsummer, Lloyd and Richardson practiced target shooting together on Lloyd's property. \n{\u00b6 4} As the summer transitioned into fall, Lloyd noticed that Richardson's behavior \nbegan to change.  Specifically, according to Lloyd, Richardson became moody, \"dark,\" and \nmore distant, took off more and more, used the house as a \"weigh station,\" and would have \nangry conversations on his cell phone.  Suspecting Richardson may be using drugs, Lloyd \ntalked to Richardson, who acknowledged that he had a drug problem. \n{\u00b6 5} On the evening of Sunday, October 29, 2006, Lloyd came home to find his \nintoxicated wife \"passed out\" on the couch with her hair draped over Richardson's lap.  \nAsked what was going on, Richardson either smiled or laughed at Lloyd with a guilty look Warren CA2017-07-104 \n \n - 3 - \nin his eyes. 1  Lloyd, upon putting his wife to bed, then confronted Richardson with a \ntelephone in one hand and a shotgun in the other and ordered Richardson to leave his \nhouse and never come back.  According to Lloyd, Richardson complied with this request, \nbut was not at all happy about it. \n{\u00b6 6} Between the evening of Sunday, October 29, 2006 and the day of the \nshooting, Wednesday, November 1, 2006, Lloyd and Richardson exchanged several phone \ncalls.  According to Lloyd, the phone calls between himself and Richardson on Sunday were \nhot and heated on both sides, with Richardson threatening Lloyd and his family with physical \nharm.  However, by Monday and Tuesday, Lloyd claimed the calls between him and \nRichardson had cooled.  Unfortunately, the calls again intensified on Wednesday when \nRichardson threatened physical harm to Lloyd and his family.  According to Lloyd, \nRichardson also threatened to burn down his house.  Seemingly terrified of Richardson and \nwhat Richardson might do to him and his family, Lloyd testified that he retrieved his \nhandgun, but did not call the police.  When Richardson called back a short time later, Lloyd \nand Richardson agreed to have Richardson's father, Ova Richardson (\"Ova\"), come to \nLloyd's house to retrieve Richardson's belongings. \n{\u00b6 7} Shortly thereafter, Lloyd testified that he saw Ova drive his truck up his \ndriveway and park in the back of the house.  Seated next to Ova in the truck was \nRichardson.2  Expecting a beating from Richardson, Lloyd tucked his handgun in his back \npocket, told his wife to stay in the living room, and went into the dining room.  The dining \nroom, which is on the side of the house, can be entered from the outside through a porch \nand a wooden door and its screen door. \n                     \n1.  The record indicates that the next morning, Lloyd's wife was heard crying in the shower complaining that \nshe had semen in her hair. \n \n2. The record indicates that Ova's three-year-old granddaughter was also in the truck with Richardson. Warren CA2017-07-104 \n \n - 4 - \n{\u00b6 8} After Ova parked his truck, Lloyd yelled at Richardson to leave the property.  \nInstead of leaving, however, Richardson opened the screen door and started pounding on \nthe wooden door.  According to Lloyd, Richardson then slapped at the door lock with his \npalm, thus causing the door to fly open.  Richardson then came at Lloyd \"at a full rush,\" \nangry, and threatening to kill him.  In response to Richardson entering the house, Lloyd \ntwice shot Richardson who then spun around and jumped back out of the wooden door and \nonto the porch.  Already being shot twice, Lloyd testified that Richardson then lunged at \nhim, thus causing Lloyd to shoot Richardson one final time.  Lloyd then closed both the \nscreen door and the wooden door and told his wife to call 9-1-1.  Although the police and \nthe paramedics were on the scene very quickly, Richardson was already dead with two \ngunshot wounds to the chest and one to the abdomen. \n{\u00b6 9} Throughout his testimony, Lloyd claimed that he had acted in self-defense, \nexplaining that he never intended to kill Richardson, but that he had no other choice but to \nshoot Richardson to protect himself and his family.  The trial court, however, rejected Lloyd's \nself-defense claim and instead returned a verdict finding Lloyd guilty as charged.  The trial \ncourt then sentenced Lloyd to serve a total aggregate term of 18 years in prison.  This court \nsubsequently affirmed Lloyd's conviction and sentence on direct appeal, State v. Lloyd, 12th \nDist. Warren Nos. CA2007-04-052 and CA2007-04-053, 2008-Ohio-3383, and the Ohio \nSupreme Court declined review.  State v. Lloyd, 120 Ohio St.3d 1454, 2008-Ohio-6813. \nPostconviction Facts and Procedural History \n{\u00b6 10} On January 16, 2008, while his direct appeal was still pending before this \ncourt, Lloyd filed a petition for postconviction relief.  Although represented by counsel, \nLloyd's petition raised many of the same issues as part of his then pending direct appeal.  \nOn July 29, 2008, the trial court denied Lloyd's petition without a hearing.  Lloyd did not \nappeal from the trial court's decision. Warren CA2017-07-104 \n \n - 5 - \n{\u00b6 11} On January 4, 2010, approximately 18 months after this court's decision \naffirming Lloyd's conviction and sentence on direct appeal, Lloyd filed a motion with this \ncourt requesting his appeal be reopened pursuant to App.R. 26(B).  Pursuant to App.R. \n26(B)(1), an application for reopening must be filed \"within ninety days from journalization \nof the appellate judgment unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later time.\"  \nOn April 7, 2010, this court denied Lloyd's motion to reopen his appeal after finding he had \n\"failed to show good cause as to why his application was not filed in a timely manner[.]\"  \nState v. Lloyd, 12th Dist. Warren Nos. CA2007-04-052 and CA2007-04-053 (April 7, 2010) \n(Entry Denying Application for Reopening).  Lloyd then appealed to the Ohio Supreme \nCourt, which again declined review.  State v. Lloyd, 128 Ohio St.3d 1414, 2011-Ohio-828. \n{\u00b6 12} On March 12, 2010, while his application to reopen his appeal was still \npending before this court, Lloyd filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the United \nStates District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  Lloyd v. Warden, Ross Correctional \nInst., S.D.Ohio No. 1:10-CV-169, 2012 WL 70619.  As part of his petition, Lloyd alleged that \nhe received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  Lloyd also alleged that he was \ndenied a fair trial because the trial court applied \"the wrong law regarding material aspects \nof the case[.]\"  Id. at *2.  The District Court denied Lloyd's petition finding he committed \nprocedural defaults in bringing his petition, as well as a waiver of his claims.  Id. at *6.  The \nDistrict Court also noted that it did \"not find a colorable claim of actual innocence such that \nthere is a basis to excuse [his] procedural defaults.\"  Id. at *7. \n{\u00b6 13} On September 19, 2012, Lloyd moved for leave to file a motion for a new trial \nbased on alleged newly discovered evidence under Crim.R. 33.  As part of this motion, \nLloyd argued that he recently discovered new evidence regarding Richardson's violent past.  \nAccording to Lloyd, this alleged new evidence supported a claim of self-defense and proves \nthat he was justifiably afraid of Richardson at the time of the shooting.  The trial court denied Warren CA2017-07-104 \n \n - 6 - \nLloyd's motion in an entry filed October 24, 2012.  In so holding, the trial court stated the \nfollowing: \nThe specific instances of the victim's violence that Defendant \nLloyd claims are 'new' are not, in fact, new.  Defendant Lloyd \nhad every opportunity to present to the court specific instances \nof violence that made him fear his victim, in support of his self-\ndefense claim.  Additionally, the fact that the defendant has now, \nfive years later, uncovered reasons to fear his victim cannot \nsupport his claim of acting out of fear and self-defense at the \ntime of the murder. \n \n{\u00b6 14} On November 29, 2012, Lloyd appealed from the trial court's decision \noverruling his motion.  However, finding his notice of appeal untimely, this court dismissed \nLloyd's appeal on December 19, 2012.  State v. Lloyd, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2012-11-\n123 (Dec. 18, 2012) (Judgment Entry of Dismissal).  Lloyd then filed a motion for \nreconsideration, which this court denied.  State v. Lloyd, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2012-11-\n123 (Feb. 5, 2013) (Entry Denying Motion for Reconsideration). \n{\u00b6 15} On June 19, 2013, Lloyd moved the trial court to correct his \"illegal sentence\" \nand allow him to \"present additional clear errors under criminal rule 52,\" which, when taken \ntogether, rendered his conviction and sentence void.  The trial court, properly construing \nLloyd's motion as a second, successive petition for postconviction relief, denied Lloyd's \nmotion on August 23, 2013.  In so holding, the trial court stated: \n[Lloyd] wants to present evidence that the victim was an evil \nperson but admits in his own motion that he was unaware of \nthese other specific incidents both at the time of the shooting \nand at the time of the trial.  Therefore, the Court can conceive \nof no way in which these prior bad acts would bolster his claim \nof self-defense.  [Lloyd] was allowed to testify as to his fear of \nthe victim and as to the events leading up to culminating in the \nshooting of the victim. \n \n{\u00b6 16} Lloyd then appealed from the trial court's decision, which this court denied.  \nState v. Lloyd , 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2013-09-080 (Mar. 24, 2014) (Accelerated \nCalendar Judgment Entry).  Lloyd then appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, which once Warren CA2017-07-104 \n \n - 7 - \nagain denied review.  State v. Lloyd, 139 Ohio St.3d 1482, 2014-Ohio-3195. \n{\u00b6 17} On November 4, 2014, the Fourth District Court of Appeals affirmed the \ndecision of the Ross County Court of Common Pleas dismissing Lloyd's petition seeking a \nwrit of habeas corpus, wherein Lloyd claimed hi s conviction and sentence were illegal \nbecause he was indicted based on the unlawful testimony of his wife during the grand jury \nproceedings.  Lloyd v. Robinson, 4th Dist. Ross No. 14CA3452, 2014-Ohio-4977.  Shortly \nthereafter, on March 31, 2015, the Fourth District Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of \nthe Ross County Court of Common Pleas dismissing Lloyd's second, successive petition \nseeking a writ of habeas corpus, wherein Lloyd claimed his conviction was unlawful and \nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence because of judicial misconduct, prosecutorial \nmisconduct, and the ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  Lloyd v. Robinson , 4th Dist. \nRoss No. 14CA3462, 2015-Ohio-1331.  The Ohio Supreme Court denied review of both \ndecisions.  Lloyd v. Robinson , 142 Ohio St.3d 1450, 2015-Ohio-1591; and  Lloyd v. \nRobinson, 143 Ohio St.3d 1419, 2015-Ohio-2911. \n{\u00b6 18} On April 6, 2015, Lloyd filed a motion for re-sentencing alleging his sentence \nwas void, wherein he challenged the trial court's order requiring him to pay restitution, court \ncosts, and other fees.  Three days later, on April 9, 2015, the trial court issued a decision \nvacating its order requiring Lloyd to pay court costs, court-appointed counsel fees, and other \nfees upon finding it had \"declined to find [Lloyd] has or is reasonably expected to have the \nmeans to pay the financial sanctions * * *.\"  The trial court's decision, however, did not make \nany reference to its prior order requiring Lloyd to pay restitution.   \n{\u00b6 19} Lloyd then appealed from the trial court's decision arguing the trial court erred \nby not also vacating the trial court's order requiring him to pay restitution.  This court agreed \nupon finding the trial court \"acknowledged that it did not intend to order Lloyd to pay any \nfinancial sanctions,\" including any order of restitution.  State v. Lloyd, 12th Dist. Warren No. Warren CA2017-07-104 \n \n - 8 - \nCA2015-05-038, 2015-Ohio-3636, \u00b6 9.  This court, therefore, vacated the trial court's order \nrequiring Lloyd to pay restitution.  Apparently not satisfied with this court's decision, Lloyd \nappealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, which again denied review.  State v. Lloyd, 146 Ohio \nSt.3d 1427, 2016-Ohio-4606. \n{\u00b6 20} On October 15, 2015, Lloyd filed another motion for re-sentencing alleging his \nsentence was void, wherein he challenged the trial court's imposition of a mandatory five-\nyear term of postrelease control.  The state, acknowledging that a defendant's conviction of \nmurder is not subject to postrelease control, agreed that the trial court erred by advising \nLloyd he would be subject to a mandatory five-year postrelease control term if he were ever \nreleased from prison.  As a result, on December 16, 2015, the trial court issued a decision \nordering \"any reference to post-release control be deleted from the sentencing entry.\" \n{\u00b6 21} On May 18, 2017, Lloyd moved the trial court to issue an amended sentencing \nentry that properly \"memorialize[d] the sentence in one single document for compliance of \nOhio Law.\"  Thereafter, on June 28, 2017, the trial court issued an amended and corrected \njudgment entry of sentence that contained no references to restitution, court costs, fees, or \npostrelease control.  Lloyd then appealed from the trial court's amended and corrected \njudgment entry of sentence, raising the following five assignments of error for review. \n{\u00b6 22} Assignment of Error No. 1:  \n{\u00b6 23} THE LOWER COURT COMMITTED PREJ UDICIAL ERROR IN IGNORING \nTHE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE. \n{\u00b6 24} Assignment of Error No. 2: \n{\u00b6 25} THE COURT COMMITTED PREJUDICIAL ERROR IN IGNORING THE \nCASTLE DOCTRINE. \n{\u00b6 26} Assignment of Error No. 3: \n{\u00b6 27} THE LOWER COURT COMMITTED PREJUDICIAL ERROR IN ALLOWING Warren CA2017-07-104 \n \n - 9 - \nPROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT. \n{\u00b6 28} Assignment of Error No. 4: \n{\u00b6 29} APPELLANT WAS DEPRIVED OF EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF \nCOUNSEL. \n{\u00b6 30} Assignment of Error No. 5: \n{\u00b6 31} APPELLANT WAS DEPRIVED OF A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL. \nAnalysis \n{\u00b6 32} In his five assignments of error, Lloyd challenges many aspects of his bench \ntrial from which the trial court found him guilty of murder with an attendant firearm \nspecification.  In support, Lloyd claims the trial court erred by not finding he had acted in \nself-defense and by not applying the \"castle doctrine\" to the case at bar.  Lloyd also claims \nhis conviction must be reversed due to alleged prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective \nassistance of trial counsel, both of which resulted in him being deprived of a fair and \nimpartial trial.  Lloyd's claims, however, are all barred by the doctrine of res judicata since \nhe could have, and in most cases actually did, raise these issues as part of his direct appeal \nand subsequent motions and petitions before the trial court. \n{\u00b6 33} As this court has stated previously, the doctrine of res judicata provides that \n\"a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel \nfrom raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any \ndefense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by \nthe defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or an appeal from \nthe judgment.\"  State v. Wagers, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2011-08-007, 2012-Ohio-2258, \u00b6 \n10, citing State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 1996-Ohio-337 (1996).  Res judicata, however, \ndoes not apply to a void sentence for a void sentence may be reviewed at any time.  State \nv. Vancleve, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2016-06-039, 2016-Ohio-7546, \u00b6 15. Warren CA2017-07-104 \n \n - 10 - \n{\u00b6 34} After a thorough review of the record, we find no error in the trial court's \nhandling of this matter that would render Lloyd's conviction or sentence void.  The doctrine \nof res judicata, therefore, is clearly applicable to the case at bar.  In so holding, we note that \nLloyd appealed from the trial court's amended and corrected judgment entry of sentence.  \nAs the record plainly reveals, that entry merely removed references to restitution, court \ncosts, fees, and postrelease control in accordance with this and the trial court's various \nrulings.  As noted by the state, and with which we agree, such an entry does not provide \nLloyd with the unfettered opportunity to challenge any error that he believes may have \noccurred prior to trial, during trial, or post trial.  Rather, as noted by the Ohio Supreme Court, \nalthough the doctrine of res judicata does not preclude review of a void sentence, \"res \njudicata still applies to other aspects of the merits of a conviction, including the \ndetermination of guilt and the lawful elements of the ensuing sentence.\"  State v. Fischer, \n128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, \u00b6 40.  Lloyd's claim otherwise lacks merit. \nConclusion \n{\u00b6 35} In light of the foregoing, because the doctrine of res judicata clearly applies to \nthe case at bar, Lloyd's five assignments of error are without merit and overruled. \n{\u00b6 36} Judgment affirmed. \n \n HENDRICKSON and M.

Fornshell, Warren County Prosecuting Attorney, Kirsten A. Brandt, 520 Justice Drive, Lebanon, Ohio 45036, for plaintiff-appellee\n\nDamon S. Lloyd, #A547349, Chillicothe Correctional Institution, 15802 State Route 104, Chillicothe, Ohio 45601, defendant-appellant, pro se\n\nS. POWELL, P.J.\n\n\u00b6 1 Defendant-appellant, Damon Shawn Lloyd (\"Lloyd\"), appeals from an amended and corrected judgment entry of sentence issued by the Warren County Court of Common Pleas convicting and sentencing him to serve an aggregate term of 18 years in prison after he was found guilty of murder with an accompanying firearm specification following a bench trial. For the reasons outlined below, we affirm.\nThe Murder of David Richardson\n\n\u00b6 2 On November 9, 2006, the Warren County Grand Jury returned an indictment charging Lloyd with murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A), an unclassified felony, with an accompanying firearm specification. The charges arose after Lloyd fatally shot David Richardson (\"Richardson\") with his Smith & Wesson nine-millimeter semi-automatic handgun on the afternoon of Wednesday, November 1, 2006. It is undisputed that the shooting occurred at Lloyd's residence. Following his arraignment, Lloyd pled not guilty and waived his right to a jury trial. The matter was then tried to the bench, during which the trial court was presented with extensive testimony and evidence regarding Richardson's murder. This includes lengthy testimony from Lloyd, who described the events leading up to Richardson's murder as follows.\n\n\u00b6 3 Lloyd and Richardson had known each other since childhood. In the summer of 2006, Lloyd asked Richardson, who was having marital and financial difficulties, to move in with him and his family. Richardson had been a boxer, a bodyguard, and a bouncer, and according to Lloyd, would brag about beating up people. Richardson, who was wanted for nonpayment of child support, was also known to carry a .45 handgun with him. During that summer, Lloyd and Richardson practiced target shooting together on Lloyd's property.\n\n\u00b6 4 As the summer transitioned into fall, Lloyd noticed that Richardson's behavior began to change. Specifically, according to Lloyd, Richardson became moody, \"dark,\" and more distant, took off more and more, used the house as a \"weigh station,\" and would have angry conversations on his cell phone. Suspecting Richardson may be using drugs, Lloyd talked to Richardson, who acknowledged that he had a drug problem.\n\n\u00b6 5 On the evening of Sunday, October 29, 2006, Lloyd came home to find his intoxicated wife \"passed out\" on the couch with her hair draped over Richardson's lap. Asked what was going on, Richardson either smiled or laughed at Lloyd with a guilty look\nin his eyes. Lloyd, upon putting his wife to bed, then confronted Richardson with a telephone in one hand and a shotgun in the other and ordered Richardson to leave his house and never come back. According to Lloyd, Richardson complied with this request, but was not at all happy about it.\n\n{\u00b6 6} Between the evening of Sunday, October 29, 2006 and the day of the shooting, Wednesday, November 1, 2006, Lloyd and Richardson exchanged several phone calls. According to Lloyd, the phone calls between himself and Richardson on Sunday were hot and heated on both sides, with Richardson threatening Lloyd and his family with physical harm. However, by Monday and Tuesday, Lloyd claimed the calls between him and Richardson had cooled. Unfortunately, the calls again intensified on Wednesday when Richardson threatened physical harm to Lloyd and his family. According to Lloyd, Richardson also threatened to burn down his house. Seemingly terrified of Richardson and what Richardson might do to him and his family, Lloyd testified that he retrieved his handgun, but did not call the police. When Richardson called back a short time later, Lloyd and Richardson agreed to have Richardson's father, Ova Richardson (\"Ova\"), come to Lloyd's house to retrieve Richardson's belongings.\n\n{\u00b6 7} Shortly thereafter, Lloyd testified that he saw Ova drive his truck up his driveway and park in the back of the house. Seated next to Ova in the truck was Richardson. Expecting a beating from Richardson, Lloyd tucked his handgun in his back pocket, told his wife to stay in the living room, and went into the dining room. The dining room, which is on the side of the house, can be entered from the outside through a porch and a wooden door and its screen door.\n\n---\n\n1. The record indicates that the next morning, Lloyd's wife was heard crying in the shower complaining that she had semen in her hair.\n\n2. The record indicates that Ova's three-year-old granddaughter was also in the truck with Richardson.\nAfter Ova parked his truck, Lloyd yelled at Richardson to leave the property. Instead of leaving, however, Richardson opened the screen door and started pounding on the wooden door. According to Lloyd, Richardson then slapped at the door lock with his palm, thus causing the door to fly open. Richardson then came at Lloyd \"at a full rush,\" angry, and threatening to kill him. In response to Richardson entering the house, Lloyd twice shot Richardson who then spun around and jumped back out of the wooden door and onto the porch. Already being shot twice, Lloyd testified that Richardson then lunged at him, thus causing Lloyd to shoot Richardson one final time. Lloyd then closed both the screen door and the wooden door and told his wife to call 9-1-1. Although the police and the paramedics were on the scene very quickly, Richardson was already dead with two gunshot wounds to the chest and one to the abdomen.\n\nThroughout his testimony, Lloyd claimed that he had acted in self-defense, explaining that he never intended to kill Richardson, but that he had no other choice but to shoot Richardson to protect himself and his family. The trial court, however, rejected Lloyd's self-defense claim and instead returned a verdict finding Lloyd guilty as charged. The trial court then sentenced Lloyd to serve a total aggregate term of 18 years in prison. This court subsequently affirmed Lloyd's conviction and sentence on direct appeal, State v. Lloyd, 12th Dist. Warren Nos. CA2007-04-052 and CA2007-04-053, 2008-Ohio-3383, and the Ohio Supreme Court declined review. State v. Lloyd, 120 Ohio St.3d 1454, 2008-Ohio-6813.\n\nPostconviction Facts and Procedural History\n\nOn January 16, 2008, while his direct appeal was still pending before this court, Lloyd filed a petition for postconviction relief. Although represented by counsel, Lloyd's petition raised many of the same issues as part of his then pending direct appeal. On July 29, 2008, the trial court denied Lloyd's petition without a hearing. Lloyd did not appeal from the trial court's decision.\nOn January 4, 2010, approximately 18 months after this court's decision affirming Lloyd's conviction and sentence on direct appeal, Lloyd filed a motion with this court requesting his appeal be reopened pursuant to App.R. 26(B). Pursuant to App.R. 26(B)(1), an application for reopening must be filed \"within ninety days from journalization of the appellate judgment unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later time.\" On April 7, 2010, this court denied Lloyd's motion to reopen his appeal after finding he had \"failed to show good cause as to why his application was not filed in a timely manner[.]\" State v. Lloyd, 12th Dist. Warren Nos. CA2007-04-052 and CA2007-04-053 (April 7, 2010) (Entry Denying Application for Reopening). Lloyd then appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, which again declined review. State v. Lloyd, 128 Ohio St.3d 1414, 2011-Ohio-828.\n\nOn March 12, 2010, while his application to reopen his appeal was still pending before this court, Lloyd filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. Lloyd v. Warden, Ross Correctional Inst., S.D.Ohio No. 1:10-CV-169, 2012 WL 70619. As part of his petition, Lloyd alleged that he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Lloyd also alleged that he was denied a fair trial because the trial court applied \"the wrong law regarding material aspects of the case[.]\" Id. at *2. The District Court denied Lloyd's petition finding he committed procedural defaults in bringing his petition, as well as a waiver of his claims. Id. at *6. The District Court also noted that it did \"not find a colorable claim of actual innocence such that there is a basis to excuse [his] procedural defaults.\" Id. at *7.\n\nOn September 19, 2012, Lloyd moved for leave to file a motion for a new trial based on alleged newly discovered evidence under Crim.R. 33. As part of this motion, Lloyd argued that he recently discovered new evidence regarding Richardson's violent past. According to Lloyd, this alleged new evidence supported a claim of self-defense and proves that he was justifiably afraid of Richardson at the time of the shooting. The trial court denied\nLloyd's motion in an entry filed October 24, 2012. In so holding, the trial court stated the following:\n\nThe specific instances of the victim's violence that Defendant Lloyd claims are 'new' are not, in fact, new. Defendant Lloyd had every opportunity to present to the court specific instances of violence that made him fear his victim, in support of his self-defense claim. Additionally, the fact that the defendant has now, five years later, uncovered reasons to fear his victim cannot support his claim of acting out of fear and self-defense at the time of the murder.\n\n\u00b6 14 On November 29, 2012, Lloyd appealed from the trial court's decision overruling his motion. However, finding his notice of appeal untimely, this court dismissed Lloyd's appeal on December 19, 2012. State v. Lloyd, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2012-11-123 (Dec. 18, 2012) (Judgment Entry of Dismissal). Lloyd then filed a motion for reconsideration, which this court denied. State v. Lloyd, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2012-11-123 (Feb. 5, 2013) (Entry Denying Motion for Reconsideration).\n\n\u00b6 15 On June 19, 2013, Lloyd moved the trial court to correct his \"illegal sentence\" and allow him to \"present additional clear errors under criminal rule 52,\" which, when taken together, rendered his conviction and sentence void. The trial court, properly construing Lloyd's motion as a second, successive petition for postconviction relief, denied Lloyd's motion on August 23, 2013. In so holding, the trial court stated:\n\n[Lloyd] wants to present evidence that the victim was an evil person but admits in his own motion that he was unaware of these other specific incidents both at the time of the shooting and at the time of the trial. Therefore, the Court can conceive of no way in which these prior bad acts would bolster his claim of self-defense. [Lloyd] was allowed to testify as to his fear of the victim and as to the events leading up to culminating in the shooting of the victim.\n\n\u00b6 16 Lloyd then appealed from the trial court's decision, which this court denied. State v. Lloyd, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2013-09-080 (Mar. 24, 2014) (Accelerated Calendar Judgment Entry). Lloyd then appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, which once\nagain denied review. *State v. Lloyd*, 139 Ohio St.3d 1482, 2014-Ohio-3195.\n\n\u00b6 17 On November 4, 2014, the Fourth District Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the Ross County Court of Common Pleas dismissing Lloyd's petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus, wherein Lloyd claimed his conviction and sentence were illegal because he was indicted based on the unlawful testimony of his wife during the grand jury proceedings. *Lloyd v. Robinson*, 4th Dist. Ross No. 14CA3452, 2014-Ohio-4977. Shortly thereafter, on March 31, 2015, the Fourth District Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the Ross County Court of Common Pleas dismissing Lloyd's second, successive petition seeking a writ of habeas corpus, wherein Lloyd claimed his conviction was unlawful and against the manifest weight of the evidence because of judicial misconduct, prosecutorial misconduct, and the ineffective assistance of trial counsel. *Lloyd v. Robinson*, 4th Dist. Ross No. 14CA3462, 2015-Ohio-1331. The Ohio Supreme Court denied review of both decisions. *Lloyd v. Robinson*, 142 Ohio St.3d 1450, 2015-Ohio-1591; and *Lloyd v. Robinson*, 143 Ohio St.3d 1419, 2015-Ohio-2911.\n\n\u00b6 18 On April 6, 2015, Lloyd filed a motion for re-sentencing alleging his sentence was void, wherein he challenged the trial court's order requiring him to pay restitution, court costs, and other fees. Three days later, on April 9, 2015, the trial court issued a decision vacating its order requiring Lloyd to pay court costs, court-appointed counsel fees, and other fees upon finding it had \"declined to find [Lloyd] has or is reasonably expected to have the means to pay the financial sanctions ***.\" The trial court's decision, however, did not make any reference to its prior order requiring Lloyd to pay restitution.\n\n\u00b6 19 Lloyd then appealed from the trial court's decision arguing the trial court erred by not also vacating the trial court's order requiring him to pay restitution. This court agreed upon finding the trial court \"acknowledged that it did not intend to order Lloyd to pay any financial sanctions,\" including any order of restitution. *State v. Lloyd*, 12th Dist. Warren No.\nThis court, therefore, vacated the trial court's order requiring Lloyd to pay restitution. Apparently not satisfied with this court's decision, Lloyd appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, which again denied review. *State v. Lloyd*, 146 Ohio St.3d 1427, 2016-Ohio-4606.\n\nOn October 15, 2015, Lloyd filed another motion for re-sentencing alleging his sentence was void, wherein he challenged the trial court's imposition of a mandatory five-year term of postrelease control. The state, acknowledging that a defendant's conviction of murder is not subject to postrelease control, agreed that the trial court erred by advising Lloyd he would be subject to a mandatory five-year postrelease control term if he were ever released from prison. As a result, on December 16, 2015, the trial court issued a decision ordering \"any reference to post-release control be deleted from the sentencing entry.\"\n\nOn May 18, 2017, Lloyd moved the trial court to issue an amended sentencing entry that properly \"memorialize[d] the sentence in one single document for compliance of Ohio Law.\" Thereafter, on June 28, 2017, the trial court issued an amended and corrected judgment entry of sentence that contained no references to restitution, court costs, fees, or postrelease control. Lloyd then appealed from the trial court's amended and corrected judgment entry of sentence, raising the following five assignments of error for review.\n\nAssignment of Error No. 1:\n\nTHE LOWER COURT COMMITTED PREJUDICIAL ERROR IN IGNORING THE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE.\n\nAssignment of Error No. 2:\n\nTHE COURT COMMITTED PREJUDICIAL ERROR IN IGNORING THE CASTLE DOCTRINE.\n\nAssignment of Error No. 3:\n\nTHE LOWER COURT COMMITTED PREJUDICIAL ERROR IN ALLOWING\nPROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT.\n\n{\u00b6 28} Assignment of Error No. 4:\n\n{\u00b6 29} APPELLANT WAS DEPRIVED OF EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL.\n\n{\u00b6 30} Assignment of Error No. 5:\n\n{\u00b6 31} APPELLANT WAS DEPRIVED OF A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL TRIAL.\n\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b6 32} In his five assignments of error, Lloyd challenges many aspects of his bench trial from which the trial court found him guilty of murder with an attendant firearm specification. In support, Lloyd claims the trial court erred by not finding he had acted in self-defense and by not applying the \"castle doctrine\" to the case at bar. Lloyd also claims his conviction must be reversed due to alleged prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of trial counsel, both of which resulted in him being deprived of a fair and impartial trial. Lloyd's claims, however, are all barred by the doctrine of res judicata since he could have, and in most cases actually did, raise these issues as part of his direct appeal and subsequent motions and petitions before the trial court.\n\n{\u00b6 33} As this court has stated previously, the doctrine of res judicata provides that \"a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or an appeal from the judgment.\" State v. Wagers, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2011-08-007, 2012-Ohio-2258, \u00b6 10, citing State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 1996-Ohio-337 (1996). Res judicata, however, does not apply to a void sentence for a void sentence may be reviewed at any time. State v. Vancleve, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2016-06-039, 2016-Ohio-7546, \u00b6 15.\nAfter a thorough review of the record, we find no error in the trial court's handling of this matter that would render Lloyd's conviction or sentence void. The doctrine of res judicata, therefore, is clearly applicable to the case at bar. In so holding, we note that Lloyd appealed from the trial court's amended and corrected judgment entry of sentence. As the record plainly reveals, that entry merely removed references to restitution, court costs, fees, and postrelease control in accordance with this and the trial court's various rulings. As noted by the state, and with which we agree, such an entry does not provide Lloyd with the unfettered opportunity to challenge any error that he believes may have occurred prior to trial, during trial, or post trial. Rather, as noted by the Ohio Supreme Court, although the doctrine of res judicata does not preclude review of a void sentence, \"res judicata still applies to other aspects of the merits of a conviction, including the determination of guilt and the lawful elements of the ensuing sentence.\" State v. Fischer, 128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, \u00b6 40. Lloyd's claim otherwise lacks merit.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn light of the foregoing, because the doctrine of res judicata clearly applies to the case at bar, Lloyd's five assignments of error are without merit and overruled.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nHENDRICKSON and M. POWELL, JJ., concur."}

Argued: Stephanie R. Anderson.  \nOn brief: Blake Law Firm Co., LLC, and Dustin M. Blake, for \nappellant. Argued: Dustin M. Blake. \n  \nAPPEAL from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas \nBRUNNER, J. \n{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Javier Armengau, appeals an amended judgment entry \nof the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas entered into the record on March 28, 2018 \nfollowing a resentencing held on March 27, 2018.  This judgment entry issued pursuant to \na remand from this Court for resentencing on Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17 and for imposing an \nappropriate tier sex-offender classification.  Because Armengau already served the 30-\nmonth sentence imposed for the sexual battery incident underlying Count 15, the trial court \nerred in resentencing when it denied credit for time already served in connection with that \nconduct and, by its statements, appeared to rely on the sentencing package doctrine in \npreserving the prior term of imprisonment and without reference to the sentencing \nrequirements of Title 29 of the Ohio Revised Code, when it required Armengau to serve a \n48-month consecutive sentence for Count 15.  We therefore sustain, in part, Armengau's \nfirst assignment of error and remand to the trial court for resentencing on Count 15.  No. 18AP-300  2 \nBecause Counts 15 and 18 were based on separate incidents, the trial court did not err by \nfailing to merge them.  Thus, we overrule Armengau's second assignment of error.  \nArmengau's remaining arguments under his third assignment of error are foreclosed as res \njudicata and law of the case. \nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{\u00b6 2} We have previously recounted the facts and procedural history of this case in \ndetail.  State v. Armengau, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-679, 2017-Ohio-4452, \u00b6 2-52.  Suffice it to \nsay, Armengau was indicted for 18 counts as a result of allegations from women whom he \nencountered in the course of his practice as a criminal defense attorney.  Id. at \u00b6 3.  He was \nacquitted of 9 counts but was ultimately convic ted, following a lengthy jury trial, of one \ncount of public indecency (Count 2), 2 counts of gross sexual imposition (Counts 3 and 8), \none count of rape (Count 10), one count of kidnapping (Count 14), and 4 counts of sexual \nbattery (Counts 15 through 18).  (July 7, 2014 Verdict Forms.)  Counts 2 and 3 (public \nindecency and gross sexual imposition) concerned one victim, C.C.; Count 8 (the other \ngross sexual imposition charge) concerned another victim, K.R.; and the remaining Counts \n10, 14, and 15 through 18 concerned a third victim, L.M.  (May 20, 2013 Indictment.) \n{\u00b6 3} In sentencing Armengau, the trial court merged Counts 10 and 15, reasoning \nthat the sexual battery underlying Count 15 was not separate from the rape underlying \nCount 10.  (Aug. 28, 2014 Jgmt. Entry at 2.)  It then sentenced Armengau to 15 months on \neach of the gross sexual imposition counts, 9 years for rape, 4 years for kidnapping, and 30 \nmonths on each of the three remaining sexual battery counts (16 through 18).  Id. at 3.  All \ncounts were to be served concurrently with the others except for the kidnapping (Count 14), \nwhich the trial court ordered Armengau to serve consecutively to the rape (Count 10).  Id.  \nAs a result, the court sentenced Armengau to a total of 13 years in prison.  Id.  The trial court \nalso found Armengau to be a Tier III sex offender and notified him accordingly.  Id. at 1-2.  \nIn a separate entry, the trial court sentenced Armengau to 30 days that were time served \non the public indecency count.  (Aug. 28, 2014 Misdemeanor Entry.) \n{\u00b6 4} In Armengau's direct appeal, he raised and we addressed nine assignments \nof error: \n[I.] The trial court erred in permitting the amendment of the \nindictment and bill of particulars, which even after amendment \nremained duplicative and lacked the requisite specificity. That \nerror, along with the State's own confusion regarding the No. 18AP-300  3 \nrelevant conduct underlying these counts, resulted in \nviolations to Mr. Amengau's [sic] rights to due process of law, \na fair trial, jury unanimity, and the double jeopardy protections \nto which he was entitled. Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth \nAmendments, United States Constitution; Article I, Sections 10 \nand 16, Ohio Constitution; Crim.R. 31(A). \n[II.] Mr. Armengau's rights to due process and a fair trial were \nviolated when the trial court allowed the State to present \nirrelevant, cumulative, overly prejudicial evidence about prior \nbad acts through additional non-victim witnesses, whose \ntestimony also violated the Ohio Rape Shield Statute, as well as \ntestimony of hundreds of unindicted offenses. \n[III.] The trial court erred when it imposed separate sentences \nfor offenses that arose from the same conduct, were not \ncommitted separately or with a separate animus, had a similar \nimport, and should have been merged for sentencing purposes \nunder R.C. 2941.25. \n[IV.] The prosecutors' misconduct denied Mr. Armengau a fair \ntrial and due process of law, in violation of his Fifth, Sixth, and \nFourteenth Amendment rights under the United States \nConstitution, Article I, Sections 10 and 16, of the Ohio \nConstitution, and R.C. 2901.05. \n[V.] Javier Armengau was deprived of his constitutional right \nto the effective assistance of counsel. Fifth, Sixth, and \nFourteenth Amendments, United States Constitution; Article I, \nSection 10 and 16, Ohio Constitution. \n[VI.] The trial court erred in denying Javier Armengau's \nCrim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, and violated his rights to due \nprocess and a fair trial when, in the absence of sufficient \nevidence, it convicted him of counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18. \n[VII.] The trial court erred in denying Javier Armengau's \nCrim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, and violated his rights to due \nprocess and a fair trial when, in the absence of sufficient \nevidence, it convicted him of counts 3 and 8. \n[VIII.] The trial court violated Javier Armengau's \nconstitutional right to be free from retroactive laws. \n[IX.] The trial court violated Javier Armengau's right to due \nprocess and a fair trial through cumulative error. \nArmengau, 2017-Ohio-4452, at \u00b6 53, in passim. No. 18AP-300  4 \n{\u00b6 5} In that decision, a divided panel of this Court recognized a number of \nproblems with Armengau's trial, including a mid-trial amendment to the indictment to \nchange the location and times of the offenses, many instances in which evidence was \nintroduced regarding unindicted immoral conduct, and misconduct by the prosecution in \nemploying a closing that capitalized on the improperly admitted \"other bad acts\" evidence \nto essentially argue that there were so many accusers that Armengau must have done \nsomething.  Id. a t  \u00b6  5 4 - 6 1 ,  6 8 - 7 7 ,  8 1 - 9 4 .   U l t i m a t e l y ,  h o w e v e r ,  a  m a j o r i t y  o f  t h e  p a n e l  \nconcluded that the jury had followed the trial court's limiting instructions and the mixed \nverdict (nearly one-half of the charges were acquittals) showed that the jury had been able \nto appropriately weigh the evidence as to each offense.  Id. at \u00b6 72, 76, 85-86, 92, 94, but cf. \nid. at \u00b6 141-43 (Tyack, J., dissenting) (commenting that \"a great deal of prejudicial evidence \nwas placed before the jury and then the prosecution was permitted to argue that even \nthough some of the evidence was utterly incredible, there was so much of it that Armengau \nmust be guilty of something\"). \n{\u00b6 6} The panel in Armengau's first appeal found that the trial court had erred by \nfailing to merge Counts 10 and 14 (rape and kidnapping) and by merging the wrong sexual \nbattery count (Count 15) with the rape rather than the correct sexual battery count (Count \n17).  Id. at \u00b6 122-30.  It also found that the trial court had erred in retroactively applying to \nArmengau the Adam Walsh Act changes to Ohio's sex offender laws.  Id. at \u00b6 131-34.  This \nCourt ordered that Armengau's case be \"remanded for resentencing as to Counts 10, 14, 15, \nand 17. The court will vacate ap pellant's Tier III sex offender classification and apply the \nsex offender classification under the law in effect at the time of the offenses for which he \nwas convicted.\"  Id. at \u00b6 136. \n{\u00b6 7} On remand, the parties engaged in considerable motions practice on the \nmerits of the case, including sentencing memoranda, a motion for a new trial, and a motion \nto dismiss the counts to be resentenced based on the argument that Armengau was to be \nresentenced on unindicted and insufficiently supported counts.  (Sept. 19, 2017 Second \nMot. for New Trial; Jan. 16, 2018 Mot. to Dismiss; Mar. 26, 2018 Armengau's Sentencing \nMemo.)  Regarding sentencing, the State noted that this Court remanded only for a new sex \noffender classification and for limited resentencing as to Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17.  (Mar. 26, \n2018 State's Sentencing Memo. at 1.)  The State also argued that \"the sentencing package No. 18AP-300  5 \ndoctrine\" permitted the trial court \" 'to resentence [Armengau] on all counts to effectuate \nits previous intent .' \"  (Emphasis added by State' s Memo.) (Mar. 26, 2018 State's \nSentencing Memo. at 3, quoting State v. Jackson, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-698, 2004-Ohio-\n1005.)1 \n{\u00b6 8} At the resentencing hearing, the trial court declined a defense motion to \nengage in factfinding in regard to what specific incident formed the basis for each count.  \n(Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 15-16, 29-30, filed June 4, 2018.)  In addition, despite \ndefense arguments that sexual battery counts in Counts 15 and 18 should merge because \nthe incidents were indistinguishable, the trial court indicated that they were separate \nincidents and declined to merge them.  (Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 33-43.)  As \nrequired by this Court, however, the trial court merged the kidnapping count (Count 14) \nwith the rape count (Count 10), and exchanged the sexual battery counts, merging Count \n17 with Count 10 rather than Count 15.  (Mar. 28, 2018 Am. Jgmt. Entry at 4-5.)  The trial \ncourt recognized that all previously imposed sentences would \"remain in full force and \n[e]ffect\" but stated that it would like to impose a total of 13 years in order to be \"consistent\" \nwith the original trial judge's sentencing.  Id. at 5; Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 30, 33.  \nIt therefore sentenced Armengau to 48 months on the sexual battery in Count 15 and \nordered Armengau to serve that sentence consecutively to the 9 years imposed in Count 10.  \n(Mar. 28, 2018 Am. Jgmt. Entry at 4-5; Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 30-33.) \n{\u00b6 9} Armengau now appeals. \nII. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR \n{\u00b6 10} Armengau raises three assignments of error for review: \n[1.] APPELLANT WAS DENIED HIS RIGHT TO DUE \nPROCESS, NOTICE OF THE SPECIFIC CHARGE AND HIS \nRIGHT TO FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS AS GUARANTEED \nBY THE OHIO CONSTITUTION AND THE FIFTH, SIXTH \nAND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT[S] TO THE UNITED \nSTATES CONSTITUTION WHEN HE WAS RESENTENCED \nON COUNTS 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, AND 18 AND WHEN HE WAS \n                                                   \n1 The Supreme Court of Ohio explicitly rejected the sentencing package doctrine two years after Jackson was \ndecided, thereby implicating its reliability for future use by the  courts of this state.  Jackson; State v. Saxon, \n109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus (\"A sentence is the sanction or \ncombination of sanctions imposed for each separate, individual offense.  [] The sentencing-package doctrine \nhas no applicability to Ohio sentencing laws: the sentencing court may not employ the doctrine when \nsentencing a defendant and appellate courts may not utilize the doctrine when reviewing a sentence or \nsentences.\"); see also State v. Wilson, 129 Ohio St.3d 214, 2011-Ohio-2669, \u00b6 16. No. 18AP-300  6 \nRESENTENCED ON COUNT 15 TO A CONSECUTIVE TERM \nOF IMPRISONMENT TO COUNT 10. \n[2.] THE TRIAL COURT'S FAILURE TO MERGE COUNTS 15 \nAND 18 FOR SENTENCING VIOLATED R.C. 2941.25 \nAND/OR R.C. 2929.14 AND APPELLANT'S RIGHTS UNDER \nTHE DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AND \nFOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES \nCONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE I, SECTION 10 OF THE \nOHIO CONSTITUTION. \n[3.] APPELLANT WAS DENIED HIS RIGHT TO DUE \nPROCESS, DOUBLE JEOPARDY, NOTICE OF THE SPECIFIC \nCHARGE AND HIS RIGHT TO FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS \nAS GUARANTEED BY THE OHIO CONSTITUTION AND \nTHE FIFTH, SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT[S] \nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION WHEN HE WAS \nTRIED, SENTENCED AND RESENTENCED FOR \nUNCHARGED AND UNNOTICED CONDUCT AND \nCONVICTED UPON INSUFFI CIENT EVIDENCE THAT \nRESULTED FROM DEFECTIVE JURY INSTRUCTIONS, \nPROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT AND IMPROPER \nINTRODUCTION OF OTHER-ACT EVIDENCE. \n(Citations omitted.) \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. First Assignment of Error \u2013 Whether the Trial Court Erred in Imposing \nSentence on Count 15 and in Ordering that Sentence to be Served \nConsecutively to Count 10 \n{\u00b6 11} Armengau argues that the trial court erred at his original sentencing in 2014 \nby confusing the count numbers (rather than the underlying conduct) when it merged \nCount 15 rather than 17 and sentenced him to serve 30 months on Count 17.  (Armengau's \nBrief at 4-12.)  Because the error was not in how the trial court chose to substantively punish \nhis conduct, but rather an accidental \"flip\" of numerical designation, and because \nArmengau completed the 30-month sentence associated with the conduct (albeit under the \nwrong count number), he argues that it is not now appropriate for the trial court to have \nimposed a new sentence for the same conduct.  Id. at 8.  We partially agree. \n{\u00b6 12} The Fifth Amendment forbids punishing an offender twice for the same \noffense and thus requires that credit for all time served in relation to an offense must be \nawarded when an offender is resentenced for that same offense.  North Carolina v. Pearce, No. 18AP-300  7 \n395 U.S. 711, 717-19 (1969) (distinguished and limited on other grounds by Alabama v. \nSmith, 490 U.S. 794, 802-03 (1989)2).  As the United States Supreme Court states it, \"the \nconstitutional guarantee against multiple punishments for the same offense absolutely \nrequires that punishment already exacted must be fully 'credited' in imposing sentence \nupon a new conviction for the same offense.\"  (Footnote omitted.) Pearce at 718-19; State \nv. Christian, ___ Ohio St.3d. ___, 2020-Ohio-828, \u00b6 24. \n{\u00b6 13} Our prior decision on direct appeal made clear that Count 15 was based on \nfacts related to a sexual incident in Armengau's white truck, whereas Count 17 was based \non the coerced fellatio that formed the basis for the rape charge in Count 10 (as well as the \nkidnapping charge in Count 14).  Armengau, 2017-Ohio-4452, at \u00b6 128-29.  The trial court \nerred, however, when it switched the count numbers (15 and 17) and merged Count 15 \n(which had nothing to do with Count 10) rather than merging Count 17 (which arose from \nthe same conduct as Count 10).  Id. at \u00b6 129.  In other words, while Armengau was not \ntechnically sentenced on Count 15 (since it had improperly merged with Count 10), he was \nsentenced for the conduct underlying Count 15 when he was sentenced for what the 2014 \nsentencing court mistakenly referred to as Count 17. \n{\u00b6 14} At the time of his resentencing on March 27, 2018, Armengau had served \n13653 days in prison (more than 45 months).  That is well in excess of the 30 concurrent \nmonths to which he was sentenced for all the incidents of sexual battery, including the \nconduct in the white truck.  (Tr. at 4055-59.)4  While the counts charged are an important \ncomponent of criminal sentencing, one of the fundamental purposes of sentencing is to \nserve as society's response to the \"conduct\" of offenders.  See, e.g., R.C. 2929.11(A) \nthrough(B); R.C. 2929.12(A) through (C).  Th e provisions of Chapte r 2929 of the Ohio \nRevised Code, \"PENALTIES AND SENTENCING,\" refer sentencing courts to consideration \n                                                   \n2 Contrary to some overbroad statements in other jurisdictions, Smith did not overrule Pearce itself; it only \noverruled Simpson v. Rice, which was decided with Pearce.  Smith, 490 U.S. at 802-03; c ompare State v. \nCarnahan, 3d Dist. No. 4-15-18, 2016-Ohio-3213, \u00b6 11, fn. 1; State v. Donahue, 6th Dist. No. WD-05-025, \n2006-Ohio-1117, \u00b6 8 (stating that Pearce was overruled by Smith) with State v. Price, 8th Dist. No. 103023, \n2016-Ohio-591, \u00b6 20 (recognizing that Pearce was merely limited by Smith); see also State v. Hall, 10th Dist. \nNo. 09AP-302, 2009-Ohio-5712, \u00b6 14-16 (recognizing Pearce's continuing vitality despite limitations imposed \nin subsequent cases).  Specifically, Smith limited the Pearce presumption of vindictiveness, noting that it \nwould not apply in cases \"where a second sentence imposed after a trial is heavier than a first sentence \nimposed after a guilty plea,\" and stating, \"we overrule Simpson v. Rice, supra, to that extent.\" Smith at 803.  \nThe circumstances of Rice are not present in this case and thus we apply Pearce. \n3 August 26, 2014 through March 27, 2018 plus 56 days of jail credit. \n4 Trial transcript filed on July 9, 2015 in 19 consecutively paginated volumes. No. 18AP-300  8 \nof the offender's \"conduct\" no fewer than 25 times.  R.C. 2929.01 et seq.  While we recognize \nthat Armengau was technically not sentenced on Count 15 in his original sentencing, to \npermit Armengau to be resentenced to a new term of imprisonment for the same underlying \nconduct without credit for the time already served simply because of an error in designating \nthe appropriate count number, would be, at a minimum, to elevate form far above \nsubstance. \n{\u00b6 15} The Constitution permitted Armengau to be punished once for the conduct \nthat underlay Count 15 (but which the trial court originally mistakenly referred to as Count \n17).  Pearce, 395 U.S. at 717-19; Holdcroft, 2013-Ohio-5014, at \u00b6 14, 18, paragraph three of \nthe syllabus.  And he was.  He was sentenced to 30 concurrent months, which he more than \nserved in full.  On resentencing, the 30 months should have been credited against whatever \nsentence was reimposed for the count relating to the sexual battery in the white truck (by \nwhatever number it is called).  See accord Christian, 2020-Ohio-828, at \u00b6 24. \n{\u00b6 16} We note that, in Christian, the original sentence had been for Counts 2 and 3 \nof the indictment in that case to be served concurrently to the sentence for Count 5.  When \nresentencing on remand, the trial court ordered Christian to serve the sentence on Count 2 \nconsecutive to Count 5.  The Supreme Court found that Christian was entitled to have the \ntime she served simultaneously on both counts credited toward both of her new sentences \non those counts. \n{\u00b6 17} Armengau argues that, on remand, the trial court should have been entirely \nforbidden from sentencing him on Count 15 because he already served the 30 months that \nwere imposed for the conduct. (Armengau's Brief at 4-12.)  However, the expectation of \nfinality in a sentence that prevents resentencing for the same offense does not mature until \nthe direct appeal is concluded or the time to appeal has expired.  Christian at \u00b6 16-18; State \nv. Roberts, 119 Ohio St.3d 294, 2008-Ohio-3835, \u00b6 16 .  Thus, only after direct appeal is \nconcluded or the time to appeal has expired does it become true that \"[a] trial court does \nnot have the authority to resentence a defendant * * * after the defendant has already served \nthe prison term for that offense.\"  Holdcroft at \u00b6 14, 18, paragraph three of the syllabus; see \nalso Christian at \u00b6 15; State v. Raber , 134 Ohio St.3d 350, 2012-Ohio-5636, \u00b6 24-26.  \nArmengau directly appealed his case in 2014 and obtained a partial reversal and remand \nfor resentencing on Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17. See Armengau, 2017-Ohio-4452.  On remand, No. 18AP-300  9 \nthe trial court resentenced on those counts and this appeal is a direct appeal from that \np r o c e e d i n g .   I n  o t h e r  w o r d s ,  A r m e n g a u  i s  still (concerning Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17) \npursuing a direct appeal and those counts are still not final.  Thus, on resentencing, the trial \ncourt was entitled to resentence Armengau on those counts. \n{\u00b6 18} In addition to not crediting Armengau with time already served, the trial \ncourt sentenced Armengau on Count 15 to a consecutive sentence of 48 months because of \nan expressed desire for the entire sentencing package to be \"consistent\" with the total term \nof imprisonment imposed by the original sentencing judge.  (Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing \nTr. at 30, 33, 61.)  Having reviewed the sentencing transcript, we note that the trial court \nfollowed the State's recommendation and adopted \"the sentencing package doctrine.\" \n(Mar. 26, 2018 State's Sentencing Memo. at 3; Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 8-9.)  The \n\" 'sentencing package' doctrine, [is] a federal doctrine that requires the court to consider \nthe sanctions imposed on multiple offenses as the components of a single, comprehensive \nsentencing plan.\"  State v. Saxon, 109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, \u00b6 5.  But, contrary \nto the State's assertions, \"[t]he sentencing-package doctrine has no applicability to Ohio \nsentencing laws: the sentencing court may not employ the doctrine when sentencing a \ndefendant and appellate courts may not utilize the doctrine when reviewing a sentence or \nsentences.\" Id. at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus; see also State v. Wilson, 129 Ohio \nSt.3d 214, 2011-Ohio-2669, \u00b6 16. \n{\u00b6 19} Not only has the sentencing package doctrine been repudiated, but the trial \ncourt's expressed rationale, to conform the sentence to the term of imprisonment imposed \nby the prior judge in the case, is not an appropriate consideration for imposing sentence in \nOhio pursuant to Title 29 of the Ohio Revised Code.  See, e.g., R.C. 2929.11 through 2929.14.  \nMoreover, while the trial court paraphrased the statutory language of R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) \nwhen imposing consecutive sentences, it did not mention any fact about the case that \nconvinced it that consecutive service was necessary for the sexual battery conduct when it \nhad not been before.  (Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 32.)  The trial court declined to \neven designate the factual basis for the charges underlying Armengau's convictions.  Id. at \n29-30.  Essentially, the record indicates that the trial judge's sentence on Count 15 was \ndesigned to conform to the total term the prior judge in the case had imposed before we No. 18AP-300  10 \nreversed in a subsequent appeal involving other issues. Armengau, 2017-Ohio-4452. \n(Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 30, 33, 61.)  That was error. \n{\u00b6 20} Armengau's first assignment of error is sustained in part.  When resentencing \non Count 15, the trial court should have credited Armengau for time already served in \nconnection with the conduct underlying the offense and should not have used the \nsentencing package doctrine to effectuate the prior sentencing judge's intent in lieu of the \nTitle 29 sentencing provisions including giving a factual basis for the new consecutive \nsentence pursuant to Christian. \nB. Second Assignment of Error \u2013 Whether the Trial Court Erred by Failing \nto Merge Counts 15 and 18 \n{\u00b6 21} The Ohio statute on allied offenses provides as follows: \n(A) Where the same conduct by [the] defendant can be \nconstrued to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar \nimport, the indictment or information may contain counts for \nall such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only \none. \n(B) Where the defendant's conduct constitutes two or more \noffenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in \ntwo or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed \nseparately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment \nor information may contain counts for all such offenses, and \nthe defendant may be convicted of all of them. \nR.C. 2941.25. \n{\u00b6 22} The Supreme Court of Ohio has explained how to apply this statute: \nUnder R.C. 2941.25(B), a defendant whose conduct supports \nmultiple offenses may be convicted of all the offenses if any one \nof the following is true: (1) the conduct constitutes offenses of \ndissimilar import, (2) the conduct shows that the offenses were \ncommitted separately, or (3) the conduct shows that the \noffenses were committed with separate animus. \nState v. Ruff, 143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015-Ohio-995, paragraph three of the syllabus.  Whether \noffenses were \"committed separately\" is self-explanatory, but the Supreme Court has \ndefined \"dissimilar import\" as follows: \nTwo or more offenses of dissimilar import exist within the \nmeaning of R.C. 2941.25(B) when the defendant's conduct \nconstitutes offenses involving separate victims or if the harm \nthat results from each offense is separate and identifiable. No. 18AP-300  11 \nRuff at paragraph two of the syllabus.  The Court has also defined \"animus\" as \"purpose, \nintent, or motive.\"  Newark v. Vazirani, 48 Ohio St.3d 81, 84 (1990) 5, quoting State v. \nBlankenship, 38 Ohio St.3d 116, 119 (1988)  (Whiteside, J., concurring); see also Black's \nLaw Dictionary 107 (10th Ed.2014) (defining \"animus\" in relevant part as \"[i]ntention\").  \nThe determination of whether or not offenses are allied offenses of similar import is \nreviewed de novo.  State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 482, 2012-Ohio-5699, \u00b6 26-28. \n{\u00b6 23} According to the amended bill of particulars and the trial court's reasoning \nduring the resentencing hearing, Counts 15 and 18 concerned two different incidents of \ncoercive intercourse in Armengau's white truck.  (June 22, 2014 Am. Bill of Particulars at \n3-4; Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing at 33-43.)  Our prior decision also recognized that L.M. \ntestified to two instances of coercive intercourse in Armengau's white truck six months \napart in 2000 or 2001.  Armengau, 2017-Ohio-4452, at \u00b6 34.  In short, the trial court's \ndecision not to merge Count 15 with 18 is supported by facts in the record showing that the \noffenses were \"committed separately.\"  Ruff at paragraph three of the syllabus. \n{\u00b6 24} We overrule Armengau's second assignment of error. \nC. Third Assignment of Error \u2013 Res Judicata and Law of the Case \n{\u00b6 25} In his third assignment of error, it appears Armengau seeks to relitigate \n(through his resentencing appeal) the merits of the underlying convictions themselves.  \n(Armengau's Brief at 26-52.)  He argues that venue was not proved as to each charge as \nalleged in the indictment, that the indictments were improperly amended, effectively \ndenying him the right to presentment, and that the illegal introduction of other act \nevidence, erroneous jury instructions, and prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair \ntrial.  Id.  These issues could have been (and, for the most part, were) previously reviewed \nand resolved in Armengau's original direct appeal.  Armengau, 2017-Ohio-4452, at \u00b6 53, in \npassim; see also State v. Jackson, 141 Ohio St.3d 171, 2014-Ohio-3707, \u00b6 92; State v. Breeze, \n10th Dist. No. 15AP-1027, 2016-Ohio-1457, \u00b6 7-9.  While this Court recognized several \nserious problems with Armengau's trial, a majority of the panel (over a strongly worded \ndissent) ultimately concluded that the court's instructions and the jury's mixed verdict \n                                                   \n5 Note, Vazirani was overruled on other grounds by State v. Rance, 85 Ohio St.3d 632, 637 (1999) which has, \nitself, been overruled by a line of cases culminating in Ruff.  See State v. Johnson, 128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-\nOhio-6314; State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 482, 2012-Ohio-5699; Ruff, 2015-Ohio-995.  Despite the many \nrevisions of allied offenses law, there is no indication that the Supreme Court has altered the definition of \n\"animus.\" No. 18AP-300  12 \nshowed that the jury process had been sound and that the trial, as a whole, had not been \nunfair.  Armengau, 2017-Ohio-4452, at \u00b6 54-61, 68-77, 81-94; see also id. at \u00b6 141-43 \n(Tyack, J., dissenting).  Those findings now bind this Court.  Even the fact that these \narguments are foreclosed as law of the case and res judicata is, itself, res judicata.  See State \nv. Armengau, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-276, 2019-Ohio-1010, \u00b6 18, in passim (holding that all \nof these issues have been previously litigated to resolution and noting that Armengau was \nagain raising the same issues in this case, 18AP-300). \n{\u00b6 26} Armengau's third assignment of error is overruled. \nIV. CONCLUSION \n{\u00b6 27} Counts 15 and 18 concerned separate sexual incidents involving Armengau's \nwhite truck and thus the trial court did not err in refusing to merge those counts.  The \narguments raised in Armengau's third assignment of error are not substantively considered \nbecause their resolutions are res judicata and are now the law of the case.  Accordingly, we \noverrule Armengau's second and third assignments of error.  However, because the trial \ncourt should have credited Armengau for time already served in connection with the \nconduct underlying Count 15 and should not have used the sentencing package doctrine in \nlieu of the statutory sentencing provisions of Title 29 of the Revised Code, we sustain in \npart and overrule in part Armengau's first assignment of error.  We remand the matter to \nthe Franklin County Court of Common Pleas for resentencing on Count 15.  In all other \nrespects, we affirm. \nJudgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and \nremanded for resentencing. \nBROWN, J., concurs. \nNELSON, J., concurs in part and dissents in part. \n \nNELSON, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part. \n{\u00b6 28} I agree with the majority that Mr. Armengau's second and third assignments \nof error are not well taken.  And I agree, too,  that the trial court was authorized\u2014indeed, \nrequired\u2014to sentence Mr. Armengau on Count 15 (for the first time) pursuant to our earlier \nremand.  Contrary to Mr. Armengau's arguments, the trial court did have jurisdiction to \nsentence on that count, and was authorized by law to impose a consecutive, four-year \nsentence for that sexual battery.  I disagree, however, with what I take to be the majority's \nsuggestion that Mr. Armengau already has served time specifically attributable to that No. 18AP-300  13 \nnewly sentenced offense.  Rather, I think that the 30 months served on Count 17, which was \nto have been served concurrently with Count 10 in the first instance, should apply even now \nagainst that nine-year sentence on Count 10 (into which Count 17 has merged).  \nAdditionally, I note that the trial court did make the factual findings required in order to \nhave Count 15 run consecutively with Count 10, and I read the judge's references to the \nearlier sentence as being by way of explaining that she was not seeking vindictively to see \nthe original aggregate sentence \"increased.\"  See March 27, 2018 Sentencing Transcript at \n33 (\"It could have been increased\").  Because I would not \"partially\" sustain \nMr. Armengau's first assignment of error, or rewrite it, I respectfully dissent to that limited \ndegree.  Compare \u00b6 11 above. \n{\u00b6 29} As a preliminary matter, simply lest there be any doubt from the majority's \nrecitation of facts and procedural history, I note that an earlier panel of this court did \nuphold the jury determinations of guilt that relate to the sentencing matters now at issue \nhere.  See State v. Armengau, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-679, 2017-Ohio-4452 (\"Armengau II,\" \nwith this appeal being \"Armengau V\"), discretionary appeal not allowed, 151 Ohio St.3d \n1511, 2018-Ohio-365.  And those findings of guilt reflect the victimization of multiple \nwomen who turned to lawyer Armengau in times of desperate need:  a mother who had \nhired Mr. Armengau to represent her son in a criminal case, id. at \u00b6 6; a young woman who \nherself was a criminal defendant and who testified that she had spurned his advances, id. \nat \u00b6 28; and \"an immigrant from Venezuela with limited English\" and a young daughter, \nwho sought immigration and divorce advice, id. at \u00b6 31.  It is this last victim, \"L.M.,\" who \nwas the object of the rape/kidnapping and sexual battery offenses for which Armengau II \nordered resentencing (Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17): she testified to various incidents over a \nperiod of years, \"always under the implied threat that if [lawyer Armengau] dropped her \ncase she would lose her immigration status and custody of her daughter,\"  see id. at \u00b6 34.  \nThe nature of these crimes does not and should not alter the legal principles involved here, \nbut it can appropriately inform certain aspects of sentencing consistent with the law; \nfurther, there may be a more felicitous way to refer to these victims than \"women whom \n[Mr. Armengau] encountered in the course of his practice as a criminal defense attorney,\" \nsee \u00b6 2 above.   No. 18AP-300  14 \n{\u00b6 30} In any event, I do not believe it correct to say that Mr. Armengau had \"already \nserved the 30-month sentence imposed for the sexual battery incident underlying Count \n15,\" compare \u00b6 1 above, when in accordance with Armengau II he was sentenced on that \ncount for the first time in the entry now under review.  In my view, Mr. Armengau was not \nsentenced on Count 15 at his 2014 hearing; that sexual battery count incorrectly was \nmerged into the Count 10 rape conviction regarding a different incident.  Armengau II \nrecognized that the merged Counts 10, 14, and 17 related to \"oral sex in appellant's Marion \noffice,\" id. at \u00b6 128, while Count 15 related to one of two incidents, six months apart, in \nwhich Mr. Armengau \"drove L.M. in a white truck * * * to a rural field where he forced her \nto have vaginal sex,\" see id. at \u00b6 34, 129; see also, e.g., June 22, 2014 [Second] Amended \nBill of Particulars at 4 (alleging lawyer's threats to L.M., in this context, that she would lose \nher daughter and be deported if she did not succumb).  As the majority notes, the other \n\"different incident[] of coercive intercourse in Armengau's white truck\" was reflected by \nCount 18, as to which we did not order resentencing.  See \u00b6 23 above.  Our remand for \nresentencing on Count 15, therefore, imposed no limitation beyond the constraints of \nstatute: as in State v. Busby, 10th Dist. No. 09AP-1119, 2010-Ohio-4516, \u00b6 6, \"[t]hat \ndecision did not limit the trial court's sentencing discretion or prohibit the trial court, on \nremand, from imposing consecutive sentences on appellant.\"    \n{\u00b6 31} The majority acknowledges that \"[Mr.] Armengau was technically not \nsentenced on Count 15\" until the resentencing.  \u00b6 14 above.  It argues, however, that while \nserving part of his rape sentence, Mr. Armengau did serve the concurrently and improperly \nsentenced 30-months on Count 17 (a different sexual battery, tied into \"the same conduct \nas Count 10,\" id. at \u00b6 13), and that the trial court in 2014 had intended that sanction to be \nfor \"the conduct underlying Count 15,\" id.; therefore, the majority says that we must treat \nthe time served on Count 17 as having been served on Count 15 lest we \"elevate form far \nabove substance,\" id. at \u00b6 14, by allowing Mr. Armengau to be punished twice for the \" 'same \noffense,' \" id. at \u00b6 12 (quoting Pearce).  (The majority does not speculate, nor would it \nmatter, how the original trial judge might have sentenced on Count 15 had he (1) properly \nidentified its nature at sentencing, and (2) properly understood that the kidnapping and \nrape counts needed to merge rather than being run concurrently.)   No. 18AP-300  15 \n{\u00b6 32} Neither the majority nor Mr. Armengau offers any direct precedent that \nsubstitutes underlying \"conduct\" for \"offense\" in this context, or that otherwise reads \nsentencing principles to foreclose resentencing on a count not previously sentenced.  I have \nnot found any either.  Here, he is not serving any additional time for \"a new conviction on \nthe same [Count 17] offense,\" see Christian at \u00b6 24.  It seems to me that if hypothetically \nthere had been only two sentenced counts, Count 10 and Count 17, with time on each to be \nserved concurrently (as originally was the case), and after the (shorter) Count 17 time had \nbeen served we ruled that the count was for an allied offense and needed to be merged into \nCount 10 (with its preexisting longer sentence), the time on Count 10 would not be reduced \nby double-counting the earlier time from Count 17.  There wouldn't be a new sentence on \nCount 10 against which to credit that time; the hypothetical defendant would just have the \none sentence, against which all aggregate time served would run.  I don't believe that the \nresentencing on Count 10 (to the same nine-year term) changes that assessment.  I do not \nthink that the Christian counting issue is implicated because the 30 months on old Count 17 \nalways came off the time served on Count 10, into which it now has been merged, and \nbecause Mr. Armengau never served time on Count 15, on which he is newly sentenced.  \nAnd while aggregate calculations might be different if, for example, Mr. Armengau had \nserved any additional time on Count 14, as now merged along with Count 17 into Count 10, \nthat's not what happened here.   \n{\u00b6 33} Our earlier remand instructed, among other things, that the trial court's \nresentence of Mr. Armengau was to include (non-merged) Count 15.  And the trial court \nneeded to impose a sentence on that count, and resentence on Count 10, before any \ndetermination could be made as to whether the sentence on that count and the sentence on \nCount 10 should run concurrently or consecutively. Ohio's detailed (and, yes, highly \nformalized) \"felony-sentencing scheme is clearly designed to focus the judge's attention on \none offense at a time. * * * * [It] makes no provision for grouping offenses together and \nimposing a single, 'lump' sentence for multiple felonies. * * * * Only after the judge has \nimposed a separate prison term for each offense may the judge then consider in [his or her] \ndiscretion whether the offender should serve those terms concurrently or consecutively.\"  \nState v. Saxon, 109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, \u00b6 8-9 (emphasis added).   No. 18AP-300  16 \n{\u00b6 34} Mr. Armengau has argued in a different context (urging that the two separate \n\"white truck\" sexual battery Counts 15 and 18 should have merged) that, \"the trial court \nafter remand and in resentencing on Count 15 was sentencing on that count for the first \ntime therefore opening up a new [merger] issue not previously litigated.\"  Appellant's Reply \nBrief at 10.  That point, it seems to me, holds true at least for the question of the length of \nthe sentence on Count 15 and whether or not it could run consecutively with the term \nimposed for Count 10.  Compare State v. Shabazz, 8th Dist. No. 104635, 2017-Ohio-2984, \n\u00b6 11 (\"because the felonious assault charge pertaining to [one of the victims] had previously \nbeen merged as an allied offense to the aggravated murder count, that count was being \naddressed for the first time at resentencing\").  And the trial court's 48-month sentence on \nCount 15 was within the statutory range for such third-degree felonies and not inconsistent \nwith the purposes and principles of sentencing.  \n{\u00b6 35} So this is not a case in which a defendant is being deprived of jail-time credit \nfor additional time served in connection with an allied offense that should have merged.  \nUnder the trial court's judgment, Mr. Armengau was to be credited with every day he spent \nincarcerated; the earlier concurrent sentence on Count 17 did not add to the time on which \nhe was sentenced for any other count, and the days he has served would count against the \n13-year total of the various sentences. \n{\u00b6 36} In sum, I do not find merit in the particular constitutional claims that are the \nbasis for Mr. Armengau's first assignment of error.  And I do not believe that we ought to \nrewrite his assignment. \n{\u00b6 37} Further, I note that the trial court did on resentencing make the findings \nrequired to permit consecutive sentences.  Assuredly, the sentence as to each count must \nbe assessed on its own to ensure that it is legal and appropriate for the particular offense.  \nThe trial court resentenced Mr. Armengau with regard to the four counts that we specified, \nmerging Counts 14 (kidnapping) and 17 (the related sexual battery) into Count 10 (rape) \nconsistent with our instructions, and imposing a separate sentence on the separate \nCount 15 sexual battery, as it also was required by our remand to do.  The trial court then \nalso considered whether the sentences on Coun ts 10 and 15 should run concurrently or \nconsecutively. No. 18AP-300  17 \n{\u00b6 38} Unlike sentencing determinations for individual counts, decisions as to \nwhether sentences should run consecutively or concurrently are by definition and necessity \nmade with reference to the different counts under consideration.  \"If multiple prison terms \nare imposed on an offender for convictions of multiple offenses, the court may require the \noffender to serve the prison terms consecutively if the court finds that the consecutive \nservice is necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender and \nthat consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender's \nconduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public, and if the court also\" makes at \nleast one of three additional findings, including that \"the harm caused by two or more of \nthe multiple offenses * * * committed [as part of one or more courses of conduct] was so \ngreat or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of any \nof the courses of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender's conduct.\"  \nR.C. 2929.14(C)(4). These concepts involving necessity, and disproportionality, and \nadequacy require the sentencing court to consider sums of years on various counts rather \nthan simply to consider individual sentences in a vacuum.  That is a calculus in which the \ninitial sentencing court engaged (in deciding to run consecutively the rape and kidnapping \ncounts that should have merged) and in which, with a different judge on the bench, it \nengaged on resentencing (in deciding, after correctly merging the counts as to which \nconsecutive sentences previously had been imposed, to run prison time on the newly \nsentenced sexual battery count consecutive to prison time on the separate and factually very \ndistinct rape count).  \n{\u00b6 39} The \"consecutive sentence [was] necessary,\" the resentencing court said, \"to \nprotect the public from future crimes or to punish the offender.  Consecutive sentences are \nnot disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and the danger the \noffender poses to the public.  And the offender's history of criminal conduct demonstrates \nthat consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the \noffender.  Given the nature of these offenses and the position that you [Mr. Armengau] were \nin when you committed them and the people whom they were committed against, this Court \ncertainly finds that a consecutive sentence is appropriate in this case.\"  March 27, 2018 \nResentencing Transcript at 32.  No. 18AP-300  18 \n{\u00b6 40} The majority decision does not challenge those findings as statutorily \ninsufficient to support the consecutive sentences. It does say that \"while the trial court \nparaphrased the statutory language of R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) when imposing consecutive \nsentences, it did not mention any fact about the case that convinced it that consecutive \nservice was necessary for the sexual battery conduct when it had not been before.\"  \u00b6 19 \nabove. But no additional factfinding was required by law in order to impose the consecutive \nsentences.  See, e.g., State v. Bonnell, 140 Ohio St.3d 209, 2014-Ohio-3177, \u00b6 27 (\"no statute \ndirects a sentencing court to give or state reasons supporting its decision to impose \nconsecutive sentences\" after it makes the findings set out in R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)).  And the \nsubstance of the trial court's consecutive sentence findings have ample support in the \nrecord. \n{\u00b6 41} I would overrule the three assignments of error and affirm the trial court's \njudgment in full.  I therefore concur with the majority to the extent that it affirms that \njudgment, and respectfully dissent to the extent that it does not. \n  \n ", "case_juv": "0", "case_crim": "0", "case_2001": "0", "case_app": "0", "case_pros": "0", "aoe_none": "0", "aoe_grandjury": "0", "aoe_court": "0", "aoe_defense": "0", "aoe_procbar": "1", "aoe_prochist": "0", "case_timeframe": "0", "other": "216    0\nName: other, dtype: int64", "olmocr_text": "IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\nTENTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\nState of Ohio, : No. 18AP-300\nPlaintiff-Appellee, : (C.P.C.

Blake.\n\nAPPEAL from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas\n\nBRUNNER, J.\n\n{\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Javier Armengau, appeals an amended judgment entry of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas entered into the record on March 28, 2018 following a resentencing held on March 27, 2018. This judgment entry issued pursuant to a remand from this Court for resentencing on Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17 and for imposing an appropriate tier sex-offender classification. Because Armengau already served the 30-month sentence imposed for the sexual battery incident underlying Count 15, the trial court erred in resentencing when it denied credit for time already served in connection with that conduct and, by its statements, appeared to rely on the sentencing package doctrine in preserving the prior term of imprisonment and without reference to the sentencing requirements of Title 29 of the Ohio Revised Code, when it required Armengau to serve a 48-month consecutive sentence for Count 15. We therefore sustain, in part, Armengau's first assignment of error and remand to the trial court for resentencing on Count 15.\nBecause Counts 15 and 18 were based on separate incidents, the trial court did not err by failing to merge them. Thus, we overrule Armengau's second assignment of error. Armengau's remaining arguments under his third assignment of error are foreclosed as res judicata and law of the case.\n\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b6 2 We have previously recounted the facts and procedural history of this case in detail. State v. Armengau, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-679, 2017-Ohio-4452, \u00b62-52. Suffice it to say, Armengau was indicted for 18 counts as a result of allegations from women whom he encountered in the course of his practice as a criminal defense attorney. Id. at \u00b63. He was acquitted of 9 counts but was ultimately convicted, following a lengthy jury trial, of one count of public indecency (Count 2), 2 counts of gross sexual imposition (Counts 3 and 8), one count of rape (Count 10), one count of kidnapping (Count 14), and 4 counts of sexual battery (Counts 15 through 18). (July 7, 2014 Verdict Forms.) Counts 2 and 3 (public indecency and gross sexual imposition) concerned one victim, C.C.; Count 8 (the other gross sexual imposition charge) concerned another victim, K.R.; and the remaining Counts 10, 14, and 15 through 18 concerned a third victim, L.M. (May 20, 2013 Indictment.)\n\n\u00b6 3 In sentencing Armengau, the trial court merged Counts 10 and 15, reasoning that the sexual battery underlying Count 15 was not separate from the rape underlying Count 10. (Aug. 28, 2014 Jgmt. Entry at 2.) It then sentenced Armengau to 15 months on each of the gross sexual imposition counts, 9 years for rape, 4 years for kidnapping, and 30 months on each of the three remaining sexual battery counts (16 through 18). Id. at 3. All counts were to be served concurrently with the others except for the kidnapping (Count 14), which the trial court ordered Armengau to serve consecutively to the rape (Count 10). Id. As a result, the court sentenced Armengau to a total of 13 years in prison. Id. The trial court also found Armengau to be a Tier III sex offender and notified him accordingly. Id. at 1-2. In a separate entry, the trial court sentenced Armengau to 30 days that were time served on the public indecency count. (Aug. 28, 2014 Misdemeanor Entry.)\n\n\u00b6 4 In Armengau's direct appeal, he raised and we addressed nine assignments of error:\n\n[I.] The trial court erred in permitting the amendment of the indictment and bill of particulars, which even after amendment remained duplicative and lacked the requisite specificity. That error, along with the State's own confusion regarding the\nrelevant conduct underlying these counts, resulted in violations to Mr. Amengau's [sic] rights to due process of law, a fair trial, jury unanimity, and the double jeopardy protections to which he was entitled. Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments, United States Constitution; Article I, Sections 10 and 16, Ohio Constitution; Crim.R. 31(A).\n\n[II.] Mr. Armengau's rights to due process and a fair trial were violated when the trial court allowed the State to present irrelevant, cumulative, overly prejudicial evidence about prior bad acts through additional non-victim witnesses, whose testimony also violated the Ohio Rape Shield Statute, as well as testimony of hundreds of unindicted offenses.\n\n[III.] The trial court erred when it imposed separate sentences for offenses that arose from the same conduct, were not committed separately or with a separate animus, had a similar import, and should have been merged for sentencing purposes under R.C. 2941.25.\n\n[IV.] The prosecutors' misconduct denied Mr. Armengau a fair trial and due process of law, in violation of his Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution, Article I, Sections 10 and 16, of the Ohio Constitution, and R.C. 2901.05.\n\n[V.] Javier Armengau was deprived of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments, United States Constitution; Article I, Section 10 and 16, Ohio Constitution.\n\n[VI.] The trial court erred in denying Javier Armengau's Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, and violated his rights to due process and a fair trial when, in the absence of sufficient evidence, it convicted him of counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18.\n\n[VII.] The trial court erred in denying Javier Armengau's Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, and violated his rights to due process and a fair trial when, in the absence of sufficient evidence, it convicted him of counts 3 and 8.\n\n[VIII.] The trial court violated Javier Armengau's constitutional right to be free from retroactive laws.\n\n[IX.] The trial court violated Javier Armengau's right to due process and a fair trial through cumulative error.\n\nArmengau, 2017-Ohio-4452, at \u00b6 53, in passim.\nIn that decision, a divided panel of this Court recognized a number of problems with Armengau's trial, including a mid-trial amendment to the indictment to change the location and times of the offenses, many instances in which evidence was introduced regarding unindicted immoral conduct, and misconduct by the prosecution in employing a closing that capitalized on the improperly admitted \"other bad acts\" evidence to essentially argue that there were so many accusers that Armengau must have done something. *Id.* at \u00b6 54-61, 68-77, 81-94. Ultimately, however, a majority of the panel concluded that the jury had followed the trial court's limiting instructions and the mixed verdict (nearly one-half of the charges were acquittals) showed that the jury had been able to appropriately weigh the evidence as to each offense. *Id.* at \u00b6 72, 76, 85-86, 92, 94, *but cf.* *id.* at \u00b6 141-43 (Tyack, J., dissenting) (commenting that \"a great deal of prejudicial evidence was placed before the jury and then the prosecution was permitted to argue that even though some of the evidence was utterly incredible, there was so much of it that Armengau must be guilty of something\").\n\nThe panel in Armengau's first appeal found that the trial court had erred by failing to merge Counts 10 and 14 (rape and kidnapping) and by merging the wrong sexual battery count (Count 15) with the rape rather than the correct sexual battery count (Count 17). *Id.* at \u00b6 122-30. It also found that the trial court had erred in retroactively applying to Armengau the Adam Walsh Act changes to Ohio's sex offender laws. *Id.* at \u00b6 131-34. This Court ordered that Armengau's case be \"remanded for resentencing as to Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17. The court will vacate appellant's Tier III sex offender classification and apply the sex offender classification under the law in effect at the time of the offenses for which he was convicted.\" *Id.* at \u00b6 136.\n\nOn remand, the parties engaged in considerable motions practice on the merits of the case, including sentencing memoranda, a motion for a new trial, and a motion to dismiss the counts to be resentenced based on the argument that Armengau was to be resentenced on unindicted and insufficiently supported counts. (Sept. 19, 2017 Second Mot. for New Trial; Jan. 16, 2018 Mot. to Dismiss; Mar. 26, 2018 Armengau's Sentencing Memo.) Regarding sentencing, the State noted that this Court remanded only for a new sex offender classification and for limited resentencing as to Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17. (Mar. 26, 2018 State's Sentencing Memo. at 1.) The State also argued that \"the sentencing package\ndoctrine\" permitted the trial court \"to resentence [Armengau] on all counts to effectuate its previous intent.' \" (Emphasis added by State's Memo.) (Mar. 26, 2018 State's Sentencing Memo. at 3, quoting State v. Jackson, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-698, 2004-Ohio-1005.)\n\n\u00b6 8 At the resentencing hearing, the trial court declined a defense motion to engage in factfinding in regard to what specific incident formed the basis for each count. (Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 15-16, 29-30, filed June 4, 2018.) In addition, despite defense arguments that sexual battery counts in Counts 15 and 18 should merge because the incidents were indistinguishable, the trial court indicated that they were separate incidents and declined to merge them. (Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 33-43.) As required by this Court, however, the trial court merged the kidnapping count (Count 14) with the rape count (Count 10), and exchanged the sexual battery counts, merging Count 17 with Count 10 rather than Count 15. (Mar. 28, 2018 Am. Jgmt. Entry at 4-5.) The trial court recognized that all previously imposed sentences would \"remain in full force and effect\" but stated that it would like to impose a total of 13 years in order to be \"consistent\" with the original trial judge's sentencing. Id. at 5; Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 30, 33. It therefore sentenced Armengau to 48 months on the sexual battery in Count 15 and ordered Armengau to serve that sentence consecutively to the 9 years imposed in Count 10. (Mar. 28, 2018 Am. Jgmt. Entry at 4-5; Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 30-33.)\n\n\u00b6 9 Armengau now appeals.\n\nII. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n\u00b6 10 Armengau raises three assignments of error for review:\n\n[1.] APPELLANT WAS DENIED HIS RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS, NOTICE OF THE SPECIFIC CHARGE AND HIS RIGHT TO FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS AS GUARANTEED BY THE OHIO CONSTITUTION AND THE FIFTH, SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT[S] TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION WHEN HE WAS RESENTENCED ON COUNTS 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, AND 18 AND WHEN HE WAS\n\n---\n\n1 The Supreme Court of Ohio explicitly rejected the sentencing package doctrine two years after Jackson was decided, thereby implicating its reliability for future use by the courts of this state. Jackson; State v. Saxon, 109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus (\"A sentence is the sanction or combination of sanctions imposed for each separate, individual offense. [] The sentencing-package doctrine has no applicability to Ohio sentencing laws: the sentencing court may not employ the doctrine when sentencing a defendant and appellate courts may not utilize the doctrine when reviewing a sentence or sentences.\"); see also State v. Wilson, 129 Ohio St.3d 214, 2011-Ohio-2669, \u00b6 16.\nRESENTENCED ON COUNT 15 TO A CONSECUTIVE TERM OF IMPRISONMENT TO COUNT 10.\n\n[2.] THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S FAILURE TO MERGE COUNTS 15 AND 18 FOR SENTENCING VIOLATED R.C. 2941.25 AND/OR R.C. 2929.14 AND APPELLANT\u2019S RIGHTS UNDER THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAUSE OF THE FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE I, SECTION 10 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION.\n\n[3.] APPELLANT WAS DENIED HIS RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS, DOUBLE JEOPARDY, NOTICE OF THE SPECIFIC CHARGE AND HIS RIGHT TO FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS AS GUARANTEED BY THE OHIO CONSTITUTION AND THE FIFTH, SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT[S] TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION WHEN HE WAS TRIED, SENTENCED AND RESENTENCED FOR UNCHARGED AND UNNOTICED CONDUCT AND CONVICTED UPON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT RESULTED FROM DEFECTIVE JURY INSTRUCTIONS, PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT AND IMPROPER INTRODUCTION OF OTHER-ACT EVIDENCE.\n\n(Citations omitted.)\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\nA. First Assignment of Error \u2013 Whether the Trial Court Erred in Imposing Sentence on Count 15 and in Ordering that Sentence to be Served Consecutively to Count 10\n\n{\u00b6 11} Armengau argues that the trial court erred at his original sentencing in 2014 by confusing the count numbers (rather than the underlying conduct) when it merged Count 15 rather than 17 and sentenced him to serve 30 months on Count 17. (Armengau\u2019s Brief at 4-12.) Because the error was not in how the trial court chose to substantively punish his conduct, but rather an accidental \"flip\" of numerical designation, and because Armengau completed the 30-month sentence associated with the conduct (albeit under the wrong count number), he argues that it is not now appropriate for the trial court to have imposed a new sentence for the same conduct. Id. at 8. We partially agree.\n\n{\u00b6 12} The Fifth Amendment forbids punishing an offender twice for the same offense and thus requires that credit for all time served in relation to an offense must be awarded when an offender is resentenced for that same offense. North Carolina v. Pearce,\n395 U.S. 711, 717-19 (1969) (distinguished and limited on other grounds by Alabama v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794, 802-03 (1989)\\(^2\\)). As the United States Supreme Court states it, \"the constitutional guarantee against multiple punishments for the same offense absolutely requires that punishment already exacted must be fully 'credited' in imposing sentence upon a new conviction for the same offense.\" (Footnote omitted.) Pearce at 718-19; State v. Christian, ___ Ohio St.3d. ___, 2020-Ohio-828, \u00b6 24.\n\n{\u00b6 13} Our prior decision on direct appeal made clear that Count 15 was based on facts related to a sexual incident in Armengau's white truck, whereas Count 17 was based on the coerced fellatio that formed the basis for the rape charge in Count 10 (as well as the kidnapping charge in Count 14). Armengau, 2017-Ohio-4452, at \u00b6 128-29. The trial court erred, however, when it switched the count numbers (15 and 17) and merged Count 15 (which had nothing to do with Count 10) rather than merging Count 17 (which arose from the same conduct as Count 10). Id. at \u00b6 129. In other words, while Armengau was not technically sentenced on Count 15 (since it had improperly merged with Count 10), he was sentenced for the conduct underlying Count 15 when he was sentenced for what the 2014 sentencing court mistakenly referred to as Count 17.\n\n{\u00b6 14} At the time of his resentencing on March 27, 2018, Armengau had served 1365\\(^3\\) days in prison (more than 45 months). That is well in excess of the 30 concurrent months to which he was sentenced for all the incidents of sexual battery, including the conduct in the white truck. (Tr. at 4055-59.)\\(^4\\) While the counts charged are an important component of criminal sentencing, one of the fundamental purposes of sentencing is to serve as society's response to the \"conduct\" of offenders. See, e.g., R.C. 2929.11(A) through(B); R.C. 2929.12(A) through (C). The provisions of Chapter 2929 of the Ohio Revised Code, \"PENALTIES AND SENTENCING,\" refer sentencing courts to consideration\n\n---\n\n\\(^2\\) Contrary to some overbroad statements in other jurisdictions, Smith did not overrule Pearce itself; it only overruled Simpson v. Rice, which was decided with Pearce. Smith, 490 U.S. at 802-03; compare State v. Carnahan, 3d Dist. No. 4-15-18, 2016-Ohio-3213, \u00b6 11, fn. 1; State v. Donahue, 6th Dist.

Specifically, Smith limited the Pearce presumption of vindictiveness, noting that it would not apply in cases \"where a second sentence imposed after a trial is heavier than a first sentence imposed after a guilty plea,\" and stating, \"we overrule Simpson v. Rice, supra, to that extent.\" Smith at 803. The circumstances of Rice are not present in this case and thus we apply Pearce.\n\n\\(^3\\) August 26, 2014 through March 27, 2018 plus 56 days of jail credit.\n\n\\(^4\\) Trial transcript filed on July 9, 2015 in 19 consecutively paginated volumes.\nof the offender's \"conduct\" no fewer than 25 times. R.C. 2929.01 et seq. While we recognize that Armengau was technically not sentenced on Count 15 in his original sentencing, to permit Armengau to be resentenced to a new term of imprisonment for the same underlying conduct without credit for the time already served simply because of an error in designating the appropriate count number, would be, at a minimum, to elevate form far above substance.\n\n\u00b6 15 The Constitution permitted Armengau to be punished once for the conduct that underlay Count 15 (but which the trial court originally mistakenly referred to as Count 17). Pearce, 395 U.S. at 717-19; Holdcroft, 2013-Ohio-5014, at \u00b6 14, 18, paragraph three of the syllabus. And he was. He was sentenced to 30 concurrent months, which he more than served in full. On resentencing, the 30 months should have been credited against whatever sentence was reimposed for the count relating to the sexual battery in the white truck (by whatever number it is called). See accord Christian, 2020-Ohio-828, at \u00b6 24.\n\n\u00b6 16 We note that, in Christian, the original sentence had been for Counts 2 and 3 of the indictment in that case to be served concurrently to the sentence for Count 5. When resentencing on remand, the trial court ordered Christian to serve the sentence on Count 2 consecutive to Count 5. The Supreme Court found that Christian was entitled to have the time she served simultaneously on both counts credited toward both of her new sentences on those counts.\n\n\u00b6 17 Armengau argues that, on remand, the trial court should have been entirely forbidden from sentencing him on Count 15 because he already served the 30 months that were imposed for the conduct. (Armengau's Brief at 4-12.) However, the expectation of finality in a sentence that prevents resentencing for the same offense does not mature until the direct appeal is concluded or the time to appeal has expired. Christian at \u00b6 16-18; State v. Roberts, 119 Ohio St.3d 294, 2008-Ohio-3835, \u00b6 16. Thus, only after direct appeal is concluded or the time to appeal has expired does it become true that \"[a] trial court does not have the authority to resentence a defendant *** after the defendant has already served the prison term for that offense.\" Holdcroft at \u00b6 14, 18, paragraph three of the syllabus; see also Christian at \u00b6 15; State v. Raber, 134 Ohio St.3d 350, 2012-Ohio-5636, \u00b6 24-26. Armengau directly appealed his case in 2014 and obtained a partial reversal and remand for resentencing on Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17. See Armengau, 2017-Ohio-4452. On remand,\nthe trial court resentenced on those counts and this appeal is a direct appeal from that proceeding. In other words, Armengau is still (concerning Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17) pursuing a direct appeal and those counts are still not final. Thus, on resentencing, the trial court was entitled to resentence Armengau on those counts.\n\n\u00b6 18 In addition to not crediting Armengau with time already served, the trial court sentenced Armengau on Count 15 to a consecutive sentence of 48 months because of an expressed desire for the entire sentencing package to be \"consistent\" with the total term of imprisonment imposed by the original sentencing judge. (Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 30, 33, 61.) Having reviewed the sentencing transcript, we note that the trial court followed the State's recommendation and adopted \"the sentencing package doctrine.\" (Mar. 26, 2018 State's Sentencing Memo. at 3; Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 8-9.) The \"sentencing package doctrine, [is] a federal doctrine that requires the court to consider the sanctions imposed on multiple offenses as the components of a single, comprehensive sentencing plan.\" State v. Saxon, 109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, \u00b6 5. But, contrary to the State's assertions, \"[t]he sentencing-package doctrine has no applicability to Ohio sentencing laws: the sentencing court may not employ the doctrine when sentencing a defendant and appellate courts may not utilize the doctrine when reviewing a sentence or sentences.\" Id. at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus; see also State v. Wilson, 129 Ohio St.3d 214, 2011-Ohio-2669, \u00b6 16.\n\n\u00b6 19 Not only has the sentencing package doctrine been repudiated, but the trial court's expressed rationale, to conform the sentence to the term of imprisonment imposed by the prior judge in the case, is not an appropriate consideration for imposing sentence in Ohio pursuant to Title 29 of the Ohio Revised Code. See, e.g., R.C. 2929.11 through 2929.14. Moreover, while the trial court paraphrased the statutory language of R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) when imposing consecutive sentences, it did not mention any fact about the case that convinced it that consecutive service was necessary for the sexual battery conduct when it had not been before. (Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 32.) The trial court declined to even designate the factual basis for the charges underlying Armengau's convictions. Id. at 29-30. Essentially, the record indicates that the trial judge's sentence on Count 15 was designed to conform to the total term the prior judge in the case had imposed before we\nreversed in a subsequent appeal involving other issues. *Armengau*, 2017-Ohio-4452. (Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing Tr. at 30, 33, 61.) That was error.\n\n\u00b6 20 Armengau's first assignment of error is sustained in part. When resentencing on Count 15, the trial court should have credited Armengau for time already served in connection with the conduct underlying the offense and should not have used the sentencing package doctrine to effectuate the prior sentencing judge's intent in lieu of the Title 29 sentencing provisions including giving a factual basis for the new consecutive sentence pursuant to *Christian*.\n\nB. Second Assignment of Error \u2013 Whether the Trial Court Erred by Failing to Merge Counts 15 and 18\n\n\u00b6 21 The Ohio statute on allied offenses provides as follows:\n\n(A) Where the same conduct by [the] defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.\n\n(B) Where the defendant's conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\n\nR.C. 2941.25.\n\n\u00b6 22 The Supreme Court of Ohio has explained how to apply this statute:\n\nUnder R.C. 2941.25(B), a defendant whose conduct supports multiple offenses may be convicted of all the offenses if any one of the following is true: (1) the conduct constitutes offenses of dissimilar import, (2) the conduct shows that the offenses were committed separately, or (3) the conduct shows that the offenses were committed with separate animus.\n\n*State v. Ruff*, 143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015-Ohio-995, paragraph three of the syllabus. Whether offenses were \"committed separately\" is self-explanatory, but the Supreme Court has defined \"dissimilar import\" as follows:\n\nTwo or more offenses of dissimilar import exist within the meaning of R.C. 2941.25(B) when the defendant's conduct constitutes offenses involving separate victims or if the harm that results from each offense is separate and identifiable.\nRuff at paragraph two of the syllabus. The Court has also defined \"animus\" as \"purpose, intent, or motive.\" Newark v. Vazirani, 48 Ohio St.3d 81, 84 (1990), quoting State v. Blankenship, 38 Ohio St.3d 116, 119 (1988) (Whiteside, J., concurring); see also Black's Law Dictionary 107 (10th Ed.2014) (defining \"animus\" in relevant part as \"[i]ntention\"). The determination of whether or not offenses are allied offenses of similar import is reviewed de novo. State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 482, 2012-Ohio-5699, \u00b6 26-28.\n\n{\u00b6 23} According to the amended bill of particulars and the trial court's reasoning during the resentencing hearing, Counts 15 and 18 concerned two different incidents of coercive intercourse in Armengau's white truck. (June 22, 2014 Am. Bill of Particulars at 3-4; Mar. 27, 2018 Resentencing at 33-43.) Our prior decision also recognized that L.M. testified to two instances of coercive intercourse in Armengau's white truck six months apart in 2000 or 2001. Armengau, 2017-Ohio-4452, at \u00b6 34. In short, the trial court's decision not to merge Count 15 with 18 is supported by facts in the record showing that the offenses were \"committed separately.\" Ruff at paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n{\u00b6 24} We overrule Armengau's second assignment of error.\n\nC. Third Assignment of Error \u2013 Res Judicata and Law of the Case\n\n{\u00b6 25} In his third assignment of error, it appears Armengau seeks to relitigate (through his resentencing appeal) the merits of the underlying convictions themselves. (Armengau's Brief at 26-52.) He argues that venue was not proved as to each charge as alleged in the indictment, that the indictments were improperly amended, effectively denying him the right to presentment, and that the illegal introduction of other act evidence, erroneous jury instructions, and prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial. Id. These issues could have been (and, for the most part, were) previously reviewed and resolved in Armengau's original direct appeal. Armengau, 2017-Ohio-4452, at \u00b6 53, in passim; see also State v. Jackson, 141 Ohio St.3d 171, 2014-Ohio-3707, \u00b6 92; State v. Breeze, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-1027, 2016-Ohio-1457, \u00b6 7-9. While this Court recognized several serious problems with Armengau's trial, a majority of the panel (over a strongly worded dissent) ultimately concluded that the court's instructions and the jury's mixed verdict\n\n---\n\n5 Note, Vazirani was overruled on other grounds by State v. Rance, 85 Ohio St.3d 632, 637 (1999) which has, itself, been overruled by a line of cases culminating in Ruff. See State v. Johnson, 128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314; State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 482, 2012-Ohio-5699; Ruff, 2015-Ohio-995. Despite the many revisions of allied offenses law, there is no indication that the Supreme Court has altered the definition of \"animus.\"\nshowed that the jury process had been sound and that the trial, as a whole, had not been unfair. *Armengau*, 2017-Ohio-4452, at \u00b6 54-61, 68-77, 81-94; see also id. at \u00b6 141-43 (Tyack, J., dissenting). Those findings now bind this Court. Even the fact that these arguments are foreclosed as law of the case and res judicata is, itself, res judicata. See *State v. Armengau*, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-276, 2019-Ohio-1010, \u00b6 18, in passim (holding that all of these issues have been previously litigated to resolution and noting that Armengau was again raising the same issues in this case, 18AP-300).\n\n\u00b6 26 Armengau's third assignment of error is overruled.\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 27 Counts 15 and 18 concerned separate sexual incidents involving Armengau's white truck and thus the trial court did not err in refusing to merge those counts. The arguments raised in Armengau's third assignment of error are not substantively considered because their resolutions are res judicata and are now the law of the case. Accordingly, we overrule Armengau's second and third assignments of error. However, because the trial court should have credited Armengau for time already served in connection with the conduct underlying Count 15 and should not have used the sentencing package doctrine in lieu of the statutory sentencing provisions of Title 29 of the Revised Code, we sustain in part and overrule in part Armengau's first assignment of error. We remand the matter to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas for resentencing on Count 15. In all other respects, we affirm.\n\n*Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for resentencing.*\n\nBROWN, J., concurs.\n\nNELSON, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.\n\nNELSON, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\u00b6 28 I agree with the majority that Mr. Armengau's second and third assignments of error are not well taken. And I agree, too, that the trial court was authorized\u2014indeed, required\u2014to sentence Mr. Armengau on Count 15 (for the first time) pursuant to our earlier remand. Contrary to Mr. Armengau's arguments, the trial court did have jurisdiction to sentence on that count, and was authorized by law to impose a consecutive, four-year sentence for that sexual battery. I disagree, however, with what I take to be the majority's suggestion that Mr. Armengau already has served time specifically attributable to that\nnewly sentenced offense. Rather, I think that the 30 months served on Count 17, which was to have been served concurrently with Count 10 in the first instance, should apply even now against that nine-year sentence on Count 10 (into which Count 17 has merged). Additionally, I note that the trial court did make the factual findings required in order to have Count 15 run consecutively with Count 10, and I read the judge's references to the earlier sentence as being by way of explaining that she was not seeking vindictively to see the original aggregate sentence \"increased.\" See March 27, 2018 Sentencing Transcript at 33 (\"It could have been increased\"). Because I would not \"partially\" sustain Mr. Armengau's first assignment of error, or rewrite it, I respectfully dissent to that limited degree. Compare \u00b6 11 above.\n\n\u00b6 29 As a preliminary matter, simply lest there be any doubt from the majority's recitation of facts and procedural history, I note that an earlier panel of this court did uphold the jury determinations of guilt that relate to the sentencing matters now at issue here. See State v. Armengau, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-679, 2017-Ohio-4452 (\"Armengau II,\" with this appeal being \"Armengau V\"), discretionary appeal not allowed, 151 Ohio St.3d 1511, 2018-Ohio-365. And those findings of guilt reflect the victimization of multiple women who turned to lawyer Armengau in times of desperate need: a mother who had hired Mr. Armengau to represent her son in a criminal case, id. at \u00b6 6; a young woman who herself was a criminal defendant and who testified that she had spurned his advances, id. at \u00b6 28; and \"an immigrant from Venezuela with limited English\" and a young daughter, who sought immigration and divorce advice, id. at \u00b6 31. It is this last victim, \"L.M.,\" who was the object of the rape/kidnapping and sexual battery offenses for which Armengau II ordered resentencing (Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17): she testified to various incidents over a period of years, \"always under the implied threat that if [lawyer Armengau] dropped her case she would lose her immigration status and custody of her daughter,\" see id. at \u00b6 34. The nature of these crimes does not and should not alter the legal principles involved here, but it can appropriately inform certain aspects of sentencing consistent with the law; further, there may be a more felicitous way to refer to these victims than \"women whom [Mr. Armengau] encountered in the course of his practice as a criminal defense attorney,\" see \u00b6 2 above.\nIn any event, I do not believe it correct to say that Mr. Armengau had \"already served the 30-month sentence imposed for the sexual battery incident underlying Count 15,\" compare \u00b6 1 above, when in accordance with Armengau II he was sentenced on that count for the first time in the entry now under review. In my view, Mr. Armengau was not sentenced on Count 15 at his 2014 hearing; that sexual battery count incorrectly was merged into the Count 10 rape conviction regarding a different incident. Armengau II recognized that the merged Counts 10, 14, and 17 related to \"oral sex in appellant's Marion office,\" id. at \u00b6 128, while Count 15 related to one of two incidents, six months apart, in which Mr. Armengau \"drove L.M. in a white truck *** to a rural field where he forced her to have vaginal sex,\" see id. at \u00b6 34, 129; see also, e.g., June 22, 2014 [Second] Amended Bill of Particulars at 4 (alleging lawyer's threats to L.M., in this context, that she would lose her daughter and be deported if she did not succumb). As the majority notes, the other \"different incident[] of coercive intercourse in Armengau's white truck\" was reflected by Count 18, as to which we did not order resentencing. See \u00b6 23 above. Our remand for resentencing on Count 15, therefore, imposed no limitation beyond the constraints of statute: as in State v. Busby, 10th Dist. No. 09AP-1119, 2010-Ohio-4516, \u00b6 6, \"[t]hat decision did not limit the trial court's sentencing discretion or prohibit the trial court, on remand, from imposing consecutive sentences on appellant.\"\n\nThe majority acknowledges that \"[Mr.] Armengau was technically not sentenced on Count 15\" until the resentencing. \u00b6 14 above. It argues, however, that while serving part of his rape sentence, Mr. Armengau did serve the concurrently and improperly sentenced 30-months on Count 17 (a different sexual battery, tied into \"the same conduct as Count 10,\" id. at \u00b6 13), and that the trial court in 2014 had intended that sanction to be for \"the conduct underlying Count 15,\" id.; therefore, the majority says that we must treat the time served on Count 17 as having been served on Count 15 lest we \"elevate form far above substance,\" id. at \u00b6 14, by allowing Mr. Armengau to be punished twice for the \"'same offense,' \" id. at \u00b6 12 (quoting Pearce). (The majority does not speculate, nor would it matter, how the original trial judge might have sentenced on Count 15 had he (1) properly identified its nature at sentencing, and (2) properly understood that the kidnapping and rape counts needed to merge rather than being run concurrently.)\nNeither the majority nor Mr. Armengau offers any direct precedent that substitutes underlying \"conduct\" for \"offense\" in this context, or that otherwise reads sentencing principles to foreclose resentencing on a count not previously sentenced. I have not found any either. Here, he is not serving any additional time for \"a new conviction on the same [Count 17] offense,\" see Christian at \u00b6 24. It seems to me that if hypothetically there had been only two sentenced counts, Count 10 and Count 17, with time on each to be served concurrently (as originally was the case), and after the (shorter) Count 17 time had been served we ruled that the count was for an allied offense and needed to be merged into Count 10 (with its preexisting longer sentence), the time on Count 10 would not be reduced by double-counting the earlier time from Count 17. There wouldn't be a new sentence on Count 10 against which to credit that time; the hypothetical defendant would just have the one sentence, against which all aggregate time served would run. I don't believe that the resentencing on Count 10 (to the same nine-year term) changes that assessment. I do not think that the Christian counting issue is implicated because the 30 months on old Count 17 always came off the time served on Count 10, into which it now has been merged, and because Mr. Armengau never served time on Count 15, on which he is newly sentenced. And while aggregate calculations might be different if, for example, Mr. Armengau had served any additional time on Count 14, as now merged along with Count 17 into Count 10, that's not what happened here.\n\nOur earlier remand instructed, among other things, that the trial court's resentencing of Mr. Armengau was to include (non-merged) Count 15. And the trial court needed to impose a sentence on that count, and resentencing on Count 10, before any determination could be made as to whether the sentence on that count and the sentence on Count 10 should run concurrently or consecutively. Ohio's detailed (and, yes, highly formalized) \"felony-sentencing scheme is clearly designed to focus the judge's attention on one offense at a time. * * * * [It] makes no provision for grouping offenses together and imposing a single, 'lump' sentence for multiple felonies. * * * * Only after the judge has imposed a separate prison term for each offense may the judge then consider in [his or her] discretion whether the offender should serve those terms concurrently or consecutively.\" State v. Saxon, 109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, \u00b6 8-9 (emphasis added).\nMr. Armengau has argued in a different context (urging that the two separate \"white truck\" sexual battery Counts 15 and 18 should have merged) that, \"the trial court after remand and in resentencing on Count 15 was sentencing on that count for the first time therefore opening up a new [merger] issue not previously litigated.\" Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 10. That point, it seems to me, holds true at least for the question of the length of the sentence on Count 15 and whether or not it could run consecutively with the term imposed for Count 10. Compare State v. Shabazz, 8th Dist. No. 104635, 2017-Ohio-2984, \u00b6 11 (\"because the felonious assault charge pertaining to [one of the victims] had previously been merged as an allied offense to the aggravated murder count, that count was being addressed for the first time at resentencing\"). And the trial court\u2019s 48-month sentence on Count 15 was within the statutory range for such third-degree felonies and not inconsistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing.\n\nSo this is not a case in which a defendant is being deprived of jail-time credit for additional time served in connection with an allied offense that should have merged. Under the trial court\u2019s judgment, Mr. Armengau was to be credited with every day he spent incarcerated; the earlier concurrent sentence on Count 17 did not add to the time on which he was sentenced for any other count, and the days he has served would count against the 13-year total of the various sentences.\n\nIn sum, I do not find merit in the particular constitutional claims that are the basis for Mr. Armengau\u2019s first assignment of error. And I do not believe that we ought to rewrite his assignment.\n\nFurther, I note that the trial court did on resentencing make the findings required to permit consecutive sentences. Assuredly, the sentence as to each count must be assessed on its own to ensure that it is legal and appropriate for the particular offense. The trial court resentenced Mr. Armengau with regard to the four counts that we specified, merging Counts 14 (kidnapping) and 17 (the related sexual battery) into Count 10 (rape) consistent with our instructions, and imposing a separate sentence on the separate Count 15 sexual battery, as it also was required by our remand to do. The trial court then also considered whether the sentences on Counts 10 and 15 should run concurrently or consecutively.\nUnlike sentencing determinations for individual counts, decisions as to whether sentences should run consecutively or concurrently are by definition and necessity made with reference to the different counts under consideration. \"If multiple prison terms are imposed on an offender for convictions of multiple offenses, the court may require the offender to serve the prison terms consecutively if the court finds that the consecutive service is necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender and that consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public, and if the court also\" makes at least one of three additional findings, including that \"the harm caused by two or more of the multiple offenses * * * committed [as part of one or more courses of conduct] was so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender's conduct.\" R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). These concepts involving necessity, and disproportionality, and adequacy require the sentencing court to consider sums of years on various counts rather than simply to consider individual sentences in a vacuum. That is a calculus in which the initial sentencing court engaged (in deciding to run consecutively the rape and kidnapping counts that should have merged) and in which, with a different judge on the bench, it engaged on resentencing (in deciding, after correctly merging the counts as to which consecutive sentences previously had been imposed, to run prison time on the newly sentenced sexual battery count consecutive to prison time on the separate and factually very distinct rape count).\n\nThe \"consecutive sentence [was] necessary,\" the resentencing court said, \"to protect the public from future crimes or to punish the offender. Consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and the danger the offender poses to the public. And the offender's history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender. Given the nature of these offenses and the position that you [Mr. Armengau] were in when you committed them and the people whom they were committed against, this Court certainly finds that a consecutive sentence is appropriate in this case.\" March 27, 2018 Resentencing Transcript at 32.\nThe majority decision does not challenge those findings as statutorily insufficient to support the consecutive sentences. It does say that \"while the trial court paraphrased the statutory language of R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) when imposing consecutive sentences, it did not mention any fact about the case that convinced it that consecutive service was necessary for the sexual battery conduct when it had not been before.\" \u00b6 19 above. But no additional factfinding was required by law in order to impose the consecutive sentences. See, e.g., State v. Bonnell, 140 Ohio St.3d 209, 2014-Ohio-3177, \u00b6 27 (\"no statute directs a sentencing court to give or state reasons supporting its decision to impose consecutive sentences\" after it makes the findings set out in R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)). And the substance of the trial court's consecutive sentence findings have ample support in the record.\n\nI would overrule the three assignments of error and affirm the trial court's judgment in full. I therefore concur with the majority to the extent that it affirms that judgment, and respectfully dissent to the extent that it does not."}

Relevant Factual Background \nThe Ohio Court of Appeals for the Eighth Appellate District set forth the following facts1 \non direct appeal: \n{\u00b6 3} The indictments resulted from a series of controlled drug buys, \noccurring on March 19, 2014 (Counts 1, 2, and 3, 26.4 grams \ncocaine); April 14, 2014 (Counts 4, 5, and 6, 27.6 grams cocaine); \nJune 10, 2014 (Counts 7, 8, and 9, 56.8 grams cocaine); and June \n20, 2014 (Counts 10, 11, and 12, 70.4 grams cocaine). Counts 13 \nand 14 are aggregate for the prior transactions. Counts 15, 16, and \n17 relate to a fifth controlled buy that took place on July 8, 2014, \ninvolving 11.9 grams of heroin. Counts 18, 19, and 20 arise from a \nJuly 15, 2014 controlled buy involving 12 grams of heroin. Counts \n21, 22, and 23 arise from a July 22, 2014 controlled buy invol ving \n27.6 grams of heroin. Counts 24, 25, and 26 arise from an August \n14, 2014 controlled buy involving 27.7 grams of heroin. Counts 27 \nand 28 are the aggregate counts for July 8, 2014, through August 14, \n2014, including major drug offender specifications (\u201cMDOs\u201d) under \nR.C. 2941.1410(A). \n \n{\u00b6 4} Codefendant and ex- girlfriend Tiffany Harmon (\u201cHarmon\u201d) \nwas charged in complicity with Count 1 and agreed to testify in \nexchange for a plea agreement. The jury trial was held in December \n2015. The trial court retained jurisdiction to determine the MDOs \nafter the jury's verdict. Codefendant Derek I. Woods (\u201cWoods\u201d) was \nfound not guilty of all charges. \n \n{\u00b6 5} Special agent Kirk Johns, Task Force Officers Luke Combs, \nand Michael Gardner were involved in the drug buys and testified \nregarding Makin's activities. The state drug task force utilized a \nconfidential \u201creliable\u201d informant (\u201cCI\u201d) to effect the transactions. \n \n{\u00b6 6} The CI would contact Makin and arrange the transaction. The \nmoney was copied prior to use in th e transaction and then given to \nthe CI, the state conducted a \u201ccursory search\u201d of the CI and the CI's \nvehicle prior to the meeting. The task force agent trailed the CI to \nthe meeting place where the event was recorded by audio, and/or \nvideo, and/or photographed. After the purchase, the CI met the task \nforce agent to turn over the drugs, and another \u201ccursory\u201d search of \n \n1 The facts found by the appellate court of record \u201cshall be presumed to be correct ,\u201d and \nthe petitioner has \u201cthe burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing \nevidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254(e)(1); Warren v. Smith, 161 F.3d 358, 360 -61 (6th Cir. 1998), cert. \ndenied, 527 U.S. 1040 (1999). \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  2 of 34.  PageID #: 19053 \n \nthe CI and the CI \u2019s vehicle was conducted. Harmon testified to \nparticipating in the first buy with Makin and the CI and that she \ncompleted the sale at Makin's direction. \n \n{\u00b6 7} The CI was recruited for assistance in 2014 after the CI\u2019s sale \nof drugs to task force members. The CI told the task force that Makin \nwas the CI's drug supplier. The CI would purchase, cut, and resell \nthe drugs. An agreement was executed by the CI containing the \nterms and conditions of his CI status. Trial testimony included a \ndetailed description of each controlled buy transaction. \n \n{\u00b6 8} Counts 14, 28, and the schoolyard specifications for Counts \n15 and 16 were dismissed pursuant to Crim.R. 29. The jury found \nMakin guilty of the remaining offenses. Makin was sentenced on the \nmajor drug specification to 11 years at the Lorain Correctional \nInstitution. He was also advised of postrelease control. This appeal \nensued. \n \nState v. Makin, 2017-Ohio-2649, \u00b6\u00b6 3-8.  \n \nIII. Relevant State Procedural History \n \nA. Indictment \nMakin was indicted on March 13, 2015, for: \nCounts 1, 4, 7, 10, 15: Trafficking, R.C. 2925.03(A)(1), felony of \nthe first-degree with Counts 1, 4, and 15 including a schoolyard \nspecification in violation of R.C. 2925.01(P); \n \nCounts 2, 5, 8, 11, 13, 16, 27: Trafficking, R.C. 2925.03(A)( 2), \nfelony of the first- degree with Counts 2, 5, and 16 including a \nschoolyard specification in violation of R.C. 2925.01(P); \n \nCount 3, 17, 20, 23, 26: Drug Possession, R.C. 2925.11(A), felony \nof the second-degree; \n \nCounts 6, 9, 12, 14, 28:  Drug Possession, R.C. 2925.11(A), felony \nof the first -degree with Count 14 including a major drug offender \nspecification in violation of R.C. 2941.1410(A); \n \nCounts 18, 21, 24: Trafficking, R.C. 2925.03(A)(1), felony of the \nsecond-degree; \n \nCounts 19, 22, 25: Trafficking, R.C. 2925.03(A)(2), felony of the \nsecond-degree;  \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  3 of 34.  PageID #: 19064 \n \n \n(ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 87-98). At arraignment, Makin pleaded not guilty to all charges. (ECF \nNo. 10-1, PageID #: 99). \nB. Trial and Guilty Verdict \nPrior to trial, Makin moved for an order requiring the prosecution to reveal any deals made \nwith cooperating witnesses for his/her assistance in the matter. (ECF No. 10 -1, PageID #: 100). \nThe trial court granted the order but required the government to produce such information only \nafter the jury was impaneled and sworn. (ECF No. 10- 1, PageID #: 101). The case proceeded to \ntrial. Makin moved for a Rule 29 acquittal, which the court granted as to Counts 14 and 18 and the \nschool-yard specifications on Counts 15 and 16. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 102). The government \ndismissed the school-yard specifications on Counts 4 and 5. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 105). The \njury found Makin guilty of all remaining charges and schoolyard specifications (on Counts 1 and \n2). (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 103-105). On December 4, 2015, Makin, pro se , filed a motion to \ndisqualify his counsel. (ECF No. 10 -1, PageID #: 106- 108). The trial court denied the motion. \n(ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 109). The trial court conducted a bench trial on the major drug offender \nspecification on December 8, 2015. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 105). On December 11, 2015, the \ncourt found Makin guilty of the major drug offender specification in Count 13. (ECF No. 10 -1, \nPageID #: 110).  On the same date, Makin was ordered to serve an aggregate sentence of eleven \nyears. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 113).  \n \nC. Direct Appeal \nOn appeal, represented by new counsel, Makin raised twelve assignments of error: \n1. The appellant was denied his right to a jury trial guaranteed by \nthe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution \nin determining the MDO specification. (Tr. 134-36).  \n \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  4 of 34.  PageID #: 19075 \n \n2. The appellant was denied due process of law and effective \nassistance of counsel when the trial court refused to order the \nState to provide an agreement with its key witness until the day \nof trial. (Tr. 86-90)  \n \n3. The Appellant was denied due process of law, a fair trial, and \neffective assistance of counsel because the court did not order \ndisclosure of an informant\u2019s identity. (Tr. 131)  \n \n4. The trial court erred by failing to give a correct accomplice \ntestimony jury instruction. R.C. 2923.03(D). (Tr. 1541)  \n \n5. The trial court erred by failing to give a comprehensive \ninstruction on informant testimony. (Tr. 1203; 1205; 1490; \n1491)  \n \n6. The trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that prior \nconvictions could be used to evaluate the credibility of a witness. \n(Tr. 1541; 1203; 1205)  \n \n7. Prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments deprived \nMr. Makin of a fair trial in violation of his rights under the Fifth, \nSixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \nConstitution and the corresponding provisions of the Ohio \nConstitution. (Tr. 1587)  \n \n8. The Appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel and \nwas not afforded his constitutional right to counsel pursuant to \nthe Sixth Amendment and due process and a fair trial pursuant \nto the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States \nConstitution. (Tr. 1541; 1203;1205)  \n \n9. The Appellant\u2019s convictions are against the weight of the \nevidence. (Tr. 1409; 1446)  \n \n10. The evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant of drug \npossession and drug trafficking. (Tr. 1409; 1446)  \n \n11. Appellant\u2019s rights to due process and equal protection under the \nOhio and United States Constitutions were violated when the \nState excluded an African-American juror without providing a \nsatisfactory race -neutral reason and without  the trial court \ncorrectly applying the law. (Tr. 148; 172-76; 290; 380;390)  \n \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  5 of 34.  PageID #: 19086 \n \n12. The trial court erred by aggregating the weight of the drugs in \nseparate counts to meet the major drug offender specification. \n(Tr. 136-37)  \n \n(ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 131- 132). On May 4, 2017, the Eighth District Court of Appeals \naffirmed the judgment of the trial court. State v. Makin, 2017-Ohio-2649, \u00b668. \nD. Appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court \nOn June 16, 2017, Makin timely filed a pro se  appeal notice in the Ohio Supreme Court. \n(ECF No. 10 -1, PageID #: 250).  Makin\u2019s memorandum in support of jurisdiction raised the \nfollowing propositions of law:  \nI. The Appellant was denied his right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth \nand Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in determining the \nMDO specifications. \n \nII. The Appellant was denied due process of law and effective assistance \nof counsel when the trial court refused to order the State to provide an \nagreement with its key witness until the day of trial. \n \nIII. The Appellant was denied due process of law, a fair trial, and effective \nassistance of counsel because the court did not order disclosure of an \ninformant\u2019s identity. \n \nIV. The trial court erred by failing to give a correct accomplice testimony \njury instruction, R.C. 2923.03(D). \n \nV. The trial court erred by failing to give a comprehensive instruction on \ninformation testimony (sic). \n \nVI. The trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that prior convictions \ncould be used to evaluate the credibility of a witness. \n \nVII. Prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments deprived Mr. Makin \nof a fair trial in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eight, (sic) \nand Fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution and the  \ncorresponding provisions of the Ohio Constitution. \nVIII. The Appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel and was not \nafforded his constitutional right to counsel pursuant to the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. \n \nIX. The Appellant\u2019s convictions are against the weight of the evidence. \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  6 of 34.  PageID #: 19097 \n \n \nX. The evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant of drug possession \nand trafficking. \n \nXI. Appellant\u2019s rights to due process and equal protection under the Ohio \nand United States Constitution were violated when the State excluded \nan African-American juror without providing a satisfactory race-neutral \nreason and without the trial court correctly applying the law. \n \nXII. The trial court erred by aggregating the weight of the drugs in separate \ncounts to meet the major drug offender specification. \n \n(ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 253- 254). On October 11, 2017, the Supreme Court of Ohio declined \nto accept jurisdiction of the appeal pursuant to S.C.Prac.R. 7.08(B)(4). (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: \n297).  \nE. Application for Reopening Appeal Pursuant to Appellate Rule 26(B) \nOn July 31, 2017, Makin filed an application to reopen his appeal pursuant to App. R. \n26(B). (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 298).  Makin claimed he received ineffective assistance of \nappellate counsel when counsel failed to raise the following assignments of error: \n1. Statutorily mandated terms required by law. The trial court\u2019s \nimposition of the terms was invalid because the court failed to notify \nappellant of all terms of statutory requirements. \n \n2. Appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to brief prosecutorial \nmisconduct regarding the prosecutor presenting fabricated evidence, \nin the form of an audio recording and unremittingly lying and \nmisleading the court and jury as well as assisting the C.I. John Hoyle \nin conveying a false testimony. \n \n3. Appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to brief that the trial \ncounsel was ineffective for failing to object to prosecutorial \nmisconduct in regards to the prosecutor presenting fabricated \nevidence, in the form of an audio recording, misleading and lying to \nthe Court and jury and assisting the C.I. John Hoyle in presenting \nperjured testimony as well as DEA agents. (\u201cThe essence of an \nineffective assistance claim is that counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors \nso upset the adversarial balance between defense and prosecution \nthat the trial was rendered unfair and the verdict rendered suspect.\u201d \nA strong presumption exists that counsel performed effectively. See \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  7 of 34.  PageID #: 19108 \n \nBerkey v. United States, 318 F.3d 768, 772 (7th Cir. 2003); Webb \nv. Lucas 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44548. \n \n(ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 300-307).  The government opposed the reopening of the appeal. (ECF \nNo. 10-1, PageID #: 308). Makin moved for leave to file a reply to the government\u2019s  opposition \nbrief, which the state Court of Appeals denied. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 316, 323). On November \n13, 2017, the Court of Appeals denied Makin\u2019s application to reopen his appeal. State v. Makin , \n2017-Ohio-8569, \u00b6 12. \nIV. Federal Habeas Corpus Petition \nOn July 5, 2018, Makin petitioned pro se that this Court issue a writ of habeas corpus. 2 \n(ECF No. 1). Makin asserted the following grounds for relief: \nGROUND ONE: Appellant was denied due process of law and effective \nassistance of counsel when the trial court refused to order the state to \nprovide agreement with key witness until trial day.   \nSupporting Facts : Prior to trial, defense counsel sought \ninformation about any agreement the State had with its key witness, an \ninformant. The trial court refused to order that this information be made \navailable until the day of trial. And even when the information was made \navailable it was generalized, and not specific. This delay obviously impeded \nthe ability of defense counsel to properly place issues before the jury as well \nas prepare a viable defense.   \n \nGROUND TWO: Appellant was denied due process of law, a fair trial, and \neffective assistance of counsel because the court did not order disclosure of \nan informants (sic) identity.   \nSupporting Facts: During pretrial discovery, the State arbitrarily \nmarked its discovery submissions as \u201ccounsel only\u201d. What made this \nprocedure problematic and prejudicial was that majority of the evidence was \naudio and video recordings allegedly reflecting Appellant\u2019s interaction with \n\u201cconfidential informant\u201d. Counsel never sha red any documents with \nappellant and counsel was also restricted from sharing the audio and video \nrecordings with Appellant. Defense counsel and Appellant was unable to \nprepare a defense before trial.   \n \n \n2 Makin asserts he placed his pro se  28 U.S.C. \u00a72254 habeas petition in the prison mail \nsystem on June 27, 2018. (ECF No. 1, PageID #: 19) \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  8 of 34.  PageID #: 19119 \n \nGROUND THREE: The trial court erred by failing to gi ve a correct \naccomplice testimony jury instruction, R.C. 2923.03(D)   \nSupporting Facts: Because \u201cmay affect her credibility\u201d is omitted \nin the jury instructions given to the jury and replaced in the sentence with \n\u201cmay affect her ability\u201d, the jurors were not instructed on the credibility \nissue and were confused. The specific jury instruction is mandated by the \nstatute.   \n \nGROUND FOUR: The trial court erred by failing to give a comprehensive \ninstruction on informants (sic) testimony.   \nSupporting Facts: It is clear that the jury was not alerted to 10  the \nspecial motives of an informant\u2019s testimony also factored with the lack of a \ngeneral credulity instruction.   \n \nGROUND FIVE: The appellant was denied the effective assistance of \ncounsel and fair trial.   \nSupporting Facts: Defense counsel failed to request an instruction \non accomplice testimony and witness credibility and also failed to object to \nthe prosecutors (sic) misconduct about the comments that were made during \nclosing argument and the fact that the prosecutor presented fabricated \nevidence and conveyed a false testimony as well as assisted the witness in \nconveying a false testimony.   \n \nGROUND SIX:3 [Prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments and \nthroughout trial deprived appellant of fair trial.] \nSupporting Facts: [Prosecutor stated during argument that defense \ncounsel\u2019s arguments were \u201claughable.\u201d The prosecutor also presented \nfabricated evidence in the form of an audio recording and conveyed a false \ntestimony and assisted the witness in conveying a false testimony at trial.] \n \nGROUND SEVEN: The evidence was insufficient to convict the appellant \nof drug possession and drug trafficking.   \nSupporting Facts: The prosecutors claim appellant was involved in \neight controlled buys with an informant. On these eight alleged controlled \nbuys its (sic) on record that the DEA never witnessed any of the alleged \ndrug transactions. Its (sic) also a fact a fact that there are no video recordings \nof appellant making any drug transactions with the informant and none of \nthe alleged marked money was confiscated from appellant or taken off his \nperson at any given time. The audio recordings were unintelligible, \ninaudible, incomprehensible and all together untrustworthy and due to this \nparticular nature of these alleged audio recordings the informant was \n \n3 Ground 6 was initially omitted from the petition. Petitioner moved  to amend on the \npremise that habeas claim six was inadvertently omitted from his petition. ( ECF No. 12, Page ID \n#: 1577, ECF No. 12-2, Page ID #: 1596). Respondent did not oppose the motion to amend. The \nCourt granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to amend. (ECF No. 13, Page ID #: 1602). \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  9 of 34.  PageID #: 191210 \n \nallowed to interpret the audio recordings for the jury in his own words. The \nappellant wasn\u2019t arrested after any of the alleged controlled buys.   \n \nGROUND EIGHT: The trial court erred by aggregating the weight of the \ndrugs in separate counts to meet the major drug offender specification.   \nSupporting Facts: According to the indictment appellant never sold \nor possessed 100 grams or more of any drugs in any of the counts and \nalleged controlled buys. \n \n(ECF Nos. 1, 14, 14-1). \n Respondent filed the return of writ on December 7, 2018 (ECF No. 10)  and the \nsupplemental return of writ to address Ground 6 on January 30, 2019 (ECF No. 15) . Petitioner \nfiled his Traverse on March 11, 2019. (ECF No. 20). The Commissioner argue d that Grounds 1 \nthrough 4, 6, and 8 are not cognizable; Grounds 2 (in part) through 4, and 6 are procedurally \ndefaulted; and Grounds  1 and 3 through 7 are meritless. In his Traverse, Petitioner waive d \nargument on Grounds 1 and 6. 4  Makin further stipulated that Grounds 3 and 5 are meritless and \nGround 4 is procedurally defaulted. (ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1886 ). On March 12, 2019, \nRespondent objected, in part, to the Traverse asserting that Petitioner had presented a new matter \nregarding the sufficiency of the evidence never before presented to the state courts. (ECF No. 21). \nPetitioner responded to Respondent\u2019s objection on March 27, 2019. (ECF No. 22). \n \nV. Legal Standards \nA. Jurisdiction \nTitle 28 , United States Co de Section 2254(a) authorizes district courts to entertain an \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus \u201con behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment \nof a State court.\u201d A state prisoner may file a \u00a7 2254 petition in the \u201cdistrict court for the district \n \n4 Although Petitioner waives argument on Grounds 1 and 6 this Court has addressed these \ngrounds as Petitioner is not required to give any additional argument and did not specifically \nstipulate to the dismissal of these grounds. \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  10 of 34.  PageID #: 191311 \n \nwherein such person is in custody or in the district court for the district within which the State \ncourt was held which convicted and sentenced him.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d). The Court of Common \nPleas of Cuyahoga  County sentenced Makin , and Cuyahoga  County is wit hin this C ourt\u2019s \ngeographic jurisdiction. Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction over Makin\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. \nB. Cognizable Federal Claim  \n \nUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a), a state prisoner may challenge his custody \u201conly on the ground \nthat he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d A \npetitioner\u2019s claim is not cognizable on habeas review if it \u201cpresents no federal issue at all.\u201d Bates \nv. McCaughtry, 934 F.2d 99, 101 (7th Cir. 1991). Thus, \u201cerrors in application of  state law \u2026 are \nusually not cognizable in federal habeas corpus.\u201d Bey v. Bagley, 500 F.3d 514, 519 (6th Cir. 2007) \n(citing Walker v. Engle, 703 F.2d 959, 962 (6th Cir. 1983)); see also Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. \n62, 67- 68 (1991) (\u201c[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state court \ndeterminations on state law questions.\u201d).   \nA federal habeas court does not function as an additional state appellate court; it does not \nreview state courts\u2019 decisions on state law or procedure.  Allen v. Morris, 845 F.2d 610, 614 (6th \nCir. 1988) (citing Oviedo v. Jago, 809 F.2d 326, 328 (6th Cir. 1987)). Instead, \u201cfederal courts must \ndefer to a state court\u2019s interpretation of its own rules of evidence and procedure\u201d in considering a \nhabeas petition. Id. (quoting Machin v. Wainwright, 758 F.2d 1431, 1433 (11th Cir. 1985)). \nMoreover, \u201cthe doctrine of exhaustion requires that a claim be presented to the state courts under \nthe same theory in which it is later presented in federal court.\u201d Wong v. Money, 142 F.3d 313, 322 \n(6th 1998).  \nC. Exhaustion \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  11 of 34.  PageID #: 191412 \n \nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) governs  \nLandrum\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus. See Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 326\u201327 (1997) \n(holding that the AEDPA governs petitions filed after April 24, 1996); Murphy v. Ohio, 551 F.3d \n485, 493 (6th Cir. 2009). Under the AEDPA, state prisoners must either exhaust all possible state \nremedies or have no remaining state remedies before a federal court can review a petition for writ \nof habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) and (c); see also Rose v. Lundy , 455 U.S. 509, 515\u201319 \n(1982). This entails giving the state courts \u201cone full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues \nby invoking one complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d  O\u2019Sullivan \nv.

Procedural Default \nProcedural default is a related but \u201cdistinct\u201d concept from exhaustion. Williams v.  \nAnderson, 460 F.3d 789, 806 (6th Cir. 2006). It occurs when a habeas petitioner  fails to obtain  \nconsideration of a federal constitutional claim by state courts because he failed to: (1) comply with \na state procedural rule that prevented the state courts from reaching the merits of the  petitioner\u2019s \nclaim; or (2) fairly raise that claim before the state courts while state remedies were still available. \nSee generally Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 80, 84- 87 (1977); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, \n125 n.28 (1982); Williams, 460 F.3d at 806.

Coyle, 205 F.3d 269, 275 (6th Cir. 2000).

To be independent, a state procedural rule and the state  courts\u2019 application of it must \nnot rely in any part on federal law. Id . at 732-33. To be adequate, a state procedural rule must be \n\u201c\u2018firmly established\u2019 and \u2018regularly followed\u2019\u201d by the state courts at the time it was applied. Beard \nv. Kindler, 558 U.S. 53, 60-61 (2009). \nA petitioner procedurally defaults a claim by failing to \u201cfairly present\u201d the claim in  state \ncourt when he does not pursue that claim through the state\u2019s \u201c\u2018ordinary appellate review  \nprocedures,\u2019\u201d and, at the time of the federal habeas petition, state law no longer allows the  \npetitioner to raise the claim.

Ohio 2003) (\u201cIssues not presented at  each \nand every level [of the state courts] cannot be considered in a federal habeas corpus  petition.\u201d). \nUnder these circumstances, while the exhaustion requirement is technically satisfied because there \nare no longer any state -court remedies available to the petitioner, the petitioner\u2019s  failure to have \nthe federal claims fully considered in the state courts constitutes a procedural  default of those \nclaims, barring federal habeas review. Williams, 460 F.3d at 806 (\u201cWhere state court remedies are \nno longer available to a petitioner because he or she failed to use them within  the required time \nperiod, procedural default and not exhaustion bars federal court review.\u201d); see also Gray v. \nNetherland, 518 U.S. 152, 161- 62 (1996) (\u201cBecause the exhausti on requirement \u2018refers only to \nremedies still available at the time of the federal petition,\u2019 . . ., it is satisfied \u2018if it is clear that [the \nhabeas petitioner\u2019s] claims are now procedurally barred under [state] law\u2019 . . . .\u201d (internal citations \nomitted)). \nFurthermore, to \u201cfairly present\u201d a claim to a state court, a petitioner must assert both its  \nlegal and factual basis.

Standard of Review \nThe AEDPA provides in relevant part as follows: \n(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person \nin custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be \ngranted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits \nin State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim \u2013 \n \n(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an \nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as \ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or \n \n(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable \ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the \nState court proceeding. \n \nTo determine whether relief should be granted, the Court must use the \u201clook -through\u201d \nmethodology and look to the \u201clast explained state -court judgment\u201d on the petitioner\u2019s federal \nclaim. Ylst, 501 U.S. at 804 (\u201cThe essence of unexplained orders is that they say nothing. We think \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  14 of 34.

Even if \u201c[r]easonable minds reviewing the record might disagree\u201d about the findi ng \nin question, \u201con habeas review that does not suffice to supersede the trial court\u2019s \u2026 \ndetermination.\u201d Rice v.

Discussion \nA. Ground 1 \nIn Ground 1 Makin asserts that he was denied due process of la w when the trial court \nordered that certain information be provided to him the day of trial and that because of the timing \nof the disclosure, his counsel could not effective ly prepare his defense. (ECF No. 14, PageID #: \n1607). Respondent argues that Ground 1 is not cognizable and, alternatively, meritless under the \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  16 of 34.  PageID #: 191917 \n \nAEDPA. (ECF No. 10, PageID #: 62). Petitioner waived argument regarding Ground 1. (ECF No. \n20, PageID #: 1887). \nPrior to trial, defense counsel moved for an order requiring the prosecution to provide \ninformation regarding any deals it had made with testifying witnesses. The trial court gra nted the \nrequest but explained that the government need only reveal the requested information once the \njury was impaneled and sworn in. Petitioner argues that the delay in the government providing the \ninformation \u201cimpeded the ability of defense counsel to properly place issues before the jury as well \nas prepare a viable defense.\u201d (ECF No. 14, PageID #: 1607).  \nAssuming arguendo that his due process claim is properly presented to this Court, 5  it lacks \nmerit. \u201cThere is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case.\u201d Weatherford v. \nBursey, 429 U.S. 545, 559 (1977). Rather, \u201cin most criminal prosecutions, the Brady rule, Rule 16 \nand the Jencks Act, exhaust the universe of discovery to which the defendant is entitled.\u201d United \nStates v. Presser, 844 F. 2d 1275, 1285 n.12 (6th Cir. 1988). \u201cBrady also applies to the \nnondisclosure of evidence affecting the credibility of a witness whose \u2018 reliability ... may ... be \ndeterminative of guilt or innocence.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Blood, 435 F.3d 612, 627 (6th Cir. 2006)  \n(quoting Giglio v. United States , 405 U.S. 150, 153\u201354, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) \n(quotation omitted); see also United States v. Jones, 399 F.3d 640, 647 (6th Cir. 2005)). \u201cBrady \ngenerally does not apply to delayed disclosure of exculpatory information, but only to a complete \n \n5 Merely using constitutional phrases like \u201cfair trial\u201d or \u201cdue process of law\u201d does not \nconstitute raising a federal constitutional issue.

Coombe, 735 F.2d 684, 688-89 (2nd Cir. 1984). Mere use \nof the words \u201cdue process and a fair trial by an impartial jury\u201d are insufficient. Slaughter, 450 F.3d \nat 236; Blackmon v. Booker, 394 F.3d 399, 400 (6th Cir. 2004) (same). \u201cA lawyer need not develop \na constitutional argument at length, but he must make one; the words \u2018due process\u2019 are not an \nargument.\u201d Riggins v. McGinnis, 50 F.3d 492, 494 (7th Cir. 1995). \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  17 of 34.  PageID #: 192018 \n \nfailure to disclose\u201d and that a \u201c[d]elay only violates Brady when the delay itself causes prejudice.\u201d \nSee United States v. Bencs, 28 F.3d 555, 560\u201361 (6th Cir. 1994).  \nHere, Makin does not assert that the government failed to disclose information. Instead, \nMakin\u2019s argument addresses the timing of the government\u2019s disclosure of the information relating \nto deals made with witnesses in exchange for the witness es\u2019 testimony at trial. This information \nrelates to the witness\u2019s credibility. However, b ecause testimony regarding any benefits provided \nto the witnesses was elicited at trial (see ECF No. 10-3, PageID #: 816-817, 827, ECF No. 10- 3, \nPageID #: 1188-1207) and the delay in disclosure did not result in prejudice, the Court finds  no \nGiglio/Brady violation here.  \nTo the extent Petitioner attempts to assert a Jencks Act violation, this too fails.  Jencks does \nnot require such material to be turned over until aft er the witness testifies. See Presser, 844 F.2d \nat 1283 (\u201cthe government may not be compelled to disclose Jencks Act material before trial.\u201d).  \nAccordingly, there is no Constitutional right that was infringed by the trial court ordering \nthe government to t urn over the requested information after the jury was sworn in. Moreover, a \ntrial court has discretion to delay the disclosure of a prospective witness to protect his or her safety \nunder Ohio Crim. R. 16(D).6  \nHaving found that no Constitutional right was infringed, it follows that Petitioner cannot \nmeet the higher standard required for relief under the AEDPA. \nAccordingly, the Court recommends denying Ground 1. \n \n \n6 Petitioner has not claimed that Ohio Crim. R. 16(D) violates the U.S. Constitution.   \nMoreover, any argument that the trial court erred in its application of 16(D) would be premised \nupon state law and not cognizable in this federal habeas proceeding. \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  18 of 34.  PageID #: 192119 \n \nB. Ground 2 \nIn Ground 2 Petitioner asserts that he was denied due process of law and a fair trial because \nthe court did not order disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity prior to trial, and that because of that \nviolation his counsel was unable to be effective. (ECF No. 14, PageID #: 1609). Respondent argues \nthat Ground 2 is not cognizable  in part and procedurally defaulted in part. Petitioner argue s that \nGround 2 is cognizable but fails to support his statement with any caselaw or argument. Petitioner \ndoes not address Respondent\u2019s procedural default argument. (ECF No. at 37-39). Petitioner argues \nthat \u201cDuring pretrial discovery, the State arbitrarily marked its discovery submissions as \u2018counsel \nonly\u2019. What made this procedure problematic and prejudicial was that majority of the evidence \nwas audio and video re cordings allegedly reflecting Appellant\u2019s interaction with \u2018 confidential \ninformant\u2019. Counsel never shared any documents with appellant and counsel was also restricted \nfrom sharing the audio and video recordings with Appellant. Defense counsel and Appellant  was \nunable to prepare a defense before trial.\u201d (ECF No. 14, PageID #: 1609). In his Traverse, Petitioner \nacknowledges that his defense counsel shared documents with him . He focuses, instead, on the \nfact that the identity of the informant was not provided prior to trial and certain audio and video \nrecordings were restricted as \u201ccounsel only\u201d pursuant to Ohio Crim. R. 16(D).7 (ECF No. at 37). \nTo the extent Makin asserts  a constitutional violation based on the trial court\u2019s order \ngranting certification of the confidential informant\u2019s identity, he has not stated a claim for federal \nhabeas relief. See McDaniel v. Hoffner, No. 17-1453, 2017 WL 4857554, at *2 (6th Cir. Sept. 12, \n2017) (citing McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300, 312\u201314 (1967) (dec lining to find that the federal \nconstitution mandates the disclosure of confidential informants); Phillips v. Cardwell , 482 F.2d \n \n7 See Footnote 6. \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  19 of 34.  PageID #: 192220 \n \n1348, 1349 (6th Cir. 1973) (stating that it is doubtful that a claim for failure to produce the identity \nof an informant is cognizable in habeas corpus)).  \nMakin\u2019s reliance on Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53 (1957), is misplaced. \u201cRoviaro \nwas an exercise of the Supreme Court \u2019s supervisory power over lower federal courts. \u201d Nelson v. \nBurton, No. 1:15- CV-251, 2018 WL 1179667, a t *9 (W.D. Mich. Feb. 20, 2018), report and \nrecommendation adopted, No. 1:15- CV-251, 2018 WL 1174140 (W.D. Mich. Mar. 6, 2018)  \n(citing Roviaro, 353 U.S. at 59\u201361; Phillips, 482 F.2d at 1349 (Roviaro\u2019s ruling \u201cwas made in a \ncase on direct appeal and in the Court \u2019s supervisory jurisdiction, not as a matter of constitutional \nlaw.\u201d)). \u201cBecause habeas corpus lies only for violation of the Constitution or laws of the United \nStates, it is highly doubtful whet her a claim under is cognizable in habeas corpus.\u201d Phillips, 482 \nF.3d at 1349. \nAccordingly, Makin\u2019s claim for failure to produce the identity of an informant is not \ncognizable in habeas corpus.  \nTo the extent Makin asserts a constitutional violation occurred by restricting certain audio \nand video recordings as \u201ccounsel only\u201d, this claim is procedurally defaulted as Makin failed to \npresent the claim to the state court. As discussed above, \u201ca petitioner may procedurally default a \nclaim by failing to [fairly] raise a claim in state court, and pursue that claim through the state\u2019s \n\u2018ordinary appellate review procedures.\u2019\u201d Williams, 460 F.3d at 806. \u201cIf, at the time of the fe deral \nhabeas petition, state law no longer allows the petitioner to raise the claim, the claim is \nprocedurally defaulted.\u201d Id. As noted above, \u201cto fairly present a claim a petitioner must assert both \nthe legal and factual basis for his or her claim.\u201d Id . Here, Makin does not argue that he  fairly \npresented this factual basis for a Fourteenth Amendment claim in state court.  \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  20 of 34.  PageID #: 192321 \n \nIn his third assignment of error raised on direct appeal, Makin argued that he was \u201cdenied \ndue process of law, a fair trial, and effective assistance of counsel because the court did not order \nthe disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity.\u201d (ECF No. 10 -1, PageID #: 139). The majority of his \nargument takes issue with the trial court\u2019s timing for requiring the government to reveal the identity \nof the informant. (See ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 139-143). As an aside, Makin states:  \nDuring pretrial discovery, the State arbitrarily marked its \nsubmissions as \u201c Counsel Only.\u201d  What made this procedure \nproblematic was that the majority of the evidence was au dio and \nvideo recordings reflecting Mr. Makin \u2019s interaction with a \nconfidential informant (\u201cCRI\u201d).  Accordingly, while counsel could \nshare documents with Mr. Makin, he was restricted from sharing the \naudio and video recordings with Mr. Makin.  This assignment of \nerror must also consider the court\u2019s refusal to remove the \u201cCounsel \nOnly\u201d tag.  The judge confused this issue with disclosure of the \nCRI\u2019s identity, Tr. 131. In short, restricting the recordings was done \nto prevent Mr. Makin from identifying the CRI; this was improper.  \nAnd, Crim R 16 requires disclosure of recorded statements of any \nState\u2019s witness, Crim R 16(B)(7); and a witness list, Crim R 16(1).  \n(ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 139). Makin\u2019s argument that the trial court violated Ohio Crim. R. 1 6 \ndoes not fairly present this issue in a manner that suggests a federal constitutional claim. See \nWilliams, 460 F.3d at 806.  Accordingly, Makin has procedurally defaulted this claim.  \nBecause Makin\u2019s ground for relief is procedurally defaulted, he must demonstrate that \ncause excuses his default and that he was prejudiced by the alleged constitutional violation. \nColeman, 501 U.S. at 750. Makin does not argue cause for his procedural default.  Thus, as Makin \nfails to demonstrate cause for his procedural default, his default is not excused. \nAccordingly, Petitioner\u2019s Ground 2 is not cognizable in part and procedurally defaulted in \npart and should be dismissed. \nC.

Walker, 224 F.3d 542, \n557 (6th Cir. 2000) (holding that habeas petitioners cannot resurrect procedurally defaulted claims \non the sole basis that a state court has applied plain-error review to the issue on direct appeal). \nAccordingly, the Court recommends dismissing Ground 4.  \nE. Ground 5 \nIn Ground 5, Petitioner asserts that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and a fair \ntrial because his counsel did not request an instruction on accomplice testimony and witness \ncredibility and did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument . (ECF No. 14- 1, PageID #: \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  22 of 34.  PageID #: 192523 \n \n1618). Respondent argues that Ground 5 is meritless. Petitioner agree s. (ECF No. 20, PageID #: \n1886). Accordingly, the Court recommends denying Ground 5. \nF. Ground 6 \nIn Ground 6, Petitioner asserts that prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments and \nthroughout trial deprived him of a fair trial. (ECF No. 14-1, PageID #: 1619). In support of Ground \n6, Petitioner states \u201cProsecutor stated during argument that defense counsel\u2019s arguments were \n\u2018laughable.\u2019 The prosecutor also presented fabricated evidence in the form of an audio recording \nand conveyed a false testimony and assist ed the witness in conveying a false testimony at trial. \u201d \nRespondent argued Ground 6 is not cognizable, procedurally defaulted, and meritless under the \nAEDPA. Petitioner waived argument regarding Ground 6. (ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1886). \nTo the extent Ground 6 takes issue with the prosecutor\u2019s remark during closing argument, \nthe Court finds this issue procedurally defaulted. In order for procedural default to apply, (1) there \nmust be a firmly established state procedural rule that is appli cable to the petitioner \u2019s claim and \nthe petitioner must not have complied with the rule; (2) the last state court to which the petitioner \nsought review must have invoked the procedural rule as a basis for its decision to reject review of \nthe federal claims; and (3) the procedural default must be an \u201cadequate and independent\u201d state \nground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim. Maupin v. \nSmith, 785 F.2d 135, 138-39 (6th Cir. 1986). \nMakin failed to adhere to the firm ly-established Ohio contemporaneous objection rule, \nwhich is an independent and adequate state ground that the Ohio appellate court invoked as the \nbasis for its decision to apply plain error review only. State v. Makin, 2017-Ohio-2649, \u00b6 35. See \nScott v. M itchell, 209 F.3d 854, 866 (6th Cir.  2000) (recognizing Ohio\u2019 s contemporaneous \nobjection rule as an adequate and independent state ground). Makin\u2019s attorney failed to object to \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  23 of 34.  PageID #: 192624 \n \nthe prosecutor stating that defense counsel\u2019s arguments were \u201claughable\u201d . The  state court of \nappeals, recognizing this, conducted plain error review of the issue  and found no error. (State v. \nMakin, 2017-Ohio-2649, \u00b6\u00b633-40). \nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has \u201cheld that an Ohio court\u2019s enforcement of the \ncontemporaneous-objection rule is \u201c \u2018an independent and adequate state ground\u2019 of decision\u201d \nsufficient to bar habeas relief.\u201d Hand v. Houk , 871 F.3d 390, 417 (6th Cir. 2017) (citing \nWogenstahl v. Mitchell, 668 F.3d 307, 336 (6th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted)). Therefore, Makin is \nbarred from raising this claim for relief in a habeas petition unless he can demonstrate cause and \nprejudice to excuse the default. Hand, 871 F.3d at 417; Keith v. Mitchell, 455 F.3d 662, 674 (6th \nCir. 2006) (\u201cAbsent cause and prejudice, a federal court may not reach the merits of claim that has \nbeen procedurally defaulted in state court. \u201d). Makin does not argue cause for his procedural \ndefault.  Nor has the petition er shown actual innocence.  See Gray, 518 U.S. at  162; Hannah v. \nConley, 49 F.3d 1193, 1196, n. 3 (6th Cir. 1995)); see also Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750\u201351. Thus, as \nMakin fails to demonstrate cause for his procedural default or actual innocence, his default is not \nexcused \nMakin\u2019s claim that \u201c[t]he prosecutor also presented fabricated evidence in the form of an \naudio recording and conveyed a false testimony and assisted the  witness in conveying a false \ntestimony at trial\u201d is also procedurally defaulted as he failed to raise the issue before the state \ncourts. The doctrine of exhaustion requires that a prosecutorial misconduct claim be presented to \nthe state courts under the same theory as the prosecutorial misconduct claim being raised in the \nhabeas petition. Williams v. Bagley, 380 F.3d 932, 969 (6th Cir. 2004). On direct appeal Makin \ntook issue only with the prosecutor\u2019s remarks that the defense\u2019s argument was \u201claughable.\u201d (ECF \nNo. 10-1, Page ID#149-152). The remainder of Makin\u2019s supporting facts \u2013 that the prosecution \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  24 of 34.  PageID #: 192725 \n \n\u201cfabricated evidence in the form of an audio recording and conveyed a false testimony and assisted \nthe witness in conveying a false testimony at trial\u201d \u2013 was n ot alleged before the state court. \nNotably, Makin does not argue that he fairly presented this factual basis in state court. Makin has \nfailed to present, and therefore to exhaust, the prosecutorial misconduct claim addressed above.  \nHowever, the exhaustion requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A) and (c) do not bar \nreview of claims where, such as here,  a petitioner no longer has state remedies available to him. \nRust v. Zent, 17 F.3d 155, 160 (6th Cir. 1994) (holding that failure exhaust bars review only when \nthe state still provides a remedy to exhaust). Makin is barred from presenting his claims to the state \ncourts because he had the opportunity to raise the issues during the course of his direct appeal but \nfailed to do so. See State v. Roberts , 1 Ohio St.3d 36, 39 (1982) (the doctrine of res judicata \nprecludes a petitioner from asserting constitutional issues in a postconviction proceeding that were \nnot raised \u201cat the earliest possible time\u201d). Instead, the Court must apply the procedural default \nrules to those claims. As discussed above, \u201ca petitioner may procedurally default a claim by failing \nto [fairly] raise a claim in state court, and pursue that claim through the state\u2019s \u2018ordinary appellate \nreview procedures.\u2019\u201d Williams, 460 F.3d at 806.  \u201cI f, at the time of the federal habeas petition, \nstate law no longer allows the petitioner to raise the claim, the claim is procedurally defaulted.\u201d  \nId.  As noted above, \u201cto fairly present a claim a petitioner must assert both the legal and factual \nbasis for his or her claim.\u201d  Id. The Court may review a prisoner \u2019s procedurally defaulted claims \non the merits only if he shows cause for not raising his claims at all levels of state court review \nand prejudice, or that he is actually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted. See Gray, \n518 U.S. at162; Hannah, 49 F.3d at 1196, n. 3; Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750\u201351. The petitioner has \nneither alleged nor established cause to excuse his procedural default on these claims. When cause \nhas not been shown, the Court need not consider whether actual prejudice has been demonstrated. \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  25 of 34.  PageID #: 192826 \n \nSee, e.g., Smith v. Murray, 477 U.S. 527, 533 (1986); Long v. McKeen, 722 F.2d 286, 289 (6th Cir. \n1983). Nor has the petitioner shown actual innocence. Therefore, his procedural default will not \nbe excused on this ground. The newly raised portions of Petitioner\u2019s Ground 6  claim of \nprosecutorial misconduct are barred by procedural default. \nAccordingly, Petitioner\u2019s Ground 6 procedurally defaulted and should be dismissed. \nG. Ground 7 \nIn Ground 7, Petitioner asserts that the \u201cevidence was insufficient to convict the appellant \nof drug possession and drug trafficking. \u201d (ECF No. 14- 1, PageID #: 1620). Makin includes the \nfollowing supporting facts:  \nThe prosecutors claim appellant was involved in eight controlled \nbuys with an informant. On these eight alleged controlled buys its \n(sic) on record that the DEA never witnessed any of the alleged drug \ntransactions. Its (sic) also a fact a fact that there are no video \nrecordings of appellant making any drug transactions with the \ninformant and none of the alleged marked money was confiscated \nfrom appellant or taken off his person at any given time. The audio \nrecordings were unintelligible, inaudible, incompre hensible and all \ntogether untrustworthy and due to this particular nature of these \nalleged audio recordings the informant was allowed to interpret the \naudio recordings for the jury in his own words. The appellant wasn\u2019t \narrested after any of the alleged controlled buys.   \n(ECF No. 14 -1, PageID #: 1620). Responde nt argued that Ground 7 is meritless. Petitioner\u2019s \nTraverse renumbers the issue as Ground 1 and states: \u201c The evidence was insufficient to convict \npetitioner of drug trafficking, drug possession, MDO specifications and schoolyard \nspecifications.\u201d (ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1848).  Specifically, Petitioner contests the credibility of \nthe witnesses. (See ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1848- 1883). Respondent objects to the Traverse and \nargues that it raises new claims and factual bases not previously argued before any court. (ECF \nNo. 21). Petitioner argues that he was supplementing and clarifying the record by including new \nfacts but that he did not change the substance of his claim. (ECF No. 22, generally).  \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  26 of 34.  PageID #: 192927 \n \nA. New Claims Raised in Traverse \nTo the extent Makin attempts to raise in his Traverse  sufficiency of the evidence claim s \nregarding his MDO specification and schoolyard specifications, the Court agrees with Respondent \nthat Makin failed to raise these issues in his habeas petition. ( Compare ECF No. 14-1, PageID #: \n1620 with ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1848).  \u201cNew issues may not be raised in the traverse. \u201d \nMcClendon v. Wainwright , No. 1: 17 CV 0589, 2018 WL 7982929, at *3 (N.D. Ohio Nov. 13, \n2018), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:17 CV 589, 2019 WL 1558739 (N.D. Ohio \nApr. 10, 2019)  (citing Burns v. Lafler , 328 F. Supp. 2d 711, 724 (E.D. Mich. 2004) (citation \nomitted) (\u201c[A] court cannot consider new issues raised in a traverse or reply to the State\u2019 s \nanswer.\u201d)). Thus, the Court will not address these new issues. \nB. Drug Trafficking and Drug Possession \nGround 7 of the petition claims a violation of due process on the basis that there was \ninsufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict on his drug possession and drug trafficking \ncharges. (ECF No. 14 -1, PageID #: 1620). Makin asserted this issue on direct appeal  and in his \npetition. Respondent assert s that Makin improperly raises facts in his Traverse that he had \npreviously failed to raise before any court. Makin\u2019s Traverse provides nearly 36 pages of argument \nand facts for Ground 7, many of which were not included in his manifest weight or sufficiency \narguments at the state level. (See ECF No. 14-1, PageID #: 155-163). Indeed, Makin acknowledges \nthat he raises new facts but argues that he does  so in order to supplement and clarify the record. \nTo the extent these \u201cfacts\u201d were not presented before to state courts, it is improper for Makin to \nraise them on habeas review. See  Davis v. Gray , No. 1:19 CV 1527, 2020 WL 4004490, at *5 \n(N.D. Ohio Apr. 28, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:19CV1527, 2020 WL \n4003040 (N.D. Ohio July 15, 2020), appeal dismissed, No. 20- 3888, 2021 WL 688840 (6th Cir. \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  27 of 34.  PageID #: 193028 \n \nFeb. 3, 2021) (\u201cA petitioner who did not take or seek the opportunity to develop evidence in his \nstate trial, direct appeal and post-conviction proceedings will be deemed to have failed to develop \nthe factual basis of the claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2). Such a situation precludes the habeas court \nfrom considering new facts presented for the first time in federal habeas proceedings or granting \nan evidentiary hearing to consider the new facts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2) is designed to restrict the \ndevelopment of facts in federal habeas proceedings that were not known or considered by a state \ncourt.\u201d).  \nHowever, the majority of Makin\u2019s arguments and facts merely attack the credibility of the \nevidence presented. ( See ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1848- 1883). The Court need not determine \nwhether these factual bases are properly presented to this court because this habeas court does not \nreconsider the credibility of witnesses. White v. Steele , 602 F.3d 707, 710 (6th Cir. 2009), cert. \ndenied, 562 U.S. 858 (2010) (quoting Brown v. Konteh, 567 F.3d 191, 205 (6th Cir. 2009) (This \ncourt does \u201cnot reweigh the evidence, re-evaluate the credibility of witnesses, or substi tute our \njudgment for that of the jury.\u201d); s ee, e.g., McKenzie v.

The Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201cit is the responsibility of the jury \u2014 not the \ncourt \u2014 to decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial.\u201d Cavazos v. \nSmith, 565 U.S. 1, 2 (2011) (per curiam). Jackson \u201cunambiguously instructs that a reviewing court \n\u2018faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume \u2014 even \nif it does not affirmatively appear in the record \u2014 that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts \nin favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\u2019 \u201d Cavazos , 565 U.S. at 7 (quoting \nJackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 326 (1979). Additionally, to the extent that Makin tries to weave \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  28 of 34.  PageID #: 193129 \n \nother issues into his sufficiency of the evidence claim ( see ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1848- 1883 \n(alleging instances of \u201cfalse testimony\u201d, \u201cprosecutorial misconduct\u201d, \u201cfraud\u201d, \u201cperjury\u201d in support \nof his sufficiency claim)), this is also improper. \nNonetheless, this Court recognizes that Makin has properly brought this sufficiency of the \nevidence claim in relation to his drug trafficking and drug possession convictions and will consider \nthe facts properly before it when analyzing this claim.  \nMakin raised on direct appeal the sufficiency of the evidence to support a guilty verdict on \nhis drug possession and drug trafficking charges; the state court of appeals ruled as follows: \n{\u00b6 41} Makin argues that his convictions are against the weight and \nsufficiency of the evidence. We combine the related ninth and tenth \nerrors for response. \n{\u00b6 42} The Ohio Supreme Court has explained that, \u201c[t]he legal \nconcepts of sufficiency of the evidence and weight of the evidence \nare both quantitatively and qualitatively different.\u201d State v. \nThompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). \n\u201cSufficiency of the evidence is a test of adequacy as to whether the \nevidence is legally sufficient to support a verdict as a matter of law, \nbut weight of the evidence addresses the evidence's effect of \ninducing belief.\u201d State v. Wilson, 113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007\u2013Ohio\u2013\n2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, \u00b6 25, citing Thompkins  at 386\u2013387. An \nappellate court, \u201cmay determine that a judgment of a trial court is \nsustained by sufficient evidence, that court may nevertheless \nconclude that the judgment is against the weight of the evidence.\u201d \nThompkins at 387. \n{\u00b6 43} The question of \u201cwhether the evidence is legally sufficient to \nsustain a verdict is a question of law. State v. Robinson, 162 Ohio \nSt. 486, 124 N.E.2d 148 (1955).\u201d Thompkins at 386. It is \u201can inquiry \nabout due process, * * * the resolution of which does not allow the \ncourt to weigh the evidence.\u201d State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, \n175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983). \n{\u00b6 44} In a sufficiency inquiry, an appellate court does not assess \nwhether the state \u2019s evidence is to be believed but whether, if \nbelieved, the evidence admitted at trial supported the conviction. \nState v. Starks, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 91682, 2009\u2013Ohio \u20133375,\u00b6 \n25, citing Thompkins at 387. \u201c \u2018The relevant inquiry is whether, after \nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, \nCase: 1:18-cv-01521-JRK  Doc #: 24  Filed:  07/19/21  29 of 34.

The appellate court \nreviews the entire record, considers the credibility of the witnesses, \nweighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, and determines \nwhether the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest \nmiscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new \ntrial ordered. Martin at 175; Leonard at 68. \n{\u00b6 46} In weighing the evidence, we consider whether a greater \namount of credible trial evidence supports \u201cone side of the issue \nrather than the other.\u201d Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 1997\u2013\nOhio\u201352, 678 N.E.2d 541. It indicates clearly to the jury that the \nparty having the burden of proof will be entitled to their verdict, if, \non weighing the evidence in their minds, they shall find the greater \namount of credible evidence sustains the issue which is to be \nestablished before th em.

The state court of appeals relied on state law, rather \nthan federal law, in addressing the sufficiency of the evidence claim. The state court, however, \nrelied on State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 390, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), and State v. Jenks, \n61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991) (syllabus), which follow the sufficiency of evidence \nstandard set forth in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979). Thus, the issue is whether the state \ncourt decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law; in other words, \nwhether the state court identified the correct governing legal principle from Supreme Court \ndecisions, but unreasonably applied that principle to the facts of Makin\u2019s case. Williams, 529 U.S. \nat 410-412; Bolton v. Harris , No. 1:18CV1164, 2021 WL 1930239, at *31 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 7, \n2021), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:18 CV 1164, 2021 WL 1929117 (N.D. Ohio \nMay 13, 2021). \nUnder Jackson, a sufficiency of the evidence claim is reviewed by determining whether, \nafter viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact \ncould have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. 443 U.S. at 319; \nsee also Cavazos, 565 U.S. at 7; Bagby v. Sowders, 894 F.2d 792, 794 (6th Cir. 1990). The state \ncourt correctly identified and applied the governing legal principle as set forth in Jackson. See \nState v. Makin, 2017-Ohio-2649, \u00b6\u00b6 40-48. \nOn habeas review, \u201cthe Jackson v.

See Palmer \nv. Palmer, No. 1:15-CV-458, 2018 WL 7891722, at *15 (W.D. Mich. Oct. 29, 2018), report and \nrecommendation adopted, No. 1:15- CV-458, 2019 WL 1429258 (W.D. Mich.

United States , 559 U.S. 133, 138 (2010) (\u201cWe are, however, bound by the \nFlorida Supreme Court \u2019s interpretation of state law, including its determination of the elements \n....\u201d); Jackson, 443 U.S. at 324 n.16 (\u201cThe respondents have suggested that this constitutional \nstandard will invite intrusions upon the power of the States to define criminal offenses.

Makin, 2017-Ohio-2649, \n\u00b648 (see quoted paragraph above).  \nReviewing the state court \u2019s determination on these issues, this court cannot find that the \nstate court \u2019s decision is an objectively unreasonable application of federal law. The evidence \nsupporting the convictions included evidence from each of the controlled buys, including audio \nand video evidence of the buys , testimony from the agents who witnessed the controlled buys, \ntestimony from the CI  who participated in the buys , and testimony regarding the amount of the \ndrugs purchased, the payment, and testing of the drugs to confirm chemical com position.

Consequently, Ground 7 should be denied. \nH. Ground 8 \nIn Ground 8, Petitioner assert s that the \u201ctrial court erred by aggregating the weight of the \ndrugs in separate counts to meet the major drug offender specification.\u201d (ECF No. 14-1, PageID \n#: 1622). Respondent argues that Ground 8 is not cognizable. Specifically, Respondent argues the \nmajor drug offender specification and the question of aggregation are state sentencing issues and, \ntherefore, not cognizable in this forum. (ECF No. 10, PageID #: 82). Petitioner agrees. (ECF No. \n20, PageID #: 1887). Accordingly, the Court recommends dismissing Ground 8. \nVII. Certificate of Appealability \nA.

The granting of a certificate of appealability does not require \na showing that the appeal would succeed on any claim. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 337 \n(2003). \nB. Analysis \nMakin\u2019s grounds for relief are either meritless , not cognizable, or procedurally defaulted. \nIf the Court accepts the foregoing recommendation, then Makin has not made a substantial \nshowing of a denial of a constitutional right. He would then not be entitled to a certificate of \nappealability. Thus, I recommend that the Court not issue to Makin a certificate of appealability.  \nVIII. Recommendation \nPetitioner Makin has presented only meritless, not cognizable, or procedurally defaulted  \nclaims.

Introduction\n\nPetitioner, Hakeen Makin, seeks a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Makin is an Ohio prisoner who is currently serving an eleven-year sentence for eighteen counts of drug trafficking and eight counts of drug possession. Makin asserts eight grounds for relief. (ECF No. 1; ECF No. 14). Respondent, Warden Lyneal Wainwright, filed a return of writ on December 7, 2018 (ECF No. 10) and a supplemental return of writ on January 30, 2019 (ECF No. 15) following Makin\u2019s amended petition (ECF No. 14). Makin filed a traverse on March 11, 2019. (ECF No. 20, \u201cTraverse\u201d). Respondent objected to the Traverse on March 12, 2019 (ECF No. 21), and Petitioner responded to the objection on March 27, 2019 (ECF No. 22).\n\nThis matter was referred to me under Local Rule 72.2 to prepare a report and recommendation on Makin\u2019s petition and other case-dispositive motions. Makin\u2019s grounds for relief are either meritless, not cognizable, or procedurally defaulted; thus, I recommend that the Court deny his petition in its entirety and not grant him a certificate of appealability.\nII. Relevant Factual Background\n\nThe Ohio Court of Appeals for the Eighth Appellate District set forth the following facts on direct appeal:\n\n{\u00b6 3} The indictments resulted from a series of controlled drug buys, occurring on March 19, 2014 (Counts 1, 2, and 3, 26.4 grams cocaine); April 14, 2014 (Counts 4, 5, and 6, 27.6 grams cocaine); June 10, 2014 (Counts 7, 8, and 9, 56.8 grams cocaine); and June 20, 2014 (Counts 10, 11, and 12, 70.4 grams cocaine). Counts 13 and 14 are aggregate for the prior transactions. Counts 15, 16, and 17 relate to a fifth controlled buy that took place on July 8, 2014, involving 11.9 grams of heroin. Counts 18, 19, and 20 arise from a July 15, 2014 controlled buy involving 12 grams of heroin. Counts 21, 22, and 23 arise from a July 22, 2014 controlled buy involving 27.6 grams of heroin. Counts 24, 25, and 26 arise from an August 14, 2014 controlled buy involving 27.7 grams of heroin. Counts 27 and 28 are the aggregate counts for July 8, 2014, through August 14, 2014, including major drug offender specifications (\u201cMDOs\u201d) under R.C. 2941.1410(A).\n\n{\u00b6 4} Codefendant and ex-girlfriend Tiffany Harmon (\u201cHarmon\u201d) was charged in complicity with Count 1 and agreed to testify in exchange for a plea agreement. The jury trial was held in December 2015. The trial court retained jurisdiction to determine the MDOs after the jury's verdict. Codefendant Derek I. Woods (\u201cWoods\u201d) was found not guilty of all charges.\n\n{\u00b6 5} Special agent Kirk Johns, Task Force Officers Luke Combs, and Michael Gardner were involved in the drug buys and testified regarding Makin's activities. The state drug task force utilized a confidential \u201creliable\u201d informant (\u201cCI\u201d) to effect the transactions.\n\n{\u00b6 6} The CI would contact Makin and arrange the transaction. The money was copied prior to use in the transaction and then given to the CI, the state conducted a \u201ccursory search\u201d of the CI and the CI's vehicle prior to the meeting. The task force agent trailed the CI to the meeting place where the event was recorded by audio, and/or video, and/or photographed. After the purchase, the CI met the task force agent to turn over the drugs, and another \u201ccursory\u201d search of\n\n---\n\n1 The facts found by the appellate court of record \u201cshall be presumed to be correct,\u201d and the petitioner has \u201cthe burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254(e)(1); Warren v. Smith, 161 F.3d 358, 360-61 (6th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1040 (1999).\nthe CI and the CI\u2019s vehicle was conducted. Harmon testified to participating in the first buy with Makin and the CI and that she completed the sale at Makin's direction.\n\n\u00b6 7 The CI was recruited for assistance in 2014 after the CI\u2019s sale of drugs to task force members. The CI told the task force that Makin was the CI's drug supplier. The CI would purchase, cut, and resell the drugs. An agreement was executed by the CI containing the terms and conditions of his CI status. Trial testimony included a detailed description of each controlled buy transaction.\n\n\u00b6 8 Counts 14, 28, and the schoolyard specifications for Counts 15 and 16 were dismissed pursuant to Crim.R. 29. The jury found Makin guilty of the remaining offenses. Makin was sentenced on the major drug specification to 11 years at the Lorain Correctional Institution. He was also advised of postrelease control. This appeal ensued.\n\nState v. Makin, 2017-Ohio-2649, \u00b6\u00b6 3-8.\n\nIII. Relevant State Procedural History\n\nA. Indictment\n\nMakin was indicted on March 13, 2015, for:\n\nCounts 1, 4, 7, 10, 15: Trafficking, R.C. 2925.03(A)(1), felony of the first-degree with Counts 1, 4, and 15 including a schoolyard specification in violation of R.C. 2925.01(P);\n\nCounts 2, 5, 8, 11, 13, 16, 27: Trafficking, R.C. 2925.03(A)(2), felony of the first-degree with Counts 2, 5, and 16 including a schoolyard specification in violation of R.C. 2925.01(P);\n\nCount 3, 17, 20, 23, 26: Drug Possession, R.C. 2925.11(A), felony of the second-degree;\n\nCounts 6, 9, 12, 14, 28: Drug Possession, R.C. 2925.11(A), felony of the first-degree with Count 14 including a major drug offender specification in violation of R.C. 2941.1410(A);\n\nCounts 18, 21, 24: Trafficking, R.C. 2925.03(A)(1), felony of the second-degree;\n\nCounts 19, 22, 25: Trafficking, R.C. 2925.03(A)(2), felony of the second-degree;\nAt arraignment, Makin pleaded not guilty to all charges. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 99).\n\nB. Trial and Guilty Verdict\n\nPrior to trial, Makin moved for an order requiring the prosecution to reveal any deals made with cooperating witnesses for his/her assistance in the matter. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 100). The trial court granted the order but required the government to produce such information only after the jury was impaneled and sworn. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 101). The case proceeded to trial. Makin moved for a Rule 29 acquittal, which the court granted as to Counts 14 and 18 and the school-yard specifications on Counts 15 and 16. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 102). The government dismissed the school-yard specifications on Counts 4 and 5. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 105). The jury found Makin guilty of all remaining charges and schoolyard specifications (on Counts 1 and 2). (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 103-105). On December 4, 2015, Makin, pro se, filed a motion to disqualify his counsel. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 106-108). The trial court denied the motion. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 109). The trial court conducted a bench trial on the major drug offender specification on December 8, 2015. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 105). On December 11, 2015, the court found Makin guilty of the major drug offender specification in Count 13. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 110). On the same date, Makin was ordered to serve an aggregate sentence of eleven years. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 113).\n\nC. Direct Appeal\n\nOn appeal, represented by new counsel, Makin raised twelve assignments of error:\n\n1. The appellant was denied his right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution in determining the MDO specification. (Tr. 134-36).\n2. The appellant was denied due process of law and effective assistance of counsel when the trial court refused to order the State to provide an agreement with its key witness until the day of trial. (Tr. 86-90)\n\n3. The Appellant was denied due process of law, a fair trial, and effective assistance of counsel because the court did not order disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity. (Tr. 131)\n\n4. The trial court erred by failing to give a correct accomplice testimony jury instruction. R.C. 2923.03(D). (Tr. 1541)\n\n5. The trial court erred by failing to give a comprehensive instruction on informant testimony. (Tr. 1203; 1205; 1490; 1491)\n\n6. The trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that prior convictions could be used to evaluate the credibility of a witness. (Tr. 1541; 1203; 1205)\n\n7. Prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments deprived Mr. Makin of a fair trial in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the corresponding provisions of the Ohio Constitution. (Tr. 1587)\n\n8. The Appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel and was not afforded his constitutional right to counsel pursuant to the Sixth Amendment and due process and a fair trial pursuant to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. (Tr. 1541; 1203;1205)\n\n9. The Appellant\u2019s convictions are against the weight of the evidence. (Tr. 1409; 1446)\n\n10. The evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant of drug possession and drug trafficking. (Tr. 1409; 1446)\n\n11. Appellant\u2019s rights to due process and equal protection under the Ohio and United States Constitutions were violated when the State excluded an African-American juror without providing a satisfactory race-neutral reason and without the trial court correctly applying the law. (Tr. 148; 172-76; 290; 380;390)\n12. The trial court erred by aggregating the weight of the drugs in separate counts to meet the major drug offender specification. (Tr. 136-37)\n\n(ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 131-132). On May 4, 2017, the Eighth District Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. State v. Makin, 2017-Ohio-2649, \u00b668.\n\nD. Appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nOn June 16, 2017, Makin timely filed a pro se appeal notice in the Ohio Supreme Court. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 250). Makin\u2019s memorandum in support of jurisdiction raised the following propositions of law:\n\nI. The Appellant was denied his right to a jury trial guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in determining the MDO specifications.\n\nII. The Appellant was denied due process of law and effective assistance of counsel when the trial court refused to order the State to provide an agreement with its key witness until the day of trial.\n\nIII. The Appellant was denied due process of law, a fair trial, and effective assistance of counsel because the court did not order disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity.\n\nIV. The trial court erred by failing to give a correct accomplice testimony jury instruction, R.C. 2923.03(D).\n\nV. The trial court erred by failing to give a comprehensive instruction on information testimony (sic).\n\nVI. The trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that prior convictions could be used to evaluate the credibility of a witness.\n\nVII. Prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments deprived Mr. Makin of a fair trial in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eight, (sic) and Fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution and the corresponding provisions of the Ohio Constitution.\n\nVIII. The Appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel and was not afforded his constitutional right to counsel pursuant to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\n\nIX. The Appellant\u2019s convictions are against the weight of the evidence.\nX. The evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant of drug possession and trafficking.\n\nXI. Appellant\u2019s rights to due process and equal protection under the Ohio and United States Constitution were violated when the State excluded an African-American juror without providing a satisfactory race-neutral reason and without the trial court correctly applying the law.\n\nXII. The trial court erred by aggregating the weight of the drugs in separate counts to meet the major drug offender specification.\n\n(ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 253-254). On October 11, 2017, the Supreme Court of Ohio declined to accept jurisdiction of the appeal pursuant to S.C.Prac.R. 7.08(B)(4). (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 297).\n\nE. Application for Reopening Appeal Pursuant to Appellate Rule 26(B)\n\nOn July 31, 2017, Makin filed an application to reopen his appeal pursuant to App. R. 26(B). (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 298). Makin claimed he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel when counsel failed to raise the following assignments of error:\n\n1. Statutorily mandated terms required by law. The trial court\u2019s imposition of the terms was invalid because the court failed to notify appellant of all terms of statutory requirements.\n\n2. Appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to brief prosecutorial misconduct regarding the prosecutor presenting fabricated evidence, in the form of an audio recording and unremittingly lying and misleading the court and jury as well as assisting the C.I. John Hoyle in conveying a false testimony.\n\n3. Appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to brief that the trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to prosecutorial misconduct in regards to the prosecutor presenting fabricated evidence, in the form of an audio recording, misleading and lying to the Court and jury and assisting the C.I. John Hoyle in presenting perjured testimony as well as DEA agents. (\u201cThe essence of an ineffective assistance claim is that counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors so upset the adversarial balance between defense and prosecution that the trial was rendered unfair and the verdict rendered suspect.\u201d A strong presumption exists that counsel performed effectively. See\nBerkey v. United States, 318 F.3d 768, 772 (7th Cir. 2003); Webb v. Lucas 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44548.\n\n(ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 300-307). The government opposed the reopening of the appeal. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 308). Makin moved for leave to file a reply to the government\u2019s opposition brief, which the state Court of Appeals denied. (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 316, 323). On November 13, 2017, the Court of Appeals denied Makin\u2019s application to reopen his appeal. State v. Makin, 2017-Ohio-8569, \u00b6 12.\n\nIV. Federal Habeas Corpus Petition\n\nOn July 5, 2018, Makin petitioned pro se that this Court issue a writ of habeas corpus.\u00b2 (ECF No. 1). Makin asserted the following grounds for relief:\n\nGROUND ONE: Appellant was denied due process of law and effective assistance of counsel when the trial court refused to order the state to provide agreement with key witness until trial day.\n\nSupporting Facts: Prior to trial, defense counsel sought information about any agreement the State had with its key witness, an informant. The trial court refused to order that this information be made available until the day of trial. And even when the information was made available it was generalized, and not specific. This delay obviously impeded the ability of defense counsel to properly place issues before the jury as well as prepare a viable defense.\n\nGROUND TWO: Appellant was denied due process of law, a fair trial, and effective assistance of counsel because the court did not order disclosure of an informants (sic) identity.\n\nSupporting Facts: During pretrial discovery, the State arbitrarily marked its discovery submissions as \u201ccounsel only\u201d. What made this procedure problematic and prejudicial was that majority of the evidence was audio and video recordings allegedly reflecting Appellant\u2019s interaction with \u201cconfidential informant\u201d. Counsel never shared any documents with appellant and counsel was also restricted from sharing the audio and video recordings with Appellant. Defense counsel and Appellant was unable to prepare a defense before trial.\n\n\u00b2 Makin asserts he placed his pro se 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254 habeas petition in the prison mail system on June 27, 2018. (ECF No. 1, PageID #: 19)\nGROUND THREE: The trial court erred by failing to give a correct accomplice testimony jury instruction, R.C. 2923.03(D)\n\nSupporting Facts: Because \u201cmay affect her credibility\u201d is omitted in the jury instructions given to the jury and replaced in the sentence with \u201cmay affect her ability\u201d, the jurors were not instructed on the credibility issue and were confused. The specific jury instruction is mandated by the statute.\n\nGROUND FOUR: The trial court erred by failing to give a comprehensive instruction on informants (sic) testimony.\n\nSupporting Facts: It is clear that the jury was not alerted to the special motives of an informant\u2019s testimony also factored with the lack of a general credulity instruction.\n\nGROUND FIVE: The appellant was denied the effective assistance of counsel and fair trial.\n\nSupporting Facts: Defense counsel failed to request an instruction on accomplice testimony and witness credibility and also failed to object to the prosecutors (sic) misconduct about the comments that were made during closing argument and the fact that the prosecutor presented fabricated evidence and conveyed a false testimony as well as assisted the witness in conveying a false testimony.\n\nGROUND SIX: [Prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments and throughout trial deprived appellant of fair trial.]\n\nSupporting Facts: [Prosecutor stated during argument that defense counsel\u2019s arguments were \u201claughable.\u201d The prosecutor also presented fabricated evidence in the form of an audio recording and conveyed a false testimony and assisted the witness in conveying a false testimony at trial.]\n\nGROUND SEVEN: The evidence was insufficient to convict the appellant of drug possession and drug trafficking.\n\nSupporting Facts: The prosecutors claim appellant was involved in eight controlled buys with an informant. On these eight alleged controlled buys its (sic) on record that the DEA never witnessed any of the alleged drug transactions. Its (sic) also a fact a fact that there are no video recordings of appellant making any drug transactions with the informant and none of the alleged marked money was confiscated from appellant or taken off his person at any given time. The audio recordings were unintelligible, inaudible, incomprehensible and all together untrustworthy and due to this particular nature of these alleged audio recordings the informant was\n\n---\n\n3 Ground 6 was initially omitted from the petition. Petitioner moved to amend on the premise that habeas claim six was inadvertently omitted from his petition. (ECF No. 12, Page ID #: 1577, ECF No. 12-2, Page ID #: 1596). Respondent did not oppose the motion to amend. The Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to amend. (ECF No. 13, Page ID #: 1602).\nallowed to interpret the audio recordings for the jury in his own words. The appellant wasn\u2019t arrested after any of the alleged controlled buys.\n\n**GROUND EIGHT:** The trial court erred by aggregating the weight of the drugs in separate counts to meet the major drug offender specification.\n\n**Supporting Facts:** According to the indictment appellant never sold or possessed 100 grams or more of any drugs in any of the counts and alleged controlled buys.\n\n(ECF Nos. 1, 14, 14-1).\n\nRespondent filed the return of writ on December 7, 2018 (ECF No. 10) and the supplemental return of writ to address Ground 6 on January 30, 2019 (ECF No. 15). Petitioner filed his Traverse on March 11, 2019. (ECF No. 20). The Commissioner argued that Grounds 1 through 4, 6, and 8 are not cognizable; Grounds 2 (in part) through 4, and 6 are procedurally defaulted; and Grounds 1 and 3 through 7 are meritless. In his Traverse, Petitioner waived argument on Grounds 1 and 6.\\(^4\\) Makin further stipulated that Grounds 3 and 5 are meritless and Ground 4 is procedurally defaulted. (ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1886). On March 12, 2019, Respondent objected, in part, to the Traverse asserting that Petitioner had presented a new matter regarding the sufficiency of the evidence never before presented to the state courts. (ECF No. 21). Petitioner responded to Respondent\u2019s objection on March 27, 2019. (ECF No. 22).\n\nV. **Legal Standards**\n\nA. **Jurisdiction**\n\nTitle 28, United States Code Section 2254(a) authorizes district courts to entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus \u201con behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\u201d A state prisoner may file a \u00a7 2254 petition in the \u201cdistrict court for the district\n\n\\(^4\\) Although Petitioner waives argument on Grounds 1 and 6 this Court has addressed these grounds as Petitioner is not required to give any additional argument and did not specifically stipulate to the dismissal of these grounds.\nwherein such person is in custody or in the district court for the district within which the State\ncourt was held which convicted and sentenced him.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d). The Court of Common\nPleas of Cuyahoga County sentenced Makin, and Cuyahoga County is within this Court\u2019s\ngeographic jurisdiction. Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction over Makin\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition.\n\nB. Cognizable Federal Claim\n\nUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a), a state prisoner may challenge his custody \u201conly on the ground\nthat he is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d A\npetitioner\u2019s claim is not cognizable on habeas review if it \u201cpresents no federal issue at all.\u201d Bates\nv. McCaughtry, 934 F.2d 99, 101 (7th Cir. 1991). Thus, \u201cerrors in application of state law \u2026 are\nusually not cognizable in federal habeas corpus.\u201d Bey v. Bagley, 500 F.3d 514, 519 (6th Cir. 2007)\n(citing Walker v. Engle, 703 F.2d 959, 962 (6th Cir. 1983)); see also Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S.\n62, 67-68 (1991) (\u201c[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state court\ndeterminations on state law questions.\u201d).\n\nA federal habeas court does not function as an additional state appellate court; it does not\nreview state courts\u2019 decisions on state law or procedure. Allen v. Morris, 845 F.2d 610, 614 (6th\nCir. 1988) (citing Oviedo v. Jago, 809 F.2d 326, 328 (6th Cir. 1987)). Instead, \u201cfederal courts must\ndeer to a state court\u2019s interpretation of its own rules of evidence and procedure\u201d in considering a\nhabeas petition. Id. (quoting Machin v. Wainwright, 758 F.2d 1431, 1433 (11th Cir. 1985)).\nMoreover, \u201cthe doctrine of exhaustion requires that a claim be presented to the state courts under\nthe same theory in which it is later presented in federal court.\u201d Wong v. Money, 142 F.3d 313, 322\n(6th 1998).\n\nC. Exhaustion\nThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\") governs Landrum\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus. See Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 326\u201327 (1997) (holding that the AEDPA governs petitions filed after April 24, 1996); Murphy v. Ohio, 551 F.3d 485, 493 (6th Cir. 2009). Under the AEDPA, state prisoners must either exhaust all possible state remedies or have no remaining state remedies before a federal court can review a petition for writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) and (c); see also Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 515\u201319 (1982). This entails giving the state courts \u201cone full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 845 (1999); Manning v. Alexander, 912 F.2d 878, 881 (6th Cir. 1990) (\u201cThe highest court in the state in which the petitioner was convicted [must have] been given a full and fair opportunity to rule on the petitioner\u2019s claims.\u201d).\n\nD. Procedural Default\n\nProcedural default is a related but \u201cdistinct\u201d concept from exhaustion. Williams v. Anderson, 460 F.3d 789, 806 (6th Cir. 2006). It occurs when a habeas petitioner fails to obtain consideration of a federal constitutional claim by state courts because he failed to: (1) comply with a state procedural rule that prevented the state courts from reaching the merits of the petitioner\u2019s claim; or (2) fairly raise that claim before the state courts while state remedies were still available. See generally Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 80, 84-87 (1977); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 125 n.28 (1982); Williams, 460 F.3d at 806. In determining whether there has been a procedural default, the federal court again looks to the last explained state-court judgment. Ylst v. Nunnemaker, 501 U.S. 797, 805 (1991); Combs v. Coyle, 205 F.3d 269, 275 (6th Cir. 2000). When a state court declines to address a prisoner\u2019s federal claims because the prisoner failed to meet a state procedural requirement, federal habeas review is barred as long as the state judgment rested\non \u201cindependent and adequate\u201d state procedural grounds. *Coleman v. Thompson*, 501 U.S. 722, 729 (1991). To be independent, a state procedural rule and the state courts\u2019 application of it must not rely in any part on federal law. *Id.* at 732-33. To be adequate, a state procedural rule must be \u201c\u2018firmly established\u2019 and \u2018regularly followed\u2019\u201d by the state courts at the time it was applied. *Beard v. Kindler*, 558 U.S. 53, 60-61 (2009).\n\nA petitioner procedurally defaults a claim by failing to \u201cfairly present\u201d the claim in state court when he does not pursue that claim through the state\u2019s \u201c\u2018ordinary appellate review procedures,\u2019\u201d and, at the time of the federal habeas petition, state law no longer allows the petitioner to raise the claim. *Williams*, 460 F.3d at 806 (quoting *O\u2019Sullivan*, 526 U.S. at 848); see also *Baston v. Bagley*, 282 F. Supp. 2d 655, 661 (N.D. Ohio 2003) (\u201cIssues not presented at each and every level [of the state courts] cannot be considered in a federal habeas corpus petition.\u201d). Under these circumstances, while the exhaustion requirement is technically satisfied because there are no longer any state-court remedies available to the petitioner, the petitioner\u2019s failure to have the federal claims fully considered in the state courts constitutes a procedural default of those claims, barring federal habeas review. *Williams*, 460 F.3d at 806 (\u201cWhere state court remedies are no longer available to a petitioner because he or she failed to use them within the required time period, procedural default and not exhaustion bars federal court review.\u201d); see also *Gray v. Netherland*, 518 U.S. 152, 161-62 (1996) (\u201cBecause the exhaustion requirement \u2018refers only to remedies still available at the time of the federal petition,\u2019 . . ., it is satisfied \u2018if it is clear that [the habeas petitioner\u2019s] claims are now procedurally barred under [state] law\u2019 . . . .\u201d (internal citations omitted)).\n\nFurthermore, to \u201cfairly present\u201d a claim to a state court, a petitioner must assert both its legal and factual basis. *Williams*, 460 F.3d at 806 (citing *McMeans v. Brigano*, 228 F.3d 674, 681\nMost importantly, a \u201cpetitioner must present his claim to the state courts as a federal constitutional issue \u2013 not merely as an issue arising under state law.\u201d Id. (quoting Koontz v. Glossa, 731 F.2d 365, 368 (6th Cir. 1984)). A petitioner can overcome a procedural default by demonstrating cause for the default and actual prejudice that resulted from the alleged violation of federal law, or that there will be a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice\u201d if the claim is not considered. Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750. \u201c[C]ause\u2019 under the cause and prejudice test must be something external to the petitioner, something that cannot be fairly attributed to him.\u201d Id. \u201c[T]he existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply with the State\u2019s procedural rule.\u201d Id. \u201cA fundamental miscarriage of justice results from the conviction of one who is \u2018actually innocent.\u2019\u201d Lundgren v. Mitchell, 440 F.3d 754, 764 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496 (1986)).\n\nE. Standard of Review\n\nThe AEDPA provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n(d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim \u2013\n\n(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or\n\n(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\n\nTo determine whether relief should be granted, the Court must use the \u201clook-through\u201d methodology and look to the \u201clast explained state-court judgment\u201d on the petitioner\u2019s federal claim. Ylst, 501 U.S. at 804 (\u201cThe essence of unexplained orders is that they say nothing. We think\nthat a presumption which gives them no effect\u2014which simply \u2018looks through\u2019 them to the last reasoned decision\u2014most nearly reflects the role they are ordinarily intended to play.\u201d); *Wilson v. Sellers*, 138 S. Ct. 1188, 1193 (2018) (\u201cWe conclude that federal habeas law employs a \u2018look through\u2019 presumption.\u201d).\n\n\u201cA decision is \u2018contrary to\u2019 clearly established federal law when \u2018the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the Supreme Court on a question of law or decides a case differently than the Supreme Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u2019\u201d *Otte v. Houk*, 654 F.3d 594, 599 (6th Cir. 2011) (quoting *Williams v. Taylor*, 529 U.S. 362, 412-13 (2000)). \u201cClearly established Federal law for purposes of \u00a7 2254(d)(1) includes only the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of [the Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions.\u201d *White v. Woodall*, 572 U.S. 415, 419 (2014) (quotations and citations omitted). \u201c[U]nder the unreasonable application clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d *Lockyer v. Andrade*, 538 U.S. 63, 75 (2003). \u201cThe unreasonable application clause requires the state court decision to be more than incorrect or erroneous\u201d\u2014it must be \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d *Id.*\n\nUnder \u00a7 2254(d)(2), \u201cwhen a federal habeas petitioner challenges the factual basis for a prior state-court decision rejecting a claim, the federal court may overturn the state court\u2019s decision only if it was \u2018based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u2019\u201d *Burt v. Titlow*, 571 U.S. 12, 18 (2013) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2)). A state-court decision is an \u201cunreasonable determination of the facts\u201d under \u00a7 2254(d)(2) only if the trial court made a \u201cclear factual error.\u201d *Wiggins v. Smith*, 539 U.S. 510, 528 (2003). A state court\u2019s factual determination is not unreasonable merely because the federal habeas\ncourt would have reached a different conclusion in the first instance. *Wood v. Allen*, 558 U.S. 290, 301 (2010). Even if \u201c[r]easonable minds reviewing the record might disagree\u201d about the finding in question, \u201con habeas review that does not suffice to supersede the trial court\u2019s \u2026 determination.\u201d *Rice v. Collins*, 546 U.S. 333, 341-42 (2006). The prisoner bears the burden of rebutting the state court\u2019s factual findings \u201cby clear and convincing evidence.\u201d *Burt*, 571 U.S. at 18 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1)).\n\nFor state prisoners, the \u00a7 2254(d) standard \u201cis difficult to meet\u2026 because it is meant to be.\u201d *Harrington v. Richter*, 562 U.S. 86, 102 (2011). This is because, \u201c[a]s amended by AEDPA, \u00a7 2254(d) is meant only to stop short of imposing a complete bar on federal-court relitigation of claims already rejected in state proceedings.\u201d *Id.* 103. \u201cIt preserves authority to issue the writ in cases where there is no possibility [that] fairminded jurists could disagree that the state courts decision conflicts with this Court\u2019s precedents\u201d and \u201cgoes no further.\u201d *Id.* Thus, in order to obtain federal habeas corpus relief, \u201ca state prisoner must show that the state court\u2019s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d *Id.*\n\nVI. Discussion\n\nA. Ground 1\n\nIn Ground 1 Makin asserts that he was denied due process of law when the trial court ordered that certain information be provided to him the day of trial and that because of the timing of the disclosure, his counsel could not effectively prepare his defense. (ECF No. 14, PageID #: 1607). Respondent argues that Ground 1 is not cognizable and, alternatively, meritless under the\nAEDPA. (ECF No. 10, PageID #: 62). Petitioner waived argument regarding Ground 1. (ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1887).\n\nPrior to trial, defense counsel moved for an order requiring the prosecution to provide information regarding any deals it had made with testifying witnesses. The trial court granted the request but explained that the government need only reveal the requested information once the jury was impaneled and sworn in. Petitioner argues that the delay in the government providing the information \u201cimpeded the ability of defense counsel to properly place issues before the jury as well as prepare a viable defense.\u201d (ECF No. 14, PageID #: 1607).\n\nAssuming arguendo that his due process claim is properly presented to this Court, it lacks merit. \u201cThere is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case.\u201d Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U.S. 545, 559 (1977). Rather, \u201cin most criminal prosecutions, the Brady rule, Rule 16 and the Jencks Act, exhaust the universe of discovery to which the defendant is entitled.\u201d United States v. Presser, 844 F. 2d 1275, 1285 n.12 (6th Cir. 1988). \u201cBrady also applies to the nondisclosure of evidence affecting the credibility of a witness whose \u2018reliability ... may ... be determinative of guilt or innocence.\u2019\u201d United States v. Blood, 435 F.3d 612, 627 (6th Cir. 2006) (quoting Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 153\u201354, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) (quotation omitted); see also United States v. Jones, 399 F.3d 640, 647 (6th Cir. 2005)). \u201cBrady generally does not apply to delayed disclosure of exculpatory information, but only to a complete\n\n---\n\n5 Merely using constitutional phrases like \u201cfair trial\u201d or \u201cdue process of law\u201d does not constitute raising a federal constitutional issue. Slaughter v. Parker, 450 F.3d 224, 236 (6th Cir. 2006); Franklin v. Rose, 811 F.2d 322, 326 (6th Cir. 1987); McMeans v. Brigano, 228 F.3d 674, 681 (6th Cir. 2000), citing Petrucelli v. Coombe, 735 F.2d 684, 688-89 (2nd Cir. 1984). Mere use of the words \u201cdue process and a fair trial by an impartial jury\u201d are insufficient. Slaughter, 450 F.3d at 236; Blackmon v. Booker, 394 F.3d 399, 400 (6th Cir. 2004) (same). \u201cA lawyer need not develop a constitutional argument at length, but he must make one; the words \u2018due process\u2019 are not an argument.\u201d Riggins v. McGinnis, 50 F.3d 492, 494 (7th Cir. 1995).\nfailure to disclose\u201d and that a \u201c[d]elay only violates Brady when the delay itself causes prejudice.\u201d\n\nSee United States v. Bencs, 28 F.3d 555, 560\u201361 (6th Cir. 1994).\n\nHere, Makin does not assert that the government failed to disclose information. Instead, Makin\u2019s argument addresses the timing of the government\u2019s disclosure of the information relating to deals made with witnesses in exchange for the witnesses\u2019 testimony at trial. This information relates to the witness\u2019s credibility. However, because testimony regarding any benefits provided to the witnesses was elicited at trial (see ECF No. 10-3, PageID #: 816-817, 827, ECF No. 10-3, PageID #: 1188-1207) and the delay in disclosure did not result in prejudice, the Court finds no Giglio/Brady violation here.\n\nTo the extent Petitioner attempts to assert a Jencks Act violation, this too fails. Jencks does not require such material to be turned over until after the witness testifies. See Presser, 844 F.2d at 1283 (\u201cthe government may not be compelled to disclose Jencks Act material before trial.\u201d).\n\nAccordingly, there is no Constitutional right that was infringed by the trial court ordering the government to turn over the requested information after the jury was sworn in. Moreover, a trial court has discretion to delay the disclosure of a prospective witness to protect his or her safety under Ohio Crim. R. 16(D).6\n\nHaving found that no Constitutional right was infringed, it follows that Petitioner cannot meet the higher standard required for relief under the AEDPA.\n\nAccordingly, the Court recommends denying Ground 1.\n\n6 Petitioner has not claimed that Ohio Crim. R. 16(D) violates the U.S. Constitution. Moreover, any argument that the trial court erred in its application of 16(D) would be premised upon state law and not cognizable in this federal habeas proceeding.\nB. Ground 2\n\nIn Ground 2 Petitioner asserts that he was denied due process of law and a fair trial because the court did not order disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity prior to trial, and that because of that violation his counsel was unable to be effective. (ECF No. 14, PageID #: 1609). Respondent argues that Ground 2 is not cognizable in part and procedurally defaulted in part. Petitioner argues that Ground 2 is cognizable but fails to support his statement with any caselaw or argument. Petitioner does not address Respondent\u2019s procedural default argument. (ECF No. at 37-39). Petitioner argues that \u201cDuring pretrial discovery, the State arbitrarily marked its discovery submissions as \u2018counsel only\u2019. What made this procedure problematic and prejudicial was that majority of the evidence was audio and video recordings allegedly reflecting Appellant\u2019s interaction with \u2018confidential informant\u2019. Counsel never shared any documents with appellant and counsel was also restricted from sharing the audio and video recordings with Appellant. Defense counsel and Appellant was unable to prepare a defense before trial.\u201d (ECF No. 14, PageID #: 1609). In his Traverse, Petitioner acknowledges that his defense counsel shared documents with him. He focuses, instead, on the fact that the identity of the informant was not provided prior to trial and certain audio and video recordings were restricted as \u201ccounsel only\u201d pursuant to Ohio Crim. R. 16(D).7 (ECF No. at 37).\n\nTo the extent Makin asserts a constitutional violation based on the trial court\u2019s order granting certification of the confidential informant\u2019s identity, he has not stated a claim for federal habeas relief. See McDaniel v. Hoffner, No. 17-1453, 2017 WL 4857554, at *2 (6th Cir. Sept. 12, 2017) (citing McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300, 312\u201314 (1967) (declining to find that the federal constitution mandates the disclosure of confidential informants); Phillips v. Cardwell, 482 F.2d\n\n7 See Footnote 6.\n1348, 1349 (6th Cir. 1973) (stating that it is doubtful that a claim for failure to produce the identity of an informant is cognizable in habeas corpus).\n\nMakin\u2019s reliance on *Roviaro v. United States*, 353 U.S. 53 (1957), is misplaced. \u201cRoviaro was an exercise of the Supreme Court\u2019s supervisory power over lower federal courts.\u201d *Nelson v. Burton*, No. 1:15-CV-251, 2018 WL 1179667, at *9 (W.D. Mich. Feb. 20, 2018), *report and recommendation adopted*, No. 1:15-CV-251, 2018 WL 1174140 (W.D. Mich. Mar. 6, 2018) (citing *Roviaro*, 353 U.S. at 59\u201361; *Phillips*, 482 F.2d at 1349 (*Roviaro*\u2019s ruling \u201cwas made in a case on direct appeal and in the Court\u2019s supervisory jurisdiction, not as a matter of constitutional law.\u201d)). \u201cBecause habeas corpus lies only for violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, it is highly doubtful whether a claim under is cognizable in habeas corpus.\u201d *Phillips*, 482 F.3d at 1349.\n\nAccordingly, Makin\u2019s claim for failure to produce the identity of an informant is not cognizable in habeas corpus.\n\nTo the extent Makin asserts a constitutional violation occurred by restricting certain audio and video recordings as \u201ccounsel only\u201d, this claim is procedurally defaulted as Makin failed to present the claim to the state court. As discussed above, \u201ca petitioner may procedurally default a claim by failing to [fairly] raise a claim in state court, and pursue that claim through the state\u2019s \u2018ordinary appellate review procedures.\u2019\u201d *Williams*, 460 F.3d at 806. \u201cIf, at the time of the federal habeas petition, state law no longer allows the petitioner to raise the claim, the claim is procedurally defaulted.\u201d *Id.* As noted above, \u201cto fairly present a claim a petitioner must assert both the legal and factual basis for his or her claim.\u201d *Id.* Here, Makin does not argue that he fairly presented this factual basis for a Fourteenth Amendment claim in state court.\nIn his third assignment of error raised on direct appeal, Makin argued that he was \u201cdenied due process of law, a fair trial, and effective assistance of counsel because the court did not order the disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity.\u201d (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 139). The majority of his argument takes issue with the trial court\u2019s timing for requiring the government to reveal the identity of the informant. (See ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 139-143). As an aside, Makin states:\n\nDuring pretrial discovery, the State arbitrarily marked its submissions as \u201cCounsel Only.\u201d What made this procedure problematic was that the majority of the evidence was audio and video recordings reflecting Mr. Makin\u2019s interaction with a confidential informant (\u201cCRI\u201d). Accordingly, while counsel could share documents with Mr. Makin, he was restricted from sharing the audio and video recordings with Mr. Makin. This assignment of error must also consider the court\u2019s refusal to remove the \u201cCounsel Only\u201d tag. The judge confused this issue with disclosure of the CRI\u2019s identity, Tr. 131. In short, restricting the recordings was done to prevent Mr. Makin from identifying the CRI; this was improper. And, Crim R 16 requires disclosure of recorded statements of any State\u2019s witness, Crim R 16(B)(7); and a witness list, Crim R 16(1). (ECF No. 10-1, PageID #: 139). Makin\u2019s argument that the trial court violated Ohio Crim. R. 16 does not fairly present this issue in a manner that suggests a federal constitutional claim. See Williams, 460 F.3d at 806. Accordingly, Makin has procedurally defaulted this claim.\n\nBecause Makin\u2019s ground for relief is procedurally defaulted, he must demonstrate that cause excuses his default and that he was prejudiced by the alleged constitutional violation. Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750. Makin does not argue cause for his procedural default. Thus, as Makin fails to demonstrate cause for his procedural default, his default is not excused.\n\nAccordingly, Petitioner\u2019s Ground 2 is not cognizable in part and procedurally defaulted in part and should be dismissed.\n\nC. Ground 3\nIn Ground 3 Petitioner asserts that the \u201ctrial court erred by failing to give a correct accomplice testimony jury instruction, R.C. 2923.03(D).\u201d (ECF No. 14, PageID #: 1610). Respondent argues that Ground 3 is not cognizable, procedurally defaulted, and meritless. Petitioner agrees that Ground 3 is meritless under the AEDPA. (ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1886). Accordingly, the Court recommends denying Ground 3.\n\nD. Ground 4\n\nIn Ground 4 Petitioner asserts that the \u201ctrial court erred by failing to give a comprehensive instruction on informants [sic] testimony.\u201d (ECF No. 14, PageID #: 1612). Respondent argues that Ground 4 is not cognizable, procedurally defaulted, and meritless. Specifically, Respondent argues that the issue was reviewed for and denied on the basis of plain error in the state appellate court and is, therefore, procedurally defaulted. (ECF No. 10, PageID #: 72). Petitioner agrees that Ground 4 is procedurally defaulted. (ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1886). This Court agrees. See *Lundgren v. Mitchell*, 440 F.3d 754, 765 (6th Cir. 2006) (holding that \u201ca state court\u2019s plain error analysis does not save a petitioner from procedural default\u201d); *Seymour v. Walker*, 224 F.3d 542, 557 (6th Cir. 2000) (holding that habeas petitioners cannot resurrect procedurally defaulted claims on the sole basis that a state court has applied plain-error review to the issue on direct appeal).\n\nAccordingly, the Court recommends dismissing Ground 4.\n\nE. Ground 5\n\nIn Ground 5, Petitioner asserts that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial because his counsel did not request an instruction on accomplice testimony and witness credibility and did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. (ECF No. 14-1, PageID #:}\n1618). Respondent argues that Ground 5 is meritless. Petitioner agrees. (ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1886). Accordingly, the Court recommends denying Ground 5.\n\nF. Ground 6\n\nIn Ground 6, Petitioner asserts that prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments and throughout trial deprived him of a fair trial. (ECF No. 14-1, PageID #: 1619). In support of Ground 6, Petitioner states \u201cProsecutor stated during argument that defense counsel\u2019s arguments were \u2018laughable.\u2019 The prosecutor also presented fabricated evidence in the form of an audio recording and conveyed a false testimony and assisted the witness in conveying a false testimony at trial.\u201d Respondent argued Ground 6 is not cognizable, procedurally defaulted, and meritless under the AEDPA. Petitioner waived argument regarding Ground 6. (ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1886).\n\nTo the extent Ground 6 takes issue with the prosecutor\u2019s remark during closing argument, the Court finds this issue procedurally defaulted. In order for procedural default to apply, (1) there must be a firmly established state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner\u2019s claim and the petitioner must not have complied with the rule; (2) the last state court to which the petitioner sought review must have invoked the procedural rule as a basis for its decision to reject review of the federal claims; and (3) the procedural default must be an \u201cadequate and independent\u201d state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim. Maupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138-39 (6th Cir. 1986).\n\nMakin failed to adhere to the firmly-established Ohio contemporaneous objection rule, which is an independent and adequate state ground that the Ohio appellate court invoked as the basis for its decision to apply plain error review only. State v. Makin, 2017-Ohio-2649, \u00b6 35. See Scott v. Mitchell, 209 F.3d 854, 866 (6th Cir. 2000) (recognizing Ohio\u2019s contemporaneous objection rule as an adequate and independent state ground). Makin\u2019s attorney failed to object to\nthe prosecutor stating that defense counsel\u2019s arguments were \u201claughable\u201d. The state court of appeals, recognizing this, conducted plain error review of the issue and found no error. (State v. Makin, 2017-Ohio-2649, \u00b6\u00b633-40).\n\nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has \u201cheld that an Ohio court\u2019s enforcement of the contemporaneous-objection rule is \u201c\u2018an independent and adequate state ground\u2019 of decision\u201d sufficient to bar habeas relief.\u201d Hand v. Houk, 871 F.3d 390, 417 (6th Cir. 2017) (citing Wogenstahl v. Mitchell, 668 F.3d 307, 336 (6th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted)). Therefore, Makin is barred from raising this claim for relief in a habeas petition unless he can demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the default. Hand, 871 F.3d at 417; Keith v. Mitchell, 455 F.3d 662, 674 (6th Cir. 2006) (\u201cAbsent cause and prejudice, a federal court may not reach the merits of claim that has been procedurally defaulted in state court.\u201d). Makin does not argue cause for his procedural default. Nor has the petitioner shown actual innocence. See Gray, 518 U.S. at 162; Hannah v. Conley, 49 F.3d 1193, 1196, n. 3 (6th Cir. 1995)); see also Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750\u201351. Thus, as Makin fails to demonstrate cause for his procedural default or actual innocence, his default is not excused\n\nMakin\u2019s claim that \u201c[t]he prosecutor also presented fabricated evidence in the form of an audio recording and conveyed a false testimony and assisted the witness in conveying a false testimony at trial\u201d is also procedurally defaulted as he failed to raise the issue before the state courts. The doctrine of exhaustion requires that a prosecutorial misconduct claim be presented to the state courts under the same theory as the prosecutorial misconduct claim being raised in the habeas petition. Williams v. Bagley, 380 F.3d 932, 969 (6th Cir. 2004). On direct appeal Makin took issue only with the prosecutor\u2019s remarks that the defense\u2019s argument was \u201claughable.\u201d (ECF No. 10-1, Page ID#149-152). The remainder of Makin\u2019s supporting facts \u2013 that the prosecution\n\u201cfabricated evidence in the form of an audio recording and conveyed a false testimony and assisted the witness in conveying a false testimony at trial\u201d \u2013 was not alleged before the state court. Notably, Makin does not argue that he fairly presented this factual basis in state court. Makin has failed to present, and therefore to exhaust, the prosecutorial misconduct claim addressed above.\n\nHowever, the exhaustion requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A) and (c) do not bar review of claims where, such as here, a petitioner no longer has state remedies available to him. Rust v. Zent, 17 F.3d 155, 160 (6th Cir. 1994) (holding that failure exhaust bars review only when the state still provides a remedy to exhaust). Makin is barred from presenting his claims to the state courts because he had the opportunity to raise the issues during the course of his direct appeal but failed to do so. See State v. Roberts, 1 Ohio St.3d 36, 39 (1982) (the doctrine of res judicata precludes a petitioner from asserting constitutional issues in a postconviction proceeding that were not raised \u201cat the earliest possible time\u201d). Instead, the Court must apply the procedural default rules to those claims. As discussed above, \u201ca petitioner may procedurally default a claim by failing to [fairly] raise a claim in state court, and pursue that claim through the state\u2019s \u2018ordinary appellate review procedures.\u2019\u201d Williams, 460 F.3d at 806. \u201cIf, at the time of the federal habeas petition, state law no longer allows the petitioner to raise the claim, the claim is procedurally defaulted.\u201d Id. As noted above, \u201cto fairly present a claim a petitioner must assert both the legal and factual basis for his or her claim.\u201d Id. The Court may review a prisoner\u2019s procedurally defaulted claims on the merits only if he shows cause for not raising his claims at all levels of state court review and prejudice, or that he is actually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted. See Gray, 518 U.S. at162; Hannah, 49 F.3d at 1196, n. 3; Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750\u201351. The petitioner has neither alleged nor established cause to excuse his procedural default on these claims. When cause has not been shown, the Court need not consider whether actual prejudice has been demonstrated.\nSee, e.g., Smith v. Murray, 477 U.S. 527, 533 (1986); Long v. McKeen, 722 F.2d 286, 289 (6th Cir. 1983). Nor has the petitioner shown actual innocence. Therefore, his procedural default will not be excused on this ground. The newly raised portions of Petitioner\u2019s Ground 6 claim of prosecutorial misconduct are barred by procedural default.\n\nAccordingly, Petitioner\u2019s Ground 6 procedurally defaulted and should be dismissed.\n\nG. Ground 7\n\nIn Ground 7, Petitioner asserts that the \u201cevidence was insufficient to convict the appellant of drug possession and drug trafficking.\u201d (ECF No. 14-1, PageID #: 1620). Makin includes the following supporting facts:\n\nThe prosecutors claim appellant was involved in eight controlled buys with an informant. On these eight alleged controlled buys its (sic) on record that the DEA never witnessed any of the alleged drug transactions. Its (sic) also a fact a fact that there are no video recordings of appellant making any drug transactions with the informant and none of the alleged marked money was confiscated from appellant or taken off his person at any given time. The audio recordings were unintelligible, inaudible, incomprehensible and all together untrustworthy and due to this particular nature of these alleged audio recordings the informant was allowed to interpret the audio recordings for the jury in his own words. The appellant wasn\u2019t arrested after any of the alleged controlled buys.\n\n(ECF No. 14-1, PageID #: 1620). Respondent argued that Ground 7 is meritless. Petitioner\u2019s Traverse renumbers the issue as Ground 1 and states: \u201cThe evidence was insufficient to convict petitioner of drug trafficking, drug possession, MDO specifications and schoolyard specifications.\u201d (ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1848). Specifically, Petitioner contests the credibility of the witnesses. (See ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1848-1883). Respondent objects to the Traverse and argues that it raises new claims and factual bases not previously argued before any court. (ECF No. 21). Petitioner argues that he was supplementing and clarifying the record by including new facts but that he did not change the substance of his claim. (ECF No. 22, generally).\nA. New Claims Raised in Traverse\n\nTo the extent Makin attempts to raise in his Traverse sufficiency of the evidence claims regarding his MDO specification and schoolyard specifications, the Court agrees with Respondent that Makin failed to raise these issues in his habeas petition. (Compare ECF No. 14-1, PageID #: 1620 with ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1848). \u201cNew issues may not be raised in the traverse.\u201d McClendon v. Wainwright, No. 1:17 CV 0589, 2018 WL 7982929, at *3 (N.D. Ohio Nov. 13, 2018), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:17 CV 589, 2019 WL 1558739 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 10, 2019) (citing Burns v. Lafler, 328 F. Supp. 2d 711, 724 (E.D. Mich. 2004) (citation omitted) (\u201c[A] court cannot consider new issues raised in a traverse or reply to the State\u2019s answer.\u201d)). Thus, the Court will not address these new issues.\n\nB. Drug Trafficking and Drug Possession\n\nGround 7 of the petition claims a violation of due process on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict on his drug possession and drug trafficking charges. (ECF No. 14-1, PageID #: 1620). Makin asserted this issue on direct appeal and in his petition. Respondent asserts that Makin improperly raises facts in his Traverse that he had previously failed to raise before any court. Makin\u2019s Traverse provides nearly 36 pages of argument and facts for Ground 7, many of which were not included in his manifest weight or sufficiency arguments at the state level. (See ECF No. 14-1, PageID #: 155-163). Indeed, Makin acknowledges that he raises new facts but argues that he does so in order to supplement and clarify the record. To the extent these \u201cfacts\u201d were not presented before to state courts, it is improper for Makin to raise them on habeas review. See Davis v. Gray, No. 1:19 CV 1527, 2020 WL 4004490, at *5 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 28, 2020), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:19CV1527, 2020 WL 4003040 (N.D. Ohio July 15, 2020), appeal dismissed, No. 20-3888, 2021 WL 688840 (6th Cir.\nFeb. 3, 2021) (\u201cA petitioner who did not take or seek the opportunity to develop evidence in his state trial, direct appeal and post-conviction proceedings will be deemed to have failed to develop the factual basis of the claim. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2). Such a situation precludes the habeas court from considering new facts presented for the first time in federal habeas proceedings or granting an evidentiary hearing to consider the new facts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2) is designed to restrict the development of facts in federal habeas proceedings that were not known or considered by a state court.\u201d).\n\nHowever, the majority of Makin\u2019s arguments and facts merely attack the credibility of the evidence presented. (See ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1848-1883). The Court need not determine whether these factual bases are properly presented to this court because this habeas court does not reconsider the credibility of witnesses. White v. Steele, 602 F.3d 707, 710 (6th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 562 U.S. 858 (2010) (quoting Brown v. Konteh, 567 F.3d 191, 205 (6th Cir. 2009) (This court does \u201cnot reweigh the evidence, re-evaluate the credibility of witnesses, or substitute our judgment for that of the jury.\u201d); see, e.g., McKenzie v. Smith, 326 F.3d 721, 727 (6th Cir. 2003) cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1158 (2004) (It is the province of the trier of fact to resolve conflicts in testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented.)). The Supreme Court has emphasized that \u201cit is the responsibility of the jury \u2014 not the court \u2014 to decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial.\u201d Cavazos v. Smith, 565 U.S. 1, 2 (2011) (per curiam). Jackson \u201cunambiguously instructs that a reviewing court \u2018faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume \u2014 even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record \u2014 that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\u2019 \u201d Cavazos, 565 U.S. at 7 (quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 326 (1979). Additionally, to the extent that Makin tries to weave\nother issues into his sufficiency of the evidence claim (see ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1848-1883 (alleging instances of \u201cfalse testimony\u201d, \u201cprosecutorial misconduct\u201d, \u201cfraud\u201d, \u201cperjury\u201d in support of his sufficiency claim)), this is also improper.\n\nNonetheless, this Court recognizes that Makin has properly brought this sufficiency of the evidence claim in relation to his drug trafficking and drug possession convictions and will consider the facts properly before it when analyzing this claim.\n\nMakin raised on direct appeal the sufficiency of the evidence to support a guilty verdict on his drug possession and drug trafficking charges; the state court of appeals ruled as follows:\n\n\u00b6 41 Makin argues that his convictions are against the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. We combine the related ninth and tenth errors for response.\n\n\u00b6 42 The Ohio Supreme Court has explained that, \u201c[t]he legal concepts of sufficiency of the evidence and weight of the evidence are both quantitatively and qualitatively different.\u201d State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). \u201cSufficiency of the evidence is a test of adequacy as to whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support a verdict as a matter of law, but weight of the evidence addresses the evidence's effect of inducing belief.\u201d State v. Wilson, 113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007\u2013Ohio\u20132202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, \u00b6 25, citing Thompkins at 386\u2013387. An appellate court, \u201cmay determine that a judgment of a trial court is sustained by sufficient evidence, that court may nevertheless conclude that the judgment is against the weight of the evidence.\u201d Thompkins at 387.\n\n\u00b6 43 The question of \u201cwhether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a verdict is a question of law. State v. Robinson, 162 Ohio St. 486, 124 N.E.2d 148 (1955).\u201d Thompkins at 386. It is \u201can inquiry about due process, * * * the resolution of which does not allow the court to weigh the evidence.\u201d State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\n\n\u00b6 44 In a sufficiency inquiry, an appellate court does not assess whether the state\u2019s evidence is to be believed but whether, if believed, the evidence admitted at trial supported the conviction. State v. Starks, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 91682, 2009\u2013Ohio\u20133375, \u00b6 25, citing Thompkins at 387. \u201cThe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution,\nany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d State v. Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004\u2013Ohio\u20136235, 818 N.E.2d 229, quoting State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus. The weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of fact. State v. Tenace, 109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006\u2013Ohio\u20132417, 847 N.E.2d 386.\n\n\u00b6 45 After consideration of whether the evidence is sufficient as a matter of law, a manifest weight inquiry looks at whether the evidence was substantial enough for a jury to reasonably conclude that all of the elements of the alleged crime have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellate court sits \u201c\u2018as a thirteenth juror.\u2019\u201d Thompkins at 387, quoting Tibbs v. Florida, 457 U.S. 31, 42, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 72 L.Ed.2d 652 (1982). The appellate court reviews the entire record, considers the credibility of the witnesses, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, and determines whether the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. Martin at 175; Leonard at 68.\n\n\u00b6 46 In weighing the evidence, we consider whether a greater amount of credible trial evidence supports \u201cone side of the issue rather than the other.\u201d Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 1997\u2013Ohio\u201352, 678 N.E.2d 541. It indicates clearly to the jury that the party having the burden of proof will be entitled to their verdict, if, on weighing the evidence in their minds, they shall find the greater amount of credible evidence sustains the issue which is to be established before them. Weight is not a question of mathematics, but depends on its effect in inducing belief.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1594 (6 Ed.1990). Id. We sit as a \u201cthirteenth juror,\u201d reviewing the entire record to determine whether the jury \u201cclearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 485 N.E.2d 717.\n\n\u00b6 47 The jury heard testimony from Harmon who was present at the first controlled buy, the task force members present at each of the controlled buys, testimony from the CI regarding each controlled buy, and both video and audio evidence of the buys. Testimony included the amount of the drugs purchased, the payment, and testing of the drugs to confirm chemical composition.\n\n\u00b6 48 Based on a thorough review of the record, we do not find that the verdict in this case is against the manifest weight of the evidence, nor is the evidence insufficient as a matter of law. The ninth and tenth errors are overruled.\nState v. Makin, 2017-Ohio-2649, \u00b6\u00b6 41-48. The state court of appeals relied on state law, rather than federal law, in addressing the sufficiency of the evidence claim. The state court, however, relied on State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 390, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), and State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991) (syllabus), which follow the sufficiency of evidence standard set forth in Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979). Thus, the issue is whether the state court decision was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law; in other words, whether the state court identified the correct governing legal principle from Supreme Court decisions, but unreasonably applied that principle to the facts of Makin\u2019s case. Williams, 529 U.S. at 410-412; Bolton v. Harris, No. 1:18CV1164, 2021 WL 1930239, at *31 (N.D. Ohio Apr. 7, 2021), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:18 CV 1164, 2021 WL 1929117 (N.D. Ohio May 13, 2021).\n\nUnder Jackson, a sufficiency of the evidence claim is reviewed by determining whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. 443 U.S. at 319; see also Cavazos, 565 U.S. at 7; Bagby v. Sowders, 894 F.2d 792, 794 (6th Cir. 1990). The state court correctly identified and applied the governing legal principle as set forth in Jackson. See State v. Makin, 2017-Ohio-2649, \u00b6\u00b6 40-48.\n\nOn habeas review, \u201cthe Jackson v. Virginia standard is so demanding that \u2018[a] defendant who challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction faces a nearly insurmountable hurdle.\u2019 \u201d Davis v. Lafler, 658 F.3d 525, 534 (6th Cir. 2011) (en banc), cert. denied, 566 U.S. 947 (2012) (quoting United States v. Oros, 578 F.3d 703, 710 (7th Cir. 2009)). The Supreme Court has affirmed that \u201cJackson claims face a high bar in federal habeas proceedings.\u201d Coleman, 566 U.S. at 651. A federal habeas court may overturn the state court\u2019s\nsufficiency of the evidence decision \u201conly if the state court decision was \u2018objectively unreasonable.\u2019\u201d *Id.* (citing *Cavazos*, 565 U.S. at 4).\n\nA sufficiency of the evidence claim \u201cmust be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.\u201d *Sanford v. Yukins*, 288 F.3d 855, 860 (6th Cir.), *cert. denied*, 537 U.S. 980 (2002) (quoting *Jackson*, 443 U.S. at 324 n.16). Thus, the federal court must look to state law to determine the elements of the crime. *See Palmer v. Palmer*, No. 1:15-CV-458, 2018 WL 7891722, at *15 (W.D. Mich. Oct. 29, 2018), report and recommendation adopted, No. 1:15-CV-458, 2019 WL 1429258 (W.D. Mich. Mar. 29, 2019) (citing *Johnson v. United States*, 559 U.S. 133, 138 (2010) (\u201cWe are, however, bound by the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of state law, including its determination of the elements ....\u201d); *Jackson*, 443 U.S. at 324 n.16 (\u201cThe respondents have suggested that this constitutional standard will invite intrusions upon the power of the States to define criminal offenses. Quite to the contrary, the standard must be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.\u201d).\n\nTo be guilty of possession under Ohio R.C. 2925.11(A), the offender must \u2018knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance.\u201d To be guilty of trafficking under Ohio R.C. 2925.03(A), the offender must knowingly \u201c(1) [s]ell or offer to sell a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog;\u201d or \u201c(2) [p]repare for shipment, ship, transport, deliver, prepare for distribution, or distribute a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog, when the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the controlled substance or a controlled substance analog is intended for sale or resale by the offender or another person.\u201d Here, the state court\u2019s opinion, quoted above, recounts the evidence that supports a conviction on the elements of drug possession and drug trafficking. *State v. Makin*, 2017-Ohio-2649, \u00b647. The state court also\naddressed Makin\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. *State v. Makin*, 2017-Ohio-2649, \u00b648 (see quoted paragraph above).\n\nReviewing the state court\u2019s determination on these issues, this court cannot find that the state court\u2019s decision is an objectively unreasonable application of federal law. The evidence supporting the convictions included evidence from each of the controlled buys, including audio and video evidence of the buys, testimony from the agents who witnessed the controlled buys, testimony from the CI who participated in the buys, and testimony regarding the amount of the drugs purchased, the payment, and testing of the drugs to confirm chemical composition. Makin has failed to demonstrate that the state court determination resulted in a decision that involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. Consequently, Ground 7 should be denied.\n\n**H. Ground 8**\n\nIn Ground 8, Petitioner asserts that the \u201ctrial court erred by aggregating the weight of the drugs in separate counts to meet the major drug offender specification.\u201d (ECF No. 14-1, PageID #: 1622). Respondent argues that Ground 8 is not cognizable. Specifically, Respondent argues the major drug offender specification and the question of aggregation are state sentencing issues and, therefore, not cognizable in this forum. (ECF No. 10, PageID #: 82). Petitioner agrees. (ECF No. 20, PageID #: 1887). Accordingly, the Court recommends dismissing Ground 8.\n\n**VII. Certificate of Appealability**\n\n**A. Legal Standard**\n\nA habeas petitioner may not appeal the denial of his application for a writ of habeas corpus unless a judge issues a certificate of appealability and specifies the issues that can be raised on appeal. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (\u201cA certificate of appealability may issue \u2026 only if the applicant has\nmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d). The \u201cpetitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d Tennard v. Dretke, 542 U.S. 274, 282 (2004) (quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000)). The granting of a certificate of appealability does not require a showing that the appeal would succeed on any claim. Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 337 (2003).\n\nB. Analysis\n\nMakin\u2019s grounds for relief are either meritless, not cognizable, or procedurally defaulted. If the Court accepts the foregoing recommendation, then Makin has not made a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right. He would then not be entitled to a certificate of appealability. Thus, I recommend that the Court not issue to Makin a certificate of appealability.\n\nVIII. Recommendation\n\nPetitioner Makin has presented only meritless, not cognizable, or procedurally defaulted claims. Thus, I recommend that the Court DENY Makin\u2019s petition and not grant him a certificate of appealability.\n\nDATED: July 19, 2021\n\n/s/ Carmen E. Henderson\nCarmen E.

Bridges, 2018-Ohio-4113.] \nTIM McCORMACK, P.J.: \n  {\u00b61}  Defendant-appellant Andrey Bridges appeals pro se from the trial court\u2019s \ndenial of his \u201cmotion to leave to file void or voidable judgment.\u201d  For the reasons that \nfollow, we affirm the trial court.  \n{\u00b62}  In November 2013, a jury convicted Bridges of murder, felonious assault, \ntampering with evidence, and abuse of a corpse in relation to the death of Carl Acoff.  \nThe trial court sentenced Bridges to an aggregate term of life in prison with the possibility \nof parole after 18 years and six months.  Bridges filed a direct appeal, arguing his \nconvictions for murder and felonious assault were against the manifest weight of the \nevidence and the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for tampering with \nevidence and abuse of a corpse.  We affirmed Bridges\u2019s convictions.  State v. Bridges , \n8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100805, 2014-Ohio-4570 (\u201c Bridges I\u201d); see State v. Bridges , 8th \nDist. Cuyahoga No. 100805, 2015-Ohio-1447 (denying Bridges\u2019s application for \nreopening his appeal). \n{\u00b63}  In July 2014, Bridges filed a petition for postconviction relief, arguing \nineffective assistance of counsel, his convictions were not supported by sufficient \nevidence, and prosecutorial misconduct.  While Bridges\u2019s direct appeal was pending, the \ntrial court denied his petition for postconviction relief without a hearing and issued \nfindings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the denial.  Bridges appealed these \nrulings in two cases, both of which were dismissed for failure to file the record.  State v. \nBridges, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 101938 (Oct. 1, 2014), and 101942 (Oct. 31, 2014).  \n{\u00b64}  In March 2015, Bridges filed a petition to vacate or set aside his judgment \nof conviction or sentence, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel, the trial court lacked \nsubject matter jurisdiction, speedy trial violations, and prosecutorial misconduct.  The \ntrial court denied Bridges\u2019s petition without a hearing.  In May 2015, Bridges filed a \nmotion for new trial, arguing his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence, \nthe trial court abused its discretion by admitting prejudicial photographic evidence, and \nhis $5 million bond was unconstitutional.  The trial court denied Bridges\u2019s motion \nwithout a hearing. \n{\u00b65}  Bridges appealed these two rulings, and in December 2015, we affirmed the \nsame.  State v. Bridges , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 102930 and 103090, 2015-Ohio-5428 \n(\u201cBridges II \u201d).  In affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment, we determined that Bridges\u2019s \nmotion for new trial was untimely and not based on newly discovered evidence.  In \naddition, we concluded that the claims asserted in Bridges\u2019s postconviction motion to \nvacate or set aside judgment of conviction or sentence were barred by res judicata.  Id. \n{\u00b66}  In August 2015, while his appeal in Bridges II was pending, Bridges filed a \nmotion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial.  In May 2016, Bridges filed a \n\u201cmotion for leave with memorandum in support to correct error R.C. 2903.02(A) \nconviction due to insufficient evidence\u201d (\u201cmotion to correct error\u201d).  The trial court \ndenied both motions without a hearing.  Bridges appealed the trial court\u2019s rulings, and in \nOctober 2016, we affirmed the trial court.  State v. Bridges , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. \n103634 and 104506, 2016-Ohio-7298 (\u201cBridges III\u201d).    \n{\u00b67}  In Bridges III, we sua sponte consolidated Bridges\u2019s appeal in Appeal No. \n103634 and found that the journal entries from which Bridges had appealed were not \nfinal, appealable orders.1  Id. at \u00b6 10-12.  In affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of \nBridges\u2019s motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial, we found Bridges failed \nto provide any new evidence supporting his ineffective assistance, actual innocence, and \nerror of law claims that was not previously known or available to him during his trial or \nduring the time period immediately following his conviction, and nevertheless, his claims \nare barred by res judicata.  Id. at \u00b6 24-28.  Additionally, we found Bridges\u2019s motion to \ncorrect error was barred by res judicata.  Id. at \u00b6 38. \n                                                 \n1\n Bridges \u2019s notice of appeal in Appeal No. 103634 references the trial court \u2019s September 23, \n2015 denial of the following motions: (1) motion to hold in abeyance the defendant \u2019s motion for new \ntrial; (2) motion for leave to supplement pending instanter of delayed motion for leave to grant motion \nfor new trial; (3) motion for emergency access to trial transcripts; (4) motion for leave to file delayed \nmotion for new trial; (5) motion to supplement his delayed motion for new trial; (6) motion for leave \nto supplement police reports and facts to delayed motion for new trial; and (7) motion for \nreconsideration via the defendant\u2019s emergency reply brief in opposition to defendant \u2019s motion for \nleave to file motion for new trial. \n{\u00b68}  In December 2017, Bridges filed a \u201cmotion to leave to file void or voidable \njudgment,\u201d arguing that the trial court considered the status of the victim as transgender \nand this consideration rendered his sentence contrary to law.  He also claimed that this \nconsideration violated his due process rights.  The trial court denied Bridges\u2019s motion, \nand Bridges now appeals. \n{\u00b69}   In the present appeal, Bridges alleges error in the trial court\u2019s sentence for \nhis 2013 conviction.  Specifically, Bridges contends in two assignments of error that his  \nsentence was contrary to law and \u201cthe court imposed an illegal determination in \nsentencing Bridges to do life in prison then do 15 years with eligible parole after the 15 \nyears * * * with additional time to be served after the life sentence.\u201d \n{\u00b610} We note initially that Bridges\u2019s \u201cmotion to leave to file void or voidable \njudgment\u201d will be construed as a postconviction petition for relief.  A motion meets the \ndefinition of a petition for postconviction relief set forth in R.C. 2953.21(A)(1), if it was \n(1) filed subsequent to the direct appeal; (2) claims a denial of constitutional rights; (3) \nseeks to render a judgment void; and (4) asks for vacation of the judgment and sentence.  \nState v. Reynolds, 79 Ohio St.3d 158, 160, 679 N.E.2d 1131 (1997).  Here, Bridges\u2019s \nmotion was filed more than three years after this court affirmed his conviction and \nsentence in his direct appeal, Bridges is claiming a violation of his due process rights, he \nis attempting to render his conviction void, and he is seeking to vacate his sentence. \n{\u00b611} A petition for postconviction relief is a collateral civil attack on a criminal \njudgment; it is not an appeal of the judgment.  State v. Bell , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. \n105000, 2017-Ohio-7168, \u00b6 10.  The petition is \u201ca means to resolve constitutional claims \nthat cannot be addressed on direct appeal because the evidence supporting the claims is \noutside the record.\u201d  State v. Gray , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106589, 2018-Ohio-3678, \u00b6 \n21, citing State v. Milanovich, 42 Ohio St.2d 46, 325 N.E.2d 540 (1975).  A trial court\u2019s \ndecision granting or denying a postconviction petition filed pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 \nshould be upheld absent an abuse of discretion.  State v. Gondor , 112 Ohio St.3d 377, \n2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, \u00b6 58.  \n{\u00b612} Pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(A)(2), postconviction relief petitions shall be filed \nno later than 180 days after the trial transcript is filed in the direct appeal of the \nconviction at issue.  The trial transcript in Bridges\u2019s direct appeal was filed on March 3, \n2014, and this petition to set aside judgment was filed more than three years later, on \nDecember 17, 2017.  \n{\u00b613} However, R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) permits a court to entertain a postconviction \npetition that is filed after the expiration period where the petitioner demonstrates he was \n\u201cunavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which\u201d he relies to support his \nclaim for relief and the petitioner demonstrates \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that, \nbut for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found the \npetitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted.\u201d  R.C. \n2953.23(A)(1)(a) and (b).  \n{\u00b614} Bridges claims that the trial court considered facts outside the record, \nnamely that the victim \u201cdied for reason of his gender life style, mental condition, or age\u201d \nand therefore his sentence is contrary to law.  He also claims that the court made \u201cillegal \ndeterminations\u201d in his sentence.  Bridges fails to provide any newly discovered evidence \nin support of his claims.  On the contrary, in his petition, he appears to direct the court\u2019s \nattention to the portion of the trial transcript in which the court considered the principles \nand purposes of sentencing under R.C. 2929.11 and the seriousness factors outlined in \nR.C. 2929.12.  This transcript is not new facts or evidence.  And Bridges fails to  \npresent any new information demonstrating that any of the sentencing factors were \nimproperly considered.  Bridges\u2019s petition is therefore untimely. \n{\u00b615} Even if we determined that Bridges\u2019s petition was timely, his claims are \nbarred by res judicata.  The doctrine of res judicata bars a defendant \u201cfrom raising and \nlitigating in any proceeding, except an appeal from [a final] judgment, any defense or any \nclaimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at \nthe trial * * * or on an appeal from that judgment.\u201d  State v. Perry , 10 Ohio St.2d 175, \n180, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967).   \n{\u00b616} Bridges did not challenge the legality of his sentence in his direct appeal.  \nAnd sentencing errors not raised on direct appeal are generally barred by the doctrine of \nres judicata.   State v. Willard, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101055, 2014-Ohio-5278, \u00b6 10.  \nVoid sentences, however, are an exception to the res judicata doctrine and may be \nreviewed at any time, either on direct appeal or by collateral attack.  State v. Fischer , \n128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, 942 N.E.2d 332, \u00b6 30; State v. Williams , 8th Dist. \nCuyahoga No. 105873, 2018-Ohio-688, \u00b6 9. [Cite as State v. Bridges, 2018-Ohio-4113.] \n{\u00b617} Here, Bridges\u2019s two assignments of error attack his sentence.  Although he \nclaims that his sentence was not imposed in accordance with the law, he presents no \ncolorable argument to support his contention that his sentence is contrary to law and \ntherefore void, nor has he presented any evidence that his sentence is void.  Rather, \nBridges appears to take issue with the trial court\u2019s findings at sentencing, claiming that \nthe findings are not supported by the record.  Bridges also disagrees with the court\u2019s \nconsideration of the sentencing factors, claiming the trial court should not have \nconsidered the victim\u2019s sexual orientation or \u201cgender life style\u201d as motive for the murder. \n These claims are barred by res judicata.   See State v. Wolke , 4th Dist. Adams No. \n17CA1048, 2018-Ohio-2119, \u00b6 15 (challenges to the imposition of consecutive sentences \nare barred by res judicata); see State v. Ray , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101142, \n2014-Ohio-4689, \u00b6 11 (challenges to the trial court\u2019s consideration of R.C. 2929.11 and \n2929.12 are barred by res judicata). \n{\u00b618} Bridges\u2019s assignments of error are overruled. \n{\u00b619} Judgment affirmed. \nIt is ordered that appellee recover of appellant costs herein taxed. \nThe court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal. \nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the common \npleas court to carry this judgment into execution.  \nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of \nthe Rules of Appellate Procedure.  \n \n__________________________________________  \nTIM McCORMACK, PRESIDING JUDGE \n \nSEAN C.

The doctrine of res judicata bars a defendant \u201cfrom raising and litigating in any proceeding, except an appeal from [a final] judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial * * * or on an appeal from that judgment.\u201d State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 180, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967).\n\n{\u00b616} Bridges did not challenge the legality of his sentence in his direct appeal. And sentencing errors not raised on direct appeal are generally barred by the doctrine of res judicata. State v. Willard, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101055, 2014-Ohio-5278, \u00b6 10. Void sentences, however, are an exception to the res judicata doctrine and may be reviewed at any time, either on direct appeal or by collateral attack. State v. Fischer, 128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, 942 N.E.2d 332, \u00b6 30; State v. Williams, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105873, 2018-Ohio-688, \u00b6 9.\nHere, Bridges\u2019s two assignments of error attack his sentence. Although he claims that his sentence was not imposed in accordance with the law, he presents no colorable argument to support his contention that his sentence is contrary to law and therefore void, nor has he presented any evidence that his sentence is void. Rather, Bridges appears to take issue with the trial court\u2019s findings at sentencing, claiming that the findings are not supported by the record. Bridges also disagrees with the court\u2019s consideration of the sentencing factors, claiming the trial court should not have considered the victim\u2019s sexual orientation or \u201cgender life style\u201d as motive for the murder. These claims are barred by res judicata. See State v. Wolke, 4th Dist. Adams No. 17CA1048, 2018-Ohio-2119, \u00b6 15 (challenges to the imposition of consecutive sentences are barred by res judicata); see State v. Ray, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101142, 2014-Ohio-4689, \u00b6 11 (challenges to the trial court\u2019s consideration of R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 are barred by res judicata).\n\nBridges\u2019s assignments of error are overruled.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nIt is ordered that appellee recover of appellant costs herein taxed.\n\nThe court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the common pleas court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\nTIM McCORMACK, PRESIDING JUDGE\n\nSEAN C.

Cuyahoga No. 106943,  \n2019-Ohio-341, in which this court affirm ed Hall\u2019s convictions and sentences for \nrape, sexual battery, endangering children, domestic violence, and importuning. 1 \nHall now asserts that his appellate counsel should have argued that (1) his \nconvictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence, (2) prosecutorial \nmisconduct denied him due process, (3) denial of access to the proceedings denied \nhim due process, (4) the trial court erred by not commencing trial in a timely \nfashion, (5) he was denied the effective assistance of trial counsel and (6) the \ncumulative impact of errors amounted to a denial of due process.  The state of Ohio \nfiled its brief in opposition on January 2, 2020.  For the following reasons, this court \ndenies the application to reopen.  \n App.R. 26(B)(1) and (2)(b) require applications claiming ineffective \nassistance of appellate counsel to be filed within 90 days from journalization of the \ndecision unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later time.  The \nDecember 2019 application was filed more than ten months after this court\u2019s \ndecision.  Thus, it is untimely on its face.  \n In his application, Hall stated that he should not be treated unfairly \nwhen he was clearly claiming actual innocence and at the time was unaware of the \n                                                \n1 The grand jury indicted Hall for one count of rape against his then 14-year-old \ndaughter and 154 counts of rape, attempted rape, kidnapping, gross sexual imposition, \nendangering children, domestic violence, se xual battery, and importuning against his \nadopted daughter.  Hall pled guilty to 8 counts of rape, 5 counts of sexual battery, 2 counts \nof endangering children and one count each of  domestic violence and importuning.  The \nother counts were nolled.  The trial judge sentenced him to an aggregate term of 4o years.   \nlaw, but has learned more since then.  Hall does not explicitly proffer these reasons \nas good cause for an untimely filing, but the court will consider them as such.  \n The courts have consistently ruled that ignorance of the law does not \nprovide sufficient cause for untimely filing.  State v. Klein, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. \n58389, 1991 Ohio App. LEXIS 1346, reopening disallowed (Mar. 15, 1994), motion \nNo. 249260, aff\u2019d, 69 Ohio St.3d 1481, 634 N.E.2d 1027 (1994) and State v. \nMarshall, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87334, 2019-Ohio-1114. \n Moreover, the bare allegation that he was claiming actual innocence, \nespecially in the face of his guilty plea, does not demonstrate actual innocence such \nthat it could establish good cause for untimely filing.  State v. Jordan , 8th Dist. \nCuyahoga No. 73453, 2015-Ohio-4977.  \n App.R. 26(B)(2) requires that an application to reopen contain a \n\u201csworn statement of the basis for the claim that appellate counsel\u2019s representation \nwas deficient with respect to the assignments of error raised.\u201d  Although Hall \nattached affidavits to other motions he filed, he did not attach an affidavit \nsupporting his application to reopen.  Thus, the application is fatally defective.  State \nv.

HODGES, \nDefendant-Appellant. \n \n   \nOPINION AND JUDGMENT ENTRY \nCase No. 18 MA 0091 \n   \n \nCriminal Appeal from the \nCourt of Common Pleas of Mahoning County, Ohio \nCase No. 16-CR-169 \n \nBEFORE: \nDavid A. D\u2019Apolito, Cheryl L. Waite, Carol Ann Robb, Judges. \n \n \nJUDGMENT: \nAffirmed.  \n   \u2013 2 \u2013 \nCase No. 18 MA 0091 \nDated:  December 6, 2019 \n \n   \nD\u2019Apolito, J.   \n \n{\u00b61} Appellant Kimani Hodges appeals his conviction by the Mahoning County \nCourt of Common Pleas following a jury trial for one count of a ggravated murder, in \nviolation of R.C. 2903.01(A), an unclassified felony, with a fi rearm specification, in \nviolation of R.C. 2941.145(A).  The trial court also found Appe llant guilty of having a \nweapon while under disability, a violation of R.C. 2323.13(A)(2 )(B), a felony of the third \ndegree.   \n{\u00b62} In his sole assignment of error, Appellant argues that the tria l court erred \nwhen it refused to provide a jury instruction on voluntary mans laughter.  Voluntary \nmanslaughter is defined as knowingly causing the death of anoth er \u201cwhile under the \ninfluence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which is brought on by \nserious provocation occasioned by the victim that is reasonably  sufficient to incite the \nperson into using deadly force.\u201d R.C. 2903.03(A).  \n{\u00b63} Because there is no evidence in the record that a reasonable person would \nhave been seriously provoked by the victim\u2019s words or actions, or that Appellant acted \nunder the influence of sudden passion or in sudden fit of rage, we find that the trial court \ndid not abuse its discretion in declining to provide the reques ted instruction.  As a \nconsequence, we affirm Appellant\u2019s aggravated murder conviction. \nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{\u00b64} On February 17, 2016, the body of Jason Fonseca, age nineteen, was found \nat the bottom of the driveway of his mother\u2019s residence at 176 Ayers Street on the east \nside of Youngstown.  Fonseca had been shot nine times.   \n{\u00b65} Later that day, Appellant was arrested and charged with aggravated murder \nin Youngstown Municipal Court. A video initial appearance was h eld on February 19, \n2016.  The matter was set for a preliminary hearing on February 26, 2016.   \n{\u00b66} On February 25, 2016, Appellant was indicted by the Mahoning Co unty \nGrand Jury for aggravated murder, and the state dismissed the c harge pending in the \nmunicipal court.  That same day, Angel Bell, who was involved i n amorous relationships   \u2013 3 \u2013 \nCase No. 18 MA 0091 \nwith both men prior to Fonseca\u2019s death, was also indicted for aggravated murder, as well \nas one count of obstructing justice. \n{\u00b67} The first trial began on January 3, 2017.  Fonseca\u2019s lifelong f riend, Noel \nRios, was the only eyewitness to the crime offered by the state.  After Appellant\u2019s counsel \nunderscored a series of inconsistencies between Rios\u2019 direct te stimony and his initial \npolice interview, Rios, who was in federal custody at the time, abruptly refused to continue \nanswering questions on cross-examination.  \n{\u00b68} After the trial court granted Appellant\u2019s motion to strike Rios \u2019 testimony in \nits entirety, the state informed the trial court that it had re ached an agreement with Bell.  \nAlthough Bell had previously maintained that she was not present when the fatal shooting \noccurred, Bell agreed to provide a proffer to the state that da y and to testify against \nAppellant, in exchange for the dismissal of the charges against her with prejudice.   \n{\u00b69} Appellant\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial based on his lack of awareness of \nthe content of Bell\u2019s proffer and the potential testimony she would provide at trial.  Without \nobjection from the state, the trial court granted the mistrial on January 9, 2017.   \n{\u00b610} On January 23, 2017, with leave of court, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss \nthe charges against him on double jeopardy grounds.  He argued that the mistrial was the \nresult of prosecutorial misconduct.  The trial court overruled the motion on February 3, \n2017. On January 30, 2018, we agreed that the prohibition again st double jeopardy did \nnot bar Appellant\u2019s retrial.  State v. Hodges, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 17 MA 0025, 2018-\nOhio-447, 105 N.E.3d 543. \n{\u00b611} The second trial began on June 4, 2018.  Both Bell and Rios tes tified on \nbehalf of the state, however Bell\u2019s testimony was riddled with \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201ds and \u201cI don\u2019t \nremember\u201ds. Bell testified that she and Fonseca had been romant ically involved since \n2014. Although problems had developed with their relationship i n 2015, Bell declined to \ncharacterize the relationship as \u201con again/off again,\u201d but, rather \u201c[always on] for the most \npart.\u201d  (Trial Tr., p. 247-248.)  At some point, Bell began a r omantic relationship with \nAppellant.   \n{\u00b612} Fonseca and Bell purchased a used automobile in January of 2016 . \nAccording to Fonseca\u2019s mother, Fonseca paid for the automobile but did not have a \ndriver\u2019s license. Because Bell was involved in an accident two days after Fonseca   \u2013 4 \u2013 \nCase No. 18 MA 0091 \npurchased the automobile, Fonseca hid the car in order to preve nt Bell from driving it.  \nFonseca was not aware at that time that he possessed the only set of keys.   \n{\u00b613} Bell and Fonseca broke up at some point thereafter and Fonseca refused \nto give the keys to the automobile to Bell.  In the week leadin g up to Fonseca\u2019s fatal \nshooting, Bell made a number of failed attempts to retrieve the  keys. Fonseca\u2019s mother \ntestified that Bell and Appellant stopped at her home on Ayers Street, where Fonseca \nwas residing after the break-up, two days before Fonseca\u2019s deat h, but, per her son\u2019s \ninstructions, she did not answer the door.  \n{\u00b614} The prior calculation and design element of the aggravated murd er charge \nwas established at trial through a series of messages posted to  various social media \naccounts in the five days leading up to Fonseca\u2019s death.  Copie s of the social media \nmessages were not admitted at trial, however, they were made a part of the record \nthrough Bell\u2019s testimony.  Bell, who did not have a phone, comm unicated with both \nFonseca and Appellant via Twitter on a Kindle.   \n{\u00b615} Bell testified that, at 9:10 a.m. on the day before Fonseca was  murdered, \nhe posted the message \u201cI love you so much\u201d in the Twitter chain  with Bell that began on \nFebruary 13, 2016.  ( Id. at 278.)  At 9:16 a.m., Appellant posted, \u201cLove yoself bitch as s \nnigga she mine now quick in box in n kikn her.\u201d  ( Id. at 278, 282.)  Bell explained that \nAppellant appeared to mean \u201cquit\u201d not \u201cquick\u201d and that \u201cin box in nkikn her\u201d was a \nreference to Bell\u2019s Kik Messenger app.   \n{\u00b616} In a 3-second video posted on Be ll\u2019s Kik Messenger video accoun t, which \nwas admitted into evidence, a man whose face is not visible wields a handgun and states, \n\u201cWe got them dicks [30 bullet clips]. I\u2019ll come to yo mama house, fuck boy, (unintelligible).\u201d  \nThe man is wearing a large round-faced watch.  Bell conceded th at Appellant had used \nher Kik account around the time when the video was posted.  \n{\u00b617} Bell testified that she did not recognize the man in the Kik video.  The state \noffered a photograph of Appellant taken on February 18, 2016 at 1:12 a.m. into evidence \nat the trial.  Appellant was wearing a large round-faced watch in the photograph.  Bell \nclaimed that she could not determine from the picture whether t he man in the video was \nwearing the same watch.  However, Detective Sergeant Rick Spott leson later testified \nthat the watch in the photograph was the same watch worn by the man in the video.     \u2013 5 \u2013 \nCase No. 18 MA 0091 \n{\u00b618} Finally, Bell testified that, at 10:51 a.m. on the day that Fonseca was fatally \nshot, Appellant posted to his own Facebook account, \u201cNiggas want to fight? I\u2019m like naww \nwe toot pipes [shoot guns] you a be fightin for your life.\u201d  (Id. at 274.)   \n{\u00b619} According to Bell\u2019s testimony, she was in the front passenger s eat of \nAppellant\u2019s automobile on February 17, 2016.  Appellant, Bell, and another man, who she \ncould not identify, were returning home from visiting friends w hen Appellant drove down \nAyers Street.  Appellant recognized the occupant of a vehicle parked near the residence.  \nHe stopped his automobile and exited to talk to the occupant.  Appellant also conversed \nwith another man who was standing on the street.  The man on the street gave Appellant \na cigarette.   \n{\u00b620} Bell testified that the confrontation between Appellant and Fon seca took \nplace behind the automobile in which she was seated. According to her testimony, \n\u201c[Fonseca] ran outside and, kind of, I don\u2019t know, I guess char ged [Appellant].\u201d  ( Id. at \n262.)  Then Bell heard gunshots and she saw Fonseca fall to the  curb. (Id. at 263, 269.)  \nAppellant returned to his automobile and then drove to a reside nce on the south side of \nYoungstown.  Bell testified that she could not recall whether A ppellant said anything to \nher or the other passenger about the shooting while driving across town. (Id. at 265.)  \n{\u00b621} After he was arrested, Appellant conversed with Bell on the telephone.  Bell \ntestified that Appellant \u201cwanted to delete his Facebook.\u201d  ( Id. at 272.)  Although Bell \nclaimed that she could not recall whether Appellant also asked her to delete his messages \non her Twitter account, Bell deleted both the Facebook and Twitter messages.  \n{\u00b622} Bell authenticated a letter she received from Appellant while h e was \nincarcerated pending trial, which she read aloud at the trial: \nI\u2019m so so so so sorry. I didn\u2019t listen to you when you said \u2013 I don\u2019t know what \nthat says \u2013 forward.  I\u2019m sorry.  Again, I didn\u2019t think shit th rough and I put \nyour life, as well as my nephew and my brother, in jeopardy.  I  was just so \nthirsty to get some money, didn\u2019t care where I was or what migh t or could \nhave happened. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t \u2013 something \u2013 much as to me not caring \nbut just being arrogant and not thinking about what if.\u201d \nBell testified that she did not know to what he was referring in the letter.  (Id. at 292.)   \u2013 6 \u2013 \nCase No. 18 MA 0091 \n{\u00b623} Raymond Ortiz, Fonseca\u2019s cousin, did not witness the shooting, but was in \nthe residence on Ayers with Fonseca that day.  Minutes before t he shooting Fonseca \ntossed his \u201choodie\u201d to Ortiz and told him to get dressed and fo llow Fonseca outside \nbecause Appellant was en route to the residence.  Fonseca exite d the residence, but \nOrtiz stopped to put on his shoes.  As Ortiz approached the doo r, he heard gunshots.  \nOrtiz testified that his friend, Javaughn used Ortiz\u2019s mobile t elephone to log into the Kik \nMessenger app and found the video.   \n{\u00b624} Rios testified that he was standing on the sidewalk smoking a c igarette \nwhen an automobile stopped in the street.  Appellant, who acted  as if he knew Rios, \nstepped out of the automobile and began conversing with him.  R ios gave Appellant a \ncigarette, even though, at the time, he did not recognize him.  Rios initially thought that \nthere was another man in the car, because the other occupant wa s wearing a \u201choodie.\u201d \nHe explained that only men wear \u201choodies,\u201d and, although he had  previously seen Bell \nwith Fonseca, she typically wore a large wig, so he did not immediately recognize her.  \n{\u00b625} Rios provided the following testimony regarding the interaction  between \nAppellant and Fonseca prior to the fatal shooting:  \nAll I know is [Fonseca] came outside and it was a big argument that started \noff.  And from there, it just led on to \u201cget from in front of m y property.\u201d  And \nthe guy said he wouldn\u2019t get from in front of the property like a couple times. \nAnd [Fonseca] said, I\u2019m gonna beat you up, and they was supposed to fight.  \nAnd the guy went to reach for a gun and they just started strug gling.  Like \n[Fonseca] rushed him and they started tussling * * * * And he s hot several \ntimes. And I had took off and ran by the other car. And he look ed at me \nbefore he got in, but I was ducked by the back of the trunk. I had lifted my \nhead up, but I ducked down at the same time. \n(Id. at 481.)  Rios conceded that he fled after he saw the gun, but before he saw Appellant \nshoot Fonseca.  \n{\u00b626} Rios added, \u201c[Fonseca] came out, he was out on the porch, they had their \nwords, and he was just \u2013 come to find out, it was about a femal e.  He told him, well, you   \u2013 7 \u2013 \nCase No. 18 MA 0091 \ncan have her, I don\u2019t care about her.\u201d ( Id. at 483.)  Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to Rios\u2019 \nsecond statement as hearsay, and the objection was sustained by  the trial court.  \nHowever, Rios later testified that he recognized Bell when he realized the argument was \nabout a woman, specifically, \u201cwhen [Rios] came to think about w hen they was arguing \nand he told her, you could have the girl, the female, that how [Rios knew], okay, that had \nto be [Bell.]\u201d  (Id. at 503.) \n{\u00b627} Rios testified that Fonseca did not have a gun, but that he was  \u201ctrying to \nfight [Appellant] bare hands [sic].\u201d  (Id. at 485.)  He further testified that Appellant refused \nto leave from the street several times, and \u201cthat\u2019s when [Fonse ca] went to go fight, post \nup and box with him, and [Appellant] reached for a gun.  And th at\u2019s when [Fonseca] \nrushed him, like to grab him, and [Appellant] shot him, boom, b oom, several times.\u201d (Id. \nat 489.)    \n{\u00b628} At the conclusion of the evidence, Appellant\u2019s counsel requeste d a jury \ninstruction on voluntary manslaughter, based on the testimony t hat Fonseca engaged in \na verbal argument and instigated a fist fight with Appellant.  Appellant\u2019s counsel argued \nthat the evidence established that \u201c[Appellant] like squares off and [Fonseca] charges him \nand then that\u2019s when [Rios] sees him pull the gun.\u201d ( Id. at 784.)  Trial counsel \nmischaracterized Rios\u2019 testimony, as Rios testified that Appell ant drew the weapon as \nFonseca approached him and Fonseca lurched at Appellant to prev ent him from \ndischarging the weapon.  The state countered that the social media messages offered at \nthe trial established provocation on the part of Appellant, not Fonseca.  (Id. at 787-788.)   \n{\u00b629} Based on the high-crime area in which the shooting occurred, the trial court \nconfessed its initial inclination to provide the instruction. N onetheless, the trial court \nrefused to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter, stating: \nHere\u2019s my problem.  That\u2019s an instruction I am required to give  only if I am \nsatisfied that there is evidence in the record that supports th e elements of \nthat offense, in particular [Appellant] being under the influen ce of sudden \npassion or in a fit of rage, either of which is brought on by s erious \nprovocation occasioned by the victim. So for discussion purposes, even if I \nassume that [Fonseca] * * * charged him, and I assume that cons titutes a \nserious provocation, I still have no evidence in this record that [Appellant] is   \u2013 8 \u2013 \nCase No. 18 MA 0091 \nunder the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage.  And I don\u2019t \nbelieve I can allow the jury simply to speculate on that portion of the offense.  \n(Id. at 786-787.)   \n{\u00b630} The trial court ultimately recognized its \u201cinability to bootstr ap the evidence \nin this case in any fashion that would justify an instruction t hat\u2019s based upon [Appellant] \nbeing in a sudden fit of rage or passion under the circumstances.  There\u2019s just no evidence \non that subject.\u201d  (Id. at 788.) The trial court did, however, instruct the jury on the lesser-\nincluded offense of murder.  \n{\u00b631} On June 8, 2018, the jury returned a guilty verdict on the char ge of \naggravated murder with the firearm specification.  At a sentencing hearing held on August \n10, 2018, the trial court found Appellant guilty of having a we apon while under disability.  \nThe trial court sentenced Appellant to life without the possibi lity of parole for the \naggravated murder conviction, plus three years for the firearm specification to be served \nconsecutively to the life sentence. The trial court further imp osed a sentence of thirty \nmonths to be served concurrently for the weapon while under dis ability conviction.  This \ntimely appeal followed. \nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR \nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT REFUSED TO INSTRUCT THE \nJURY ON VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER WHEN THERE EXISTED \nSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO INSTRUCT THE JURY FOR INVOLUNTARY \nMANSLAUGHTER. \n{\u00b632} Aggravated murder is defined as \u201cpurposely, and with prior calculation and \ndesign, caus[ing] the death of another.\u201d R.C. 2903.01(A). Murder is defined as \u201cpurposely \ncaus[ing] the death of another.\u201d R.C. 2903.02(A). In contrast, voluntary manslaughter is \ndefined as knowingly causing the death of another \u201cwhile under the influence of sudden \npassion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which is brought on by serious provocation \noccasioned by the victim that is reasonably sufficient to incite the person into using deadly \nforce.\u201d R.C. 2903.03(A).   \u2013 9 \u2013 \nCase No. 18 MA 0091 \n{\u00b633} Voluntary manslaughter is an inferior degree offense of murder, rather than \na lesser included offense. State v. Kanner, 7th Dist. Monroe No. 04 MO 10, 2006-Ohio-\n3485, \u00b6 17. This is true because the elements of the crime of voluntary manslaughter are \ncontained within the offense of murder, except for one or more additional mitigating \nelements. Id. \n{\u00b634} In order to find a defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter w hen the \ndefendant is charged with murder, the jury must find by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat the provocation was sufficient to arouse the passions of an ordinary person and that \nthe particular defendant\u2019s passions were aroused. State v. Shane , 63 Ohio St.3d 630, \n634, 590 N.E.2d 272 (1992).  Thus, the test has both an objecti ve and a subjective \ncomponent. Id.  When determining whether the subjective portion of this test ha s been \nsatisfied, \u201cthe emotional and mental state of the defendant, as well as the conditions and \ncircumstances that surrounded the incident in question, must be  considered.\u201d  State v. \nPerdue, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 00 CA 244, 153 Ohio App.3d 213, 2003-Ohio-3481, 792 \nN.E.2d 747, \u00b6 11.  Where insufficient evidence of provocation i s presented and no \nreasonable jury could decide that the defendant was reasonably provoked by the victim, \nthen no instruction on voluntary manslaughter can be given. Shane, supra, at 638. \n{\u00b635} An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision whether to give a \nparticular jury instruction under an abuse of discretion standa rd.  State v. Kaufman, 187 \nOhio App.3d 50, 2010-Ohio-1536, 931 N.E.2d 143, \u00b6 103. An abuse  of discretion \nconnotes more than an error of judgment; it implies an attitude  on the part of the court \nthat is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.  State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, \n157, 404 N.E .2d 144 (1980). \n{\u00b636} Appellant writes, \u201c[Appellant] was under the influence of sudden passion or \nin a sudden fit or rage.  [Fonseca\u2019s] words and actions provoke d [Appellant] to protect \nhimself.\u201d  (Emphasis added)(Reply Brf., p. 7.)  However, we hav e recognized that an \ninstruction on voluntary manslaughter is generally incompatible with and contradictory to \na defense of self-defense.  State v. Marcum, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 04 CO 66, 2006-\nOhio-7068, \u00b6 46 (\u201ca self-defense theory is usually contradictory to proof of sudden passion \nor rage.\u201d)     \u2013 10 \u2013 \nCase No. 18 MA 0091 \n{\u00b637} To establish self-defense through the use of deadly force, Appe llant would \nhave been required to prove: (1) that he \u201cwas not at fault in c reating the situation giving \nrise to the affray\u201d; (2) that he had \u201ca bona fide belief that h e was in imminent danger of \ndeath or great bodily harm and that his only means of escape fr om such danger was in \nthe use of such force\u201d; and (3) that he \u201cdid not violate any du ty to retreat or avoid the \ndanger.\u201d State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 24, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002), citing State v. \nRobbins, 58 Ohio St.2d 74, 388 N.E.2d 755 (1979), paragraph two of the  syllabus. \nFurthermore, a person is privileged only to \u201cuse as much force as is reasonably necessary \nto repel [an] attack.\u201d State v. Jackson, 22 Ohio St.3d 281, 490 N.E.2d 893 (1986).   \n{\u00b638} While self-defense requires a showing of fear, voluntary mansla ughter \nrequires a showing of rage, with emotions of \u201canger, hatred, je alousy, and/or furious \nresentment.\u201d Perdue, supra, \u00b6 12, quoting State v. Harris, 129 Ohio App.3d 527, 535, 718 \nN.E.2d 488 (10th Dist. 1998); see, also, State v. Tantarelli , 10th Dist. Franklin No. \n94APA11-618, 1995 WL 318730.  The Ohio Supreme Court has specif ically held that \n\u201cfear alone is insufficient to demonstrate the kind of emotiona l state necessary to \nconstitute sudden passion or fit of rage.\u201d State v. Mack , 82 Ohio St.3d 198, 201, 1998 \nOhio 375, 694 N.E.2d 1328, see also Kanner, supra, \u00b6 51-53; State v. Williams, 7th Dist. \nJefferson No. 11 JE 7, 2012-Ohio-5256, \u00b6 20-24; State v. Stevenson, 10th Dist. Franklin \nNo. 17AP-512, 2018-Ohio-5140, \u00b6 29 (shooting someone out of fea r rather than rage or \npassion does not support a jury instruction for voluntary mansl aughter). The Ohio \nSupreme Court has likewise held that \u201cwords alone will not cons titute reasonably \nsufficient provocation to incite the use of deadly force in mos t situations.\u201d State v. \nThompson, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, 23 N.E.3d 1096, \u00b6 158. \n{\u00b639} Earlier this year, the Tenth District distinguished their 1981 decision based \non the previous version of R.C. 2901.03 in State v. Hodge, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 18AP-\n95, 2019-Ohio-4012.  Relevant to the above-captioned appeal, th e Tenth District \nexplained: \nMr. Hodge \u201crelies extensively on this court\u2019s decision in State v. Roddy , \n1981 Ohio App. Lexis 10292 (Nov. 17, 1981), Franklin App. No. 81AP-499, \nunreported (1981 Opinions 3706), for the proposition that fear for one\u2019s own \nsafety is sufficient to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instru ction.\u201d See   \u2013 11 \u2013 \nCase No. 18 MA 0091 \n[State v.] Harris, 129 Ohio App.3d [527,] 535, [718 N.E.2d 488]; Appellant\u2019s \nBrief at 25-26. As there, \u201csuch reliance is misplaced.\u201d Harris at 535. We \nhave explained before, and reiterate here, that this aspect of Roddy did not \nsurvive amendment to the voluntary manslaughter statute. \u201c[G]iv en that \nvoluntary manslaughter now requires that the defendant be under  t h e  \ninfluence of \u2018sudden passion or fit of rage,\u2019 the position adva nced by \nappellant and supported by Roddy cannot be * * * maintained.\u201d  Id. (citations \nomitted); see also, e.g., [State v.] Stevenson, [10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-\n512,] 2018-Ohio-5140 at \u00b6 27-28 (\u201cThis court has previously explained * * * \nwhy reliance on Roddy is misplaced [citing Harris and State v. Caldwell , \n10th Dist. No. 98AP-165, 1998 Ohio App. Lexis 6220]. * * * * At the time that \nRoddy was decided, voluntary manslaughter was defined as knowingly \ncausing the death of another while under extreme emotional stress brought \non by serious provocation reasonably sufficient to incite the u se of deadly \nforce. * * * * R.C. 2901.03(A), however, was amended in 1982 to  limit the \napplication of the voluntary manslaughter statute * * * * [and] require[ ] that \nthe defendant be under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit \nof rage\u201d). \nId. at \u00b6 40. \n{\u00b640} Rios\u2019 uncontested account of the shooting established that Fons eca \nordered Appellant to leave the street and he was no longer inte rested in a romantic \nrelationship with Bell.  After repeated refusals by Appellant t o leave the scene, Fonseca \nwent to \u201cgo fight, post up and box\u201d with Appellant, and Appellant reached for a gun.  When \nAppellant drew the gun, Fonseca \u201crushed him, like to grab him\u201d and Appellant shot \nFonseca nine times.  Bell testified that \u201c[Fonseca] ran outside  and, kind of, I don\u2019t know, \nI guess charged [Appellant].\u201d  (Id. at 262.)  Although the Ohio Supreme Court qualified its \nconclusion that words alone will not constitute reasonably suff icient provocation to incite \nthe use of deadly force in most situations, we find that the words exchanged by Appellant \nand Fonseca were insufficient to provoke deadly force based on the facts in this case.     \u2013 12 \u2013 \nCase No. 18 MA 0091 \n{\u00b641} At most, the record establishes that Fonseca left the porch wit h the intent \nto engage in a fist fight with Appellant.  While Fonseca\u2019s inte nt to engage in a fist fight \nmight have caused fear in the average person, it would not evoke passion or a fit of rage.  \n{\u00b642} Furthermore, Ohio intermediate courts have consistently rejecte d the \nargument that a physical altercation constitutes serious provoc ation inspiring sudden \npassion or a fit of rage. For instance, in State v. Thomas, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27266, \n2015-Ohio-2935, the defendant approached the victim, who was se lling drugs in front of \nthe residence of the defendant\u2019s grandmother. Thomas asked the victim to move down \nthe street. The victim responded by threatening to physically a ssault Thomas. Thomas \nswung his fist at the victim, but did not connect. The victim t hen pulled out a gun, which \nThomas knocked to the ground. Thomas gained control over the gun and shot the victim.  \n{\u00b643} At trial, Thomas explained that he fired the gun out of fear th at the victim \nwould take the gun from him and kill him. Id. at \u00b6 25. He requested both a self-defense \nand voluntary manslaughter instruction. The court agreed to pro vide a self-defense \ninstruction but declined to provide a voluntary manslaughter instruction based on Thomas' \ntestimony that he shot out of fear, not because of provocation from the fight. Id. at \u00b6 25. \nThus, the Ninth District held that the evidence supported an in struction on self-defense, \nnot voluntary manslaughter. \n{\u00b644} In State v. Perry, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 94-T-5165, 1997 WL 590789, (Aug \n19, 1998), the defendant testified that he and the victim argue d and the victim reached \nfor his gun. The defendant testified that he attacked and beat the victim to death because \nhe was afraid that she would shoot him. The defendant requested  a voluntary \nmanslaughter instruction, which the trial court denied. The Ele venth District found no \nabuse of discretion, because the defendant's testimony suggeste d self-defense, not \nvoluntary manslaughter. \n{\u00b645} Finally, we find that there is no subjective evidence of passio n or rage on \nthe part of Appellant in the record.  Bell was the only witness  who was present at the \nscene and accompanied Appellant after the fatal shooting.  Howe ver, Bell testified that \nshe could not recall anything that Appellant said during the car ride across town after the \nfatal shooting.  In Thompson, supra, Thompson\u2019s only witness was present when \nThompson shot the victim. She testified that Thompson got back i n  t h e  c a r  a f t e r  t h e    \u2013 13 \u2013 \nCase No. 18 MA 0091 \nshooting as they drove to his sister\u2019s house.  The Ohio Supreme Court opined that \u201c[h]er \ntestimony provides no insight into Thompson\u2019s actual state of mind or level of agitation at \nthe time of the shooting.\u201d  Thompson, supra, \u00b6 159.  The same is true here.  \n{\u00b646} Based upon the foregoing case law, we find that a reasonable person would \nconclude that the verbal altercation and the threat of a physical assault in this case were \nobjectively insufficient to inspire sudden passion or a fit of rage, and, further, that there is \nno evidence of actual passion or rage on the part of Appellant in the record.  In fact, the \nrecord, which includes Appellant\u2019s violent threats via social media and his letter of apology \nto Bell, directly contradicts any argument that Appellant acted  with sudden passion or in \na fit of rage.  Therefore, we find that the trial court did not  abuse its discretion when it \ndeclined Appellant\u2019s request for a jury instruction on voluntar y manslaughter, and \nAppellant\u2019s sole assignment of error has no merit.  \nCONCLUSION \n{\u00b647} In summary, we find that the words exchanged between Fonseca an d \nAppellant and the threat of a physical altercation were insuffi cient from an objective \nstandpoint to constitute serious provocation or to incite the u se of deadly force by \nAppellant.  We further find that there is no evidence in the record that Appellant was acting \nunder the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rag e when he shot Fonseca. \nAccordingly, Appellant\u2019s conviction for aggravated murder is affirmed. \n \n \n \nWaite, P.J., concurs. \n \nRobb, J., concurs. \n [Cite as State v.

D\u2019Apolito, Cheryl L. Waite, Carol Ann Robb, Judges.\n\nJUDGMENT:\nAffirmed.\n\nAtty. Paul J. Gains, Mahoning County Prosecutor, and Atty. Ralph M. Rivera, Assistant\nProsecuting Attorney, 21 West Boardman Street, 6th Floor, Youngstown, Ohio 44503,\nfor Plaintiff-Appellee and\n\nAtty. Joseph Gardner, 19 East Front Street, Youngstown, Ohio 44503, for Defendant-\nAppellant.\nD'Apolito, J.\n\n{\u00b61} Appellant Kimani Hodges appeals his conviction by the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas following a jury trial for one count of aggravated murder, in violation of R.C. 2903.01(A), an unclassified felony, with a firearm specification, in violation of R.C. 2941.145(A). The trial court also found Appellant guilty of having a weapon while under disability, a violation of R.C. 2323.13(A)(2)(B), a felony of the third degree.\n\n{\u00b62} In his sole assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it refused to provide a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter. Voluntary manslaughter is defined as knowingly causing the death of another \u201cwhile under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which is brought on by serious provocation occasioned by the victim that is reasonably sufficient to incite the person into using deadly force.\u201d R.C. 2903.03(A).\n\n{\u00b63} Because there is no evidence in the record that a reasonable person would have been seriously provoked by the victim\u2019s words or actions, or that Appellant acted under the influence of sudden passion or in sudden fit of rage, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to provide the requested instruction. As a consequence, we affirm Appellant\u2019s aggravated murder conviction.\n\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n{\u00b64} On February 17, 2016, the body of Jason Fonseca, age nineteen, was found at the bottom of the driveway of his mother\u2019s residence at 176 Ayers Street on the east side of Youngstown. Fonseca had been shot nine times.\n\n{\u00b65} Later that day, Appellant was arrested and charged with aggravated murder in Youngstown Municipal Court. A video initial appearance was held on February 19, 2016. The matter was set for a preliminary hearing on February 26, 2016.\n\n{\u00b66} On February 25, 2016, Appellant was indicted by the Mahoning County Grand Jury for aggravated murder, and the state dismissed the charge pending in the municipal court. That same day, Angel Bell, who was involved in amorous relationships\nwith both men prior to Fonseca\u2019s death, was also indicted for aggravated murder, as well as one count of obstructing justice.\n\n\u00b67 The first trial began on January 3, 2017. Fonseca\u2019s lifelong friend, Noel Rios, was the only eyewitness to the crime offered by the state. After Appellant\u2019s counsel underscored a series of inconsistencies between Rios\u2019 direct testimony and his initial police interview, Rios, who was in federal custody at the time, abruptly refused to continue answering questions on cross-examination.\n\n\u00b68 After the trial court granted Appellant\u2019s motion to strike Rios\u2019 testimony in its entirety, the state informed the trial court that it had reached an agreement with Bell. Although Bell had previously maintained that she was not present when the fatal shooting occurred, Bell agreed to provide a proffer to the state that day and to testify against Appellant, in exchange for the dismissal of the charges against her with prejudice.\n\n\u00b69 Appellant\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial based on his lack of awareness of the content of Bell\u2019s proffer and the potential testimony she would provide at trial. Without objection from the state, the trial court granted the mistrial on January 9, 2017.\n\n\u00b610 On January 23, 2017, with leave of court, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him on double jeopardy grounds. He argued that the mistrial was the result of prosecutorial misconduct. The trial court overruled the motion on February 3, 2017. On January 30, 2018, we agreed that the prohibition against double jeopardy did not bar Appellant\u2019s retrial. State v. Hodges, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 17 MA 0025, 2018-Ohio-447, 105 N.E.3d 543.\n\n\u00b611 The second trial began on June 4, 2018. Both Bell and Rios testified on behalf of the state, however Bell\u2019s testimony was riddled with \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201ds and \u201cI don\u2019t remember\u201ds. Bell testified that she and Fonseca had been romantically involved since 2014. Although problems had developed with their relationship in 2015, Bell declined to characterize the relationship as \u201con again/off again,\u201d but, rather \u201c[always on] for the most part.\u201d (Trial Tr., p. 247-248.) At some point, Bell began a romantic relationship with Appellant.\n\n\u00b612 Fonseca and Bell purchased a used automobile in January of 2016. According to Fonseca\u2019s mother, Fonseca paid for the automobile but did not have a driver\u2019s license. Because Bell was involved in an accident two days after Fonseca\npurchased the automobile, Fonseca hid the car in order to prevent Bell from driving it. Fonseca was not aware at that time that he possessed the only set of keys.\n\n{\u00b613} Bell and Fonseca broke up at some point thereafter and Fonseca refused to give the keys to the automobile to Bell. In the week leading up to Fonseca\u2019s fatal shooting, Bell made a number of failed attempts to retrieve the keys. Fonseca\u2019s mother testified that Bell and Appellant stopped at her home on Ayers Street, where Fonseca was residing after the break-up, two days before Fonseca\u2019s death, but, per her son\u2019s instructions, she did not answer the door.\n\n{\u00b614} The prior calculation and design element of the aggravated murder charge was established at trial through a series of messages posted to various social media accounts in the five days leading up to Fonseca\u2019s death. Copies of the social media messages were not admitted at trial, however, they were made a part of the record through Bell\u2019s testimony. Bell, who did not have a phone, communicated with both Fonseca and Appellant via Twitter on a Kindle.\n\n{\u00b615} Bell testified that, at 9:10 a.m. on the day before Fonseca was murdered, he posted the message \u201cI love you so much\u201d in the Twitter chain with Bell that began on February 13, 2016. (Id. at 278.) At 9:16 a.m., Appellant posted, \u201cLove yoself bitch ass nigga she mine now quick in box in n kikn her.\u201d (Id. at 278, 282.) Bell explained that Appellant appeared to mean \u201cquit\u201d not \u201cquick\u201d and that \u201cin box in nkikn her\u201d was a reference to Bell\u2019s Kik Messenger app.\n\n{\u00b616} In a 3-second video posted on Bell\u2019s Kik Messenger video account, which was admitted into evidence, a man whose face is not visible wields a handgun and states, \u201cWe got them dicks [30 bullet clips]. I\u2019ll come to yo mama house, fuck boy, (unintelligible).\u201d The man is wearing a large round-faced watch. Bell conceded that Appellant had used her Kik account around the time when the video was posted.\n\n{\u00b617} Bell testified that she did not recognize the man in the Kik video. The state offered a photograph of Appellant taken on February 18, 2016 at 1:12 a.m. into evidence at the trial. Appellant was wearing a large round-faced watch in the photograph. Bell claimed that she could not determine from the picture whether the man in the video was wearing the same watch. However, Detective Sergeant Rick Spottleson later testified that the watch in the photograph was the same watch worn by the man in the video.\nFinally, Bell testified that, at 10:51 a.m. on the day that Fonseca was fatally shot, Appellant posted to his own Facebook account, \u201cNiggas want to fight? I\u2019m like naww we toot pipes [shoot guns] you a be fightin for your life.\u201d (Id. at 274.)\n\nAccording to Bell\u2019s testimony, she was in the front passenger seat of Appellant\u2019s automobile on February 17, 2016. Appellant, Bell, and another man, who she could not identify, were returning home from visiting friends when Appellant drove down Ayers Street. Appellant recognized the occupant of a vehicle parked near the residence. He stopped his automobile and exited to talk to the occupant. Appellant also conversed with another man who was standing on the street. The man on the street gave Appellant a cigarette.\n\nBell testified that the confrontation between Appellant and Fonseca took place behind the automobile in which she was seated. According to her testimony, \u201c[Fonseca] ran outside and, kind of, I don\u2019t know, I guess charged [Appellant].\u201d (Id. at 262.) Then Bell heard gunshots and she saw Fonseca fall to the curb. (Id. at 263, 269.) Appellant returned to his automobile and then drove to a residence on the south side of Youngstown. Bell testified that she could not recall whether Appellant said anything to her or the other passenger about the shooting while driving across town. (Id. at 265.)\n\nAfter he was arrested, Appellant conversed with Bell on the telephone. Bell testified that Appellant \u201cwanted to delete his Facebook.\u201d (Id. at 272.) Although Bell claimed that she could not recall whether Appellant also asked her to delete his messages on her Twitter account, Bell deleted both the Facebook and Twitter messages.\n\nBell authenticated a letter she received from Appellant while he was incarcerated pending trial, which she read aloud at the trial:\n\nI\u2019m so so so so sorry. I didn\u2019t listen to you when you said \u2013 I don\u2019t know what that says \u2013 forward. I\u2019m sorry. Again, I didn\u2019t think shit through and I put your life, as well as my nephew and my brother, in jeopardy. I was just so thirsty to get some money, didn\u2019t care where I was or what might or could have happened. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t \u2013 something \u2013 much as to me not caring but just being arrogant and not thinking about what if.\u201d\n\nBell testified that she did not know to what he was referring in the letter. (Id. at 292.)\nRaymond Ortiz, Fonseca\u2019s cousin, did not witness the shooting, but was in the residence on Ayers with Fonseca that day. Minutes before the shooting Fonseca tossed his \u201choodie\u201d to Ortiz and told him to get dressed and follow Fonseca outside because Appellant was en route to the residence. Fonseca exited the residence, but Ortiz stopped to put on his shoes. As Ortiz approached the door, he heard gunshots. Ortiz testified that his friend, Javaughn used Ortiz\u2019s mobile telephone to log into the Kik Messenger app and found the video.\n\nRios testified that he was standing on the sidewalk smoking a cigarette when an automobile stopped in the street. Appellant, who acted as if he knew Rios, stepped out of the automobile and began conversing with him. Rios gave Appellant a cigarette, even though, at the time, he did not recognize him. Rios initially thought that there was another man in the car, because the other occupant was wearing a \u201choodie.\u201d He explained that only men wear \u201choodies,\u201d and, although he had previously seen Bell with Fonseca, she typically wore a large wig, so he did not immediately recognize her.\n\nRios provided the following testimony regarding the interaction between Appellant and Fonseca prior to the fatal shooting:\n\nAll I know is [Fonseca] came outside and it was a big argument that started off. And from there, it just led on to \u201cget from in front of my property.\u201d And the guy said he wouldn\u2019t get from in front of the property like a couple times. And [Fonseca] said, I\u2019m gonna beat you up, and they was supposed to fight. And the guy went to reach for a gun and they just started struggling. Like [Fonseca] rushed him and they started tussling * * * * And he shot several times. And I had took off and ran by the other car. And he looked at me before he got in, but I was ducked by the back of the trunk. I had lifted my head up, but I ducked down at the same time.\n\n(Id. at 481.) Rios conceded that he fled after he saw the gun, but before he saw Appellant shoot Fonseca.\n\nRios added, \u201c[Fonseca] came out, he was out on the porch, they had their words, and he was just \u2013 come to find out, it was about a female. He told him, well, you\ncan have her, I don\u2019t care about her.\u201d (Id. at 483.) Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to Rios\u2019 second statement as hearsay, and the objection was sustained by the trial court. However, Rios later testified that he recognized Bell when he realized the argument was about a woman, specifically, \u201cwhen [Rios] came to think about when they was arguing and he told her, you could have the girl, the female, that how [Rios knew], okay, that had to be [Bell.]\u201d (Id. at 503.)\n\n\u00b627 Rios testified that Fonseca did not have a gun, but that he was \u201ctrying to fight [Appellant] bare hands [sic].\u201d (Id. at 485.) He further testified that Appellant refused to leave from the street several times, and \u201cthat\u2019s when [Fonseca] went to go fight, post up and box with him, and [Appellant] reached for a gun. And that\u2019s when [Fonseca] rushed him, like to grab him, and [Appellant] shot him, boom, boom, several times.\u201d (Id. at 489.)\n\n\u00b628 At the conclusion of the evidence, Appellant\u2019s counsel requested a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter, based on the testimony that Fonseca engaged in a verbal argument and instigated a fist fight with Appellant. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the evidence established that \u201c[Appellant] like squares off and [Fonseca] charges him and then that\u2019s when [Rios] sees him pull the gun.\u201d (Id. at 784.) Trial counsel mischaracterized Rios\u2019 testimony, as Rios testified that Appellant drew the weapon as Fonseca approached him and Fonseca lurched at Appellant to prevent him from discharging the weapon. The state countered that the social media messages offered at the trial established provocation on the part of Appellant, not Fonseca. (Id. at 787-788.)\n\n\u00b629 Based on the high-crime area in which the shooting occurred, the trial court confessed its initial inclination to provide the instruction. Nonetheless, the trial court refused to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter, stating:\n\nHere\u2019s my problem. That\u2019s an instruction I am required to give only if I am satisfied that there is evidence in the record that supports the elements of that offense, in particular [Appellant] being under the influence of sudden passion or in a fit of rage, either of which is brought on by serious provocation occasioned by the victim. So for discussion purposes, even if I assume that [Fonseca] * * * charged him, and I assume that constitutes a serious provocation, I still have no evidence in this record that [Appellant] is\nunder the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage. And I don\u2019t believe I can allow the jury simply to speculate on that portion of the offense.\n\n(Id. at 786-787.)\n\n\u00b630 The trial court ultimately recognized its \u201cinability to bootstrap the evidence in this case in any fashion that would justify an instruction that\u2019s based upon [Appellant] being in a sudden fit of rage or passion under the circumstances. There\u2019s just no evidence on that subject.\u201d (Id. at 788.) The trial court did, however, instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of murder.\n\n\u00b631 On June 8, 2018, the jury returned a guilty verdict on the charge of aggravated murder with the firearm specification. At a sentencing hearing held on August 10, 2018, the trial court found Appellant guilty of having a weapon while under disability. The trial court sentenced Appellant to life without the possibility of parole for the aggravated murder conviction, plus three years for the firearm specification to be served consecutively to the life sentence. The trial court further imposed a sentence of thirty months to be served concurrently for the weapon while under disability conviction. This timely appeal followed.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT REFUSED TO INSTRUCT THE JURY ON VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER WHEN THERE EXISTED SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO INSTRUCT THE JURY FOR INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.\n\n\u00b632 Aggravated murder is defined as \u201cpurposely, and with prior calculation and design, caus[ing] the death of another.\u201d R.C. 2903.01(A). Murder is defined as \u201cpurposely caus[ing] the death of another.\u201d R.C. 2903.02(A). In contrast, voluntary manslaughter is defined as knowingly causing the death of another \u201cwhile under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which is brought on by serious provocation occasioned by the victim that is reasonably sufficient to incite the person into using deadly force.\u201d R.C. 2903.03(A).\nVoluntary manslaughter is an inferior degree offense of murder, rather than a lesser included offense. *State v. Kanner*, 7th Dist. Monroe No. 04 MO 10, 2006-Ohio-3485, \u00b6 17. This is true because the elements of the crime of voluntary manslaughter are contained within the offense of murder, except for one or more additional mitigating elements. *Id.*\n\nIn order to find a defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter when the defendant is charged with murder, the jury must find by a preponderance of the evidence that the provocation was sufficient to arouse the passions of an ordinary person and that the particular defendant\u2019s passions were aroused. *State v. Shane*, 63 Ohio St.3d 630, 634, 590 N.E.2d 272 (1992). Thus, the test has both an objective and a subjective component. *Id.* When determining whether the subjective portion of this test has been satisfied, \u201cthe emotional and mental state of the defendant, as well as the conditions and circumstances that surrounded the incident in question, must be considered.\u201d *State v. Perdue*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 00 CA 244, 153 Ohio App.3d 213, 2003-Ohio-3481, 792 N.E.2d 747, \u00b6 11. Where insufficient evidence of provocation is presented and no reasonable jury could decide that the defendant was reasonably provoked by the victim, then no instruction on voluntary manslaughter can be given. *Shane, supra*, at 638.\n\nAn appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s decision whether to give a particular jury instruction under an abuse of discretion standard. *State v. Kaufman*, 187 Ohio App.3d 50, 2010-Ohio-1536, 931 N.E.2d 143, \u00b6 103. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of judgment; it implies an attitude on the part of the court that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. *State v. Adams*, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 404 N.E.2d 144 (1980).\n\nAppellant writes, \u201c[Appellant] was under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit or rage. [Fonseca\u2019s] words and actions provoked [Appellant] to protect himself.\u201d (Emphasis added)(Reply Brf., p. 7.) However, we have recognized that an instruction on voluntary manslaughter is generally incompatible with and contradictory to a defense of self-defense. *State v. Marcum*, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 04 CO 66, 2006-Ohio-7068, \u00b6 46 (\u201ca self-defense theory is usually contradictory to proof of sudden passion or rage.\u201d)\nTo establish self-defense through the use of deadly force, Appellant would have been required to prove: (1) that he \u201cwas not at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray\u201d; (2) that he had \u201ca bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that his only means of escape from such danger was in the use of such force\u201d; and (3) that he \u201cdid not violate any duty to retreat or avoid the danger.\u201d State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 24, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002), citing State v. Robbins, 58 Ohio St.2d 74, 388 N.E.2d 755 (1979), paragraph two of the syllabus. Furthermore, a person is privileged only to \u201cuse as much force as is reasonably necessary to repel [an] attack.\u201d State v. Jackson, 22 Ohio St.3d 281, 490 N.E.2d 893 (1986).\n\nWhile self-defense requires a showing of fear, voluntary manslaughter requires a showing of rage, with emotions of \u201canger, hatred, jealousy, and/or furious resentment.\u201d Perdue, supra, \u00b6 12, quoting State v. Harris, 129 Ohio App.3d 527, 535, 718 N.E.2d 488 (10th Dist. 1998); see, also, State v. Tantarelli, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 94APA11-618, 1995 WL 318730. The Ohio Supreme Court has specifically held that \u201cfear alone is insufficient to demonstrate the kind of emotional state necessary to constitute sudden passion or fit of rage.\u201d State v. Mack, 82 Ohio St.3d 198, 201, 1998 Ohio 375, 694 N.E.2d 1328, see also Kanner, supra, \u00b6 51-53; State v. Williams, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 11 JE 7, 2012-Ohio-5256, \u00b6 20-24; State v. Stevenson, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-512, 2018-Ohio-5140, \u00b6 29 (shooting someone out of fear rather than rage or passion does not support a jury instruction for voluntary manslaughter). The Ohio Supreme Court has likewise held that \u201cwords alone will not constitute reasonably sufficient provocation to incite the use of deadly force in most situations.\u201d State v. Thompson, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, 23 N.E.3d 1096, \u00b6 158.\n\nEarlier this year, the Tenth District distinguished their 1981 decision based on the previous version of R.C. 2901.03 in State v. Hodge, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 18AP-95, 2019-Ohio-4012. Relevant to the above-captioned appeal, the Tenth District explained:\n\nMr. Hodge \u201crelies extensively on this court\u2019s decision in State v. Roddy, 1981 Ohio App. Lexis 10292 (Nov. 17, 1981), Franklin App. No. 81AP-499, unreported (1981 Opinions 3706), for the proposition that fear for one\u2019s own safety is sufficient to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction.\u201d See\n[State v.] Harris, 129 Ohio App.3d [527,] 535, [718 N.E.2d 488]; Appellant\u2019s Brief at 25-26. As there, \u201csuch reliance is misplaced.\u201d Harris at 535. We have explained before, and reiterate here, that this aspect of Roddy did not survive amendment to the voluntary manslaughter statute. \u201c[G]iven that voluntary manslaughter now requires that the defendant be under the influence of \u2018sudden passion or fit of rage,\u2019 the position advanced by appellant and supported by Roddy cannot be *** maintained.\u201d Id. (citations omitted); see also, e.g., [State v.] Stevenson, [10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-512,] 2018-Ohio-5140 at \u00b6 27-28 (\u201cThis court has previously explained * * * why reliance on Roddy is misplaced [citing Harris and State v. Caldwell, 10th Dist. No. 98AP-165, 1998 Ohio App. Lexis 6220]. * * * * At the time that Roddy was decided, voluntary manslaughter was defined as knowingly causing the death of another while under extreme emotional stress brought on by serious provocation reasonably sufficient to incite the use of deadly force. * * * * R.C. 2901.03(A), however, was amended in 1982 to limit the application of the voluntary manslaughter statute * * * * [and] require[ ] that the defendant be under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage\u201d).\n\nId. at \u00b6 40.\n\n\u00b640 Rios\u2019 uncontested account of the shooting established that Fonseca ordered Appellant to leave the street and he was no longer interested in a romantic relationship with Bell. After repeated refusals by Appellant to leave the scene, Fonseca went to \u201cgo fight, post up and box\u201d with Appellant, and Appellant reached for a gun. When Appellant drew the gun, Fonseca \u201crushed him, like to grab him\u201d and Appellant shot Fonseca nine times. Bell testified that \u201c[Fonseca] ran outside and, kind of, I don\u2019t know, I guess charged [Appellant].\u201d (Id. at 262.) Although the Ohio Supreme Court qualified its conclusion that words alone will not constitute reasonably sufficient provocation to incite the use of deadly force in most situations, we find that the words exchanged by Appellant and Fonseca were insufficient to provoke deadly force based on the facts in this case.\nAt most, the record establishes that Fonseca left the porch with the intent to engage in a fist fight with Appellant. While Fonseca\u2019s intent to engage in a fist fight might have caused fear in the average person, it would not evoke passion or a fit of rage.\n\nFurthermore, Ohio intermediate courts have consistently rejected the argument that a physical altercation constitutes serious provocation inspiring sudden passion or a fit of rage. For instance, in State v. Thomas, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27266, 2015-Ohio-2935, the defendant approached the victim, who was selling drugs in front of the residence of the defendant\u2019s grandmother. Thomas asked the victim to move down the street. The victim responded by threatening to physically assault Thomas. Thomas swung his fist at the victim, but did not connect. The victim then pulled out a gun, which Thomas knocked to the ground. Thomas gained control over the gun and shot the victim.\n\nAt trial, Thomas explained that he fired the gun out of fear that the victim would take the gun from him and kill him. Id. at \u00b6 25. He requested both a self-defense and voluntary manslaughter instruction. The court agreed to provide a self-defense instruction but declined to provide a voluntary manslaughter instruction based on Thomas' testimony that he shot out of fear, not because of provocation from the fight. Id. at \u00b6 25. Thus, the Ninth District held that the evidence supported an instruction on self-defense, not voluntary manslaughter.\n\nIn State v. Perry, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 94-T-5165, 1997 WL 590789, (Aug 19, 1998), the defendant testified that he and the victim argued and the victim reached for his gun. The defendant testified that he attacked and beat the victim to death because he was afraid that she would shoot him. The defendant requested a voluntary manslaughter instruction, which the trial court denied. The Eleventh District found no abuse of discretion, because the defendant's testimony suggested self-defense, not voluntary manslaughter.\n\nFinally, we find that there is no subjective evidence of passion or rage on the part of Appellant in the record. Bell was the only witness who was present at the scene and accompanied Appellant after the fatal shooting. However, Bell testified that she could not recall anything that Appellant said during the car ride across town after the fatal shooting. In Thompson, supra, Thompson\u2019s only witness was present when Thompson shot the victim. She testified that Thompson got back in the car after the\nshooting as they drove to his sister\u2019s house. The Ohio Supreme Court opined that \u201c[h]er testimony provides no insight into Thompson\u2019s actual state of mind or level of agitation at the time of the shooting.\u201d Thompson, supra, \u00b6 159. The same is true here.\n\n\u00b646 Based upon the foregoing case law, we find that a reasonable person would conclude that the verbal altercation and the threat of a physical assault in this case were objectively insufficient to inspire sudden passion or a fit of rage, and, further, that there is no evidence of actual passion or rage on the part of Appellant in the record. In fact, the record, which includes Appellant\u2019s violent threats via social media and his letter of apology to Bell, directly contradicts any argument that Appellant acted with sudden passion or in a fit of rage. Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined Appellant\u2019s request for a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter, and Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error has no merit.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\u00b647 In summary, we find that the words exchanged between Fonseca and Appellant and the threat of a physical altercation were insufficient from an objective standpoint to constitute serious provocation or to incite the use of deadly force by Appellant. We further find that there is no evidence in the record that Appellant was acting under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage when he shot Fonseca. Accordingly, Appellant\u2019s conviction for aggravated murder is affirmed.\n\nWaite, P.J., concurs.\n\nRobb, J., concurs.\nFor the reasons stated in the Opinion rendered herein, the assignment of error is overruled and it is the final judgment and order of this Court that the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning County, Ohio, is affirmed. Costs to be waived.\n\nA certified copy of this opinion and judgment entry shall constitute the mandate in this case pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. It is ordered that a certified copy be sent by the clerk to the trial court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\nNOTICE TO COUNSEL\n\nThis document constitutes a final judgment entry."}

Harding, appeals a decision of the Madison County Court \nof Common Pleas denying his petition for postconviction relief.  For the reasons that follow, \nwe dismiss the appeal. \n{\u00b6 2} Appellant was indicted in 2016 for possession of marijuana and criminal tools.  \nThe charges arose from the traffic stop of a vehicle driven by appellant.  A search of the Madison CA2018-03-008 \n \n - 2 - \nvehicle yielded approximately 123 pounds of marijuana.  Appellant moved to suppress the \nmarijuana, claiming that the search of the car was unconstitutional.  The trial court overruled \nthe motion and the matter proceeded to a jury trial.  In November 2016, the jury found \nappellant guilty as charged, and the trial court sentenced appellant to an aggregate eight-\nyear prison term.  We subsequently upheld appellant's conviction and sentence.  State v. \nHarding, 12th Dist. Madison No. CA2016-11-029, 2017-Ohio-8930.    \n{\u00b6 3} In December 2017, appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief (\"PCR\"), \nchallenging his conviction and sentence and raising three grounds for relief.  On March 5, \n2018, the trial court summarily denied the PCR petition without a hearing on the basis of \nthe doctrine of res judicata. \n{\u00b6 4} Appellant now appeals, raising three assignments of error: \n{\u00b6 5} Assignment of Error No. 1: \n{\u00b6 6} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION; WHEN IT \nDENIED AND DISMISSED PETITIONER'S PROPERLY FILED PETITION TO VACATE \nOR SET ASIDE JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION OR SENTENCE ALLEGING ISSUES \nOUTSIDE THE RECORD, WITHOUT ANY REAL REVIEW OR HOLDING A HEARING; BY \nINCORRECTLY RULING THAT THE ISSUE OF THE VIDEO PRESENTED WAS  NOT \nTHE ORIGINAL VIDEO AND THE ISSUE HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY LITIGATED OR \nCOULD HAVE BEEN; INCORPORATING THE STATE'S FLAWED ARGUMENT THAT \nSUCH MATTER IS BARRED BY DOCTRINE OF RES JUDICATA. \n{\u00b6 7} Assignment of Error No. 2: \n{\u00b6 8} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION; WHEN IT \nDENIED AND DISMISSED PETITIONER'S PROPERLY FILED PETITION TO VACATE \nOR SET ASIDE JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION OR SENTENCE ALLEGING ISSUES \nOUTSIDE THE RECORD, WITHOUT ANY REAL REVIEW OR HOLDING A HEARING; BY Madison CA2018-03-008 \n \n - 3 - \nINCORRECTLY RULING THAT THE MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF PROSECUTORIAL \nMISCONDUCT, FULLY DISCOVERED AFTER TRIAL AND DIRECT APPEAL, \nESPECIALLY WITHHOLDING OF DISCOVERY AND BRADY MATERIALS; AND ARE \nISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY LITIGATED OR COULD HAVE BEEN, AND \nSUCH MATTERS ARE BARRED BY DOCTRINE OF RES JUDICATA. \n{\u00b6 9} Assignment of Error No. 3: \n{\u00b6 10} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION; WHEN IT \nDENIED AND DISMISSED PETITIONER'S PROPERLY FILED PETITION TO VACATE \nOR SET ASIDE JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION OR SENTENCE ALLEGING ISSUES \nOUTSIDE THE RECORD, WITHOUT ANY REAL REVIEW OR HOLDING A HEARING; BY \nINCORRECTLY RULING THAT THE ADDITIONAL ISSUES OF CONSTITUTIONALLY \nINEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL, ESPECIALLY THE FAILURE TO \nDEPOSE, FILE AFFIDAVIT OR CALL A NEEDED WITNESS, CRAIG VOIGT, WHO WAS \nA PASSENGER IN THE CAR DURING QUESTIONABLE TRAFFIC STOP; FULLY \nDISCOVERED AFTER TRIAL AND DIRECT APPEAL, AND SUPPORTED BY NEW \nAFFIDAVITS; ARE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY LITIGATED OR COULD \nHAVE BEEN AND BARRED BY RES JUDICATA. \n{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2953.21(C) requires a trial court to \"determine whether there are \nsubstantive grounds for relief\" in a PCR petition and to consider the PCR petition and its \nsupporting affidavits and documentary evidence in making that determination.  If, upon such \nconsideration, the trial court finds no grounds for a hearing and dismisses the petition, \"the \ncourt is required to make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the reasons \nfor dismissal and as to the grounds for relief relied upon in the petition.\"  State v. Lester, 41 \nOhio St.2d 51, 55 (1975); R.C. 2953.21(C).  Findings of fact and conclusions of law are \nmandatory even where a PCR petition is summarily denied.  State v. Mapson, 1 Ohio St.3d Madison CA2018-03-008 \n \n - 4 - \n217, 218 (1982).   \n{\u00b6 12} Res judicata is a proper basis for dismissing a PCR petition.  Lester at 55.  \n\"[W]hen a petition is summarily dismissed because all claims raised are barred by res \njudicata, the trial court should make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law with \nrespect thereto, and, where appropriate, should specify the portions of the files and records \nwhich establish the bar of res judicata.\"  (Emphasis sic.)  Id.  The trial court is required to \n\"make a finding as to the substantive basis of each claim for relief contained in a petition,\" \nand \"the findings of the trial court should reply to each of a petitioner's substantive claims.\"  \nId.  \n{\u00b6 13} The trial court denied appellant's PCR petition on the basis of res judicata in \na three-line entry.  The entry does not describe or discuss the specific claims raised by \nappellant.  Further, the entry does not indicate the trial court reviewed the documents \nsubmitted in support of the PCR petition, does not contain any reference to those supporting \ndocuments, and does not explain why the supporting documents do not prevent the \napplication of res judicata.  In other words, the trial court's entry dismissing the petition \nsimply concludes that appellant is entitled to no relief but does not set forth findings of fact \nand conclusions of law with regard to this holding, and thus does not satisfy the requirement \nfor mandatory findings of fact and conclusions of law under R.C. 2953.21(C).  Lester, 41 \nOhio St.2d at 56.   \n{\u00b6 14} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that a judgment entry denying \npostconviction relief without findings of fact and conclusions of law is not a final, appealable \norder.  Mapson, 1 Ohio St.3d at 218; State ex rel. Ferrell v. Clark, 13 Ohio St.3d 3 (1984); \nState v. Blacker, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2011-02-012, 2011-Ohio-3916, \u00b6 18.  See also \nState v. Sapp , 2d Dist. Clark No. 2002 CA 8, 2002-Ohio-3922; State v. Kinstle , 3d Dist. \nAllen No. 1-12-32, 2013-Ohio-850; State v. Francis, 5th Dist. Guernsey No. 07CA000023, Madison CA2018-03-008 \n \n - 5 - \n2008-Ohio-3307.   \n{\u00b6 15} We therefore dismiss appellant's appeal for lack of a final appealable order. 1  \nAs we stated in Blacker, \"the proper disposal of [appellant's] petition for postconviction relief \nnow requires [appellant] to file a motion with the trial court moving the court to make the \nrequisite findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the trial court's issue of these facts \nand conclusions.\"  Blacker at \u00b6 18.  \"Only then can this court properly rule on the matters \nwithin [appellant's petition] for postconviction relief.\"  Id.  \n{\u00b6 16} Appeal dismissed. \n \n S. POWELL, P.J., and PIPER, J., concur. \n \n \n                     \n1.  We note that while appellant did not raise the trial court's failure to make and file findings of fact and \nconclusions of law as an assignment of error, he did argue in his brief that the trial court failed to provide \nspecific findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by R.C. 2953.21(C).  We further note that Ohio \nappellate courts have also sua sponte dismissed appeals of the denial of a PCR petition for lack of a final \nappealable order.  See State v. Kinstle , 3d Dist.

Jennifer Simon, 4410 Market Street, Youngstown, Ohio 44512, for Appellant. \n     \u2013 2 \u2013 \nCase No. 17 MA 0167 \nDated:  March 25, 2019 \n \n   \nD\u2019APOLITO, J.   \n \n{\u00b61} Appellant Jonathon Daviduk  appeals the j udgment entry of the Mahoning \nCounty Court of Common Pleas denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  Having \nreviewed the record, we find that Appellant\u2019s plea was voluntarily entered, the trial court \ndid not abuse its discretion in overruling the motion, and Appellant has failed to \ndemonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.  Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court \nis affirmed.  \nFacts and Procedural History \n{\u00b62} On May 25, 2017, Appellant was indicted for one count of Aggravated \nRobbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1)(C), a felony of the first degree; one count of  \nRobbery, in violation of R.C.  2911.01(A)(2)(B), a felony of the second degree; and one \ncount of Kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(2)(C), a felony of the second degree.  \nHe signed a waiver of speedy trial rights on June 29, 2017 and trial was scheduled for \nJuly 31, 2017, then continued to August 28, 2017.  On August 25, 2017, the trial court \nwas notified that a plea agreement had been reached.   \n{\u00b63} At the plea hearing on August 28, 2017, Appellant announced that he \nwanted to go to trial and requested new counsel.  Appellant subsequently withdrew the \nrequest for new counsel and the trial was scheduled to begin the following day.  Plea \nnegotiations resumed prior to the commencement of trial on August 29, 2017, and \nAppellant decided once again that he wanted to accept the state\u2019s plea offer. \n{\u00b64} At the beginning of the plea hearing on August 29, 2017, the trial court \ninquired: \u201cSo what\u2019s different today from yesterday?\u201d  Appellant responded: \nWell, I was being stupid.  I want to apologize to you for the way I was acting.  \nIt was \u2013 I got a daughter that\u2019s on the way, that I didn\u2019t want to spend the \nrest of my life in prison on this.  I would rather take the deal and raise my \ndaughter when she\u2019s born.     \u2013 3 \u2013 \nCase No. 17 MA 0167 \n(8/29/17 Tr. 2).    \n{\u00b65} The trial court explained the rigorous demands of conducting a trial, \nincluding the preparation of evidence and argument by counsel, the subpoenaing of \nwitnesses, and the summoning of jurors.  After acknowledging that counsel, the \nwitnesses, and the prospective jurors were present at the courthouse and ready to \nproceed, the trial court stated, \u201cThis is not something where it\u2019s a ping pong game.  This \nis where you gotta [sic] make up your mind.  Whether you like it or not.  That\u2019s the bottom \nline.  And once you make up your mind, we all have to live with it.\u201d (Id. at 3). \n{\u00b66} Next, the trial court addressed Appellant\u2019s previous concerns regarding his \ntrial counsel.  The trial court asked, \u201cYesterday you indicated that you wanted to get a \ndifferent lawyer and that you were unhappy.  I just want to make sure that you\u2019re not just \nsaying that.  Are you completely satisfied with his legal representation and advice?\u201d  \nAppellant responded, \u201cI am, Your Honor.\u201d  (Id. at 6-7). \n{\u00b67} In the colloquy that followed, the trial court informed Appellant of the rights \nhe was waiving as a result of his guilty plea, and then reviewed the entire written plea \nagreement on the record.  Appellant testified that he had previously reviewed the plea \nagreement with his counsel.  Appellant waived all of his trial and appellate rights and \nentered guilty pleas to the charge of robbery and the amended charge of attempted \nkidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and 2905.01(A)(2)(C).  The trial court accepted \nAppellant\u2019s pleas and found him guilty of the foregoing charges.  The sentencing hearing \nwas scheduled for October 30, 2017. \n{\u00b68} On September 27, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se motion pursuant to Brady \nv. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) which was overruled as \nmoot by the trial court on October 23, 2017.  In his motion, Appellant sought information \npertaining to the codefendants and witnesses in the case.   \n{\u00b69} On October 30, 2017, prior to the commencement of the sentencing \nhearing, Appellant\u2019s trial counsel filed a motion to withdraw guilty plea.  Attached to the \nmotion was a copy of a handwritten letter from Appellant to trial counsel, dated October \n12, 2017, which reads, in its entirety, \u201cI\u2019m just informing you that I\u2019m taking back my plea \nand would like to go to trial I\u2019m done being stuck in here for something someone else did \nI also did a motion for Brady Material thank you have a nice day.\u201d     \u2013 4 \u2013 \nCase No. 17 MA 0167 \n{\u00b610} The trial court converted the sentencing hearing into a motion hearing and \nheard oral argument on the motion to withdraw plea.  Appellant restated the substance of \nhis letter to trial counsel at the hearing \u2013 that he was not guilty of the crimes and did not \nwant to waste years of his life in prison for the criminal behavior of others. \n{\u00b611} The state provided the following summary of the evidence that would be \noffered at trial.  Surveillance video captured Appellant and his codefendants entering a \nBurger King restaurant through the \u201cdrive-thru\u201d window, which had been left open by a \nBurger King employee, who was complicit in the crime.  Appellant was found at a \nresidence located within a few miles of the crime scene and clothing was found in the \nresidence that matched the clothing worn by one of the perpetrators that evening.  \nFurther, one of Appellant\u2019s codefendants had identified him as one of the perpetrators in \nhis proffer, and another codefendant confirmed his involvement in the crime.  The state \nargued that it would suffer prejudice if the motion to withdraw were granted, because one \nof the codefendants had already been sentenced. \n{\u00b612} Citing our decision in State v. Cuthbertson, 139 Ohio App.3d 895, 898-899, \n2000-Ohio-2638, 746 N.E.2d 197 (7th Dist.2000), the trial court observed that the timing \nof the motion was unreasonable because more than a month had passed since the plea \nhearing, and, further, that the state would suffer prejudice, because a witness for the \nprosecution had already been sentenced.  (10/30/17 Tr. 17).  The trial court opined that \nAppellant\u2019s plea colloquy had been thorough and his trial counsel had provided exemplary \nrepresentation.  The trial court tersely concluded that Appellant filed the motion to \nwithdraw plea simply because he \u201c[didn\u2019t] want to go to jail.\u201d  (Id. at 18).  The trial court \nfurther found that no evidence of Appellant\u2019s innocence had been offered at the hearing.  \nBecause Appellant had fully understood the elements of the crimes, the evidence that \nwould be offered against him at trial, and the potential sentence prior to entering his plea, \nthe trial court overruled the motion to withdraw and proceeded to sentencing. \nAnalysis \n{\u00b613} Appellant asserts three assignments of error, each challenging the validity \nof his plea:   \u2013 5 \u2013 \nCase No. 17 MA 0167 \nFirst Assignment of Error: \nAppellant\u2019s plea of guilty was not knowingly, voluntarily and/or intelligently \nmade. \n{\u00b614} Guilty pleas are governed by Crim.R. 11.  The notice requirements for non-\nconstitutional rights incorporated in Rule 11 are subject to a substantial compliance \nanalysis, which looks to the totality of the circumstances to ascertain whether the \ndefendant subjectively understood the implications of his plea and the rights he waived. \nState v. Rudai, 7th Dist. No. 18 BE 0002, 2018-Ohio-4464, citing State v. Nero, 56 Ohio \nSt.3d 106, 108, 564 N.E.2d 474 (1990); State v. Stewart, 51 Ohio St.2d 86, 93, 364 N.E.2d \n1163 (1977).  Strict compliance is required when notifying the defendant of constitutional \nrights incorporated in Rule 11.  State v. Barker , 129 Ohio St.3d 472, 2011-Ohio-4130, \n953 N.E.2d 826, \u00b6 15, citing State v. Veney, 120 Ohio St.3d 176, 2008-Ohio-5200, 897 \nN.E.2d 621, \u00b6 18.   \n{\u00b615} A review of the record demonstrates that the trial court engaged in a \nrequired colloquy with Appellant regarding the nature of the charges against him, as well \nas the rights he was waiving as a part of his plea.  Appellant specifically acknowledged \nthat his plea was \u201cfreely and voluntarily made,\u201d and that he wanted to \u201cwaive all of [his] \ntrial and appellate rights and go ahead with [the] plea.\u201d  (8/29/17 Tr. 14).  Appellant never \nexpressed any equivocation to cast doubt on the voluntariness of his plea at the plea \nhearing.   \n{\u00b616} Nonetheless, Appellant contends that his \u201clack of criminal history, combined \nwith his youth, quick pace at which the case was forced to proceed, evidence of \nreluctance to enter into a plea, concerns with the legal representation that was being \nprovided to him and statements made by the Court prior to Appellant entering his plea \ngive cause to believe the plea was not made knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently but \nrather entered into under pressure.\u201d  (Appellant Brf. 7).  However, an examination of the \nrecord reveals that Appellant\u2019s argument is unfounded. \n{\u00b617} First, there is no evidence in the record that the matter was forced to \nproceed at a quick pace.  Appellant was indicted on May 15, 2017.  He failed to appear \nat a status conference on June 19, 2017 and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.    \u2013 6 \u2013 \nCase No. 17 MA 0167 \nHe was held without bond for the remainder of the pretrial period.  He signed a waiver of \nspeedy trial rights on June 29, 2017 and trial was scheduled for Ju ly 31, 20 17, then \ncontinued to August 29, 2017.  Contrary to his argument, Appellant had ample time to \nconsider the maximum possible sentences should he be convicted, and the considerable \nreduction in his sentence should he enter a guilty plea.   \n{\u00b618} Turning to Appellant\u2019s \u201cevidence of reluctance,\u201d the trial court specifically \nasked Appellant to explain his decision to enter into a plea agreement with the state one \nday after he had expressed an unwillingness to plead and dissatisfaction with his counsel.  \nAppellant was given ample opportunity to express his reservations, but, instead, he \napologized to the trial court and articulated a thoughtful and compelling reason for \naccepting the plea deal. \n{\u00b619} Based upon the record, the trial court complied with Crim.R. 11 before \naccepting Appellant\u2019s plea, and there is no evidence in the record that suggests \nAppellant\u2019s plea was involuntary.  Accordingly, we find that the first assignment of error \nis meritless.   \nSecond Assignment of Error: \nThe trial court committed plain error by refusing to allow Appellant to \nwithdraw his plea of guilty. \n{\u00b620} Criminal Rule 32.1 provides:  \u201cA motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no \ncontest may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice \nthe court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the \ndefendant to withdraw his or her plea.\u201d  A motion made pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1 is \naddressed to the sound discretio n of the trial court, and the good faith, credibility and \nweight of the movant\u2019s assertions in support of the motion are matters to be resolved by \nthat court.  State v. Reed, 7th Dist. No. 04 MA 236, 2005-Ohio-2925, \u00b6 7.   \n{\u00b621} In State v. Xie, 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 527, 584 N.E.2d 715 (1992), the Ohio \nSupreme Court set forth the burden of proof and the standard of review for a motion to \nwithdraw plea prior to sentencing:  \nWe agree that a presentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be   \u2013 7 \u2013 \nCase No. 17 MA 0167 \nfreely and liberally granted.  Nevertheless, it must be recognized that a \ndefendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a plea prior to \nsentencing.  Therefore, the trial court must conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether there is a reasonable and legitimate basis for the withdrawal of the \nplea.  In this case, the trial court held such a hearing, at which it carefully \nconsidered Xie's motion and all the circumstances surrounding the entering \nof the plea.  Absent an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in \nmaking the ruling, its decision must be affirmed. For us to find an abuse of \ndiscretion in this case, we must find more than an error of judgment. We \nmust find that the trial court's ruling was \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary or \nunconscionable.\u201d State v. Adams  (1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 3d \n169, 173, 404 N.E.2d 144, 149. \n{\u00b622} In State v. Cuthbertson , 7th Dist. No. 98CA133, 139 Ohio App.3d 895, \n2000-Ohio-2638, 746 N.E.2d 197, we articulated the factors to be considered when \ndetermining whether a trial court abused its discretion in overruling a motion to withdraw \nplea:  (1) whether a withdrawal will result in prejudice to the prosecution; (2) the \nrepresentation afforded to the defendant by counsel; (3) the extent of the hearing \nconducted by Crim.R. 11; (4) the extent of the hearing on the motion to withdraw; (5) the \namount of consideration given to the motion by the court; (6) the timing of the motion; (7) \nthe reasons given for the withdrawal; (8) the defendant\u2019s understanding of the charges \nand penalties; and (9) the existence of a meritorious defense.  Id. at 898-899, citing State \nv. Thomas, 7th Dist. Nos. 96 C.A. 223, 96 C.A. 225, 96 C.A. 226, 1998 WL 934645, *4. \nNo one of these factors is conclusive. Cuthbertson at 899. \n{\u00b623}  Based on the transcript of the October 30th hearing, the trial court \nthoughtfully analyzed each relevant factor in evaluating the motion to withdraw his guilty \nplea.  Further, Appellant was given ample opportunity to articulate his reasons for seeking \nto withdraw his plea.  As a consequence, we find that the hearing was sufficient and that \nthe trial court gave full and fair consideration to the motion.  Accordingly, we conclude \nthat the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled the motion to withdraw \nplea, and that Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error has no merit.  \nThird Assignment of Error:   \u2013 8 \u2013 \nCase No. 17 MA 0167 \nAppellant was prejudiced and deprived of the effective assistance of trial counsel \nin violation of Appellant\u2019s rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments \nto the United States Constitution, and Sections 10 and 16, Article 1 of the Ohio \nConstitution.   \n{\u00b624} To prove a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must \nshow that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, that is, his performance fell below an \nobjective standard of reasonableness, and this deficient performance prejudiced the \ndefense.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 684, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984).  Appellant \nargues that his counsel was ineffective because the motion to withdraw his guilty plea \nwas not filed until the day of the sentencing hearing, despite the fact that Appellant\u2019s \nhandwritten letter was dated October 12, 2017.  Appellant further argues that trial counsel \ndid not vigorously argue the motion.  \n{\u00b625} With respect to the timing of the motion, the trial court observed:   \nThis is a month after the plea was entered, and the world has turned.  One \nof the defendants was already sentenced.  That\u2019s one of the cooperating \ndefendants who would give testimony against this defendant, whose \ntestimony may now be unavailable because of the fact that his sentence \nhas already been put into execution.   \n(Id. at 17).   \n{\u00b626} Appellant\u2019s handwritten letter attached to the motion to withdraw the guilty \nplea was dated October 12, 2017.  Appellant contends that, if trial counsel had filed the \nmotion immediately upon receiving Appellant\u2019s letter, then the trial court would have \ngranted the motion to withdraw.  \n{\u00b627} Appellant\u2019s argument fails for two reasons.  First, the trial court\u2019s \ndetermination that the timing of the motion was unreasonable was based on the fact that \na month had passed since the plea was entered.  Assuming arguendo that trial counsel \nfiled the motion the day after he received Appellant\u2019s letter, the motion would still have \nbeen filed more than a month after the plea agreement was executed.  Second, the trial \ncourt reasoned that the state suffered prejudice because one of the codefendants had   \u2013 9 \u2013 \nCase No. 17 MA 0167 \nalready been sentenced in the interim between Appellant\u2019s guilty plea and sentencing.  \nAppellant argues that, had trial counsel timely filed a motion to withdraw, the state could \nhave continued the codefendant\u2019s sentencing hearing until the motion to withdraw the \nguilty plea could be heard.  This assertion is speculative at best, because the record is \nsilent as to the date that the codefendant was sentenced.   \n{\u00b628} Next, Appellant asserts that \u201clittle, if any, argument was given in support of \nthe Motion [to withdraw the plea].\u201d  (Appellant Brf. 12).  Appellant was given ample \nopportunity to explain the reasons supporting his motion.  Furthermore, the motion to \nwithdraw the plea raises the same arguments Appellant raises here, namely that his \n\u201cjudgment was impaired when he entered his guilty plea to emotions of fear and panic,\u201d \nand as a result his plea was not knowingly, voluntarily, or intelligently made.  (10/30/17 \nMotion 2).   Appellant predicates his argument on the fact that he chose not to enter the \nplea and requested new counsel one day prior to the execution of the plea agreement.  \nHowever, Appellant\u2019s decision to enter his guilty pleas on August 29, 2017 was fully \nexplained in the record.   \n{\u00b629} Having reviewed the record, we find that Appellant has failed to show that \ncounsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable advocacy or that \nAppellant suffered any prejudice.  As a consequence, we further find that Appellant\u2019s third \nassignment of error is meritless.    \n{\u00b630} Finally, we address sua sponte an error not raised by Appellant that \nnevertheless affects his substantial rights. See Crim.R. 52(B).  At the sentencing hearing, \nthe trial court imposed a four-year sentence for Appellant\u2019s robbery conviction and a \nthree-year sentence for his attempted kidnapping conviction, to be served concurrently. \n(Id. 29-30).  In the judgment entry, the trial court imposed a four-year term of imprisonment \nfor each crime, to be served concurrently.  (11/3/17 JE).   \n{\u00b631} Crim.R. 43(A) provides that \u201cthe defendant must be physically present at \nevery stage of the criminal proceeding and trial, including * * * the imposition of sentence.\u201d  \nBecause a defendant is required to be present when sentence is imposed, it constitutes \nreversible error for the trial court to impose a sentence in its judgment entry different than \nthe sentence announced at the sentencing hearing in defendant's presence.  State v. \nWilliams, 7th Dist. No. 11 MA 131, 2012-Ohio-6277, \u00b6 53.   \u2013 10 \u2013 \nCase No. 17 MA 0167 \n{\u00b632} If there exists a variance between the sentence pronounced in open court \nand the sentence imposed by a court\u2019s judgment entry, a remand for resentencing is \nrequired.  State v. Reinthaler, 7th Dist. No. 16 MA 0170, 2018-Ohio-2483, \u00b6 9.  Crim.R. \n36 provides that \u201c[c]lerical mistakes in judgments, orders, or other parts of the record, and \nerrors in the record arising from oversight or omission, may be corrected by the court at \nany time.\u201d  Accordingly, this matter must be remanded so that the trial court can enter a \nnunc pro tunc entry reflecting the sentence imposed at the sentencing hearing.  Id. at \u00b6 \n16, State v. Tesack, 7th Dist. No. 15 JE 4, 2015-Ohio-5601, \u00b6 18. \nConclusion \n{\u00b633} In summary, we find that Appellant\u2019s plea was freely and voluntarily entered, \nand, accordingly, the judgment of the trial court with regard to Appellant\u2019s motion to \nwithdraw his plea is affirmed.  However, this cause is remanded for a nunc pro tunc order \nmemorializing the sentence imposed at the sentencing hearing.  \n \n \n \nWaite, P.J., concurs.  \n \nRobb, J., concurs. \n \n [Cite as State v.

Jennifer Simon, 4410 Market Street, Youngstown, Ohio 44512, for Appellant.\nD'APOLITO, J.\n\n{\u00b61} Appellant Jonathon Daviduk appeals the judgment entry of the Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Having reviewed the record, we find that Appellant's plea was voluntarily entered, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the motion, and Appellant has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\nFacts and Procedural History\n\n{\u00b62} On May 25, 2017, Appellant was indicted for one count of Aggravated Robbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1)(C), a felony of the first degree; one count of Robbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(2)(B), a felony of the second degree; and one count of Kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(2)(C), a felony of the second degree. He signed a waiver of speedy trial rights on June 29, 2017 and trial was scheduled for July 31, 2017, then continued to August 28, 2017. On August 25, 2017, the trial court was notified that a plea agreement had been reached.\n\n{\u00b63} At the plea hearing on August 28, 2017, Appellant announced that he wanted to go to trial and requested new counsel. Appellant subsequently withdrew the request for new counsel and the trial was scheduled to begin the following day. Plea negotiations resumed prior to the commencement of trial on August 29, 2017, and Appellant decided once again that he wanted to accept the state's plea offer.\n\n{\u00b64} At the beginning of the plea hearing on August 29, 2017, the trial court inquired: \u201cSo what's different today from yesterday?\u201d Appellant responded:\n\nWell, I was being stupid. I want to apologize to you for the way I was acting. It was \u2013 I got a daughter that's on the way, that I didn't want to spend the rest of my life in prison on this. I would rather take the deal and raise my daughter when she's born.\nThe trial court explained the rigorous demands of conducting a trial, including the preparation of evidence and argument by counsel, the subpoenaing of witnesses, and the summoning of jurors. After acknowledging that counsel, the witnesses, and the prospective jurors were present at the courthouse and ready to proceed, the trial court stated, \u201cThis is not something where it\u2019s a ping pong game. This is where you gotta [sic] make up your mind. Whether you like it or not. That\u2019s the bottom line. And once you make up your mind, we all have to live with it.\u201d (Id. at 3).\n\nNext, the trial court addressed Appellant\u2019s previous concerns regarding his trial counsel. The trial court asked, \u201cYesterday you indicated that you wanted to get a different lawyer and that you were unhappy. I just want to make sure that you\u2019re not just saying that. Are you completely satisfied with his legal representation and advice?\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cI am, Your Honor.\u201d (Id. at 6-7).\n\nIn the colloquy that followed, the trial court informed Appellant of the rights he was waiving as a result of his guilty plea, and then reviewed the entire written plea agreement on the record. Appellant testified that he had previously reviewed the plea agreement with his counsel. Appellant waived all of his trial and appellate rights and entered guilty pleas to the charge of robbery and the amended charge of attempted kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and 2905.01(A)(2)(C). The trial court accepted Appellant\u2019s pleas and found him guilty of the foregoing charges. The sentencing hearing was scheduled for October 30, 2017.\n\nOn September 27, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se motion pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) which was overruled as moot by the trial court on October 23, 2017. In his motion, Appellant sought information pertaining to the codefendants and witnesses in the case.\n\nOn October 30, 2017, prior to the commencement of the sentencing hearing, Appellant\u2019s trial counsel filed a motion to withdraw guilty plea. Attached to the motion was a copy of a handwritten letter from Appellant to trial counsel, dated October 12, 2017, which reads, in its entirety, \u201cI'm just informing you that I'm taking back my plea and would like to go to trial I'm done being stuck in here for something someone else did I also did a motion for Brady Material thank you have a nice day.\u201d\nThe trial court converted the sentencing hearing into a motion hearing and heard oral argument on the motion to withdraw plea. Appellant restated the substance of his letter to trial counsel at the hearing \u2013 that he was not guilty of the crimes and did not want to waste years of his life in prison for the criminal behavior of others.\n\nThe state provided the following summary of the evidence that would be offered at trial. Surveillance video captured Appellant and his codefendants entering a Burger King restaurant through the \u201cdrive-thru\u201d window, which had been left open by a Burger King employee, who was complicit in the crime. Appellant was found at a residence located within a few miles of the crime scene and clothing was found in the residence that matched the clothing worn by one of the perpetrators that evening. Further, one of Appellant\u2019s codefendants had identified him as one of the perpetrators in his proffer, and another codefendant confirmed his involvement in the crime. The state argued that it would suffer prejudice if the motion to withdraw were granted, because one of the codefendants had already been sentenced.\n\nCiting our decision in State v. Cuthbertson, 139 Ohio App.3d 895, 898-899, 2000-Ohio-2638, 746 N.E.2d 197 (7th Dist.2000), the trial court observed that the timing of the motion was unreasonable because more than a month had passed since the plea hearing, and, further, that the state would suffer prejudice, because a witness for the prosecution had already been sentenced. (10/30/17 Tr. 17). The trial court opined that Appellant\u2019s plea colloquy had been thorough and his trial counsel had provided exemplary representation. The trial court tersely concluded that Appellant filed the motion to withdraw plea simply because he \u201c[didn\u2019t] want to go to jail.\u201d (Id. at 18). The trial court further found that no evidence of Appellant\u2019s innocence had been offered at the hearing. Because Appellant had fully understood the elements of the crimes, the evidence that would be offered against him at trial, and the potential sentence prior to entering his plea, the trial court overruled the motion to withdraw and proceeded to sentencing.\n\nAnalysis\n\nAppellant asserts three assignments of error, each challenging the validity of his plea:\nFirst Assignment of Error:\n\nAppellant's plea of guilty was not knowingly, voluntarily and/or intelligently made.\n\n\u00b614 Guilty pleas are governed by Crim.R. 11. The notice requirements for non-constitutional rights incorporated in Rule 11 are subject to a substantial compliance analysis, which looks to the totality of the circumstances to ascertain whether the defendant subjectively understood the implications of his plea and the rights he waived. State v. Rudai, 7th Dist. No. 18 BE 0002, 2018-Ohio-4464, citing State v. Nero, 56 Ohio St.3d 106, 108, 564 N.E.2d 474 (1990); State v. Stewart, 51 Ohio St.2d 86, 93, 364 N.E.2d 1163 (1977). Strict compliance is required when notifying the defendant of constitutional rights incorporated in Rule 11. State v. Barker, 129 Ohio St.3d 472, 2011-Ohio-4130, 953 N.E.2d 826, \u00b6 15, citing State v. Veney, 120 Ohio St.3d 176, 2008-Ohio-5200, 897 N.E.2d 621, \u00b6 18.\n\n\u00b615 A review of the record demonstrates that the trial court engaged in a required colloquy with Appellant regarding the nature of the charges against him, as well as the rights he was waiving as a part of his plea. Appellant specifically acknowledged that his plea was \u201cfreely and voluntarily made,\u201d and that he wanted to \u201cwaive all of [his] trial and appellate rights and go ahead with [the] plea.\u201d (8/29/17 Tr. 14). Appellant never expressed any equivocation to cast doubt on the voluntariness of his plea at the plea hearing.\n\n\u00b616 Nonetheless, Appellant contends that his \u201clack of criminal history, combined with his youth, quick pace at which the case was forced to proceed, evidence of reluctance to enter into a plea, concerns with the legal representation that was being provided to him and statements made by the Court prior to Appellant entering his plea give cause to believe the plea was not made knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently but rather entered into under pressure.\u201d (Appellant Brf. 7). However, an examination of the record reveals that Appellant\u2019s argument is unfounded.\n\n\u00b617 First, there is no evidence in the record that the matter was forced to proceed at a quick pace. Appellant was indicted on May 15, 2017. He failed to appear at a status conference on June 19, 2017 and a bench warrant was issued for his arrest.\nHe was held without bond for the remainder of the pretrial period. He signed a waiver of speedy trial rights on June 29, 2017 and trial was scheduled for July 31, 2017, then continued to August 29, 2017. Contrary to his argument, Appellant had ample time to consider the maximum possible sentences should he be convicted, and the considerable reduction in his sentence should he enter a guilty plea.\n\nTurning to Appellant\u2019s \u201cevidence of reluctance,\u201d the trial court specifically asked Appellant to explain his decision to enter into a plea agreement with the state one day after he had expressed an unwillingness to plead and dissatisfaction with his counsel. Appellant was given ample opportunity to express his reservations, but, instead, he apologized to the trial court and articulated a thoughtful and compelling reason for accepting the plea deal.\n\nBased upon the record, the trial court complied with Crim.R. 11 before accepting Appellant's plea, and there is no evidence in the record that suggests Appellant\u2019s plea was involuntary. Accordingly, we find that the first assignment of error is meritless.\n\nSecond Assignment of Error:\n\nThe trial court committed plain error by refusing to allow Appellant to withdraw his plea of guilty.\n\nCriminal Rule 32.1 provides: \u201cA motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\u201d A motion made pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1 is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the good faith, credibility and weight of the movant\u2019s assertions in support of the motion are matters to be resolved by that court. State v. Reed, 7th Dist. No. 04 MA 236, 2005-Ohio-2925, \u00b6 7.\n\nIn State v. Xie, 62 Ohio St.3d 521, 527, 584 N.E.2d 715 (1992), the Ohio Supreme Court set forth the burden of proof and the standard of review for a motion to withdraw plea prior to sentencing:\n\nWe agree that a presentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be\nfreely and liberally granted. Nevertheless, it must be recognized that a defendant does not have an absolute right to withdraw a plea prior to sentencing. Therefore, the trial court must conduct a hearing to determine whether there is a reasonable and legitimate basis for the withdrawal of the plea. In this case, the trial court held such a hearing, at which it carefully considered Xie's motion and all the circumstances surrounding the entering of the plea. Absent an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in making the ruling, its decision must be affirmed. For us to find an abuse of discretion in this case, we must find more than an error of judgment. We must find that the trial court's ruling was \u201cunreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d State v. Adams (1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 163d 169, 173, 404 N.E.2d 144, 149.\n\n\u00b622 In State v. Cuthbertson, 7th Dist. No. 98CA133, 139 Ohio App.3d 895, 2000-Ohio-2638, 746 N.E.2d 197, we articulated the factors to be considered when determining whether a trial court abused its discretion in overruling a motion to withdraw plea: (1) whether a withdrawal will result in prejudice to the prosecution; (2) the representation afforded to the defendant by counsel; (3) the extent of the hearing conducted by Crim.R. 11; (4) the extent of the hearing on the motion to withdraw; (5) the amount of consideration given to the motion by the court; (6) the timing of the motion; (7) the reasons given for the withdrawal; (8) the defendant\u2019s understanding of the charges and penalties; and (9) the existence of a meritorious defense. Id. at 898-899, citing State v. Thomas, 7th Dist. Nos. 96 C.A. 223, 96 C.A. 225, 96 C.A. 226, 1998 WL 934645, *4. No one of these factors is conclusive. Cuthbertson at 899.\n\n\u00b623 Based on the transcript of the October 30th hearing, the trial court thoughtfully analyzed each relevant factor in evaluating the motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Further, Appellant was given ample opportunity to articulate his reasons for seeking to withdraw his plea. As a consequence, we find that the hearing was sufficient and that the trial court gave full and fair consideration to the motion. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled the motion to withdraw plea, and that Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error has no merit.\n\nThird Assignment of Error:\nAppellant was prejudiced and deprived of the effective assistance of trial counsel in violation of Appellant's rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Sections 10 and 16, Article 1 of the Ohio Constitution.\n\n{\u00b624} To prove a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient, that is, his performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and this deficient performance prejudiced the defense. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 684, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). Appellant argues that his counsel was ineffective because the motion to withdraw his guilty plea was not filed until the day of the sentencing hearing, despite the fact that Appellant's handwritten letter was dated October 12, 2017. Appellant further argues that trial counsel did not vigorously argue the motion.\n\n{\u00b625} With respect to the timing of the motion, the trial court observed:\n\nThis is a month after the plea was entered, and the world has turned. One of the defendants was already sentenced. That's one of the cooperating defendants who would give testimony against this defendant, whose testimony may now be unavailable because of the fact that his sentence has already been put into execution.\n\n(*Id.* at 17).\n\n{\u00b626} Appellant's handwritten letter attached to the motion to withdraw the guilty plea was dated October 12, 2017. Appellant contends that, if trial counsel had filed the motion immediately upon receiving Appellant's letter, then the trial court would have granted the motion to withdraw.\n\n{\u00b627} Appellant's argument fails for two reasons. First, the trial court's determination that the timing of the motion was unreasonable was based on the fact that a month had passed since the plea was entered. Assuming arguendo that trial counsel filed the motion the day after he received Appellant's letter, the motion would still have been filed more than a month after the plea agreement was executed. Second, the trial court reasoned that the state suffered prejudice because one of the codefendants had\nalready been sentenced in the interim between Appellant's guilty plea and sentencing. Appellant argues that, had trial counsel timely filed a motion to withdraw, the state could have continued the codefendant's sentencing hearing until the motion to withdraw the guilty plea could be heard. This assertion is speculative at best, because the record is silent as to the date that the codefendant was sentenced.\n\n{\u00b628} Next, Appellant asserts that \u201clittle, if any, argument was given in support of the Motion [to withdraw the plea].\u201d (Appellant Brf. 12). Appellant was given ample opportunity to explain the reasons supporting his motion. Furthermore, the motion to withdraw the plea raises the same arguments Appellant raises here, namely that his \u201cjudgment was impaired when he entered his guilty plea to emotions of fear and panic,\u201d and as a result his plea was not knowingly, voluntarily, or intelligently made. (10/30/17 Motion 2). Appellant predicates his argument on the fact that he chose not to enter the plea and requested new counsel one day prior to the execution of the plea agreement. However, Appellant's decision to enter his guilty pleas on August 29, 2017 was fully explained in the record.\n\n{\u00b629} Having reviewed the record, we find that Appellant has failed to show that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable advocacy or that Appellant suffered any prejudice. As a consequence, we further find that Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is meritless.\n\n{\u00b630} Finally, we address sua sponte an error not raised by Appellant that nevertheless affects his substantial rights. See Crim.R. 52(B). At the sentencing hearing, the trial court imposed a four-year sentence for Appellant\u2019s robbery conviction and a three-year sentence for his attempted kidnapping conviction, to be served concurrently. (Id. 29-30). In the judgment entry, the trial court imposed a four-year term of imprisonment for each crime, to be served concurrently. (11/3/17 JE).\n\n{\u00b631} Crim.R. 43(A) provides that \u201cthe defendant must be physically present at every stage of the criminal proceeding and trial, including *** the imposition of sentence.\u201d Because a defendant is required to be present when sentence is imposed, it constitutes reversible error for the trial court to impose a sentence in its judgment entry different than the sentence announced at the sentencing hearing in defendant's presence. State v. Williams, 7th Dist. No. 11 MA 131, 2012-Ohio-6277, \u00b6 53.\n\u00b632 If there exists a variance between the sentence pronounced in open court and the sentence imposed by a court\u2019s judgment entry, a remand for resentencing is required. State v. Reinthaler, 7th Dist. No. 16 MA 0170, 2018-Ohio-2483, \u00b6 9. Crim.R. 36 provides that \u201c[c]lerical mistakes in judgments, orders, or other parts of the record, and errors in the record arising from oversight or omission, may be corrected by the court at any time.\u201d Accordingly, this matter must be remanded so that the trial court can enter a nunc pro tunc entry reflecting the sentence imposed at the sentencing hearing. Id. at \u00b6 16, State v. Tesack, 7th Dist. No. 15 JE 4, 2015-Ohio-5601, \u00b6 18.\n\nConclusion\n\n\u00b633 In summary, we find that Appellant\u2019s plea was freely and voluntarily entered, and, accordingly, the judgment of the trial court with regard to Appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea is affirmed. However, this cause is remanded for a nunc pro tunc order memorializing the sentence imposed at the sentencing hearing.\n\nWaite, P.J., concurs.\n\nRobb, J., concurs.\nAffirmed\n\nFor the reasons stated in the Opinion rendered herein, the assignments of error are overruled and it is the final judgment and order of this Court that the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning County, Ohio, is affirmed, but remanded for nunc pro tunc order for sentencing. Costs are waived.\n\nA certified copy of this opinion and judgment entry shall constitute the mandate in this case pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. It is ordered that a certified copy be sent by the clerk to the trial court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\nNOTICE TO COUNSEL\n\nThis document constitutes a final judgment entry."}

Box \n5500, Chillicothe, Ohio 45601 \n Defendant-Appellant-Pro Se   \n \n. . . . . . . . . . . . . \n  \nTUCKER, J.  \n-2- \n \n{\u00b6 1} This appeal relates to Appellant Michael Hazel\u2019s pro se motion for leave to \nfile a motion for a new trial based upon the discovery of new evidence.  Hazel\u2019s motion, \nthough it asserts and comments upon a number of facts and issues, asserts that he is \nentitled to such leave because he is not the biological father of a child born to Heather \nKunce, that his alleged paternity of Kunce\u2019s child was used to enhance his domestic \nviolence convictions from fourth to third degree felonies, that he was unavoidably \nprevented from discovery of this evidence in time to allow a timely filed motion seeking a \nnew trial, and, as such, he should be allowed to file a motion for a new trial and, ultimately, \nhe should be granted a new trial.  The trial court overruled Hazel\u2019s motion prompting the \npending appeal.  Hazel was appointed appellate counsel who filed a brief under the \nauthority of Anders v. California , 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), \nwith Hazel then filing a pro se brief.  We conclude that there are no potentially meritorious \nappellate issues.  The trial court\u2019s decision will, accordingly, be affirmed. \n \nProcedural History \n{\u00b6 2} A recitation of the long and somewhat complicated history of Hazel\u2019s case is \nhelpful to an understanding of his newly discovered evidence contention, and why this \nevidence, from Hazel\u2019s perspective, entitles him to a new trial.  Hazel\u2019s newly discovered \nevidence has its genesis in Hazel\u2019s 2003 conviction for aggravated burglary in Clark No. \n03-CR-0592 (2003 case).  Hazel, in the 2003 case, was indicted for aggravated burglary, \ndomestic violence, and intimidation of a witness.  The victim was Kunce, who, at the time, \nthought Hazel was the father of her child.  The 2003 case was resolved by Hazel\u2019s plea  \n-3- \nto aggravated burglary with the remaining counts being dismissed.  Hazel was \nsentenced to an agreed upon three year prison term.   \n{\u00b6 3} Hazel and Kunce, sometime in 2004, underwent DNA paternity testing which \nrevealed that Hazel was not the father of Kunce\u2019s daughter.     \n{\u00b6 4} Hazel, thereafter, was indicted in Clark County in four interrelated cases.  In \nClark No. 10-CR-808, Hazel was indicted for domestic violence, felonious assault, and \nkidnapping.  The domestic violence count included an attached pregnancy specification \nand an allegation that Hazel had previously been convicted of domestic violence in Clark \nNo. 09-CR-212 and aggravated burglary in the 2003 case.  In Clark No. 10-CR-827, \nHazel was indicted for domestic violence.  The indictment included a pregnancy \nspecification and the assertion that Hazel had previously been convicted of domestic \nviolence in Clark No. 09-CR-212 and aggravated burglary in the 2003 case.  Hazel, in \nClark No. 10-CR-828, was indicted for domestic violence.  The indictment included an \nattached pregnancy specification and the assertion that Hazel had previously been \nconvicted of domestic violence in Clark No. 09-CR-212 and of aggravated burglary in the \n2003 case.  Finally, Hazel, in Clark No. 11-CR-49, was indicted on three counts of \nfelonious assault with, evidently, one of the felonious assault counts superseding and \nreplacing the felonious assault count contained in Clark No. 10-CR-808.  The indictments \ninvolved a common victim, and, based upon this, the trial court, at the State\u2019s request, \nconsolidated the four cases under Clark No. 10-CR-808 (2010 cases).   \n{\u00b6 5} The consolidated cases proceeded to a jury trial on March 2, 2011.  The trial \ncourt, based upon the State\u2019s concession, granted Hazel\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal \non all counts except the three domestic violence counts.  The jury found Hazel not guilty  \n-4- \nof one of the domestic violence counts, but the jury returned guilty verdicts on the \nremaining two domestic violence counts.  Further, the jury found Hazel guilty of the \npregnancy specifications, and the jury also separately determined that Hazel had \npreviously been convicted of domestic violence in Clark No. 09-CR-212 and of \naggravated burglary involving a family or household member in the 2003 case. \n{\u00b6 6} The State\u2019s evidence regarding Hazel\u2019s previous domestic violence \nconviction was established by Hazel\u2019s guilty plea in Clark No. 09-CR-212.  The State\u2019s \nevidence regarding the aggravated burglary conviction involving a family or household \nmember was provided by Andrew Wilson, the prosecuting attorney in Hazel\u2019s 2003 case.  \nWilson\u2019s testimony referenced a bill of particulars prepared for use in the 2003 case.  \nWilson testified that the bill of particulars indicated that \u201cthe underlying offense [supporting \nan aggravated burglary conviction] was domestic violence, meaning that the victim was \na family or household member.\u201d   \n{\u00b6 7} The trial court imposed Hazel\u2019s sentence immediately after the jury\u2019s verdicts.  \nThe trial court, based upon the pregnancy specifications, had to impose a prison term on \nboth domestic violence convictions.  Further, the jury\u2019s determination that Hazel had \nbeen convicted of domestic violence in Clark No. 09-CR-212 and of aggravated burglary \ninvolving a family or household member in the 2003 case made each domestic violence \nconviction a third, as opposed to a fourth, degree felony.  The trial court, with this \nbackground in mind, imposed a five year prison term on each count and ordered that the \nsentences be served consecutively resulting in, of course, a ten year prison term.   \n{\u00b6 8} Hazel pursued a direct appeal.  We, on March 2, 2012, affirmed Hazel\u2019s \nconvictions.  State v. Hazel, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2011-CA-16, 2012-Ohio-835.  Hazel also  \n-5- \nfiled a pro se petition for post-conviction relief.  The trial court dismissed the petition \ntriggering an appeal.  We, on January 18, 2013, affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal \ndecision.  State v. Hazel, 2d Dist. Clark Nos. 2011-CA-101, 2012-CA-22, 2013-Ohio-118. \n{\u00b6 9} Hazel also filed a pro se petition in the Federal District Court, Southern Dist. \nof Ohio seeking habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. 2254.  Magistrate Judge Merz, on \nAugust 15, 2014, issued a Report and Recommendation recommending that Hazel\u2019s \npetition be dismissed.  Hazel v. Warden, Chillicothe Correctional Institution , Case No. \n3:13-CV-332, 2014 WL 4076152 (Aug. 15, 2014).  District Judge Black, in response to \nobjections filed by Hazel, referred the case back to Judge Merz for reconsideration.  \nJudge Merz, on September 8, 2014, filed a supplemental Report and Recommendation \nwhich once again recommended dismissal of Hazel\u2019s habeas corpus petition.  Hazel v. \nWarden, Chillicothe Corre ctional Institution, Case No. 3:13-CV-332, 2014 WL 4417771 \n(Sept. 8, 2014).  Judge Black, on September 24, 2014, accepted Judge Merz\u2019s dismissal \nrecommendation.  This resulted in the dismissal of Hazel\u2019s petition, with Judge Black \ndetermining that any appeal from the order of dismissal would be \u201cobjectively frivolous.\u201d   \n{\u00b6 10} This gets us to the motion which generated Hazel\u2019s pending appeal.  The \nmotion, filed pro se on February 25, 2016, sought leave from the trial court to file a motion \nfor a new trial \u201con the basis of newly discovered evidence\u2026 [that] could not have been \nproduced at trial with reas onable diligence.\u201d  Hazel\u2019s motion includes numerous \nallegations, but the purported newly discovered evidence is the 2004 DNA test result \nwhich established that he is not the father of Kunce\u2019s child.   \n{\u00b6 11} The trial court, on January 12, 2017, overruled Hazel\u2019s motion stating that \nHazel\u2019s request is \u201cbased\u2026 on the premise that he could not be guilty of domestic  \n-6- \nviolence and/or aggravated burglary in [the 2003 case] because he is not the biological \nfather of Kunce\u2019s daughter.\u201d  The trial court further stated that Hazel, by virtue of his guilty \nplea in the 2003 case, \u201cacknowledged the relationship as putative father for purposes of \nthe\u2026 offense of aggravated burglary.\u201d  The trial court, accordingly, overruled Hazel\u2019s \nmotion seeking leave to file a motion for a new trial concluding that Hazel failed \u201cto present \nany new credible evidence to show that there is a strong probability that the result of a \nnew trial would be different.\u201d  Hazel, pro se, filed an appeal.   \n{\u00b6 12} We appointed counsel to represent Hazel.  Hazel\u2019s appellate counsel, on \nAugust 28, 2017, filed a brief under the authority of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, \n87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).  Counsel stated that she could \u201cfind no error by \nthe trial court prejudicial to the rights of [Hazel] which may be argued to this court on this \nparticular appeal.\u201d  Counsel further noted that a number of errors suggested to her by \nHazel have no potential merit based upon the doctrine of res judicata.  Counsel, \nspecifically, stated that the pending appeal is not a direct appeal, and, thus, \u201c[m]any \npotential Assignments of Error proposed by [Hazel] are not available on this appeal \nincluding but not limited to: adverse pretrial rulings; adverse rulings during trial on \nobjections or motions; jury selection and instructions; plea issues; sufficiency of the \nevidence; etc.\u201d  Counsel, consistent with her duty under Anders and based upon her \nreceipt of a brief Hazel prepared and sent to her, set forth the following potential errors: \nthe trial court abused its discretion and committed prejudicial error by its failure to \n\u201cconduct an evidentiary hearing and a Basurto test based upon newly discovered \nevidence\u201d; Hazel\u2019s due process and equal rights were violated based upon \u201cprosecutorial \nmisconduct of a witness of the State and misconduct of the jury\u201d; Hazel was denied  \n-7- \neffective assistance of counsel based upon trial counsel\u2019s \u201cmishandling of evidence\u201d in \nthe 2003 case; the evidence used to enhance Hazel\u2019s domestic violence convictions in \nthe 2010 cases was \u201cinsufficient because the\u2026 enhancement tool was based upon a \nprior conviction that was not committed against a family or household member\u201d; and \nHazel\u2019s domestic violence convictions in the 2010 cases should have remained fourth \ndegree felonies.   \n{\u00b6 13} We informed Hazel of the Anders filing and of his right to file a pro se brief.  \nHazel, on October 16, 2017, filed a brief with the brief\u2019s assignments of error matching \nthe potential errors set forth in the Anders brief.  Briefing was completed by the State\u2019s \nfiling of its brief and Hazel\u2019s filing of a reply brief.1   \n \nCrim.R. 33 \n{\u00b6 14} Crim.R. 33(A)(6) allows a trial court to grant a defendant a new trial when \n\u201cnew evidence material to the defense is discovered which the defendant could not with \nreasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial.\u201d  Crim.R. 33(B) provides \nthat a motion for a new trial which is based upon newly discovered evidence \u201cshall be \nfiled within one hundred and twenty days after the day upon which the verdict was \nrendered\u2026\u201d  Crim.R. 33(B) further provides that \u201c[i]f it is made to appear by clear and \nconvincing proof that the defendant was unavoidably prevented from the discovery of the \nevidence upon which he must rely, such motion shall be filed within seven days from an \n                                                           \n1 The trial court\u2019s January 12, 2017 entry also overruled Hazel\u2019s motion for judicial release \nand a motion for a new trial.  We, on April 25, 2017, filed a Decision and Entry excluding \nfrom appellate review the trial court\u2019s denial of Hazel\u2019s motion for judicial release.  We \ndid so because denial of such a motion is not a final appealable order.  We also noted \nthat Hazel has confirmed that he did not file a motion for a new trial.    \n-8- \norder of the court finding that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the \nevidence within the one hundred twenty day period.\u201d  Thus, a defendant seeking a new \ntrial outside the one hundred twenty day time frame must seek and receive leave of the \ntrial court to file a motion for a new trial.  State v. Tubbs, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2015-CA-14, \n2016-Ohio-842.  We review a trial court\u2019s Crim.R. 33 ruling under an abuse of discretion \nstandard.  Id.   \n \nHazel\u2019s Purported Newly Discovered Evidence \n{\u00b6 15} Hazel\u2019s purported newly discovered evidence is the DNA test result \nestablishing that he is not the biological father of Kunce\u2019s child.  This evidence, by \nHazel\u2019s reckoning, establishes that in the 2003 case the aggravated burglary was not \ncommitted against a family or household member, that, given this, the State, in the 2010 \ncases, inappropriately used Kunce\u2019s family or household member status to enhance the \ndomestic violence convictions from fourth to third degree felonies, and, as such, he is \nentitled to a new trial in the 2010 cases.   \n{\u00b6 16} It is necessary, in order to fully appreciate Hazel\u2019s argument, to review how \nthe 2010 domestic violence convictions became third degree felonies.  As noted, the jury \nin the 2010 cases determined that Hazel had previously been convicted of domestic \nviolence in Clark No. 09-CR-212 and of aggravated burglary involving a family or \nhousehold member in the 2003 case.  This finding enhanced the domestic violence \nconvictions from fourth degree felonies to third degree felonies.  Specifically, R.C. \n2919.25(D)(4) requires such enhancement when a defendant has \u201cpreviously\u2026 pleaded \nguilty to or been convicted of two or more offenses of domestic violence or two or more\u2026  \n-9- \noffenses of the type described in division (D)(3) of this section involving a person who \nwas a family or household member at the time of the\u2026 offenses\u2026\u201d  Aggravated burglary \nis an offense included under R.C. 2919.25(D)(3).  Thus, the jury\u2019s determination \nregarding Hazel\u2019s 2009 domestic violence conviction and the 2003 aggravated burglary \nconviction involving a family or household member make the domestic violence \nconvictions in the 2010 cases third degree felonies.   \n{\u00b6 17} Hazel\u2019s newly discovered evidence assertions are without any potential \nmerit, and, thus, there is no arguably meritorious appellate argument that the trial court \nabused its discretion when it denied Hazel leave to file a motion for a new trial upon the \nbasis of newly discovered evidence.  Hazel does not explain how he was unavoidably \nprevented from obtaining the DNA test result regarding Kunce\u2019s child until the February \n2016 filing of his motion seeking leave to file a motion for a new trial.  Any attempted \nexplanation would defy logic since he participated in the 2004 paternity testing.  Judge \nMerz addressed this issue in his initial Report and Recommendation as follows: \nHazel has offered no excuse for his delay in presenting the new evidence.  \nHe obviously knew in 2004 that he was not the father of [Kunce\u2019s child] \nbecause he has asked this court to compel production of the DNA testing \nhe and\u2026 Kunce underwent as to the paternity of the child.   \nHazel v. Warden, Case No. 3:13-CV-332, 2014 WL 4076152, *28.   \nThus, Hazel, without doubt, knew that he was not the biological father of Kunce\u2019s child \nwhen the 2010 domestic violence charges went to trial making his assertion that the DNA \ntest result is newly discovered evidence without any arguable merit.2   \n                                                           \n2 The State, in the 2010 cases, had to prove that the 2003 conviction involved a family or  \n-10-\n{\u00b6 18} Hazel\u2019s pro se brief contains five assignments of error that either relate to \nhis core contention or are not relevant to his newly discovered evidence contention, and, \nadditionally, are barred by res judicata.  There is, given this, no reason to separately \ndiscuss Hazel\u2019s five assignments of error.3   \n{\u00b6 19} We, consistent with our duty under Anders, have conducted a complete \nreview of the record.  This review has not revealed any potentially worthy appellate \nissues.   \n \nConclusion \n{\u00b6 20} We have found no non-frivolous issues for appellate review.  Counsel\u2019s \nmotion to withdraw is granted.  The judgment of the Clark County Common Pleas Court \nis affirmed.   \n  \n                                                           \nhousehold member.  In a domestic violence case, the underlying offense in the 2003 \naggravated burglary case, the State may establish the victim\u2019s family or household \nmember status in a number of ways with, in the case of a female victim and a male \ndefendant, the defendant\u2019s paternity of a child born to the victim being one such method.  \nThus, in the 2010 cases, the State was not obligated to prove that Hazel fathered Kunce\u2019s \nchild, and Hazel, by pleading guilty in the 2003 case, gave up \u201chis opportunity to put the \nState to its proof of the underlying domestic violence offense.\u201d  Hazel v. Warden, Case \nNo. 3:13-CV-332, 2014 WL 4076152, *28.    \n \n3 Hazel\u2019s first assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred by not conducting an \nevidentiary hearing and for not conducting a Basurto test.  A trial court is obligated to \nconduct an evidentiary hearing on a motion seeking leave to file a motion for a new trial \nif the documents submitted in support of the motion \u201con their face support [the] claim that \n[the defendant] was unavoidably prevented from timely discovering the evidence\u2026\u201d  \nState v.

Box 5500, Chillicothe, Ohio 45601\n\nDefendant-Appellant-Pro Se\n\nTUCKER, J.\nThis appeal relates to Appellant Michael Hazel's pro se motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial based upon the discovery of new evidence. Hazel's motion, though it asserts and comments upon a number of facts and issues, asserts that he is entitled to such leave because he is not the biological father of a child born to Heather Kunce, that his alleged paternity of Kunce's child was used to enhance his domestic violence convictions from fourth to third degree felonies, that he was unavoidably prevented from discovery of this evidence in time to allow a timely filed motion seeking a new trial, and, as such, he should be allowed to file a motion for a new trial and, ultimately, he should be granted a new trial. The trial court overruled Hazel's motion prompting the pending appeal. Hazel was appointed appellate counsel who filed a brief under the authority of *Anders v. California*, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), with Hazel then filing a pro se brief. We conclude that there are no potentially meritorious appellate issues. The trial court's decision will, accordingly, be affirmed.\n\n**Procedural History**\n\nA recitation of the long and somewhat complicated history of Hazel's case is helpful to an understanding of his newly discovered evidence contention, and why this evidence, from Hazel's perspective, entitles him to a new trial. Hazel's newly discovered evidence has its genesis in Hazel's 2003 conviction for aggravated burglary in Clark No. 03-CR-0592 (2003 case). Hazel, in the 2003 case, was indicted for aggravated burglary, domestic violence, and intimidation of a witness. The victim was Kunce, who, at the time, thought Hazel was the father of her child. The 2003 case was resolved by Hazel's plea\nto aggravated burglary with the remaining counts being dismissed. Hazel was sentenced to an agreed upon three year prison term.\n\n{\u00b6 3} Hazel and Kunce, sometime in 2004, underwent DNA paternity testing which revealed that Hazel was not the father of Kunce\u2019s daughter.\n\n{\u00b6 4} Hazel, thereafter, was indicted in Clark County in four interrelated cases. In Clark No. 10-CR-808, Hazel was indicted for domestic violence, felonious assault, and kidnapping. The domestic violence count included an attached pregnancy specification and an allegation that Hazel had previously been convicted of domestic violence in Clark No. 09-CR-212 and aggravated burglary in the 2003 case. In Clark No. 10-CR-827, Hazel was indicted for domestic violence. The indictment included a pregnancy specification and the assertion that Hazel had previously been convicted of domestic violence in Clark No. 09-CR-212 and aggravated burglary in the 2003 case. Hazel, in Clark No. 10-CR-828, was indicted for domestic violence. The indictment included an attached pregnancy specification and the assertion that Hazel had previously been convicted of domestic violence in Clark No. 09-CR-212 and of aggravated burglary in the 2003 case. Finally, Hazel, in Clark No. 11-CR-49, was indicted on three counts of felonious assault with, evidently, one of the felonious assault counts superseding and replacing the felonious assault count contained in Clark No. 10-CR-808. The indictments involved a common victim, and, based upon this, the trial court, at the State\u2019s request, consolidated the four cases under Clark No. 10-CR-808 (2010 cases).\n\n{\u00b6 5} The consolidated cases proceeded to a jury trial on March 2, 2011. The trial court, based upon the State\u2019s concession, granted Hazel\u2019s Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal on all counts except the three domestic violence counts. The jury found Hazel not guilty\nof one of the domestic violence counts, but the jury returned guilty verdicts on the remaining two domestic violence counts. Further, the jury found Hazel guilty of the pregnancy specifications, and the jury also separately determined that Hazel had previously been convicted of domestic violence in Clark No. 09-CR-212 and of aggravated burglary involving a family or household member in the 2003 case.\n\n\u00b6 6 The State\u2019s evidence regarding Hazel\u2019s previous domestic violence conviction was established by Hazel\u2019s guilty plea in Clark No. 09-CR-212. The State\u2019s evidence regarding the aggravated burglary conviction involving a family or household member was provided by Andrew Wilson, the prosecuting attorney in Hazel\u2019s 2003 case. Wilson\u2019s testimony referenced a bill of particulars prepared for use in the 2003 case. Wilson testified that the bill of particulars indicated that \u201cthe underlying offense [supporting an aggravated burglary conviction] was domestic violence, meaning that the victim was a family or household member.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 7 The trial court imposed Hazel\u2019s sentence immediately after the jury\u2019s verdicts. The trial court, based upon the pregnancy specifications, had to impose a prison term on both domestic violence convictions. Further, the jury\u2019s determination that Hazel had been convicted of domestic violence in Clark No. 09-CR-212 and of aggravated burglary involving a family or household member in the 2003 case made each domestic violence conviction a third, as opposed to a fourth, degree felony. The trial court, with this background in mind, imposed a five year prison term on each count and ordered that the sentences be served consecutively resulting in, of course, a ten year prison term.\n\n\u00b6 8 Hazel pursued a direct appeal. We, on March 2, 2012, affirmed Hazel\u2019s convictions. State v. Hazel, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2011-CA-16, 2012-Ohio-835. Hazel also\nfiled a pro se petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court dismissed the petition triggering an appeal. We, on January 18, 2013, affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal decision. *State v. Hazel*, 2d Dist. Clark Nos. 2011-CA-101, 2012-CA-22, 2013-Ohio-118.\n\n{\u00b6 9} Hazel also filed a pro se petition in the Federal District Court, Southern Dist. of Ohio seeking habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. 2254. Magistrate Judge Merz, on August 15, 2014, issued a Report and Recommendation recommending that Hazel's petition be dismissed. *Hazel v. Warden, Chillicothe Correctional Institution*, Case No. 3:13-CV-332, 2014 WL 4076152 (Aug. 15, 2014). District Judge Black, in response to objections filed by Hazel, referred the case back to Judge Merz for reconsideration. Judge Merz, on September 8, 2014, filed a supplemental Report and Recommendation which once again recommended dismissal of Hazel's habeas corpus petition. *Hazel v. Warden, Chillicothe Correctional Institution*, Case No. 3:13-CV-332, 2014 WL 4417771 (Sept. 8, 2014). Judge Black, on September 24, 2014, accepted Judge Merz\u2019s dismissal recommendation. This resulted in the dismissal of Hazel's petition, with Judge Black determining that any appeal from the order of dismissal would be \u201cobjectively frivolous.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6 10} This gets us to the motion which generated Hazel\u2019s pending appeal. The motion, filed pro se on February 25, 2016, sought leave from the trial court to file a motion for a new trial \u201con the basis of newly discovered evidence\u2026 [that] could not have been produced at trial with reasonable diligence.\u201d Hazel\u2019s motion includes numerous allegations, but the purported newly discovered evidence is the 2004 DNA test result which established that he is not the father of Kunce\u2019s child.\n\n{\u00b6 11} The trial court, on January 12, 2017, overruled Hazel\u2019s motion stating that Hazel\u2019s request is \u201cbased\u2026 on the premise that he could not be guilty of domestic\nviolence and/or aggravated burglary in [the 2003 case] because he is not the biological father of Kunce's daughter.\u201d The trial court further stated that Hazel, by virtue of his guilty plea in the 2003 case, \u201cacknowledged the relationship as putative father for purposes of the... offense of aggravated burglary.\u201d The trial court, accordingly, overruled Hazel's motion seeking leave to file a motion for a new trial concluding that Hazel failed \u201cto present any new credible evidence to show that there is a strong probability that the result of a new trial would be different.\u201d Hazel, pro se, filed an appeal.\n\n\u00b6 12 We appointed counsel to represent Hazel. Hazel's appellate counsel, on August 28, 2017, filed a brief under the authority of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel stated that she could \u201cfind no error by the trial court prejudicial to the rights of [Hazel] which may be argued to this court on this particular appeal.\u201d Counsel further noted that a number of errors suggested to her by Hazel have no potential merit based upon the doctrine of res judicata. Counsel, specifically, stated that the pending appeal is not a direct appeal, and, thus, \u201c[m]any potential Assignments of Error proposed by [Hazel] are not available on this appeal including but not limited to: adverse pretrial rulings; adverse rulings during trial on objections or motions; jury selection and instructions; plea issues; sufficiency of the evidence; etc.\u201d Counsel, consistent with her duty under Anders and based upon her receipt of a brief Hazel prepared and sent to her, set forth the following potential errors: the trial court abused its discretion and committed prejudicial error by its failure to \u201cconduct an evidentiary hearing and a Basurto test based upon newly discovered evidence\u201d; Hazel's due process and equal rights were violated based upon \u201cprosecutorial misconduct of a witness of the State and misconduct of the jury\u201d; Hazel was denied\neffective assistance of counsel based upon trial counsel's \u201cmishandling of evidence\u201d in the 2003 case; the evidence used to enhance Hazel's domestic violence convictions in the 2010 cases was \u201cinsufficient because the... enhancement tool was based upon a prior conviction that was not committed against a family or household member\u201d; and Hazel's domestic violence convictions in the 2010 cases should have remained fourth degree felonies.\n\n\u00b6 13 We informed Hazel of the Anders filing and of his right to file a pro se brief. Hazel, on October 16, 2017, filed a brief with the brief's assignments of error matching the potential errors set forth in the Anders brief. Briefing was completed by the State's filing of its brief and Hazel's filing of a reply brief.\u00b9\n\nCrim.R. 33\n\n\u00b6 14 Crim.R. 33(A)(6) allows a trial court to grant a defendant a new trial when \u201cnew evidence material to the defense is discovered which the defendant could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial.\u201d Crim.R. 33(B) provides that a motion for a new trial which is based upon newly discovered evidence \u201cshall be filed within one hundred and twenty days after the day upon which the verdict was rendered...\u201d Crim.R. 33(B) further provides that \u201c[i]f it is made to appear by clear and convincing proof that the defendant was unavoidably prevented from the discovery of the evidence upon which he must rely, such motion shall be filed within seven days from an\n\n\u00b9 The trial court\u2019s January 12, 2017 entry also overruled Hazel's motion for judicial release and a motion for a new trial. We, on April 25, 2017, filed a Decision and Entry excluding from appellate review the trial court\u2019s denial of Hazel\u2019s motion for judicial release. We did so because denial of such a motion is not a final appealable order. We also noted that Hazel has confirmed that he did not file a motion for a new trial.\norder of the court finding that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence within the one hundred twenty day period.\u201d Thus, a defendant seeking a new trial outside the one hundred twenty day time frame must seek and receive leave of the trial court to file a motion for a new trial. *State v. Tubbs*, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2015-CA-14, 2016-Ohio-842. We review a trial court\u2019s Crim.R. 33 ruling under an abuse of discretion standard. *Id.*\n\n**Hazel\u2019s Purported Newly Discovered Evidence**\n\n{\u00b6 15} Hazel\u2019s purported newly discovered evidence is the DNA test result establishing that he is not the biological father of Kunce\u2019s child. This evidence, by Hazel\u2019s reckoning, establishes that in the 2003 case the aggravated burglary was not committed against a family or household member, that, given this, the State, in the 2010 cases, inappropriately used Kunce\u2019s family or household member status to enhance the domestic violence convictions from fourth to third degree felonies, and, as such, he is entitled to a new trial in the 2010 cases.\n\n{\u00b6 16} It is necessary, in order to fully appreciate Hazel\u2019s argument, to review how the 2010 domestic violence convictions became third degree felonies. As noted, the jury in the 2010 cases determined that Hazel had previously been convicted of domestic violence in Clark No. 09-CR-212 and of aggravated burglary involving a family or household member in the 2003 case. This finding enhanced the domestic violence convictions from fourth degree felonies to third degree felonies. Specifically, R.C. 2919.25(D)(4) requires such enhancement when a defendant has \u201cpreviously... pleaded guilty to or been convicted of two or more offenses of domestic violence or two or more...\noffenses of the type described in division (D)(3) of this section involving a person who was a family or household member at the time of the... offenses...\u201d Aggravated burglary is an offense included under R.C. 2919.25(D)(3). Thus, the jury's determination regarding Hazel's 2009 domestic violence conviction and the 2003 aggravated burglary conviction involving a family or household member make the domestic violence convictions in the 2010 cases third degree felonies.\n\n{\u00b6 17} Hazel's newly discovered evidence assertions are without any potential merit, and, thus, there is no arguably meritorious appellate argument that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied Hazel leave to file a motion for a new trial upon the basis of newly discovered evidence. Hazel does not explain how he was unavoidably prevented from obtaining the DNA test result regarding Kunce's child until the February 2016 filing of his motion seeking leave to file a motion for a new trial. Any attempted explanation would defy logic since he participated in the 2004 paternity testing. Judge Merz addressed this issue in his initial Report and Recommendation as follows:\n\nHazel has offered no excuse for his delay in presenting the new evidence.\n\nHe obviously knew in 2004 that he was not the father of [Kunce's child] because he has asked this court to compel production of the DNA testing he and... Kunce underwent as to the paternity of the child.\n\n_Hazel v. Warden_, Case No. 3:13-CV-332, 2014 WL 4076152, *28.\n\nThus, Hazel, without doubt, knew that he was not the biological father of Kunce's child when the 2010 domestic violence charges went to trial making his assertion that the DNA test result is newly discovered evidence without any arguable merit.2\n\n---\n\n2 The State, in the 2010 cases, had to prove that the 2003 conviction involved a family or\nHazel's pro se brief contains five assignments of error that either relate to his core contention or are not relevant to his newly discovered evidence contention, and, additionally, are barred by res judicata. There is, given this, no reason to separately discuss Hazel's five assignments of error.3\n\nWe, consistent with our duty under Anders, have conducted a complete review of the record. This review has not revealed any potentially worthy appellate issues.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have found no non-frivolous issues for appellate review. Counsel's motion to withdraw is granted. The judgment of the Clark County Common Pleas Court is affirmed.\n\n3 Hazel's first assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred by not conducting an evidentiary hearing and for not conducting a Basurto test. A trial court is obligated to conduct an evidentiary hearing on a motion seeking leave to file a motion for a new trial if the documents submitted in support of the motion \u201con their face support [the] claim that [the defendant] was unavoidably prevented from timely discovering the evidence...\u201d State v.

Armengau, appeals a judgment of the \nFranklin County Court of Common Pleas denying his combined motion for reconsideration \nof the trial court judgment denying his first motion for leave to file a delayed motion for \nnew trial and second motion for leave to file a motion for delayed new trial, instanter.  For \nthe reasons that follow, we affirm. \nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{\u00b6 2} In a prior appeal in this case, appellant sought review of the denial of his first \nmotion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial.  State v. Armengau, 10th Dist. No. No. 17AP-852  2 \n16AP-355, 2017-Ohio-197 (\"Armengau I\").1  In affirming the judgment of the trial court, \nthis court in Armengau I set forth the procedural history of this case, in relevant part, as \nfollows: \nOn May 20, 2013, a Franklin County Grand Jury indicted \nappellant on three counts of kidnapping, three counts of gross \nsexual imposition, six counts of rape with specifications, five \ncounts of sexual battery, and one count of public indecency.  At \nthe time of the offenses, appellant was licensed to practice law \nin Ohio and each of his victims was either a current or former \nclient of appellant's or a client's family member. \nOn July 7, 2014, a Franklin County jury found appellant guilty \nof nine felonies and one misdemeanor.  On August 28, 2014, \nthe trial court sentenced appellant to a prison term of 13 years.  \nOn August 7, 2015, appellant filed a Crim.R. 33(B) motion for \nleave to file a delayed motion for new trial. Appellant supported \nhis motion for leave with his own affidavit and the affidavit of \nDiane Caldwell, a former roommate of one of appellant's \nvictims, Luz Melean.  Appellant claims that the averments in \nCaldwell's February 6, 2015 affidavit constitute newly \ndiscovered evidence material to his defense.  In her affidavit, \nCaldwell avers that Melean told her the sexual activity between \nshe and appellant was \"purely consensual.\"  (Caldwell Aff. at \n\u00b6 20.)  The state opposed the motion. \nOn April 5, 2016, the trial court denied appellant's motion for \nleave without an evidentiary hearing. Appellant timely \nappealed to this court from the judgment of the trial court. \nId. at \u00b6 2-4. \n{\u00b6 3} In Armengau I, we denied appellant's motion for leave to file a delayed \nmotion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence under Crim.R. 33(A)(6), finding \nthat appellant failed to show he was unavoidably prevented from discovering Caldwell's \nevidence within 120 days of the jury verdict as required by Crim.R. 33(B) and that he further \nfailed to file his motion for leave within a reasonable time after discovering Caldwell's \nevidence.  Id. at \u00b6 14, 18.  With regard to appellant's claims that he was entitled to a new \ntrial on the grounds set forth in Crim.R. 33(A)(1), (2), and (5), we held that appellant failed \nto show he was unavoidably prevented from filing his motion for new trial within 14 days \nof the jury verdict as required by Crim.R. 33(B).  Id. at \u00b6 29.  Accordingly, we overruled \n                                                   \n1 Appeal not accepted for review in State v. Armengau, 149 Ohio St.3d 1434, 2017-Ohio-4396. No. 17AP-852  3 \nappellant's sole assignment of error and held the trial court did not abuse its discretion in \ndenying, without an evidentiary hearing, appellant's motion for leave to file a delayed \nmotion for new trial on the grounds set forth in Crim.R. 33(A)(1), (2), (5), and (6).  Id. at \n\u00b6 34-35. \n{\u00b6 4} On June 2, 2017, this court, in a majority decision, affirmed the trial court \njudgment in part, reversed in part, and remanded with instructions.  State v. Armengau, \n10th Dist. No. 14AP-679, 2017-Ohio-4452 (\"Armengau II\").2  Our decision in Armengau II \nprovides, in relevant part, as follows: \nIn summary, appellant's first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, \nseventh, and ninth assignments of error are overruled. \nAppellant's third and eighth assignments of error are \nsustained. The judgment of the Franklin County Court of \nCommon Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the \nmatter is remanded for resentenci ng as to Counts 10, 14, 15, \nand 17.  The court will vacate ap pellant's Tier III sex offender \nclassification and apply the sex offender classification under \nthe law in effect at the time of the offenses for which he was \nconvicted. \nId. at \u00b6 136. \n{\u00b6 5} The majority decision rejected appellant's assignments of error alleging that \nhis convictions should be reversed due to a faulty indictment, inadmissible \"other acts\" \nevidence, prosecutorial and witness misconduct, and insufficiency of the evidence.  Id. at \n\u00b6 67, 80, 94, 120.  The majority decision su stained appellant's third assignment of error \nalleging the trial court erred by failing to merge two counts in the indictment for purposes \nof conviction and sentence and appellant's eighth assignment of error alleging the trial \ncourt erred by improperly classifying him as a Tier III sex offender.  Id. at \u00b6 129, 134. \n{\u00b6 6} On September 19, 2017, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of the \ntrial court's August 7, 2015 judgment entry denying his motion for leave to file a delayed \nmotion for new trial and, in the alternative, a second motion for leave to file a delayed \nmotion for new trial, instanter.  In other words, appellant's September 19, 2017 motion \nsought reconsideration of the very trial co urt judgment that this court affirmed in \nArmengau I.  In the alternative, appellant's September 19, 2017 motion also sought leave, \n                                                   \n2 Tyack, J., dissenting.  Discretionary appeal not allowed by State v. Armengau, 151 Ohio St.3d 1511, 2018-\nOhio-365. No. 17AP-852  4 \nfor the second time, to file a motion for delayed new trial on the grounds set forth in Crim.R. \n33(A)(1) through (6). \n{\u00b6 7} On November 6, 2017, the trial court denied appellant's motion on finding \nthat appellant \"cites no authority, nor is this Court aware of any, that would permit this \nCourt to set aside and effectively overrule the judgment of the Tenth District Court of \nAppeals.\"  (Decision and Entry at 1-2.)  The trial court further found that appellant did not \nfile his second motion for leave within a reasonable time after allegedly discovering the new \nevidence and that appellant \"fail[ed] to show, by clear and convincing evidence, * * * that \nhe could not have discovered the new evidence with reasonable diligence or that he was \nunavoidably prevented from timely filing his Motion for Leave.\"  (Decision and Entry at 2.) \n{\u00b6 8} Appellant timely appealed to this court from the trial court decision. \nII. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR \n{\u00b6 9} Appellant assigns the following as trial court error: \n[1.]  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING \nAPPELLANT'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF HIS \nMOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL \nAND THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING \nAPPELLANT'S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL IN VIOLATION \nOF APPELLANT'S RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS, JURY \nUNANIMITY AND DOUBLE JEOPARD PROTECTIONS AS \nGUARANTEED BY THE FIFTH, SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \nAND OHIO CONSTITUTION WHEN THE APPELLATE \nCOURT CONFIRMED THAT APPELLANT WAS CONVICTED \nFOR CRIMES FOR WHICH HE WAS NEVER CHARGED OR \nINDICTED AND WHERE HIS CONVICTIONS WERE BASED \nON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND PROSECUTORIAL \nMISCONDUCT THAT WAS CONFIRMED TO BE BLATANT \nAND SERIOUS AND WHERE THE AMENDMENTS TO THE \nINDICTMENT WERE IMPERMISSIBLE DENYING HIM HIS \nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO NOTICE OF THE SPECIFIC \nCHARGE AND OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND THEREBY \nDENYING HIM A FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR TRIAL AS \nGUARANTEED BY THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. \n[2.]  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING \nAPPELLANT'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF HIS \nMOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL \nAND THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING \nAPPELLANT'S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL WHEN THE \nAPPELLATE COURT CONFIRMED THE GROUNDS AND No. 17AP-852  5 \nBASIS UNDER WHICH APPELLANT SOUGHT A NEW \nTRIAL IN HIS ORIGINAL MOTION INCLUDING THE \nADMISSION OF UNFAIRLY PREJUDICIAL AND \nIRRELEVANT EVIDENCE IN VIOLAITON OF EVID. R. \n404(B) AND THE FIFTH, SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION \nAND THE OHIO CONSTITUTION. \n[3.]  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING \nAPPELLANT'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF HIS \nMOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL \nAND THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING \nAPPELLANT'S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL IN VIOLATION \nOF THE FIFTH, SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS \nTO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION WHEN THE \nAPPELLATE COURT CONFIRMED APPELLANT WAS \nCONVICTED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE \nIN COUNTS 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 AND 18 OF THE \nINDICTMENT. \nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW \n{\u00b6 10} Ordinarily, \"[i]n considering a trial court's denial of a motion for leave to file \na motion for new trial, this court employ s an abuse of discretion standard.\"  State v. \nAnderson, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-831, 2014-Ohio-1849, \u00b6 7, citing State v. Anderson, 10th \nDist. No. 12AP-133, 2012-Ohio-4733, \u00b6 9.  However, where the movant files a motion for \nleave to file a motion for new trial after judgment of conviction and sentence has been \naffirmed on appeal, the question arises whether the trial court retains jurisdiction to hear \nand determine the motion.  See, e.g., State v. Davis, 131 Ohio St.3d 1, 2011-Ohio-5028; \nState ex rel. Cordray v. Marshall , 123 Ohio St.3d 229, 2009-Ohio-4986; State ex rel. \nSpecial Prosecutors v. Judges, Court of Common Pleas, 55 Ohio St.2d 94 (1978).  In such \ncases, this court is presented with an issue of law that we review de novo.  Giancola v. Azem, \n__ Ohio St.3d __, 2018-Ohio-1694, \u00b6 13 (slip opinion), citing Arnott v. Arnott, 132 Ohio \nSt.3d 401, 2012-Ohio-3208, \u00b6 17; State v. Andrioff, 10th Dist. No. 84AP-502 (Mar. 7, 1985). \nIV. LEGAL ANALYSIS \nA. Appellant's Assignments of Error \n{\u00b6 11} In each of appellant's assignments of error, appellant argues that our decision \nin Armengau II provides support for the arguments appellant made on the merits of his \noriginal delayed motion for new trial.  Accord ingly, appellant claims the trial court erred No. 17AP-852  6 \nwhen it overruled his motion for reconsideration of his original motion for leave to file a \ndelayed motion for new trial.  Appellant makes the same argument in support of his second \nmotion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial, instanter.  Plaintiff-appellee, State of \nOhio, argues that res judicata barred both appellant's motion for reconsideration and his \nsecond motion for leave to file a motion for delayed new trial.  Because our analysis is the \nsame for each of appellant's assignments of error, we will consider them jointly. \n{\u00b6 12} Crim.R. 33 permits a trial court to grant a new trial under the following \nrelevant circumstances: \n(A)  Grounds.  A new trial may be granted on motion of the \ndefendant for any of the following causes affecting materially \nhis substantial rights: \n(1)  Irregularity in the proceedings, or in any order or ruling of \nthe court, or abuse of discretion by the court, because of which \nthe defendant was prevented from having a fair trial; \n(2)  Misconduct of the jury, prosecuting attorney, or the \nwitnesses for the state; \n* * * \n(5)  Error of law occurring at the trial; \n(6)  When new evidence material to the defense is discovered, \nwhich the defendant could not with reasonable diligence have \ndiscovered and produced at the trial.  When a motion for a new \ntrial is made upon the ground of newly discovered evidence, the \ndefendant must produce at the hearing on the motion, in \nsupport thereof, the affidavits of the witnesses by whom such \nevidence is expected to be given, and if time is required by the \ndefendant to procure such affidavits, the court may postpone \nthe hearing of the motion for such length of time as is \nreasonable under all the circumstances of the case. The \nprosecuting attorney may produce affidavits or other evidence \nto impeach the affidavits of such witnesses. \n(B)  Motion for new trial; Form, Time.  Application for a new \ntrial shall be made by motion which, except for the cause of \nnewly discovered evidence, shall be filed within fourteen days \nafter the verdict was rendered, or the decision of the court \nwhere a trial by jury has been waived, unless it is made to \nappear by clear and convincing proof that the defendant was No. 17AP-852  7 \nunavoidably prevented from filing his motion for a new trial \n* * *. \nMotions for new trial on account of newly discovered evidence \nshall be filed within one hundred twenty days after the day \nupon which the verdict was rend ered, or the decision of the \ncourt where trial by jury has been waived.  If it is made to \nappear by clear and convincing proof that the defendant was \nunavoidably prevented from the discovery of the evidence upon \nwhich he must rely, such motion shall be filed within seven \ndays from an order of the court finding that he was unavoidably \nprevented from discovering the evidence within the one \nhundred twenty day period. \n{\u00b6 13} The threshold question for this court in  reviewing the denial of appellant's \ncombined motion for reconsideration and second motion for leave to file a delayed motion \nfor new trial is whether the trial court retained jurisdiction to hear and determine the \nmotion after this court affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence in Armengau II.  \nFor the reasons that follow, we conclude the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider \nappellant's motion. \n{\u00b6 14} In Special Prosecutors , the trial court granted a defendant's motion to \nwithdraw a guilty plea after a conviction and sentence based on the plea had been affirmed \non appeal.  After a trial date had been set, the Supreme Court of Ohio granted a writ of \nprohibition to prevent the trial from proceeding.  The Supreme Court stated: \"[T]he trial \ncourt's granting of the motion to withdraw the guilty plea and the order to proceed with a \nnew trial were inconsistent with the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the trial \ncourt's conviction premised upon the guilty plea.  The judgment of the reviewing court is \ncontrolling upon the lower court as to all matters within the compass of the judgment.  \nAccordingly, we find that the trial court lost its jurisdiction when the appeal was taken, and, \nabsent a remand, it did not regain jurisdiction subsequent to the Court of Appeals' \ndecision.\"  Id. at 97. \n{\u00b6 15} Relying on Special Prosecutors, this court in Andrioff concluded the trial \ncourt did not retain jurisdiction to hear and determine appellant's motion for new trial \nbrought pursuant to Crim.R. 33(A)(1) through (5) after this court had affirmed the \njudgment of conviction and sentence.  In reaching its conclusion, this court stated: No. 17AP-852  8 \nDefendant could have simply filed a motion for a new trial \nunder Crim. R. 33(A)(1) through (5). However, he chose to file \na notice of appeal pursuant to App. R. 4(B) and Crim. R. 33(F), \nand advanced four assignments of error: that the verdict was \nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence and was contrary to \nlaw; that he had ineffective assistance of counsel; evidentiary \nrulings of the court; and his sentencing. Whereupon, all \nassignments of error were overruled and the judgment \naffirmed.  \nThus, defendant elected to appeal his conviction. He advanced \nseveral issues which could have properly been the subject of a \nnew trial within Crim. R. 33(A)(1) through (5).  Since he elected \nto appeal, he cannot, in effect, relitigate the case in the trial \ncourt. Although the trial court retains jurisdiction over issues \nnot inconsistent with the appellate court to review, modify, \naffirm or reverse a judgment, it does not regain jurisdiction \nover matters subject to the appeal in the absence of a reversal \nand remand by the appellate court. State, ex rel. Special \nProsecutors, v. Judges (1978), 55 Ohio St. 2d 94. \n(Emphasis added.)  Id. \n{\u00b6 16} In Davis, the Supreme Court addressed whether, in light of Special \nProsecutors, a trial court retains jurisdiction to hear and determine a Crim.R. 33(A)(6) \nmotion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence after a conviction has been \naffirmed in the direct appeal.  The Supreme Court held that a trial court retains jurisdiction \nto hear and determine a Crim.R. 33(A)(6) motion when it raises issues that could not have \nbeen raised in the direct appeal because resolution of those issues depended on evidence \noutside the record in that appeal.  Id. at \u00b6 34, 37. \n{\u00b6 17} In Davis, appellee argued in the alternative that even if the trial court retained \njurisdiction to hear and determine a Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial after the judgment and \nconviction was affirmed on appeal, the law of the case doctrine would present a bar to relief.  \nThe Davis court noted: \nThe law-of-the-case doctrine holds that \"the decision of a \nreviewing court in a case remains the law of that case on the \nlegal questions involved for all subsequent proceedings in the \ncase at both the trial and reviewing levels.\"  (Emphasis added) \nNolan v. Nolan (1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 11 OBR 1, 462 N.E.2d \n410. This doctrine prevents a litigant from relying on \narguments at retrial that were fully litigated, or could have been \nfully litigated, in a first appeal. See Hubbard ex rel. Creed v. No. 17AP-852  9 \nSauline (1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 402, 404-405, 1996 Ohio 174, \n659 N.E.2d 781. \nId. at \u00b6 30. \n{\u00b6 18} In rejecting appellee's contention that the law of the case doctrine presented \na bar to appellant's Crim.R. 33(A)(6) motion, based on newly discovered evidence, the court \nin Davis noted the law of the case doctrine would not prevent a trial court from considering \na new trial motion after the judgment of conviction and sentence was affirmed on appeal \nwhere the motion was \"based on newly discovered evidence when the specific issue has not \nbeen decided upon direct appeal.\"  Id. at \u00b6 37. \n{\u00b6 19} Though appellant allegedly grounded his second motion for leave to file a \ndelayed motion for new trial in part on newly discovered evidence, pursuant to Crim.R. \n33(A)(6), appellant did not produce any newly discovered evidence to support the motion.  \nRather, appellant presented the same affidavit from Caldwell that he presented in his \noriginal motion for leave to file a motion for delayed appeal and made the same arguments \nin support of his second motion that he made in his original motion.  For example, appellant \nonce again argues that his convictions were the result of prosecutorial and witness \nmisconduct, that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence, that his \nconvictions were based on inadmissible \"other acts\" evidence, and that the indictment was \nfaulty.  These are the same arguments appellant raised in his original motion for leave to \nfile a motion for delayed new trial and the same arguments he raised in his appeal to this \ncourt from the judgment of conviction and sentence.  Armengau II at \u00b6 53.  As we noted in \nArmengau I, such arguments are grounded on Crim.R. 33(A)(1), (2), and (5), not Crim.R. \n33(A)(6). \n{\u00b6 20} Accordingly, pursuant to the decisions of the Supreme Court in Davis and \nSpecial Prosecutors and the decision of this court in Andrioff, the trial court was divested \nof jurisdiction to hear and determine both appellant's motion for reconsideration of his first \nmotion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial and his second motion for leave to \nfile a delayed motion for new trial after this court affirmed the judgment of conviction and \nsentence on appeal.  To the extent appellant claims that either the majority or the dissenting \nopinion in Armengau II constitutes newly discovered evidence in support of his second \nmotion for new trial, appellant has cited no case law in support of such a claim and this \ncourt has found none.  Moreover, the ma jority decision of this court in Armengau II No. 17AP-852  10 \noverruled appellant's assignments of error alleging prosecutorial and witness misconduct, \ninsufficiency of evidence, inadmissible \"other acts\" evidence, and a faulty indictment.3  As \nnoted above, the remand order in Armengau II was limited to resentencing as to certain \ncounts and redetermining appellant's sex offender status.  In our opinion, the trial court \nnever regained jurisdiction to alter or amend the judgment entry of conviction in the \nmanner sought by appellant's motion for reconsideration or his second motion for leave to \nfile a motion for new trial.  See Cordray at \u00b6 25 (the lower court \"patently and \nunambiguously lacked jurisdiction to grant a motion for relief from a murder conviction \nand sentence based on claims that had previously been rejected by the court of appeals in \nan appeal in the same case\"). \n{\u00b6 21} Moreover, even if we were to agree with appellant that the dissenting opinion \nin Armengau II  supports the grounds for a new trial alleged in appellant's proposed \nmotions for new trial, the law of the case doctrine and our decision in Armengau I bar \nappellant from raising these claims.  In Armengau I, we denied appellant leave to file an \nuntimely motion for new trial on the grounds set forth in Crim.R. 33(A)(1), (2), and (5) on \nfinding appellant failed to show that he was unavoidably prevented from filing his motion \nfor new trial within 14 days of the jury verdict as required by Crim.R. 33(B).  Id. at \u00b6 29.  We \ndenied his motion for leave to file an untimely motion for new trial on the grounds of newly \ndiscovered evidence, pursuant to Crim.R. 33(A)(6), on finding appellant failed to show that \nhe was unavoidably prevented from discovering Caldwell's evidence within 120 days of the \njury verdict as required by Crim.R. 33(B) and that he further failed to file his motion for \nleave within a reasonable time after discovering Caldwell's evidence.  In Armengau I, this \ncourt never reached the merits of appellant's new trial motion because we agreed with the \ntrial court that appellant failed to satisfy the requirements for leave under Crim.R. 33(B).  \nOur holding in Armengau I remained the law of the case for purposes of appellant's motion \nfor reconsideration and second motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial.  \n                                                   \n3 The dissenting opinion would have sustained appellant's second assignment of error, reversed appellant's \nconvictions, and remanded the matter for a new trial.  Appellant's second assignment of error alleged: \n[Appellant's] rights to due process and a fair trial were violated when the \ntrial court allowed the State to present irrelevant, cumulative, overly \nprejudicial evidence about prior bad acts through additional non-victim \nwitnesses, whose testimony also violated the Ohio Rape Shield Statute, as \nwell as testimony of hundreds of unindicted offenses. No. 17AP-852  11 \nDavis.  See also State v. Cochran, 10th Dist. No. 16AP-491, 2017-Ohio-1528, \u00b6 5 (\"Absent \nextraordinary circumstances, such as an inte rvening decision by the Supreme Court, an \ninferior court has no discretion to disregar d the mandate of a superior court in a prior \nappeal in the same case.\").  The fact the dissenting opinion in Armengau II arguably \nsupports the grounds for new trial appellant asserted under Crim.R. 33(A)(1) through (5) \ndoes not alter our conclusion in Armengau I  that appellant's motion asserting those \ngrounds was untimely filed, and appellant failed to demonstrate compliance with Crim.R. \n33(B).  The only \"newly discovered\" evidence cited by appellant in his combined motion for \nreconsideration and second motion for leave to file a motion for new trial was the Caldwell \naffidavit.  Appellant presented nothing to excuse his untimeliness that this court had not \nalready considered in Armengau I. \n{\u00b6 22} For the foregoing reasons, we hold the trial court did not err when it denied \nappellant's motion seeking reconsideration of his original motion for leave to file a delayed \nmotion for new trial and his alternative second motion for leave to file a motion for delayed \nnew trial.  Accordingly, we overrule appellant's assignments of error. \nV. CONCLUSION \n{\u00b6 23} Having overruled each of appellant's assignments of error, we affirm the \njudgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. \nJudgment affirmed. \n \nBROWN, P.J., and KLATT, J., concur. \n___________________ \n ", "case_juv": "0", "case_crim": "0", "case_2001": "0", "case_app": "0", "case_pros": "0", "aoe_none": "0", "aoe_grandjury": "0", "aoe_court": "0", "aoe_defense": "0", "aoe_procbar": "1", "aoe_prochist": "0", "case_timeframe": "0", "other": "370    0\nName: other, dtype: int64", "olmocr_text": "IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\nTENTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\nState of Ohio, : \n\nPlaintiff-Appellee, : No. 17AP-852\nv. : (C.P.C.

Armengau, appeals a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas denying his combined motion for reconsideration of the trial court judgment denying his first motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial and second motion for leave to file a motion for delayed new trial, instanter. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\nI. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\u00b6 2 In a prior appeal in this case, appellant sought review of the denial of his first motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial. State v. Armengau, 10th Dist. No.\nIn affirming the judgment of the trial court, this court in Armengau I set forth the procedural history of this case, in relevant part, as follows:\n\nOn May 20, 2013, a Franklin County Grand Jury indicted appellant on three counts of kidnapping, three counts of gross sexual imposition, six counts of rape with specifications, five counts of sexual battery, and one count of public indecency. At the time of the offenses, appellant was licensed to practice law in Ohio and each of his victims was either a current or former client of appellant\u2019s or a client\u2019s family member.\n\nOn July 7, 2014, a Franklin County jury found appellant guilty of nine felonies and one misdemeanor. On August 28, 2014, the trial court sentenced appellant to a prison term of 13 years. On August 7, 2015, appellant filed a Crim.R. 33(B) motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial. Appellant supported his motion for leave with his own affidavit and the affidavit of Diane Caldwell, a former roommate of one of appellant\u2019s victims, Luz Melean. Appellant claims that the averments in Caldwell\u2019s February 6, 2015 affidavit constitute newly discovered evidence material to his defense. In her affidavit, Caldwell avers that Melean told her the sexual activity between she and appellant was \"purely consensual.\" (Caldwell Aff. at \u00b6 20.) The state opposed the motion.\n\nOn April 5, 2016, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for leave without an evidentiary hearing. Appellant timely appealed to this court from the judgment of the trial court.\n\nId. at \u00b6 2-4.\n\n{\u00b6 3} In Armengau I, we denied appellant\u2019s motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence under Crim.R. 33(A)(6), finding that appellant failed to show he was unavoidably prevented from discovering Caldwell\u2019s evidence within 120 days of the jury verdict as required by Crim.R. 33(B) and that he further failed to file his motion for leave within a reasonable time after discovering Caldwell\u2019s evidence. Id. at \u00b6 14, 18. With regard to appellant\u2019s claims that he was entitled to a new trial on the grounds set forth in Crim.R. 33(A)(1), (2), and (5), we held that appellant failed to show he was unavoidably prevented from filing his motion for new trial within 14 days of the jury verdict as required by Crim.R. 33(B). Id. at \u00b6 29. Accordingly, we overruled\n\n1 Appeal not accepted for review in State v. Armengau, 149 Ohio St.3d 1434, 2017-Ohio-4396.\nappellant\u2019s sole assignment of error and held the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\ndenying, without an evidentiary hearing, appellant\u2019s motion for leave to file a delayed\nmotion for new trial on the grounds set forth in Crim.R. 33(A)(1), (2), (5), and (6). *Id.* at \u00b634-35.\n\n\u00b6 4 On June 2, 2017, this court, in a majority decision, affirmed the trial court\njudgment in part, reversed in part, and remanded with instructions. *State v. Armengau*,\n10th Dist. No. 14AP-679, 2017-Ohio-4452 (\"Armengau II\"). Our decision in *Armengau II*\nprovides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\nIn summary, appellant\u2019s first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth assignments of error are overruled.\nAppellant\u2019s third and eighth assignments of error are sustained. The judgment of the Franklin County Court of\nCommon Pleas is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the matter is remanded for resentencing as to Counts 10, 14, 15,\nand 17. The court will vacate appellant\u2019s Tier III sex offender\nclassification and apply the sex offender classification under\nthe law in effect at the time of the offenses for which he was\nconvicted.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6136.\n\n\u00b6 5 The majority decision rejected appellant\u2019s assignments of error alleging that\nhis convictions should be reversed due to a faulty indictment, inadmissible \"other acts\"\nevidence, prosecutorial and witness misconduct, and insufficiency of the evidence. *Id.* at \u00b667, 80, 94, 120. The majority decision sustained appellant\u2019s third assignment of error alleging the trial court erred by failing to merge two counts in the indictment for purposes\nof conviction and sentence and appellant\u2019s eighth assignment of error alleging the trial\ncourt erred by improperly classifying him as a Tier III sex offender. *Id.* at \u00b6129, 134.\n\n\u00b6 6 On September 19, 2017, appellant filed a motion for reconsideration of the\ntrial court\u2019s August 7, 2015 judgment entry denying his motion for leave to file a delayed\nmotion for new trial and, in the alternative, a second motion for leave to file a delayed\nmotion for new trial, instanter. In other words, appellant\u2019s September 19, 2017 motion\nsought reconsideration of the very trial court judgment that this court affirmed in\n*Armengau I*. In the alternative, appellant\u2019s September 19, 2017 motion also sought leave,\n\n---\n\n2 Tyack, J., dissenting. Discretionary appeal not allowed by *State v. Armengau*, 151 Ohio St.3d 1511, 2018-\nOhio-365.\nfor the second time, to file a motion for delayed new trial on the grounds set forth in Crim.R. 33(A)(1) through (6).\n\n\u00b6 7 On November 6, 2017, the trial court denied appellant's motion on finding that appellant \"cites no authority, nor is this Court aware of any, that would permit this Court to set aside and effectively overrule the judgment of the Tenth District Court of Appeals.\" (Decision and Entry at 1-2.) The trial court further found that appellant did not file his second motion for leave within a reasonable time after allegedly discovering the new evidence and that appellant \"fail[ed] to show, by clear and convincing evidence, * * * that he could not have discovered the new evidence with reasonable diligence or that he was unavoidably prevented from timely filing his Motion for Leave.\" (Decision and Entry at 2.)\n\n\u00b6 8 Appellant timely appealed to this court from the trial court decision.\n\nII. ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n\n\u00b6 9 Appellant assigns the following as trial court error:\n\n[1.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF HIS MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL AND THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL IN VIOLATION OF APPELLANT'S RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS, JURY UNANIMITY AND DOUBLE JEOPARD PROTECTIONS AS GUARANTEED BY THE FIFTH, SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND OHIO CONSTITUTION WHEN THE APPELLATE COURT CONFIRMED THAT APPELLANT WAS CONVICTED FOR CRIMES FOR WHICH HE WAS NEVER CHARGED OR INDICTED AND WHERE HIS CONVICTIONS WERE BASED ON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT THAT WAS CONFIRMED TO BE BLATANT AND SERIOUS AND WHERE THE AMENDMENTS TO THE INDICTMENT WERE IMPERMISSIBLE DENYING HIM HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO NOTICE OF THE SPECIFIC CHARGE AND OPPORTUNITY TO DEFEND THEREBY DENYING HIM A FUNDAMENTALLY FAIR TRIAL AS GUARANTEED BY THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.\n\n[2.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF HIS MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL AND THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL WHEN THE APPELLATE COURT CONFIRMED THE GROUNDS AND\nBASIS UNDER WHICH APPELLANT SOUGHT A NEW TRIAL IN HIS ORIGINAL MOTION INCLUDING THE ADMISSION OF UNFAIRLY PREJUDICIAL AND IRRELEVANT EVIDENCE IN VIOLATION OF EVID. R. 404(B) AND THE FIFTH, SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND THE OHIO CONSTITUTION.\n\n[3.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF HIS MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL AND THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL IN VIOLATION OF THE FIFTH, SIXTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION WHEN THE APPELLATE COURT CONFIRMED APPELLANT WAS CONVICTED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IN COUNTS 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 AND 18 OF THE INDICTMENT.\n\nIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n{\u00b6 10} Ordinarily, \"[i]n considering a trial court's denial of a motion for leave to file a motion for new trial, this court employs an abuse of discretion standard.\" State v. Anderson, 10th Dist. No. 13AP-831, 2014-Ohio-1849, \u00b6 7, citing State v. Anderson, 10th Dist. No. 12AP-133, 2012-Ohio-4733, \u00b6 9. However, where the movant files a motion for leave to file a motion for new trial after judgment of conviction and sentence has been affirmed on appeal, the question arises whether the trial court retains jurisdiction to hear and determine the motion. See, e.g., State v. Davis, 131 Ohio St.3d 1, 2011-Ohio-5028; State ex rel. Cordray v. Marshall, 123 Ohio St.3d 229, 2009-Ohio-4986; State ex rel. Special Prosecutors v. Judges, Court of Common Pleas, 55 Ohio St.2d 94 (1978). In such cases, this court is presented with an issue of law that we review de novo. Giancola v. Azem, __ Ohio St.3d __, 2018-Ohio-1694, \u00b6 13 (slip opinion), citing Arnott v. Arnott, 132 Ohio St.3d 401, 2012-Ohio-3208, \u00b6 17; State v. Andrioff, 10th Dist. No. 84AP-502 (Mar. 7, 1985).\n\nIV. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\nA. Appellant's Assignments of Error\n\n{\u00b6 11} In each of appellant's assignments of error, appellant argues that our decision in Armengau II provides support for the arguments appellant made on the merits of his original delayed motion for new trial. Accordingly, appellant claims the trial court erred\nwhen it overruled his motion for reconsideration of his original motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial. Appellant makes the same argument in support of his second motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial, instanter. Plaintiff-appellee, State of Ohio, argues that res judicata barred both appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration and his second motion for leave to file a motion for delayed new trial. Because our analysis is the same for each of appellant\u2019s assignments of error, we will consider them jointly.\n\n\u00b6 12 Crim.R. 33 permits a trial court to grant a new trial under the following relevant circumstances:\n\n(A) Grounds. A new trial may be granted on motion of the defendant for any of the following causes affecting materially his substantial rights:\n\n(1) Irregularity in the proceedings, or in any order or ruling of the court, or abuse of discretion by the court, because of which the defendant was prevented from having a fair trial;\n\n(2) Misconduct of the jury, prosecuting attorney, or the witnesses for the state;\n\n* * *\n\n(5) Error of law occurring at the trial;\n\n(6) When new evidence material to the defense is discovered, which the defendant could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial. When a motion for a new trial is made upon the ground of newly discovered evidence, the defendant must produce at the hearing on the motion, in support thereof, the affidavits of the witnesses by whom such evidence is expected to be given, and if time is required by the defendant to procure such affidavits, the court may postpone the hearing of the motion for such length of time as is reasonable under all the circumstances of the case. The prosecuting attorney may produce affidavits or other evidence to impeach the affidavits of such witnesses.\n\n(B) Motion for new trial; Form, Time. Application for a new trial shall be made by motion which, except for the cause of newly discovered evidence, shall be filed within fourteen days after the verdict was rendered, or the decision of the court where a trial by jury has been waived, unless it is made to appear by clear and convincing proof that the defendant was\nunavoidably prevented from filing his motion for a new trial.\n\nMotions for new trial on account of newly discovered evidence shall be filed within one hundred twenty days after the day upon which the verdict was rendered, or the decision of the court where trial by jury has been waived. If it is made to appear by clear and convincing proof that the defendant was unavoidably prevented from the discovery of the evidence upon which he must rely, such motion shall be filed within seven days from an order of the court finding that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence within the one hundred twenty day period.\n\n\u00b6 13 The threshold question for this court in reviewing the denial of appellant\u2019s combined motion for reconsideration and second motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial is whether the trial court retained jurisdiction to hear and determine the motion after this court affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence in Armengau II. For the reasons that follow, we conclude the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider appellant\u2019s motion.\n\n\u00b6 14 In Special Prosecutors, the trial court granted a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea after a conviction and sentence based on the plea had been affirmed on appeal. After a trial date had been set, the Supreme Court of Ohio granted a writ of prohibition to prevent the trial from proceeding. The Supreme Court stated: \"[T]he trial court\u2019s granting of the motion to withdraw the guilty plea and the order to proceed with a new trial were inconsistent with the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the trial court\u2019s conviction premised upon the guilty plea. The judgment of the reviewing court is controlling upon the lower court as to all matters within the compass of the judgment. Accordingly, we find that the trial court lost its jurisdiction when the appeal was taken, and, absent a remand, it did not regain jurisdiction subsequent to the Court of Appeals' decision.\" Id. at 97.\n\n\u00b6 15 Relying on Special Prosecutors, this court in Andrioff concluded the trial court did not retain jurisdiction to hear and determine appellant\u2019s motion for new trial brought pursuant to Crim.R. 33(A)(1) through (5) after this court had affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence. In reaching its conclusion, this court stated:\nDefendant could have simply filed a motion for a new trial under Crim. R. 33(A)(1) through (5). However, he chose to file a notice of appeal pursuant to App. R. 4(B) and Crim. R. 33(F), and advanced four assignments of error: that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence and was contrary to law; that he had ineffective assistance of counsel; evidentiary rulings of the court; and his sentencing. Whereupon, all assignments of error were overruled and the judgment affirmed.\n\nThus, defendant elected to appeal his conviction. He advanced several issues which could have properly been the subject of a new trial within Crim. R. 33(A)(1) through (5). Since he elected to appeal, he cannot, in effect, relitigate the case in the trial court. Although the trial court retains jurisdiction over issues not inconsistent with the appellate court to review, modify, affirm or reverse a judgment, it does not regain jurisdiction over matters subject to the appeal in the absence of a reversal and remand by the appellate court. State, ex rel. Special Prosecutors, v. Judges (1978), 55 Ohio St. 2d 94.\n\n(Emphasis added.) Id.\n\n\u00b6 16 In Davis, the Supreme Court addressed whether, in light of Special Prosecutors, a trial court retains jurisdiction to hear and determine a Crim.R. 33(A)(6) motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence after a conviction has been affirmed in the direct appeal. The Supreme Court held that a trial court retains jurisdiction to hear and determine a Crim.R. 33(A)(6) motion when it raises issues that could not have been raised in the direct appeal because resolution of those issues depended on evidence outside the record in that appeal. Id. at \u00b6 34, 37.\n\n\u00b6 17 In Davis, appellee argued in the alternative that even if the trial court retained jurisdiction to hear and determine a Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial after the judgment and conviction was affirmed on appeal, the law of the case doctrine would present a bar to relief. The Davis court noted:\n\nThe law-of-the-case doctrine holds that \"the decision of a reviewing court in a case remains the law of that case on the legal questions involved for all subsequent proceedings in the case at both the trial and reviewing levels.\" (Emphasis added) Nolan v. Nolan (1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 1, 3, 11 OBR 1, 462 N.E.2d 410. This doctrine prevents a litigant from relying on arguments at retrial that were fully litigated, or could have been fully litigated, in a first appeal. See Hubbard ex rel. Creed v.\nIn rejecting appellee\u2019s contention that the law of the case doctrine presented a bar to appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 33(A)(6) motion, based on newly discovered evidence, the court in *Davis* noted the law of the case doctrine would not prevent a trial court from considering a new trial motion after the judgment of conviction and sentence was affirmed on appeal where the motion was \"based on newly discovered evidence when the specific issue has not been decided upon direct appeal.\" *Id.* at \u00b6 37.\n\nThough appellant allegedly grounded his second motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial in part on newly discovered evidence, pursuant to Crim.R. 33(A)(6), appellant did not produce any newly discovered evidence to support the motion. Rather, appellant presented the same affidavit from Caldwell that he presented in his original motion for leave to file a motion for delayed appeal and made the same arguments in support of his second motion that he made in his original motion. For example, appellant once again argues that his convictions were the result of prosecutorial and witness misconduct, that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence, that his convictions were based on inadmissible \"other acts\" evidence, and that the indictment was faulty. These are the same arguments appellant raised in his original motion for leave to file a motion for delayed new trial and the same arguments he raised in his appeal to this court from the judgment of conviction and sentence. *Armengau II* at \u00b6 53. As we noted in *Armengau I*, such arguments are grounded on Crim.R. 33(A)(1), (2), and (5), not Crim.R. 33(A)(6).\n\nAccordingly, pursuant to the decisions of the Supreme Court in *Davis* and *Special Prosecutors* and the decision of this court in *Andrioff*, the trial court was divested of jurisdiction to hear and determine both appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration of his first motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial and his second motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial after this court affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence on appeal. To the extent appellant claims that either the majority or the dissenting opinion in *Armengau II* constitutes newly discovered evidence in support of his second motion for new trial, appellant has cited no case law in support of such a claim and this court has found none. Moreover, the majority decision of this court in *Armengau II*\noverruled appellant\u2019s assignments of error alleging prosecutorial and witness misconduct, insufficiency of evidence, inadmissible \"other acts\" evidence, and a faulty indictment. As noted above, the remand order in Armengau II was limited to resentencing as to certain counts and redetermining appellant\u2019s sex offender status. In our opinion, the trial court never regained jurisdiction to alter or amend the judgment entry of conviction in the manner sought by appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration or his second motion for leave to file a motion for new trial. See Cordray at \u00b6 25 (the lower court \"patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to grant a motion for relief from a murder conviction and sentence based on claims that had previously been rejected by the court of appeals in an appeal in the same case\").\n\nMoreover, even if we were to agree with appellant that the dissenting opinion in Armengau II supports the grounds for a new trial alleged in appellant\u2019s proposed motions for new trial, the law of the case doctrine and our decision in Armengau I bar appellant from raising these claims. In Armengau I, we denied appellant leave to file an untimely motion for new trial on the grounds set forth in Crim.R. 33(A)(1), (2), and (5) on finding appellant failed to show that he was unavoidably prevented from filing his motion for new trial within 14 days of the jury verdict as required by Crim.R. 33(B). Id. at \u00b6 29. We denied his motion for leave to file an untimely motion for new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence, pursuant to Crim.R. 33(A)(6), on finding appellant failed to show that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering Caldwell\u2019s evidence within 120 days of the jury verdict as required by Crim.R. 33(B) and that he further failed to file his motion for leave within a reasonable time after discovering Caldwell\u2019s evidence. In Armengau I, this court never reached the merits of appellant\u2019s new trial motion because we agreed with the trial court that appellant failed to satisfy the requirements for leave under Crim.R. 33(B). Our holding in Armengau I remained the law of the case for purposes of appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration and second motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial.\n\n3 The dissenting opinion would have sustained appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, reversed appellant\u2019s convictions, and remanded the matter for a new trial. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error alleged:\n\n[Appellant\u2019s] rights to due process and a fair trial were violated when the trial court allowed the State to present irrelevant, cumulative, overly prejudicial evidence about prior bad acts through additional non-victim witnesses, whose testimony also violated the Ohio Rape Shield Statute, as well as testimony of hundreds of unindicted offenses.\nDavis. See also State v. Cochran, 10th Dist. No. 16AP-491, 2017-Ohio-1528, \u00b6 5 (\"Absent extraordinary circumstances, such as an intervening decision by the Supreme Court, an inferior court has no discretion to disregard the mandate of a superior court in a prior appeal in the same case.\"). The fact the dissenting opinion in Armengau II arguably supports the grounds for new trial appellant asserted under Crim.R. 33(A)(1) through (5) does not alter our conclusion in Armengau I that appellant\u2019s motion asserting those grounds was untimely filed, and appellant failed to demonstrate compliance with Crim.R. 33(B). The only \"newly discovered\" evidence cited by appellant in his combined motion for reconsideration and second motion for leave to file a motion for new trial was the Caldwell affidavit. Appellant presented nothing to excuse his untimeliness that this court had not already considered in Armengau I.\n\n\u00b6 22 For the foregoing reasons, we hold the trial court did not err when it denied appellant\u2019s motion seeking reconsideration of his original motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial and his alternative second motion for leave to file a motion for delayed new trial. Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s assignments of error.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\n\u00b6 23 Having overruled each of appellant\u2019s assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nBROWN, P.J., and KLATT, J., concur."}

Lindsay (\u201cLindsay\u201d) appeals the  \njudgment of the Marion County Court of Common Pleas for dismissing his petition \nfor a writ of habeas corpus.  For the reasons set forth below, the judgment of the \ntrial court is affirmed.  \nFacts and Procedural History \n{\u00b62} In 2010, Lindsay was convicted of rape, sexual battery, and gross sexual \nimposition.  State v. Lindsay, 5th Dist. Richland No. 18CA87, 2019-Ohio-157, \u00b6 5.  \nLindsay, at the time he filed this appeal, was an inmate at the  North Central \nCorrectional Complex in Marion County.  Doc. 1.  On May 13, 201 9, he filed a \npetition for a writ of habeas corpus (\u201cpetition\u201d) with the tria l court.  Doc. 1.  In the \nmemorandum attached to his petition, Lindsay argued that the tr ial court lost \njurisdiction over his case after the trial court permitted amen dments to his \nindictment that changed the identity of the charges against him .  Doc. 1.  Lindsay \nalso alleges that the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct; that the trial court\u2019s \ndetermination violated the prohibition on double jeopardy; and that the trial court \ndid not have the authority to sentence him.  Doc. 1.   \n{\u00b63} On July 15, 2019, the trial court dismissed Lindsay\u2019s petition pursuant \nto Civ.R. 12(B)(6).  Doc. 7.  On August 1, 2019, Lindsay filed a motion to reconsider \nhis dismissed petition.  Doc. 10.  On August 6, 2019, the trial court denied Lindsay\u2019s  \nCase No. 9-19-45 \n \n \n-3- \n \nmotion to reconsider.  Doc. 11. The petitioner filed his notice  of appeal on August \n9, 2019.  Doc. 12.  On appeal, Lindsay raises the following assignments of error: \nFirst Assignment of Error \nThe trial court was without any legal authority to sentence for  \nCase No. 2010CR0419D, although having original jurisdiction \npursuant to Article (IV), Section 4(B), of the Ohio Constitutio n, \nalso under Revised Code \u00a7 2931.03; after the return of the \u2018tru e \nbill\u2019 from the grand jury, however, the violations of the statu te, \nCriminal Rule 7(D), caused the trial court to lose standing ove r \nthe plaintiff, and immediate release should have been the outcome \nof the proceedings, as they were void ab initio.  \n \nSecond Assignment of Error \nThe plaintiff\u2019s sentence is void, and his incarceration is ille gal, a \njudgment absolutely void, and is a mere nullity; there should n ot \nbe any discretion in determining whether it should be dismissed  \nor set aside, and there is no remedy available for a sentence t hat \nis a question of judicial misconduct; allowing such an action after \nmultiple violations of due process of law against the plaintiff, who \nwas not informed of his right as to be released.   \n \nFor the sake of analytical clarity, we will consider both of these assignments of error \nin one analysis.   \nFirst and Second Assignments of Error \n{\u00b64} On appeal, Lindsay argues that the trial court erred in dismiss ing his \npetition because he presented adequate grounds for relief.   \n   \nCase No. 9-19-45 \n \n \n-4- \n \nLegal Standard \n{\u00b65} \u201cHabeas corpus, like other extraordinary writs, is not availabl e when \nthere is an adequate remedy at law.\u201d  State ex rel. Walker v. Sloan, 147 Ohio St.3d \n353, 2016-Ohio-7451, 65 N.E.3d 744, \u00b6 7.   \nA court may dismiss a habeas action under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for \nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted \u2018if, after \nall factual allegations are presumed true and all reasonable \ninferences are made in [the petitioner\u2019s] favor, it appears beyond \ndoubt that he could prove no set of facts entitling him to the \nrequested extraordinary relief in habeas corpus.\u2019  Keith v. Bobby, \n117 Ohio St.3d 470, 2008-Ohio-1443, 884 N.E.2d 1067, \u00b6 10.  We \nreview a dismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) de novo.  State ex rel. \nMcKinney v. Schmenk , 152 Ohio St.3d 70, 2017-Ohio-9183, 92 \nN.E.3d 871, \u00b6 8. \n \nRock v. Harris, 157 Ohio St.3d 6, 2019-Ohio-1849, 131 N.E.3d 6, \u00b6 6.  Further,  \nwhen a petition raises claims that are not cognizable in habeas  \ncorpus, a court need not hold an evidentiary hearing before \ndismissing the petition under Civ.R. 12(B)(6).  See Marshall v. \nLazaroff, 77 Ohio St.3d 443, 444, 674 N.E.2d 1378 (1997).  Nor is \nit necessary to first evaluate the merits of the claims. \n \nHandcock v. Shoop, 156 Ohio St.3d 282, 2019-Ohio-718, 125 N.E.3d 872, \u00b6 7. \nLegal Analysis  \n{\u00b66} In his petition, Lindsay challenged the indictment against him,  argued \nthat he was prejudiced by prosecutorial misconduct, and asserte d that his sentence \nwas invalid.  Doc. 1.  He also contended that a fraud was perpe trated against the \ntrial court and that his conviction violated double jeopardy.  Doc. 1.  However, none \nof these claims is cognizable in habeas corpus.  Clarke v. McFaul , 8th Dist.  \nCase No. 9-19-45 \n \n \n-5- \n \nCuyahoga No. 89436, 2007-Ohio-1592, \u00b6 10 (holding that \u201chabeas corpus is not \navailable to challenge either the validity or sufficiency of an  indictment.\u201d); Bobby, \nsupra, at \u00b6 15 (holding that \u201cclaims of fraud upon the court, prosec utorial \nmisconduct, and perjured testimony are not cognizable in habeas corpus.\u201d); Wills v. \nTurner, 150 Ohio St.3d 379, 2017-Ohio-6874, 81 N.E.3d 1252, \u00b6 6 (hold ing that \n\u201csentencing errors are not jurisdictional and are not cognizable in habeas corpus.\u201d); \nJohnson v. Crutchfield, 140 Ohio St.3d 485, 2014-Ohio-3653, 20 N.E.3d 676, \u00b6 6 \n(holding \u201cdouble-jeopardy claims are not cognizable in habeas c orpus.\u201d).  Thus, \nLindsay, in his petition, \u201cfail[ed] to state a claim upon which  relief [could] be \ngranted.\u201d  Civ.R. 12(B)(6).   \n{\u00b67} Further, all of the arguments that Lindsay made in his petition  identify \nalleged errors in the process that preceded his direct appeal.  See State v. Lindsay , \n5th Dist. Richland No. 2010-CA-0134, 2011-Ohio-4747. Lindsay could have raised \nthese claims on direct appeal.  Thus, in this case, direct appe al was an adequate \nalternative remedy in the ordinary course of law.  We also note  that Lindsay raised \nthese exact same arguments in a previous petition for postconvi ction relief that he \nfiled with the trial court on June 18, 2018.  Lindsay, supra, 2019-Ohio-157, \u00b6 16.  \nSince these claims were available to Lindsay during his direct appeal and have been \npreviously raised in his prior petition for postconviction reli ef, they are barred by \nres judicata.  State ex rel. Gibson v. Sloan , 147 Ohio St.3d 240, 2016-Ohio-3422, \n63 N.E.3d 1172, \u00b6 9 (holding that \u201c[r]es judicata precludes a p etitioner from using  \nCase No. 9-19-45 \n \n \n-6- \n \nhabeas corpus to gain successive appellate review of previously  litigated issues.\u201d); \nState ex rel. Rash v. Jackson , 102 Ohio St.3d 145, 2004-Ohio-2053, 807 N.E.2d \n344, \u00b6 12.  For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing \nLindsay\u2019s petition.  Thus, the appellant\u2019s first and second ass ignments of error are \noverruled.   \nConclusion \n{\u00b68} Having found no error prejudicial to the petitioner in the part iculars \nassigned and argued, the judgment of the Marion County Court of  Common Pleas \nis affirmed.  \nJudgment Affirmed \nZIMMERMAN, P.J. and PRESTON, J., concur. \n/hls \n ", "case_juv": "0", "case_crim": "0", "case_2001": "0", "case_app": "0", "case_pros": "0", "aoe_none": "0", "aoe_grandjury": "0", "aoe_court": "0", "aoe_defense": "0", "aoe_procbar": "1", "aoe_prochist": "0", "case_timeframe": "0", "other": "232    0\nName: other, dtype: int64", "olmocr_text": "IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\nTHIRD APPELLATE DISTRICT\nMARION COUNTY\n\nSTATE OF OHIO, EX.

State v. Lindsay, 5th Dist. Richland No. 18CA87, 2019-Ohio-157, \u00b6 5. Lindsay, at the time he filed this appeal, was an inmate at the North Central Correctional Complex in Marion County. Doc. 1. On May 13, 2019, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus (\u201cpetition\u201d) with the trial court. Doc. 1. In the memorandum attached to his petition, Lindsay argued that the trial court lost jurisdiction over his case after the trial court permitted amendments to his indictment that changed the identity of the charges against him. Doc. 1. Lindsay also alleges that the State engaged in prosecutorial misconduct; that the trial court\u2019s determination violated the prohibition on double jeopardy; and that the trial court did not have the authority to sentence him. Doc. 1.\n\n{\u00b63} On July 15, 2019, the trial court dismissed Lindsay\u2019s petition pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). Doc. 7. On August 1, 2019, Lindsay filed a motion to reconsider his dismissed petition. Doc. 10. On August 6, 2019, the trial court denied Lindsay\u2019s\nmotion to reconsider. Doc. 11. The petitioner filed his notice of appeal on August 9, 2019. Doc. 12. On appeal, Lindsay raises the following assignments of error:\n\n**First Assignment of Error**\n\nThe trial court was without any legal authority to sentence for Case No. 2010CR0419D, although having original jurisdiction pursuant to Article (IV), Section 4(B), of the Ohio Constitution, also under Revised Code \u00a7 2931.03; after the return of the \u2018true bill\u2019 from the grand jury, however, the violations of the statute, Criminal Rule 7(D), caused the trial court to lose standing over the plaintiff, and immediate release should have been the outcome of the proceedings, as they were void ab initio.\n\n**Second Assignment of Error**\n\nThe plaintiff\u2019s sentence is void, and his incarceration is illegal, a judgment absolutely void, and is a mere nullity; there should not be any discretion in determining whether it should be dismissed or set aside, and there is no remedy available for a sentence that is a question of judicial misconduct; allowing such an action after multiple violations of due process of law against the plaintiff, who was not informed of his right as to be released.\n\nFor the sake of analytical clarity, we will consider both of these assignments of error in one analysis.\n\n**First and Second Assignments of Error**\n\n{\u00b64} On appeal, Lindsay argues that the trial court erred in dismissing his petition because he presented adequate grounds for relief.\nLegal Standard\n\n{\u00b65} \u201cHabeas corpus, like other extraordinary writs, is not available when there is an adequate remedy at law.\u201d State ex rel. Walker v. Sloan, 147 Ohio St.3d 353, 2016-Ohio-7451, 65 N.E.3d 744, \u00b6 7.\n\nA court may dismiss a habeas action under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted \u2018if, after all factual allegations are presumed true and all reasonable inferences are made in [the petitioner\u2019s] favor, it appears beyond doubt that he could prove no set of facts entitling him to the requested extraordinary relief in habeas corpus.\u2019 Keith v. Bobby, 117 Ohio St.3d 470, 2008-Ohio-1443, 884 N.E.2d 1067, \u00b6 10. We review a dismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) de novo. State ex rel. McKinney v. Schmenk, 152 Ohio St.3d 70, 2017-Ohio-9183, 92 N.E.3d 871, \u00b6 8.\n\nRock v. Harris, 157 Ohio St.3d 6, 2019-Ohio-1849, 131 N.E.3d 6, \u00b6 6. Further, when a petition raises claims that are not cognizable in habeas corpus, a court need not hold an evidentiary hearing before dismissing the petition under Civ.R. 12(B)(6). See Marshall v. Lazaroff, 77 Ohio St.3d 443, 444, 674 N.E.2d 1378 (1997). Nor is it necessary to first evaluate the merits of the claims.\n\nHandcock v. Shoop, 156 Ohio St.3d 282, 2019-Ohio-718, 125 N.E.3d 872, \u00b6 7.\n\nLegal Analysis\n\n{\u00b66} In his petition, Lindsay challenged the indictment against him, argued that he was prejudiced by prosecutorial misconduct, and asserted that his sentence was invalid. Doc. 1. He also contended that a fraud was perpetrated against the trial court and that his conviction violated double jeopardy. Doc. 1. However, none of these claims is cognizable in habeas corpus. Clarke v. McFaul, 8th Dist.\nCuyahoga No. 89436, 2007-Ohio-1592, \u00b6 10 (holding that \u201chabeas corpus is not available to challenge either the validity or sufficiency of an indictment.\u201d); Bobby, supra, at \u00b6 15 (holding that \u201cclaims of fraud upon the court, prosecutorial misconduct, and perjured testimony are not cognizable in habeas corpus.\u201d); Wills v. Turner, 150 Ohio St.3d 379, 2017-Ohio-6874, 81 N.E.3d 1252, \u00b6 6 (holding that \u201csentencing errors are not jurisdictional and are not cognizable in habeas corpus.\u201d); Johnson v. Crutchfield, 140 Ohio St.3d 485, 2014-Ohio-3653, 20 N.E.3d 676, \u00b6 6 (holding \u201cdouble-jeopardy claims are not cognizable in habeas corpus.\u201d). Thus, Lindsay, in his petition, \u201cfail[ed] to state a claim upon which relief [could] be granted.\u201d Civ.R. 12(B)(6).\n\nFurther, all of the arguments that Lindsay made in his petition identify alleged errors in the process that preceded his direct appeal. See State v. Lindsay, 5th Dist. Richland No. 2010-CA-0134, 2011-Ohio-4747. Lindsay could have raised these claims on direct appeal. Thus, in this case, direct appeal was an adequate alternative remedy in the ordinary course of law. We also note that Lindsay raised these exact same arguments in a previous petition for postconviction relief that he filed with the trial court on June 18, 2018. Lindsay, supra, 2019-Ohio-157, \u00b6 16. Since these claims were available to Lindsay during his direct appeal and have been previously raised in his prior petition for postconviction relief, they are barred by res judicata. State ex rel. Gibson v. Sloan, 147 Ohio St.3d 240, 2016-Ohio-3422, 63 N.E.3d 1172, \u00b6 9 (holding that \u201c[r]es judicata precludes a petitioner from using\nCase No. 9-19-45\n\nhabeas corpus to gain successive appellate review of previously litigated issues.\u201d); State ex rel. Rash v. Jackson, 102 Ohio St.3d 145, 2004-Ohio-2053, 807 N.E.2d 344, \u00b6 12. For these reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err in dismissing Lindsay\u2019s petition. Thus, the appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error are overruled.\n\nConclusion\n\n{\u00b68} Having found no error prejudicial to the petitioner in the particulars assigned and argued, the judgment of the Marion County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n\nJudgment Affirmed\n\nZIMMERMAN, P.J. and PRESTON, J., concur.\n\n/hls"}

DeVaughns, appeals pro se from the \njudgment of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas overruling his Crim.R. 33 \nmotion for new trial.  For the reasons outlined below, the judgment of the trial court will \nbe affirmed. \n \nFacts and Course of Proceedings \n{\u00b6 2} In 2006, DeVaughns was tried before a jury and found guilty of felonious \nassault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) and kidnapping in violation of R.C. \n2905.01(A)(3).  The charges stemmed from allegations that DeVaughns had beaten the \nmother of his child, Lynelle Moore, causing her life-threatening injuries, and conf ined \nMoore against her will.  After the jury rendered its verdict, the trial court sentenced \nDeVaughns to eight years in prison for the felonious assault and ten years in prison for \nthe kidnapping.  The trial court ordered the sentences to be served consecutively to each \nother and consecutively to a sentence imposed in another case. \n{\u00b6 3} DeVaughns subsequently appealed from his conviction and sentence.  On \nappeal, we rejected the manifest weight and allied offense claims raised by DeVaughns \nin his appeal, but held that the trial court erred in failing to afford DeVaughns an \nopportunity to speak on his own behalf at sentencing.  Accordingly, we reversed the trial \ncourt\u2019s sentencing decision and remanded the matter for resentencing.  State v. \nDeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21654, 2007-Ohio-3455 (\u201cDeVaughns I\u201d). \n{\u00b6 4} On remand, the trial court gave DeVaughns the opportunity to address the \ncourt personally at his resentencing hearing.  Following DeVaughns\u2019 remarks, the trial  \n-3- \ncourt imposed the same sentence that it had imposed at the original sentencing hearing.  \nDeVaughns thereafter appealed from the sentence imposed by the trial court on remand, \nwhich we affirmed.  State v. DeVaughns , 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22349, 2008-Ohio-\n4010 (\u201cDeVaughns II\u201d). \n{\u00b6 5} In August 2009, DeVaughns filed a pro se motion for new trial based on newly \ndiscovered evidence.  The alleged new evidence consisted of attendance sheets from a \ndaycare center and a letter from a daycare employee, both of which purportedly \ndemonstrated that DeVaughns had picked up his daughter during the time it was alleged \nthat he kidnapped Moore.  The trial court denied DeVaughns\u2019 motions without a hearing.  \nOn appeal, we held that the record \u201cclearly reveals that this evidence was not new in \nrelation to the issues of fact that were tried.  The substance of [the employee\u2019s] letter \nwas admitted into evidence at Defendant\u2019s trial as a stipulation.\u201d  Accordingly, we \naffirmed the denial of DeVaughns\u2019 motion for a new trial.  State v. DeVaughns, 2d Dist. \nMontgomery No. 23720, 2011-Ohio-125 (\u201cDeVaughns III\u201d). \n{\u00b6 6} In 2011, DeVaughns filed several other pro se motions, including, but not \nlimited to, a \u201cMotion for Correction [of] Trial Transcript\u201d and a \u201cMotion for Unavoidably \nPrevented Crim.R. 33(B),\u201d which the trial court construed as a Crim.R. 33 motion for new \ntrial.  The trial court overruled both motions and DeVaughns separately appealed those \ndecisions.  We dismissed DeVaughns\u2019 appeal from the trial court\u2019s decision overruling \nthe motion to correct the trial transcript on grounds that the issue of an incomplete trial \ntranscript could have been raised in the pending appeal from his Crim.R. 33 motion for \nnew trial.  Decision and Final Judgment Entry (Sept. 12, 2011), 2d Dist. Montgomery \nApp. Case No. 24700.     \n-4- \n{\u00b6 7} In the appeal from the trial court\u2019s decision overruling DeVaughns\u2019 Crim.R. \n33 motion for new trial, we found that all but one of DeVaughns\u2019 assignments of error \nwere either barred by res judicata or were not properly before this court.  The single \nassignment of error we reviewed claimed that DeVaughns\u2019 trial counsel was ineffective in \nfailing to present exculpatory evidence related to his purported alibi.  We, however, \naffirmed the trial court\u2019s decision overruling DeVaughns\u2019 motion for new trial on grounds \nthat the motion was untimely and that DeVaughns was not unavoidably prevented from \ndiscovering the evidence on which his ineffective assistance claim was based.  State v. \nDeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24631, 2012-Ohio-5791 (\u201cDeVaughns IV\u201d). \n{\u00b6 8} In April 2015, DeVaughns filed a petition for post-conviction relief pursuant \nto R.C. 2953.21 and R.C. 2953.23, along with several other motions to supplement his \npetition.  The petition and motions included claims of ineffective assistance of counsel \nand prosecutorial misconduct.  Specifically, DeVaughns argued that his trial counsel \nfailed to properly object to the admissibility of certain blood evidence and that the \nprosecutor offered into evidence and discussed during closing argument inadmissible \nblood evidence.  The trial court denied DeVaughns\u2019 petition on grounds that it was \nuntimely and that his allegations \u201cdo not address complaints outside the record that could \nnot be attacked on direct appeal.\u201d  On June 30, 2015, DeVaughns appealed that ruling, \nbut then voluntarily dismissed the appeal.  Decision and Final Judgment Entry (Feb. 19, \n2016), 2d Dist. Montgomery App. Case No. 26745.   \n{\u00b6 9} On February 18, 2016, DeVaughns filed another petition for post-conviction \nrelief, wherein he asked the trial court to set aside his conviction.  Specifically, \nDeVaughns argued that there was evidence of blood on various items in his apartment,  \n-5- \nbut the record did not identify the identity of the person whose blood was found, as no \nDNA testing had been requested on the blood samples.  DeVaughns further indicated \nthat certain testimony about the blood was \u201cindiscernible\u201d in the trial transcript and that \nthe \u201cidentity and/or identities of the State\u2019s (DNA) evidence used to convict [him]\u201d was \noutside the trial court\u2019s record and unavailable.  DeVaughns also claimed that the failure \nto identify the source of the blood deprived him of his right to confront witnesses, that his \ntrial counsel was ineffective in failing to challenge the blood evidence, and that these \ncircumstances warranted a new trial. \n{\u00b6 10} Approximately three weeks later, on March 7, 2016, DeVaughns filed a \n\u201cmotion\u201d under R.C. 2953.21 and R.C. 2953.23, arguing that the State had failed to \nrespond to his petition for post-conviction relief, and therefore, had conceded the facts in \nhis petition.  In response, the State filed an opposing memorandum arguing that the \nclaims in DeVaughns\u2019 petition were untimely and barred by the doctrine of res judicata.  \nThe trial court agreed with the State.  Therefore, on March 30, 2016, the trial court issued \na decision overruling DeVaughns\u2019 petition for post-conviction relief1 on the basis of res \njudicata.  Not satisfied with the trial court\u2019s decision, DeVaughns once again appealed to \nthis court.   \n{\u00b6 11} On appeal, we found that DeVaughns\u2019 petition was successive and \nuntimely, and that he failed to establish that he was unavoidably prevented from \ndiscovering the facts upon which his claim was based.  Specifically, we found that \n                                                           \n1 Although the trial court\u2019s judgment entry references DeVaughns\u2019 motion filed on March \n7, 2016, and not the petition for post-conviction relief filed on February 18, 2016, based \non the substance of the trial court\u2019s judgment, it is apparent that the court ruled on the \npetition for post-conviction relief, regardless of the stated date.  See State v. DeVaughns, \n2017-Ohio-475, 84 N.E.3d 332, \u00b6 11, fn. 1 (2d Dist.).   \n-6- \nDeVaughns knew, from being present at his trial, that the blood evidence was offered at \ntrial and that it was not DNA tested.  We also found that DeVaughns was aware of his \ntrial counsel\u2019s statements to the trial court concerning the admissibility of the blood \nevidence, and therefore, he could have raised his counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness in his \ndirect appeal.  Accordingly, we affirmed the judgment of the trial court overruling \nDeVaughns\u2019 petition for post-conviction relief.  State v. DeVaughns, 2017-Ohio-475, 84 \nN.E.3d 332 (2d Dist.) (\u201cDeVaughns V\u201d).2   \n{\u00b6 12} Two days before our decision was released in DeVaughns V, on February \n8, 2017, DeVaughns filed yet another pro se Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial.  The motion \nraised the same argument that was raised in his prior petition for post-conviction relief; \nnamely, that the State\u2019s purported failure to identify the source of the blood evidence used \nat trial deprived him of his right to confront his accusers.  The State filed an opposing \nmemorandum in response arguing that DeVaughns\u2019 claim was barred by res judicata.  \nDeVaughns thereafter filed a reply to the State\u2019s memorandum, followed by two additional \npro se motions filed on June 21, 2017, and July 5, 2017, which requested the trial court \nto allow him to depose the source of the blood evidence and to \u201cexculpate testimony\u201d \nregarding the blood evidence.   \n{\u00b6 13} On August 15, 2017, the trial court issued a decision overruling all three of \nDeVaughns\u2019 pending motions.  In doing so, the trial court analyzed the motions under \nCrim.R. 33 and found that they were untimely and not filed on the basis of newly \ndiscovered evidence.  The trial court also determined that the motions were barred by \n                                                           \n2 In that decision we also affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment overruling DeVaughns\u2019 \nApp.R.9(C) motion for a statement of the evidence that was filed on July 13, 2015. \nDeVaughns V, 2017-Ohio-475, 84 N.E.3d 332 at \u00b6 13-20.  \n-7- \nthe doctrine of res judicata.  DeVaughns now appeals from the trial court\u2019s decision, \nraising two assignments of error for review. \n \nFirst Assignment of Error \n{\u00b6 14} Although difficult to discern, we interpret DeVaughns\u2019 First Assignment of \nError as generally challenging the trial court\u2019s decision to overrule his motion for new trial \npursuant to Crim.R. 33.  After a thorough review of the record, we find no error in the trial \ncourt\u2019s decision. \n{\u00b6 15} \u201cA trial court\u2019s decision on a Crim.R. 33 motion for a new trial will not be \nreversed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d  State v. Gillispie , 2d Dist. Montgomery No. \n24456, 2012-Ohio-1656, \u00b6 31, citing State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 564 N.E.2d 54 \n(1990), paragraph one of the syllabus; State v.

Warwick at *2.  \u201cA defendant is entitled to a hearing on a motion for \nleave to seek a new trial if he submits documents that on their face support his claim of \nbeing unavoidably prevented from meeting Crim.R. 33\u2019s time requirement.\u201d  State v. \nHiler, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27364, 2017-Ohio-7636, \u00b6 12, citing Lanier at \u00b6 16. \n{\u00b6 19} \u201c \u2018[A] party is unavoidably prevented from filing a motion for new trial if the \nparty had no knowledge of the existence of the ground supporting the motion for new trial \nand could not have learned of the existence of that ground within the time prescribed for \nfiling the motion for new trial in the exercise of reasonable diligence.\u2019 \u201d  Parker at \u00b6 16, \nquoting State v. Walden, 19 Ohio App.3d 141, 145-146, 483 N.E.2d 859 (10th Dist.1984). \n\u201c[A] defendant fails to demonstrate that he or she was unavoidably prevented from \ndiscovering new evidence when he would ha ve discovered that information earlier had \nhe or she exercised due diligence and some effort.\u201d  State v. Lenoir, 2d Dist. Montgomery \nNo. 26846, 2016-Ohio-4981, \u00b6 24, citing State v. Metcalf, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26101, \n2015-Ohio-3507, \u00b6 11, citing Warwick. \n{\u00b6 20} In this case, DeVaughns filed his motion for new trial pursuant to Crim.R. \n33(A)(1), (4), and (5).  DeVaughns\u2019 motion is therefore based on an irregularity in the \nproceedings, insufficient evidence to support his conviction, and an error of law at trial.  \nSince DeVaughns\u2019 motion is not based on newly discovered evidence, he was required \nto file his motion within fourteen days after his verdict or to request leave to file his motion \nout of time by providing clear and convincing proof that he was unavoidably prevented \nfrom timely filing his motion.  The record is clear that DeVaughns\u2019 motion for new trial \nwas untimely, as he filed the motion over ten years after his verdict was rendered.   \n-10-\nAccordingly, DeVaughns was obligated to provide the trial court with clear and convincing \nproof that he was unavoidably prevented from filing his motion in a timely fashion.  \nDeVaughns did not do this.  We further note that the record is devoid of any evidence \nindicating that DeVaughns was unavoidably prevented from discovering the fact that the \nblood evidence was not DNA tested, as he was aware of this fact at the time of trial.   \nTherefore, since DeVaughns never provided the trial court with a reason, let alone clear \nand convincing proof that he had been unavoidably prevent ed from timely filing his \nmotion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for new trial.   \n{\u00b6 21} The trial court also properly concluded that the blood evidence issue raised \nin DeVaughns\u2019 motion for new trial was barred by the doctrine of res judicata, as he could \nhave raised that issue in his direct appeal and raised similar issues in DeVaughns IV and \nDeVaughns V.  See State v. Videen, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27479, 2017-Ohio-8608, \n\u00b6 20 (finding res judicata barred appellant from raising issues in his motion for new trial \nthat could have been raised in his direct appeal), citing State v.

Nor does the fact that \nDefendant briefly left the apartment necessarily establish that Moore had \nopportunities to escape confinement, given the physical injuries Defendant \ninflicted on her and his threat to kill her if she tried to escape.

DeVaughns, appeals pro se from the judgment of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas overruling his Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial. For the reasons outlined below, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.\n\nFacts and Course of Proceedings\n\nIn 2006, DeVaughns was tried before a jury and found guilty of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) and kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3). The charges stemmed from allegations that DeVaughns had beaten the mother of his child, Lynelle Moore, causing her life-threatening injuries, and confined Moore against her will. After the jury rendered its verdict, the trial court sentenced DeVaughns to eight years in prison for the felonious assault and ten years in prison for the kidnapping. The trial court ordered the sentences to be served consecutively to each other and consecutively to a sentence imposed in another case.\n\nDeVaughns subsequently appealed from his conviction and sentence. On appeal, we rejected the manifest weight and allied offense claims raised by DeVaughns in his appeal, but held that the trial court erred in failing to afford DeVaughns an opportunity to speak on his own behalf at sentencing. Accordingly, we reversed the trial court\u2019s sentencing decision and remanded the matter for resentencing. State v. DeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21654, 2007-Ohio-3455 (\u201cDeVaughns I\u201d).\n\nOn remand, the trial court gave DeVaughns the opportunity to address the court personally at his resentencing hearing. Following DeVaughns\u2019 remarks, the trial\ncourt imposed the same sentence that it had imposed at the original sentencing hearing. DeVaughns thereafter appealed from the sentence imposed by the trial court on remand, which we affirmed. *State v. DeVaughns*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22349, 2008-Ohio-4010 (\u201c*DeVaughns II*\u201d).\n\n{\u00b6 5} In August 2009, DeVaughns filed a pro se motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The alleged new evidence consisted of attendance sheets from a daycare center and a letter from a daycare employee, both of which purportedly demonstrated that DeVaughns had picked up his daughter during the time it was alleged that he kidnapped Moore. The trial court denied DeVaughns\u2019 motions without a hearing. On appeal, we held that the record \u201cclearly reveals that this evidence was not new in relation to the issues of fact that were tried. The substance of [the employee\u2019s] letter was admitted into evidence at Defendant\u2019s trial as a stipulation.\u201d Accordingly, we affirmed the denial of DeVaughns\u2019 motion for a new trial. *State v. DeVaughns*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23720, 2011-Ohio-125 (\u201c*DeVaughns III*\u201d).\n\n{\u00b6 6} In 2011, DeVaughns filed several other pro se motions, including, but not limited to, a \u201cMotion for Correction [of] Trial Transcript\u201d and a \u201cMotion for Unavoidably Prevented Crim.R. 33(B),\u201d which the trial court construed as a Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial. The trial court overruled both motions and DeVaughns separately appealed those decisions. We dismissed DeVaughns\u2019 appeal from the trial court\u2019s decision overruling the motion to correct the trial transcript on grounds that the issue of an incomplete trial transcript could have been raised in the pending appeal from his Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial. Decision and Final Judgment Entry (Sept. 12, 2011), 2d Dist. Montgomery App. Case No. 24700.\nIn the appeal from the trial court's decision overruling DeVaughns' Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial, we found that all but one of DeVaughns' assignments of error were either barred by res judicata or were not properly before this court. The single assignment of error we reviewed claimed that DeVaughns' trial counsel was ineffective in failing to present exculpatory evidence related to his purported alibi. We, however, affirmed the trial court's decision overruling DeVaughns' motion for new trial on grounds that the motion was untimely and that DeVaughns was not unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence on which his ineffective assistance claim was based. State v. DeVaughns, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24631, 2012-Ohio-5791 (\"DeVaughns IV\").\n\nIn April 2015, DeVaughns filed a petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 and R.C. 2953.23, along with several other motions to supplement his petition. The petition and motions included claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. Specifically, DeVaughns argued that his trial counsel failed to properly object to the admissibility of certain blood evidence and that the prosecutor offered into evidence and discussed during closing argument inadmissible blood evidence. The trial court denied DeVaughns' petition on grounds that it was untimely and that his allegations \u201cdo not address complaints outside the record that could not be attacked on direct appeal.\u201d On June 30, 2015, DeVaughns appealed that ruling, but then voluntarily dismissed the appeal. Decision and Final Judgment Entry (Feb. 19, 2016), 2d Dist. Montgomery App. Case No. 26745.\n\nOn February 18, 2016, DeVaughns filed another petition for post-conviction relief, wherein he asked the trial court to set aside his conviction. Specifically, DeVaughns argued that there was evidence of blood on various items in his apartment,\nbut the record did not identify the identity of the person whose blood was found, as no DNA testing had been requested on the blood samples. DeVaughns further indicated that certain testimony about the blood was \u201cindiscernible\u201d in the trial transcript and that the \u201cidentity and/or identities of the State's (DNA) evidence used to convict [him]\u201d was outside the trial court\u2019s record and unavailable. DeVaughns also claimed that the failure to identify the source of the blood deprived him of his right to confront witnesses, that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to challenge the blood evidence, and that these circumstances warranted a new trial.\n\n{\u00b6 10} Approximately three weeks later, on March 7, 2016, DeVaughns filed a \u201cmotion\u201d under R.C. 2953.21 and R.C. 2953.23, arguing that the State had failed to respond to his petition for post-conviction relief, and therefore, had conceded the facts in his petition. In response, the State filed an opposing memorandum arguing that the claims in DeVaughns\u2019 petition were untimely and barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The trial court agreed with the State. Therefore, on March 30, 2016, the trial court issued a decision overruling DeVaughns' petition for post-conviction relief\\(^1\\) on the basis of res judicata. Not satisfied with the trial court\u2019s decision, DeVaughns once again appealed to this court.\n\n{\u00b6 11} On appeal, we found that DeVaughns\u2019 petition was successive and untimely, and that he failed to establish that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts upon which his claim was based. Specifically, we found that\n\n\\(^1\\) Although the trial court\u2019s judgment entry references DeVaughns\u2019 motion filed on March 7, 2016, and not the petition for post-conviction relief filed on February 18, 2016, based on the substance of the trial court\u2019s judgment, it is apparent that the court ruled on the petition for post-conviction relief, regardless of the stated date. See State v. DeVaughns, 2017-Ohio-475, 84 N.E.3d 332, \u00b6 11, fn. 1 (2d Dist.).\nDeVaughns knew, from being present at his trial, that the blood evidence was offered at trial and that it was not DNA tested. We also found that DeVaughns was aware of his trial counsel's statements to the trial court concerning the admissibility of the blood evidence, and therefore, he could have raised his counsel's alleged ineffectiveness in his direct appeal. Accordingly, we affirmed the judgment of the trial court overruling DeVaughns' petition for post-conviction relief. State v. DeVaughns, 2017-Ohio-475, 84 N.E.3d 332 (2d Dist.) (\"DeVaughns V\").\n\n\u00b6 12 Two days before our decision was released in DeVaughns V, on February 8, 2017, DeVaughns filed yet another pro se Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial. The motion raised the same argument that was raised in his prior petition for post-conviction relief; namely, that the State's purported failure to identify the source of the blood evidence used at trial deprived him of his right to confront his accusers. The State filed an opposing memorandum in response arguing that DeVaughns' claim was barred by res judicata. DeVaughns thereafter filed a reply to the State's memorandum, followed by two additional pro se motions filed on June 21, 2017, and July 5, 2017, which requested the trial court to allow him to depose the source of the blood evidence and to \"exculpate testimony\" regarding the blood evidence.\n\n\u00b6 13 On August 15, 2017, the trial court issued a decision overruling all three of DeVaughns' pending motions. In doing so, the trial court analyzed the motions under Crim.R. 33 and found that they were untimely and not filed on the basis of newly discovered evidence. The trial court also determined that the motions were barred by\n\n---\n\n2 In that decision we also affirmed the trial court's judgment overruling DeVaughns' App.R.9(C) motion for a statement of the evidence that was filed on July 13, 2015. DeVaughns V, 2017-Ohio-475, 84 N.E.3d 332 at \u00b6 13-20.\nthe doctrine of res judicata. DeVaughns now appeals from the trial court's decision, raising two assignments of error for review.\n\nFirst Assignment of Error\n\n{\u00b6 14} Although difficult to discern, we interpret DeVaughns' First Assignment of Error as generally challenging the trial court's decision to overrule his motion for new trial pursuant to Crim.R. 33. After a thorough review of the record, we find no error in the trial court's decision.\n\n{\u00b6 15} \"A trial court's decision on a Crim.R. 33 motion for a new trial will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.\" State v. Gillispie, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24456, 2012-Ohio-1656, \u00b6 31, citing State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 564 N.E.2d 54 (1990), paragraph one of the syllabus; State v. Matthews, 81 Ohio St.3d 375, 378, 691 N.E.2d 1041 (1998). \" 'Abuse of discretion' has been defined as an attitude that is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\" (Citation omitted.)

River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597 (1990).\n\n{\u00b6 16} Pursuant to Crim.R. 33(A):\n\nA new trial may be granted on motion of the defendant for any of the following causes affecting materially his substantial rights:\n\n(1) Irregularity in the proceedings, or in any order or ruling of the court, or abuse of discretion by the court, because of which the defendant was prevented from having a fair trial;\n\n(2) Misconduct of the jury, prosecuting attorney, or the witnesses for the\nstate;\n(3) Accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against;\n(4) That the verdict is not sustained by sufficient evidence or is contrary to law. * * *\n(5) Error of law occurring at the trial;\n(6) When new evidence material to the defense is discovered which the defendant could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and produced at the trial. * * *\n\n\u00b6 17 Except for motions based on newly discovered evidence under Crim.R. 33(A)(6), a motion for new trial \u201cshall be filed within fourteen days after the verdict was rendered * * * unless it is made to appear by clear and convincing proof that the defendant was unavoidably prevented from filing his motion for a new trial * * * [.]\u201d Crim.R. 33(B). In contrast, a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence \u201cshall be filed within one hundred twenty days after the day upon which the verdict was rendered * * * [.]\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6 18 In order to file a motion for new trial after the expiration of the time periods specified in Crim.R. 33(B), a defendant must first seek leave of the trial court to file a delayed motion.

Hiler*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27364, 2017-Ohio-7636, \u00b6 12, citing *Lanier* at \u00b6 16.\n\n{\u00b6 19} \u201c\u2018[A] party is unavoidably prevented from filing a motion for new trial if the party had no knowledge of the existence of the ground supporting the motion for new trial and could not have learned of the existence of that ground within the time prescribed for filing the motion for new trial in the exercise of reasonable diligence.\u2019\u201d *Parker* at \u00b6 16, quoting *State v. Walden*, 19 Ohio App.3d 141, 145-146, 483 N.E.2d 859 (10th Dist.1984). \u201c[A] defendant fails to demonstrate that he or she was unavoidably prevented from discovering new evidence when he would have discovered that information earlier had he or she exercised due diligence and some effort.\u201d *State v. Lenoir*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26846, 2016-Ohio-4981, \u00b6 24, citing *State v. Metcalf*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26101, 2015-Ohio-3507, \u00b6 11, citing *Warwick*.\n\n{\u00b6 20} In this case, DeVaughns filed his motion for new trial pursuant to Crim.R. 33(A)(1), (4), and (5). DeVaughns' motion is therefore based on an irregularity in the proceedings, insufficient evidence to support his conviction, and an error of law at trial. Since DeVaughns' motion is not based on newly discovered evidence, he was required to file his motion within fourteen days after his verdict or to request leave to file his motion out of time by providing clear and convincing proof that he was unavoidably prevented from timely filing his motion. The record is clear that DeVaughns' motion for new trial was untimely, as he filed the motion over ten years after his verdict was rendered.\nAccordingly, DeVaughns was obligated to provide the trial court with clear and convincing proof that he was unavoidably prevented from filing his motion in a timely fashion. DeVaughns did not do this. We further note that the record is devoid of any evidence indicating that DeVaughns was unavoidably prevented from discovering the fact that the blood evidence was not DNA tested, as he was aware of this fact at the time of trial. Therefore, since DeVaughns never provided the trial court with a reason, let alone clear and convincing proof that he had been unavoidably prevented from timely filing his motion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for new trial.\n\n\u00b6 21 The trial court also properly concluded that the blood evidence issue raised in DeVaughns\u2019 motion for new trial was barred by the doctrine of res judicata, as he could have raised that issue in his direct appeal and raised similar issues in DeVaughns IV and DeVaughns V. See State v. Videen, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27479, 2017-Ohio-8608, \u00b6 20 (finding res judicata barred appellant from raising issues in his motion for new trial that could have been raised in his direct appeal), citing State v. Russell, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 04AP-1149, 2005-Ohio-4063, \u00b6 6-7 and State v. Butler, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2717, 1991 WL 116659, *1 (June 26, 1991).\n\n\u00b6 22 For the foregoing reasons, DeVaughns\u2019 First Assignment of Error is overruled.\n\nSecond Assignment of Error\n\n\u00b6 23 We interpret DeVaughns\u2019 Second Assignment of Error as challenging this court\u2019s decision in DeVaughns III, as DeVaughns merely quotes the following portion of that decision:\nThe mere fact that at some point during Lynelle Moore\u2019s confinement Defendant briefly left his apartment to pickup his daughter does not exonerate Defendant and demonstrate that Defendant did not restrain Moore\u2019s liberty at other times during this period. Nor does the fact that Defendant briefly left the apartment necessarily establish that Moore had opportunities to escape confinement, given the physical injuries Defendant inflicted on her and his threat to kill her if she tried to escape.

Horsley , Interim City Prosecutor, \nand Jon Vogt, Appellate Director, for Plaintiff-Appellant, \n \nRaymond T. Faller , Hamilton County Public Defender, and David Hoffmann , \nAssistant Public Defender, for Defendant-Appellee. \n \n OHIO FIRST DISTRICT COURT OF APPEALS \n \n 2\nMYERS, Judge. \n{\u00b61} The state of Ohio appeals the judgments of the Hamilton County \nMunicipal Court dismissing five charges against Willadean Branam as a sanction for \nthe state\u2019s failure to provide a video in discovery.  Because the trial court abused its \ndiscretion by failing to consider the appropriate factors before imposing dismissal as \na sanction for the discovery violation, we reverse. \n{\u00b62} On January 1, 2019, Branam was charged with obstructing official \nbusiness, spitting in a public place, possession of marijuana, leaving a curb without \nproper signaling, and a license-plate violation.  On January 29, Branam filed a \ndemand for discovery. \n{\u00b63} In its written response filed on February 3, the state provided all that \nBranam had requested except for videos captured by police body-worn cameras \n(\u201cBWC\u201d) and from mobile video recorders (\u201cMVR\u201d) in police cruisers.  The state \nindicated that \u201cBWC video will be forwarded upon receipt\u201d and \u201cMVR Video ordered, \nwill forward upon receipt, if available.\u201d   \n{\u00b64} On February 14, Branam filed a moti on asking the court to extend the \ndeadline for her to file a motion to suppress.  She asserted that she was still waiting \nfor the state to produce BWC and MVR videos, which might form the basis of a \npotential motion to suppress. \n{\u00b65} At a hearing on April 12, the court ordered the state to provide the \nr e c o r d i n g s  w i t h i n  t e n  d a y s .

Hanudel, for appellant. \n \n* * * * * \n \nMAYLE, J. \n{\u00b6 1} Appellant, Ronald Boaston, appeals the October 16, 2017 judgment of the \nLucas County Court of Common Pleas denying his petition for postconviction relief and \nrequest for funds to hire court-appointed experts.  For the following reasons, we affirm.  2.\nI.  Background and Facts \n{\u00b6 2} In 2015, Boaston was convicted of murdering his ex-wife, Brandi  \nGonyer-Boaston.  On appeal, he argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in \n(1) allowing the deputy coroner who conducted the autopsy, Dr. Diane Scala-Barnett, to \ntestify regarding Brandi\u2019s time of death based on her stomach contents (the \u201ctime-of-\ndeath opinion\u201d) and that an abrasion on Brandi\u2019s chin was consistent with the pattern, \nshape, and texture of a buckle and some Velcro on one of Boaston\u2019s gloves (the \u201cglove-\nbuckle opinion\u201d) because these opinions were not in Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s written expert \nreport, as required by Crim.R. 16(K), and (2) permitting a Toledo Police Department \ndetective, Jay Gast, to testify regarding cellphone tower tracking without establishing the \nscientific validity of such evidence.  See State v. Boaston, 2017-Ohio-8770, 100 N.E.3d \n1002 (6th Dist.).  We determined that (1) Boaston waived the Crim.R. 16(K) issue by \nfailing to raise it before trial because defense counsel knew that Dr. Scala-Barnett \nplanned to testify about Brandi\u2019s time of death based on her stomach contents and to \nopine on the similarity of the abrasion and the glove buckle, but did not move to exclude \nDr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s testimony until after the jury was empaneled; (2) Boaston did not \nraise concerns about the validity of the cellphone tower tracking evidence at trial, so he \nwaived all but plain error regarding that issue; and (3) it was not plain error for the trial \ncourt to accept testimony about cellphone tower tracking from a detective without \nconducting a hearing regarding the testimony\u2019s scientific reliability.  Id. at \u00b6 49, 56, 62, \n65-66.  3.\n{\u00b6 3} Boaston appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio, which accepted his appeal \non the Crim.R. 16(K) issue and affirmed his conviction, albeit on different grounds.  State \nv. Boaston, 160 Ohio St.3d 46, 2020-Ohio-1061, 153 N.E.3d 44.  The court determined \nthat Crim.R. 16(K) required the exclusion of Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion \nand glove-buckle opinion because they were not included in her written report, and that \nthe trial court erred in allowing her to testify regarding these matters.  Id. at \u00b6 55-59.  \nHowever, the court also concluded that the error was harmless because Dr.  \nScala-Barnett\u2019s opinions were \u201cnot essential to the state\u2019s prosecution of the charged \ncrimes\u201d and \u201cdid little more than connect dots that were all too readily apparent.\u201d  Id. at \n\u00b6 64.  Moreover, the court found that \u201ceven without the deputy coroner\u2019s opinion \ntestimony on Brandi\u2019s time of death and the glove-buckle comparison, the remaining \nevidence overwhelmingly establishes Boaston\u2019s guilt beyond any reasonable doubt.\u201d  Id. \nat \u00b6 65.  The court cataloged the record evidence of Boaston\u2019s jealousy, controlling \nbehavior, installation of spyware on Brandi\u2019s phones, his \u201ctumultuous\u201d relationship with \nBrandi, his refusal to accept Brandi\u2019s clear desire to leave the relationship and move out \nof their shared apartment, the steps he took in preparation of Brandi\u2019s murder (including \nmaking ATM withdrawals, putting gas in her vehicle, asking a friend for \u201cassistance \u2018to \ntake care of business,\u2019\u201d and calling Brandi the morning of the murder to make sure that \nshe came to the apartment when she got off of work), and the lack of activity on \nBoaston\u2019s cellphone during the timeframe when Brandi was likely murdered and \ntransported to Fulton County.  Id. at \u00b6 66-68.  4.\n{\u00b6 4} On the whole, the Supreme Court said that \n[i]t strains credulity to think that in the span of 46 minutes, Brandi left \n[Boaston\u2019s] residence, was abducted by an unidentified assailant who \npartially undressed and killed her, wrapped her in plastic, stashed her body \nalong with her dry clothing and shoes in the rear of her vehicle, drove the \nSUV 20 miles away, abandoned it off the country road, and mysteriously \ndisappeared without a trace.  Id. at \u00b6 69. \nBecause all of this evidence established Boaston\u2019s guilt \u201cbeyond any reasonable doubt,\u201d \nthe court found that he was not entitled to a new trial, despite the erroneous admission of \nDr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s opinions.  Id. at \u00b6 70. \n{\u00b6 5} The Supreme Court did not address the issue of Gast\u2019s opinion on cell tower \ntracking data. \n{\u00b6 6} While his direct appeal was pending, Boaston filed the petition for \npostconviction relief underlying this appeal.  In it, he raised three grounds for relief. \n{\u00b6 7} First, Boaston claimed that the state violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. \n83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by failing to disclose material evidence \nfavorable to him when it presented Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion and  \nglove-buckle opinion without Dr. Scala-Barnett including those opinions in her written \nreport, as required by Crim.R. 16(K).  He argued that his defense was prejudiced because \nit was \u201cimpossible\u201d for any expert hired by trial counsel \u201cto conduct a true expert \nanalysis consisting of a scientific reasoning process * * *\u201d without knowing what Dr.  5.\nScala-Barnett\u2019s \u201creasoning process\u201d was.  He claimed that this resulted in him being \n\u201cambushed in trial,\u201d and that due process required that he be given an opportunity in a \npostconviction relief proceeding to have an expert pathologist review Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s \nconclusions. \n{\u00b6 8} In support of this claim for relief, Boaston submitted the affidavit of his \nappellate attorney, Stephen Hanudel, who also represents Boaston in the postconviction \nrelief proceedings.  Hanudel averred that, based on his research, Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s \n\u201cconclusion as to Ms. Gonyer-Boaston\u2019s time of death based on the stomach contents \nmay have lacked sufficient scientific basis and needs independent expert evaluation.\u201d  In \nreaching this conclusion, Hanudel spoke to four forensic pathologists. \n{\u00b6 9} One forensic pathologist told him that \u201cthe science behind using stomach \ncontents to determine time of death is disputed and controversial within the medical and \nscientific community[,]\u201d but \u201cdid not express his personal position on the issue [and] was \nvery careful to not come across as expressing any point of view that would indicate how \nhe would feel about Dr. [Scala-]Barnett\u2019s conclusion, especially since he has not viewed \nthe autopsy materials.\u201d \n{\u00b6 10} The second \u201cquickly expressed the willingness to evaluate Dr.  \n[Scala-]Barnett\u2019s conclusion[, but] did not specifically state his position on the issue.\u201d  \nHanudel\u2019s \u201cpersonal interpretation of his quick willingness to help as soon as I told him \nthe issue was that the science is disputed and controversial.\u201d  6.\n{\u00b6 11} The third did not want to be involved in the case because he knows Dr. \nScala-Barnett personally, but, because he was not going to be involved, he \u201ctalked a little \nmore freely and expressed reservations as to the scientific reliability behind using \nstomach contents to determine time of death.  He seemed to think that the reliability \nvaries from case to case based on the specific facts involved.\u201d \n{\u00b6 12} The final pathologist Hanudel spoke to also \u201cexpressed reservations about \nthe scientific reliability behind using stomach contents to determine time of death.\u201d  \nHowever, he ultimately \u201cdeclined to get involved in the case.  He seemed very busy with \nother matters.\u201d \n{\u00b6 13} After his conversations with these pathologists, Hanudel was convinced \nthat Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s \u201cconclusions must be given a second look from an independent \nexpert,\u201d and his \u201cimpression from all four is that Dr. [Scala-]Barnett may very well be \nwrong in her conclusion.\u201d \n{\u00b6 14} Boaston\u2019s second claim for relief in his postconviction relief petition \nalleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because, although trial counsel \nconsulted with experts in forensic pathology and cell tower tracking, he did not use those \nexperts at trial.  Boaston argues in his petition that, although trial counsel did not have a \nwritten report from Dr. Scala-Barnett that his forensic pathologist could have used to \nformulate an opinion before trial, trial counsel could have, for example, had the forensic \npathologist observe Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s testimony and then testify in response.  Boaston \nalso faults trial counsel for failing to ask for a hearing under Daubert v. Merrell Dow  7.\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), to get Dr. \nScala-Barnett to justify her opinions before being allowed to testify.  He argued that \n\u201c[t]here was absolutely no sound strategy * * *\u201d involved in trial counsel\u2019s decision not \nto call the experts to testify in some capacity, but instead to only cross-examine the \nstate\u2019s experts. \n{\u00b6 15} Although he stopped short of directly calling trial counsel ineffective, \nHanudel provided more details about trial counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness in his \naffidavit.  First, he said that trial counsel consulted with a forensic pathologist, Dr. \nThomas Young, who issued a written opinion (about a month before Dr. Scala-Barnett \ntold trial counsel about her time-of-death opinion) that questioned whether Brandi\u2019s death \nwas caused by strangulation.  Trial counsel then spoke to Dr. Young about Dr. Scala-\nBarnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion.  He believed that \u201cthere were way too many variables in \nthe digestive process to render a time-of-death conclusion\u201d based on stomach contents, \nbut, according to Hanudel, \u201cit was impossible for Dr. Young to formally express an \nopinion on the issue\u201d without having a written opinion from Dr. Scala-Barnett that \noutlined her \u201cscientific reasoning process * * *.\u201d  Because trial counsel felt that Dr. \nYoung\u2019s testimony \u201cwould amount to the same type of abstract conjecture as Dr.  \n[Scala-]Barnett\u2019s[,]\u201d he opted to rebut Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s testimony through cross-\nexamination.  According to Hanudel, the lack of a written report from Dr. Scala-Barnett \nhad a \u201cdirect impact\u201d on trial counsel\u2019s decision not to call Dr. Young to testify, and if \ncounsel had been given a report \u201carticulating [Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s] findings, analysis, and  8.\nconclusion * * *\u201d regarding Brandi\u2019s time of death, he \u201cwould have had Dr. Young \nreview the report and then issue his own report.  This then may have resulted in a \ndifferent decision on whether to have Dr. Young testify, despite Dr. Young\u2019s admission \nto [trial counsel] that he tends not to come across well in testimony.\u201d \n{\u00b6 16} Hanudel also averred that trial counsel consulted with Midwest Data Group \nregarding the cell tower tracking data, but did not receive an opinion letter from Midwest \nData Group, so there is nothing in writing that contradicts Gast\u2019s trial testimony about \n\u201ccell tower sector pie slices.\u201d  However, trial counsel spoke to someone at Midwest Data \nGroup who \u201cfelt the cell tower sector pie slices are not perfectly even[,]\u201d but counsel \nchose not to present the expert at trial because \u201che did not feel the testimony would be of \nmuch assistance to Mr. Boaston since he felt he could sufficiently cover the issues in \ncross examination [sic].\u201d \n{\u00b6 17} In preparing the postconviction relief petition, Hanudel contacted Larry \nDaniel who \u201chas testified over 45 times in state and federal courts as a computer \ntechnology expert, cellular phone forensics expert, GPS forensics expert, and cellular \ntechnology expert.\u201d  Hanudel gathered from his conversation with Daniel that cell tower \nsectors do not necessarily create \u201ceven pie slices\u201d\u2014which is what Gast testified to at \ntrial, and what the state relied on to show that Boaston was not at home the morning \nBrandi\u2019s body was found, like he said he was, because his phone contacted a different \nsector of the cell tower near his house.  Instead, Daniel told Hanudel that \u201cthe science is \nmuch more complicated and that sector overlap can often occur[,]\u201d and, essentially, the  9.\nfact that Boaston\u2019s phone contacted a different side of the cell tower \u201cmay not mean what \nthe State thinks it means.\u201d \n{\u00b6 18} In his final claim for relief, Boaston argued that the DNA profile from an \nunknown male that was found on Brandi\u2019s pants should be tested because it could reveal \nthe identity of the real killer.  In support, he pointed out that the other DNA profile on the \npants only showed that it was from a Boaston male and could not be linked to any \nspecific Boaston male\u2014i.e., it could have come from Boaston or one of his sons, who all \nsaw Brandi regularly.  He argued that the only other evidence putting Boaston with \nBrandi at the time she died was \u201ca questionable opinion presented by Dr. [Scala-]Barnett \nthat is not well backed by science.\u201d   He also points out that there were no signs of foul \nplay in Boaston\u2019s apartment, the cellphone tower tracking evidence showed that Boaston \nwas in Toledo at all relevant times, there was no evidence that Boaston was in Fulton \nCounty (where Brandi\u2019s body was found), there was no DNA on the glove buckle that \nDr. Scala-Barnett opined could have caused the abrasion on Brandi\u2019s chin, and the fact \nthat Brandi\u2019s hair was found in the Velcro on Boaston\u2019s glove \u201cmeans nothing because \nshe and Boaston saw each other every day.\u201d  He concluded that \u201c[i]t is more than \nworthwhile to see if the unknown male DNA profile can be matched to anyone, \nespecially in the State\u2019s criminal DNA database.\u201d \n{\u00b6 19} In his affidavit in support of Boaston\u2019s petition, however, Hanudel averred \nthat he had spoken to a forensic scientist at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation \n(\u201cBCI\u201d) about whether \u201cfurther testing could be done to determine the origin of the other  10. \nmale DNA profile\u201d on Brandi\u2019s pants.  The BCI analyst told him that \u201cbased on the \nnature of the [other male DNA] sample, it was not possible to make any such \ndetermination with further testing.\u201d \n{\u00b6 20} In addition to these claims for relief, Boaston included a request for court-\nappointed expert witness fees in his postconviction relief petition.  He argued that he \nneeded expert assistance to develop his claims, but that he lacked the funds to hire them.  \nIn his affidavit, Hanudel said that he was privately retained by Boaston\u2019s family to \nrepresent Boaston in postconviction matters, but that the family \u201csimply does not have \nthe funds to provide the up-front retainers the experts require and pay the potential total \ncost incurred by the experts.\u201d \n{\u00b6 21} In response to Boaston\u2019s petition, the state filed a \u201cMOTION TO \nDISMISS/MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT * * *\u201d that also opposed Boaston\u2019s \nrequests for additional DNA testing and funds for court-appointed experts.  It argued that \nBoaston\u2019s claims for relief were barred by res judicata, his request for further DNA \ntesting was undermined by Hanudel\u2019s admission that the BCI analyst told him that the \nsource of the unknown DNA on Brandi\u2019s pants could not be determined, and Boaston \nwas not entitled to court-appointed experts. \n{\u00b6 22} Specifically, the state argued that Hanudel\u2019s affidavit did not support the \npetition because (1) it contained hearsay statements from experts, which, the state \nclaimed, were entitled to little weight; (2) it contained extraneous and irrelevant \ninformation related to bite mark identification, which was not at issue in Boaston\u2019s case;  11. \n(3) Hanudel\u2019s description of trial counsel\u2019s decisions related to the expert witnesses \n\u201cprovide[d] evidence of precisely the strategic calculus that trial attorneys are permitted \n(and expected) to make * * *\u201d; and (4) it acknowledged that \u201cfurther testing of the \nunknown male DNA profile on Brandi\u2019s pants would not lead to any determinative \nresult.\u201d \n{\u00b6 23} Regardless, even assuming that Hanudel\u2019s affidavit did support Boaston\u2019s \nclaims, the state argued that all of his claims related to Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s testimony and \nGast\u2019s cell tower tracking data testimony were barred by res judicata because these \nclaims were, or could have been, raised in Boaston\u2019s direct appeal, and did not fall into \nthe exception to the res judicata bar for cases where the defendant presents new, \ncompetent, relevant, and material evidence from outside of the trial record.  The state said \nthat the issue of Dr. Scala-Barnett failing to include her time-of-death opinion and glove-\nbuckle opinion in her written report was raised by trial counsel and was \u201ccentral to his \ndirect appeal.\u201d  He also argued in his direct appeal that trial counsel was ineffective based \non his handling of Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s trial testimony.  The state further contended that \nBoaston\u2019s arguments that testimony about the glove buckle was highly prejudicial and \ninflammatory were \u201cevidentiary issues that could have been handled on direct appeal, \nbecause they are based solely on the record of the trial itself.\u201d \n{\u00b6 24} Further, the state argued, Boaston\u2019s claims related to Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s \ntestimony failed on their merits.  The state said that Boaston was not prejudiced by the \nreport he received from Dr. Scala-Barnett because \u201cCrim. Rule 16(K) allows some  12. \nflexibility in determining what constitutes a report[,]\u201d and Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s autopsy \nreport that noted the amount and appearance of Brandi\u2019s stomach contents and included a \npicture comparing the glove buckle to the abrasion on her chin fit within the rule\u2019s \ndefinition of a \u201creport.\u201d  Beyond that, trial counsel had actual knowledge of Dr. Scala-\nBarnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion because he discussed it with her 19 days before trial and \ndid not seek a continuance to secure expert testimony to counter her opinion. \n{\u00b6 25} Regarding Boaston\u2019s claim that the state committed a Brady violation by \nfailing to disclose Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion, \nthe state argued that these opinions did not fall within the scope of Brady because \nBoaston failed to show that the state withheld the evidence, Boaston was ignorant of the \nevidence, or the evidence was material (i.e., reasonably probable to change the outcome \nof the proceeding) and exculpatory (i.e., favorable to Boaston). \n{\u00b6 26} Next, the state argued that Boaston could not prove that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective because counsel\u2019s decision not to call an expert to counter Dr. Scala-\nBarnett\u2019s testimony was strategic, and Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion was not \nso scientifically questionable that it required a Daubert hearing, counsel\u2019s decision to rely \non cross-examination was a \u201csensible trial tactic,\u201d and Boaston could not show that \nrequesting a Daubert hearing would have resulted in the exclusion of Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s \ntime-of-death opinion or changed the outcome of the trial. \n{\u00b6 27} As to Gast\u2019s cell tower testimony, the state argued that Boaston also raised \nthis issue in his direct appeal, so it was barred by res judicata, and that trial counsel\u2019s  13. \ndecision to cross-examine Gast rather than calling an expert to rebut the cell tower \ntestimony was trial strategy, not ineffective assistance. \n{\u00b6 28} Regarding the additional DNA evidence on Brandi\u2019s pants, the state argued \nthat Boaston failed to submit his request for additional DNA testing on a separate form, \nas required by R.C. 2953.73, he was not eligible for retesting under R.C. 2953.72(A)(6) \nbecause his DNA was included in the original test results, and he could not show that he \neither (1) did not have a DNA test taken at the trial stage or (2) did have a DNA test taken \nat the trial stage, but the test was not definitive and exclusion of his DNA would be \noutcome determinative, as required by R.C. 2953.74(B). \n{\u00b6 29} Finally, the state argued that Boaston was not entitled to court-appointed \nexperts in a postconviction relief proceeding because the postconviction relief statutes, \nR.C. 2953.21 to 2953.23, provide the exclusive postconviction remedies to which an \noffender is entitled, and court appointment of expert witnesses is not one of them. \n{\u00b6 30} Boaston did not file a response to the state\u2019s motion. \n{\u00b6 31} On October 16, 2017, without holding a hearing, the trial court issued its \ndecision granting the state\u2019s motion to dismiss and denying Boaston\u2019s postconviction \nrelief petition and request for appointment of expert witnesses.1 \n                                              \n1 Although the trial court\u2019s judgment entry says that the state\u2019s \u201cMotion to \nDismiss/Motion for Summary Judgment is found well-taken and GRANTED[,]\u201d the \ncourt\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law make clear that it dismissed Boaston\u2019s \npetition on its face in accordance with R.C. 2953.21(C), (E), and (G).  14. \n{\u00b6 32} First, the court found that Boaston\u2019s postconviction relief petition failed to \npresent any substantive grounds for relief and \n[r]ather than present substantive evidence, demonstrating operative facts \nthat establish grounds for relief, [Boaston] proffered only his \npostconviction counsel\u2019s opinions regarding the evidence admitted at trial \nand trial counsel\u2019s decisions and trial strategy, with \u201cexpert\u201d hearsay that \noffers no actual opinion.  Even if the Court treated the hearsay statements \nas true, therefore, there is no cogent evidence contained within those \nstatements demonstrating any basis for relief. \nThe court also found that Hanudel\u2019s summary of trial counsel\u2019s work did not rise to a \nlevel \u201cdemonstrating a constitutional violation meriting postconviction relief.\u201d \n{\u00b6 33} Next, the court agreed with the state that the grounds for relief that Boaston \nraised in his postconviction relief petition were barred by res judicata.  The court noted \nthat Boaston\u2019s postconviction relief claims were identical to the claims that he raised in \nhis direct appeal and he was unable to avoid the res judicata bar by bringing to the court\u2019s \nattention evidence dehors the record because he \u201cproffered no new, competent, relevant \nand material evidence, relying only on hearsay that\u2014even if treated as true statements\u2014\nprovide no evidence of facts demonstrating any substantive grounds for relief.\u201d \n{\u00b6 34} Regarding Boaston\u2019s claim that the state committed a Brady violation by \nfailing to timely disclose Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle \nopinion in a written expert report, the trial court found that Boaston knew about Dr.  15. \nScala-Barnett\u2019s opinions before trial\u2014despite the state\u2019s failure to provide a written \nreport\u2014and had \u201cfailed to identify evidence that was actually withheld in violation of his \nconstitutional rights * * *.\u201d  And, even assuming that the late disclosure of Dr. Scala-\nBarnett\u2019s opinions constituted the withholding or suppression of evidence, Boaston failed \nto show that the evidence was material and exculpatory. \n{\u00b6 35} As to Boaston\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the trial court \nfound that he had failed to present sufficient operative facts demonstrating trial counsel\u2019s \nlack of competence and resulting prejudice to Boaston; the facts that Boaston had \npresented showed that Hanudel disagreed with trial counsel\u2019s trial strategy, not that trial \ncounsel provided ineffective assistance.  Moreover, Boaston could have argued his \nineffective assistance claims in his direct appeal, so they were barred by res judicata. \n{\u00b6 36} The trial court also agreed with the state that Boaston had failed to follow \nthe statutory application procedure in R.C. 2953.72 regarding post-trial DNA testing, so it \nwas not required to entertain his request for additional testing of the unknown male DNA \non Brandi\u2019s pants.  Regardless, Boaston could not show that he met the statutory criteria \nfor post-trial DNA testing in R.C. 2953.73 to 2953.81, so the court was required to deny \nhis request. \n{\u00b6 37} Finally, the court found that Boaston was not entitled to funds for court-\nappointed experts to assist with his postconviction relief proceedings because the \npostconviction relief statutes do not permit discovery unless the petition and supporting \nevidence demonstrate substantive grounds for relief.  As the court had already determined  16. \nthat Boaston\u2019s petition and supporting evidence did not demonstrate substantive grounds \nfor relief, he was not entitled to funds to retain experts. \n{\u00b6 38} Boaston now appeals, raising two assignments of error: \n1.  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DISMISSING \nAPPELLANT\u2019S POST-CONVICTION RELIEF PETITION WITHOUT \nHOLDING AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING. \n2.  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY NOT ALLOWING COURT-\nAPPOINTED EXPERT WITNESS FEES FOR APPELLANT TO HIRE \nEXPERTS WHO WOULD HAVE HELPED HIM FULLY DEVELOP HIS \nCLAIM FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF. \nII.  Law and Analysis \n \nA.  The postconviction relief statute and standard of review. \n \n{\u00b6 39} A petition for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21 is the exclusive \nmethod by which an offender can raise collateral challenges to the validity of his \nconviction or sentence.  R.C. 2953.21(J).2  The basis for the petition must be \u201csuch a \ndenial or infringement of the person\u2019s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable \n                                              \n2 After Boaston filed his petition in February 2017, R.C. 2953.21 was amended to include \nprovisions regarding postconviction discovery in cases where the petitioner was \nsentenced to death.  See 2016 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 139, effective April 6, 2017.  Although \nthe amendment did not make any substantive changes to the provisions affecting \nBoaston, it did change the lettering of some of the sections applicable in this case.  For \nclarity, all of our citations to R.C. 2953.21 refer to the prior version of the statute that was \nin effect when Boaston filed his petition and applies to his case.  See 2014 Sub.H.B. No. \n663.   17. \nunder the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States * * *.\u201d  R.C. \n2953.21(A)(1)(a).  Under R.C. 2953.21(C), the trial court is required to determine \nwhether the petition presents substantive grounds for relief before granting a hearing.  In \ndoing so, the court shall consider the petition and any supporting affidavits and \ndocumentary evidence, along with \u201call the files and records pertaining to the proceedings \nagainst the petitioner * * *.\u201d  Id.  To be entitled to a hearing, the petitioner must set forth \n\u201csufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.\u201d  State v. Calhoun, \n86 Ohio St.3d 279, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999), paragraph two of the syllabus.  The court is \nrequired to \u201cproceed to a prompt hearing on the issues * * *\u201d unless the petition and the \nrecord show that the petitioner is not entitled to relief.  R.C.  2953.21(E).  If the trial court \ndoes not find grounds for granting relief, it is required to deny the petition.  R.C. \n2953.21(G). \n{\u00b6 40} The parties dispute the appropriate standard of review.  Boaston argues \nthat, because postconviction relief proceedings are civil proceedings collateral to the \nunderlying criminal conviction and the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his petition on its face is \nakin to a dismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), we should review the trial court\u2019s decision \nde novo, as we would a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) dismissal.  He claims that our past reliance on \nState v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, for the abuse-of-\ndiscretion standard in postconviction relief cases is misplaced\u2014at least in cases where \nthe trial court denies a petition without a hearing\u2014because Gondor was decided after the \ntrial court held an evidentiary hearing and \u201c[i]t makes sense that abuse of discretion  18. \nwould only apply when there has been a hearing so that the appellate court provides \ndeference to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and does not substitute its judgment for that \nof the trial court after taking testimony and evidence in a hearing.\u201d  He did not cite to any \ncases involving postconviction relief petitions to support his argument. \n{\u00b6 41} The state, on the other hand, argues that the Ohio Supreme Court has firmly \nestablished that we are to review the trial court\u2019s dismissal of a postconviction relief \npetition on its face for an abuse of discretion.  In support of its argument, the state cites to \nCalhoun.  In that case\u2014which involved a postconviction relief petition that the trial court \ndenied without a hearing\u2014the Supreme Court held that a trial court reviewing a \npostconviction relief petition that includes affidavits \u201cshould give due deference to \naffidavits sworn to under oath and filed in support of the petition, but may, in the sound \nexercise of discretion, judge their credibility in determining whether to accept the \naffidavits as true statements of fact.  To hold otherwise would require a hearing for every \npostconviction relief petition.\u201d  (Emphasis added.)  Id. at 284.  The court also noted that \nthe postconviction relief statute \u201cclearly calls for discretion in determining whether to \ngrant a hearing * * *.\u201d  Id.  The court concluded by saying that its decision \u201csimply \naffirm[ed] the trial court\u2019s discretion to judge the credibility of the petitions in order to \ndiscard frivolous claims.\u201d  Id. at 292. \n{\u00b6 42} Later, in Gondor, the Supreme Court acknowledged the trial court\u2019s \n\u201cgatekeeping role\u201d in determining whether a petitioner will receive a hearing on his \npostconviction relief petition.  Gondor at \u00b6 51.  The court reiterated that it   19. \ndetermined in Calhoun that the trial court\u2019s gatekeeping function in the \npostconviction relief process is entitled to deference, including the court\u2019s \ndecision regarding the sufficiency of the facts set forth by the petitioner and \nthe credibility of the affidavits submitted.  We established in Calhoun that a \ncourt reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision in regard to its gatekeeping \nfunction should apply an abuse-of-discretion standard.  (Emphasis added.)  \nGondor at \u00b6 52. \nThe court determined that the \u201cconsistent approach\u201d was granting the trial court the same \nlevel of deference\u2014i.e., abuse-of-discretion review\u2014post-hearing.  Id. \n{\u00b6 43} Because the court determined that the same level of review applied to the \ntrial court\u2019s decision to dismiss a petition summarily or after an evidentiary hearing, we \nbelieve that the holding in Gondor is applicable here.  That is, \u201ca trial court\u2019s decision \ngranting or denying a postconviction petition filed pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 should be \nupheld absent an abuse of discretion; a reviewing court should not overrule the trial \ncourt\u2019s finding on a petition for postconviction relief that is supported by competent and \ncredible evidence.\u201d  Id. at \u00b6 58. \n{\u00b6 44} However, there is an exception to this rule when the court summarily \ndismisses a postconviction relief petition on purely legal grounds (such as lack of subject-\nmatter jurisdiction or res judicata).  We review those grounds for dismissal de novo.  \nState v. Osley, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-17-1164, 2017-Ohio-8673, \u00b6 8, citing State v. Willis, \n2016-Ohio-335, 58 N.E.3d 515, \u00b6 7 (6th Dist.).   20. \nB.  The trial court properly denied Boaston\u2019s petition without a hearing. \n \n{\u00b6 45} In his first assignment of error, Boaston argues that the trial court erred by \ndismissing his postconviction relief petition without holding an evidentiary hearing \nbecause the state committed a Brady violation by failing to provide a written report of Dr. \nScala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion before trial and he \nreceived ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to appropriately \nrespond to being \u201cambushed\u201d by Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s unwritten opinions and did not call \nan expert to contradict Gast\u2019s cell tower testimony.  He argues that his claims are not \nbarred by res judicata because they rely on evidence outside of the record, and that his \npetition \u201cclearly contained enough factual matter challenging the State\u2019s key evidence \nand demonstrating the constitutional violations suffered by Boaston in how that evidence \nwas presented.\u201d  Ultimately, he contends, his petition \u201cwas not so meritless to warrant \ndismissing it without a full evidentiary hearing to test the ultimate substance to [his] \nclaims.\u201d \n{\u00b6 46} In response, the state argues that (1) the hearsay statements in Hanudel\u2019s \naffidavit did not provide the operative facts necessary to support the petition; (2) the trial \ncourt correctly determined that Boaston\u2019s claims related to Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s and Gast\u2019s \ntestimony were barred by res judicata because he raised the same issues in his direct \nappeal; (3) Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion did not \nmeet the three-part test required to show a meritorious Brady claim; and (4) Boaston \ncould not show that his trial counsel was ineffective because deciding not to call experts  21. \nto rebut Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s and Gast\u2019s testimony was trial strategy and not requesting a \nDaubert hearing, alone, does not prove ineffective assistance. \n{\u00b6 47} We will address each issue in turn. \n1.  Boaston\u2019s claimed Brady violation is barred by res judicata. \n \n{\u00b6 48} Boaston first argues that his right to due process was violated when the \nstate failed to disclose Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion.  Because he could have \nraised this issue in his direct appeal, we find that it is barred by res judicata. \n{\u00b6 49} The doctrine of res judicata prevents a convicted defendant who was \nrepresented by counsel from raising in any proceeding except an appeal from his \nconviction any defense or claimed lack of due process that he raised or could have raised \nat the trial that resulted in his conviction or on the appeal from the judgment of \nconviction.  State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph nine of \nthe syllabus.  Res judicata applies in postconviction relief proceedings and bars any \nissues that were or could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal.  State v. Heiney, 6th \nDist. Lucas No. L-19-1115, 2020-Ohio-2761, \u00b6 21.  A petitioner can avoid the \napplication of res judicata if he provides new competent, relevant, and material evidence \nfrom outside of the record to support his claims.  State v. Redd, 6th Dist. Lucas No.  \nL-00-1148, 2001 WL 1001182, *1 (Aug. 31, 2001), citing State v. Smith, 17 Ohio St.3d \n98, 477 N.E.2d 1128 (1985).  However, this \u201cevidence dehors the record\u201d cannot be \nsomething that existed and was available for use at the time of trial.  Id.  22. \n{\u00b6 50} Here, Boaston and his trial counsel clearly knew about the state\u2019s belated \ndisclosure of Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion (and \nthe state\u2019s complete failure to provide Boaston with a written report of those opinions, as \nrequired by Crim.R. 16(K)) at the time of trial.  But Boaston did not pursue the issue of a \nBrady violation in his direct appeal,3 and his postconviction relief petition did not include \nany new evidence outside of the record related to the alleged Brady violation.  Therefore, \nhis Brady claim is precluded by res judicata.  We find that this argument is without merit. \n2.  Boaston\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is barred by res judicata. \n \n{\u00b6 51} Boaston\u2019s second claim is that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance \nby failing to call experts to rebut Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s and Gast\u2019s testimony and failing to \nrequest that the trial court conduct a Daubert hearing to require Dr. Scala-Barnett to \njustify her time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion.  He argues that his \nineffective assistance claims are not barred by res judicata because they depend on \nevidence outside of the record.  He also contends that a trial court must presume that the \nfactual allegations in a postconviction relief petition and any accompanying affidavits are \ntrue when determining whether to hold a hearing\u2014which the trial court did not do in this \ncase\u2014and, when viewed in that light, his petition at least warranted an evidentiary \nhearing.  \n                                              \n3 In his direct appeal, Boaston mentioned in passing that the state committed a Brady \nviolation by failing to provide Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s opinions in writing because trial \ncounsel did not know how to begin to challenge the scientific validity of her conclusions, \nbut he did not fully develop the argument, and we did not address Brady in our decision.  23. \n{\u00b6 52} Initially, we note that Boaston\u2019s contention that the trial court is required to \npresume the truth of the factual allegations in the petition and any accompanying \naffidavits is incorrect.  In Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d at 284, 714 N.E.2d 905, the Supreme \nCourt specifically held that trial courts have the discretion to judge the credibility of \naffidavits submitted in support of postconviction relief petitions and do not have to accept \nthe factual allegations in them as true.  As the court stated, \u201c[t]o hold otherwise would \nrequire a hearing for every postconviction relief petition.\u201d  Id. \n{\u00b6 53} Turning to the merits of this argument, to prevail on a claim of ineffective \nassistance of counsel, the petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the \nproper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial court cannot be relied on as \nhaving produced a just result.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. \n2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).

Indeed, \u201cthe failure to call an \nexpert and instead rely on cross-examination does not constitute ineffective assistance of \ncounsel.\u201d  State v.

Thompson, 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 10-11, 514 N.E.2d 407 (1987). \n{\u00b6 57} In its decision, the trial court found that Boaston\u2019s ineffective assistance \nclaim was barred by res judicata because he raised an ineffective assistance claim in his \ndirect appeal and the only evidence regarding trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness that he  25. \npresented with his postconviction relief petition was Hanudel\u2019s affidavit \u201cdemonstrating \nonly disagreement with trial counsel\u2019s strategy and tactics.\u201d  Boaston argues that the \ninformation in Hanudel\u2019s affidavit\u2014including his discussions with trial counsel and his \nconsultations with experts\u2014is evidence outside of the record that precludes the \napplication of res judicata to his ineffective assistance claim. \n{\u00b6 58} While we agree with Boaston that the information in Hanudel\u2019s affidavit is \ninformation that was not available for review in his direct appeal, we find that it is not \nsufficient to overcome the res judicata bar.  This is because merely attaching evidence \ndehors the record to the petition will not guarantee a postconviction relief hearing.  \nHeiney at \u00b6 24.  Rather, the evidence \u201c\u2018must meet some threshold standard of cogency\u2019 to \nadvance the petitioner\u2019s claim beyond mere hypothesis.\u201d  State v. Brown, 6th Dist. Lucas \nNo. L-99-1251, 2000 WL 20557, *3 (Jan. 14, 2000), quoting State v. Lawson, 103 Ohio \nApp.3d 307, 315, 659 N.E.2d 362 (12th Dist.1995). \n{\u00b6 59} In his affidavit, Hanudel outlines his post-trial conversations with trial \ncounsel, which show that trial counsel made certain tactical decisions that Hanudel might \nnot agree with (such as choosing to cross-examine Dr. Scala-Barnett rather than \nrequesting a continuance to try to find an expert to testify or filing a pretrial motion to \nhave her time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion excluded, and choosing not to \npresent the cell tower tracking data expert because he did not believe the expert would be \nhelpful), but that do not fall below an objective standard of reasonable representation.  \nThe trial court was within its discretion to find that Hanudel\u2019s hearsay statements  26. \nregarding trial counsel\u2019s representation of Boaston and conversations with potential \nexpert witnesses did not rise to the required \u201c\u2018threshold standard of cogency\u2019 to advance \nthe petitioner\u2019s claim beyond mere hypothesis.\u201d  Brown at *3, quoting Lawson at 315.  \nAccordingly, we find that the trial court did not err by finding Boaston\u2019s ineffective \nassistance claim barred by res judicata. \n{\u00b6 60} Additionally, we note, as the Supreme Court did, that there is substantial \nevidence in the record\u2014apart from the testimony that Boaston contends was admitted \nbecause of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness\u2014that supported a finding that Boaston was \nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Boaston, 160 Ohio St.3d 46, 2020-Ohio-1061, 153 \nN.E.3d 44, at \u00b6 65-70. \n{\u00b6 61} Because both of Boaston\u2019s constitutional claims are barred by res judicata, \nwe find that the trial court did not err by denying the postconviction relief petition \nwithout a hearing.  Accordingly, his first assignment of error is not well-taken. \nC.  Boaston\u2019s request for expert funds is moot. \n \n{\u00b6 62} In his second assignment of error, Boaston argues that the trial court erred \nby finding that he was not entitled to funds to hire court-appointed experts.  Because we \nhave determined that the court did not err in denying the postconviction relief petition, \nwe find that the issue of funds to hire experts is moot.  Boaston\u2019s second assignment of \nerror is not well-taken. \n   27. \nIII.  Conclusion \n \n{\u00b6 63} The October 16, 2017 judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common \nPleas is affirmed.

For the following reasons, we affirm.\nI. Background and Facts\n\n\u00b6 2 In 2015, Boaston was convicted of murdering his ex-wife, Brandi Gonyer-Boaston. On appeal, he argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in (1) allowing the deputy coroner who conducted the autopsy, Dr. Diane Scala-Barnett, to testify regarding Brandi\u2019s time of death based on her stomach contents (the \u201ctime-of-death opinion\u201d) and that an abrasion on Brandi\u2019s chin was consistent with the pattern, shape, and texture of a buckle and some Velcro on one of Boaston\u2019s gloves (the \u201cglove-buckle opinion\u201d) because these opinions were not in Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s written expert report, as required by Crim.R. 16(K), and (2) permitting a Toledo Police Department detective, Jay Gast, to testify regarding cellphone tower tracking without establishing the scientific validity of such evidence. See State v. Boaston, 2017-Ohio-8770, 100 N.E.3d 1002 (6th Dist.). We determined that (1) Boaston waived the Crim.R. 16(K) issue by failing to raise it before trial because defense counsel knew that Dr. Scala-Barnett planned to testify about Brandi\u2019s time of death based on her stomach contents and to opine on the similarity of the abrasion and the glove buckle, but did not move to exclude Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s testimony until after the jury was empaneled; (2) Boaston did not raise concerns about the validity of the cellphone tower tracking evidence at trial, so he waived all but plain error regarding that issue; and (3) it was not plain error for the trial court to accept testimony about cellphone tower tracking from a detective without conducting a hearing regarding the testimony\u2019s scientific reliability. Id. at \u00b6 49, 56, 62, 65-66.\nBoaston appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio, which accepted his appeal on the Crim.R. 16(K) issue and affirmed his conviction, albeit on different grounds. *State v. Boaston*, 160 Ohio St.3d 46, 2020-Ohio-1061, 153 N.E.3d 44. The court determined that Crim.R. 16(K) *required* the exclusion of Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion because they were not included in her written report, and that the trial court erred in allowing her to testify regarding these matters. *Id.* at \u00b6 55-59. However, the court also concluded that the error was harmless because Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s opinions were \u201cnot essential to the state\u2019s prosecution of the charged crimes\u201d and \u201cdid little more than connect dots that were all too readily apparent.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 64. Moreover, the court found that \u201ceven without the deputy coroner\u2019s opinion testimony on Brandi\u2019s time of death and the glove-buckle comparison, the remaining evidence overwhelmingly establishes Boaston\u2019s guilt beyond any reasonable doubt.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 65. The court cataloged the record evidence of Boaston\u2019s jealousy, controlling behavior, installation of spyware on Brandi\u2019s phones, his \u201ctumultuous\u201d relationship with Brandi, his refusal to accept Brandi\u2019s clear desire to leave the relationship and move out of their shared apartment, the steps he took in preparation of Brandi\u2019s murder (including making ATM withdrawals, putting gas in her vehicle, asking a friend for \u201cassistance \u2018to take care of business,\u2019\u201d and calling Brandi the morning of the murder to make sure that she came to the apartment when she got off of work), and the lack of activity on Boaston\u2019s cellphone during the timeframe when Brandi was likely murdered and transported to Fulton County. *Id.* at \u00b6 66-68.\nOn the whole, the Supreme Court said that it strains credulity to think that in the span of 46 minutes, Brandi left [Boaston\u2019s] residence, was abducted by an unidentified assailant who partially undressed and killed her, wrapped her in plastic, stashed her body along with her dry clothing and shoes in the rear of her vehicle, drove the SUV 20 miles away, abandoned it off the country road, and mysteriously disappeared without a trace. *Id.* at \u00b6 69.\n\nBecause all of this evidence established Boaston\u2019s guilt \u201cbeyond any reasonable doubt,\u201d the court found that he was not entitled to a new trial, despite the erroneous admission of Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s opinions. *Id.* at \u00b6 70.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not address the issue of Gast\u2019s opinion on cell tower tracking data.\n\nWhile his direct appeal was pending, Boaston filed the petition for postconviction relief underlying this appeal. In it, he raised three grounds for relief.\n\nFirst, Boaston claimed that the state violated *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by failing to disclose material evidence favorable to him when it presented Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion without Dr. Scala-Barnett including those opinions in her written report, as required by Crim.R. 16(K). He argued that his defense was prejudiced because it was \u201cimpossible\u201d for any expert hired by trial counsel \u201cto conduct a true expert analysis consisting of a scientific reasoning process * * *\u201d without knowing what Dr.\nScala-Barnett\u2019s \u201creasoning process\u201d was. He claimed that this resulted in him being \u201cambushed in trial,\u201d and that due process required that he be given an opportunity in a postconviction relief proceeding to have an expert pathologist review Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s conclusions.\n\n\u00b6 8 In support of this claim for relief, Boaston submitted the affidavit of his appellate attorney, Stephen Hanudel, who also represents Boaston in the postconviction relief proceedings. Hanudel averred that, based on his research, Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s \u201cconclusion as to Ms. Gonyer-Boaston\u2019s time of death based on the stomach contents may have lacked sufficient scientific basis and needs independent expert evaluation.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, Hanudel spoke to four forensic pathologists.\n\n\u00b6 9 One forensic pathologist told him that \u201cthe science behind using stomach contents to determine time of death is disputed and controversial within the medical and scientific community[,]\u201d but \u201cdid not express his personal position on the issue [and] was very careful to not come across as expressing any point of view that would indicate how he would feel about Dr. [Scala-]Barnett\u2019s conclusion, especially since he has not viewed the autopsy materials.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 10 The second \u201cquickly expressed the willingness to evaluate Dr. [Scala-]Barnett\u2019s conclusion[, but] did not specifically state his position on the issue.\u201d Hanudel\u2019s \u201cpersonal interpretation of his quick willingness to help as soon as I told him the issue was that the science is disputed and controversial.\u201d\nThe third did not want to be involved in the case because he knows Dr. Scala-Barnett personally, but, because he was not going to be involved, he \u201ctalked a little more freely and expressed reservations as to the scientific reliability behind using stomach contents to determine time of death. He seemed to think that the reliability varies from case to case based on the specific facts involved.\u201d\n\nThe final pathologist Hanudel spoke to also \u201cexpressed reservations about the scientific reliability behind using stomach contents to determine time of death.\u201d However, he ultimately \u201cdeclined to get involved in the case. He seemed very busy with other matters.\u201d\n\nAfter his conversations with these pathologists, Hanudel was convinced that Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s \u201cconclusions must be given a second look from an independent expert,\u201d and his \u201cimpression from all four is that Dr. [Scala-]Barnett may very well be wrong in her conclusion.\u201d\n\nBoaston\u2019s second claim for relief in his postconviction relief petition alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because, although trial counsel consulted with experts in forensic pathology and cell tower tracking, he did not use those experts at trial. Boaston argues in his petition that, although trial counsel did not have a written report from Dr. Scala-Barnett that his forensic pathologist could have used to formulate an opinion before trial, trial counsel could have, for example, had the forensic pathologist observe Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s testimony and then testify in response. Boaston also faults trial counsel for failing to ask for a hearing under Daubert v. Merrell Dow\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), to get Dr. Scala-Barnett to justify her opinions before being allowed to testify. He argued that \u201c[t]here was absolutely no sound strategy * * *\u201d involved in trial counsel\u2019s decision not to call the experts to testify in some capacity, but instead to only cross-examine the state\u2019s experts.\n\n{\u00b6 15} Although he stopped short of directly calling trial counsel ineffective, Hanudel provided more details about trial counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness in his affidavit. First, he said that trial counsel consulted with a forensic pathologist, Dr. Thomas Young, who issued a written opinion (about a month before Dr. Scala-Barnett told trial counsel about her time-of-death opinion) that questioned whether Brandi\u2019s death was caused by strangulation. Trial counsel then spoke to Dr. Young about Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion. He believed that \u201cthere were way too many variables in the digestive process to render a time-of-death conclusion\u201d based on stomach contents, but, according to Hanudel, \u201cit was impossible for Dr. Young to formally express an opinion on the issue\u201d without having a written opinion from Dr. Scala-Barnett that outlined her \u201cscientific reasoning process * * *.\u201d Because trial counsel felt that Dr. Young\u2019s testimony \u201cwould amount to the same type of abstract conjecture as Dr. [Scala-]Barnett\u2019s[,]\u201d he opted to rebut Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s testimony through cross-examination. According to Hanudel, the lack of a written report from Dr. Scala-Barnett had a \u201cdirect impact\u201d on trial counsel\u2019s decision not to call Dr. Young to testify, and if counsel had been given a report \u201carticulating [Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s] findings, analysis, and\nconclusion * * *\u201d regarding Brandi\u2019s time of death, he \u201cwould have had Dr. Young review the report and then issue his own report. This then may have resulted in a different decision on whether to have Dr. Young testify, despite Dr. Young\u2019s admission to [trial counsel] that he tends not to come across well in testimony.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 16 Hanudel also averred that trial counsel consulted with Midwest Data Group regarding the cell tower tracking data, but did not receive an opinion letter from Midwest Data Group, so there is nothing in writing that contradicts Gast\u2019s trial testimony about \u201ccell tower sector pie slices.\u201d However, trial counsel spoke to someone at Midwest Data Group who \u201cfelt the cell tower sector pie slices are not perfectly even[,]\u201d but counsel chose not to present the expert at trial because \u201che did not feel the testimony would be of much assistance to Mr. Boaston since he felt he could sufficiently cover the issues in cross examination [sic].\u201d\n\n\u00b6 17 In preparing the postconviction relief petition, Hanudel contacted Larry Daniel who \u201chas testified over 45 times in state and federal courts as a computer technology expert, cellular phone forensics expert, GPS forensics expert, and cellular technology expert.\u201d Hanudel gathered from his conversation with Daniel that cell tower sectors do not necessarily create \u201ceven pie slices\u201d\u2014which is what Gast testified to at trial, and what the state relied on to show that Boaston was not at home the morning Brandi\u2019s body was found, like he said he was, because his phone contacted a different sector of the cell tower near his house. Instead, Daniel told Hanudel that \u201cthe science is much more complicated and that sector overlap can often occur[,]\u201d and, essentially, the\nfact that Boaston\u2019s phone contacted a different side of the cell tower \u201cmay not mean what\nthe State thinks it means.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 18 In his final claim for relief, Boaston argued that the DNA profile from an\nunknown male that was found on Brandi\u2019s pants should be tested because it could reveal\nthe identity of the real killer. In support, he pointed out that the other DNA profile on the\npants only showed that it was from a Boaston male and could not be linked to any\nspecific Boaston male\u2014i.e., it could have come from Boaston or one of his sons, who all\nsaw Brandi regularly. He argued that the only other evidence putting Boaston with\nBrandi at the time she died was \u201ca questionable opinion presented by Dr. [Scala-]Barnett\nthat is not well backed by science.\u201d He also points out that there were no signs of foul\nplay in Boaston\u2019s apartment, the cellphone tower tracking evidence showed that Boaston\nwas in Toledo at all relevant times, there was no evidence that Boaston was in Fulton\nCounty (where Brandi\u2019s body was found), there was no DNA on the glove buckle that\nDr. Scala-Barnett opined could have caused the abrasion on Brandi\u2019s chin, and the fact\nthat Brandi\u2019s hair was found in the Velcro on Boaston\u2019s glove \u201cmeans nothing because\nshe and Boaston saw each other every day.\u201d He concluded that \u201c[i]t is more than\nworthwhile to see if the unknown male DNA profile can be matched to anyone,\nespecially in the State\u2019s criminal DNA database.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 19 In his affidavit in support of Boaston\u2019s petition, however, Hanudel averred\nthat he had spoken to a forensic scientist at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation\n(\u201cBCI\u201d) about whether \u201cfurther testing could be done to determine the origin of the other\nmale DNA profile\u201d on Brandi\u2019s pants. The BCI analyst told him that \u201cbased on the nature of the [other male DNA] sample, it was not possible to make any such determination with further testing.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 20 In addition to these claims for relief, Boaston included a request for court-appointed expert witness fees in his postconviction relief petition. He argued that he needed expert assistance to develop his claims, but that he lacked the funds to hire them. In his affidavit, Hanudel said that he was privately retained by Boaston\u2019s family to represent Boaston in postconviction matters, but that the family \u201csimply does not have the funds to provide the up-front retainers the experts require and pay the potential total cost incurred by the experts.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 21 In response to Boaston\u2019s petition, the state filed a \u201cMOTION TO DISMISS/MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT * * *\u201d that also opposed Boaston\u2019s requests for additional DNA testing and funds for court-appointed experts. It argued that Boaston\u2019s claims for relief were barred by res judicata, his request for further DNA testing was undermined by Hanudel\u2019s admission that the BCI analyst told him that the source of the unknown DNA on Brandi\u2019s pants could not be determined, and Boaston was not entitled to court-appointed experts.\n\n\u00b6 22 Specifically, the state argued that Hanudel\u2019s affidavit did not support the petition because (1) it contained hearsay statements from experts, which, the state claimed, were entitled to little weight; (2) it contained extraneous and irrelevant information related to bite mark identification, which was not at issue in Boaston\u2019s case;\n(3) Hanudel\u2019s description of trial counsel\u2019s decisions related to the expert witnesses \u201cprovide[d] evidence of precisely the strategic calculus that trial attorneys are permitted (and expected) to make * * *\u201d; and (4) it acknowledged that \u201cfurther testing of the unknown male DNA profile on Brandi\u2019s pants would not lead to any determinative result.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6 23} Regardless, even assuming that Hanudel\u2019s affidavit did support Boaston\u2019s claims, the state argued that all of his claims related to Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s testimony and Gast\u2019s cell tower tracking data testimony were barred by res judicata because these claims were, or could have been, raised in Boaston\u2019s direct appeal, and did not fall into the exception to the res judicata bar for cases where the defendant presents new, competent, relevant, and material evidence from outside of the trial record. The state said that the issue of Dr. Scala-Barnett failing to include her time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion in her written report was raised by trial counsel and was \u201ccentral to his direct appeal.\u201d He also argued in his direct appeal that trial counsel was ineffective based on his handling of Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s trial testimony. The state further contended that Boaston\u2019s arguments that testimony about the glove buckle was highly prejudicial and inflammatory were \u201cevidentiary issues that could have been handled on direct appeal, because they are based solely on the record of the trial itself.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6 24} Further, the state argued, Boaston\u2019s claims related to Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s testimony failed on their merits. The state said that Boaston was not prejudiced by the report he received from Dr. Scala-Barnett because \u201cCrim. Rule 16(K) allows some\nflexibility in determining what constitutes a report[,]\u201d and Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s autopsy report that noted the amount and appearance of Brandi\u2019s stomach contents and included a picture comparing the glove buckle to the abrasion on her chin fit within the rule\u2019s definition of a \u201creport.\u201d Beyond that, trial counsel had actual knowledge of Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion because he discussed it with her 19 days before trial and did not seek a continuance to secure expert testimony to counter her opinion.\n\n{\u00b6 25} Regarding Boaston\u2019s claim that the state committed a Brady violation by failing to disclose Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion, the state argued that these opinions did not fall within the scope of Brady because Boaston failed to show that the state withheld the evidence, Boaston was ignorant of the evidence, or the evidence was material (i.e., reasonably probable to change the outcome of the proceeding) and exculpatory (i.e., favorable to Boaston).\n\n{\u00b6 26} Next, the state argued that Boaston could not prove that his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel\u2019s decision not to call an expert to counter Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s testimony was strategic, and Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion was not so scientifically questionable that it required a Daubert hearing, counsel\u2019s decision to rely on cross-examination was a \u201csensible trial tactic,\u201d and Boaston could not show that requesting a Daubert hearing would have resulted in the exclusion of Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion or changed the outcome of the trial.\n\n{\u00b6 27} As to Gast\u2019s cell tower testimony, the state argued that Boaston also raised this issue in his direct appeal, so it was barred by res judicata, and that trial counsel\u2019s\ndecision to cross-examine Gast rather than calling an expert to rebut the cell tower testimony was trial strategy, not ineffective assistance.\n\n{\u00b6 28} Regarding the additional DNA evidence on Brandi\u2019s pants, the state argued that Boaston failed to submit his request for additional DNA testing on a separate form, as required by R.C. 2953.73, he was not eligible for retesting under R.C. 2953.72(A)(6) because his DNA was included in the original test results, and he could not show that he either (1) did not have a DNA test taken at the trial stage or (2) did have a DNA test taken at the trial stage, but the test was not definitive and exclusion of his DNA would be outcome determinative, as required by R.C. 2953.74(B).\n\n{\u00b6 29} Finally, the state argued that Boaston was not entitled to court-appointed experts in a postconviction relief proceeding because the postconviction relief statutes, R.C. 2953.21 to 2953.23, provide the exclusive postconviction remedies to which an offender is entitled, and court appointment of expert witnesses is not one of them.\n\n{\u00b6 30} Boaston did not file a response to the state\u2019s motion.\n\n{\u00b6 31} On October 16, 2017, without holding a hearing, the trial court issued its decision granting the state\u2019s motion to dismiss and denying Boaston\u2019s postconviction relief petition and request for appointment of expert witnesses.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Although the trial court\u2019s judgment entry says that the state\u2019s \u201cMotion to Dismiss/Motion for Summary Judgment is found well-taken and GRANTED[,]\u201d the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law make clear that it dismissed Boaston\u2019s petition on its face in accordance with R.C. 2953.21(C), (E), and (G).\nFirst, the court found that Boaston\u2019s postconviction relief petition failed to present any substantive grounds for relief and rather than present substantive evidence, demonstrating operative facts that establish grounds for relief, [Boaston] proffered only his postconviction counsel\u2019s opinions regarding the evidence admitted at trial and trial counsel\u2019s decisions and trial strategy, with \u201cexpert\u201d hearsay that offers no actual opinion. Even if the Court treated the hearsay statements as true, therefore, there is no cogent evidence contained within those statements demonstrating any basis for relief.\n\nThe court also found that Hanudel\u2019s summary of trial counsel\u2019s work did not rise to a level \u201cdemonstrating a constitutional violation meriting postconviction relief.\u201d\n\nNext, the court agreed with the state that the grounds for relief that Boaston raised in his postconviction relief petition were barred by res judicata. The court noted that Boaston\u2019s postconviction relief claims were identical to the claims that he raised in his direct appeal and he was unable to avoid the res judicata bar by bringing to the court\u2019s attention evidence dehors the record because he \u201cproffered no new, competent, relevant and material evidence, relying only on hearsay that\u2014even if treated as true statements\u2014provide no evidence of facts demonstrating any substantive grounds for relief.\u201d\n\nRegarding Boaston\u2019s claim that the state committed a Brady violation by failing to timely disclose Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion in a written expert report, the trial court found that Boaston knew about Dr.\nScala-Barnett\u2019s opinions before trial\u2014despite the state\u2019s failure to provide a written report\u2014and had \u201cfailed to identify evidence that was actually withheld in violation of his constitutional rights * * *.\u201d And, even assuming that the late disclosure of Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s opinions constituted the withholding or suppression of evidence, Boaston failed to show that the evidence was material and exculpatory.\n\n\u00b6 35 As to Boaston\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the trial court found that he had failed to present sufficient operative facts demonstrating trial counsel\u2019s lack of competence and resulting prejudice to Boaston; the facts that Boaston had presented showed that Hanudel disagreed with trial counsel\u2019s trial strategy, not that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance. Moreover, Boaston could have argued his ineffective assistance claims in his direct appeal, so they were barred by res judicata.\n\n\u00b6 36 The trial court also agreed with the state that Boaston had failed to follow the statutory application procedure in R.C. 2953.72 regarding post-trial DNA testing, so it was not required to entertain his request for additional testing of the unknown male DNA on Brandi\u2019s pants. Regardless, Boaston could not show that he met the statutory criteria for post-trial DNA testing in R.C. 2953.73 to 2953.81, so the court was required to deny his request.\n\n\u00b6 37 Finally, the court found that Boaston was not entitled to funds for court-appointed experts to assist with his postconviction relief proceedings because the postconviction relief statutes do not permit discovery unless the petition and supporting evidence demonstrate substantive grounds for relief. As the court had already determined\nthat Boaston\u2019s petition and supporting evidence did not demonstrate substantive grounds for relief, he was not entitled to funds to retain experts.\n\n\u00b6 38 Boaston now appeals, raising two assignments of error:\n\n1. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DISMISSING APPELLANT\u2019S POST-CONVICTION RELIEF PETITION WITHOUT HOLDING AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING.\n\n2. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY NOT ALLOWING COURT-APPOINTED EXPERT WITNESS FEES FOR APPELLANT TO HIRE EXPERTS WHO WOULD HAVE HELPED HIM FULLY DEVELOP HIS CLAIM FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF.\n\nII. Law and Analysis\n\nA. The postconviction relief statute and standard of review.\n\n\u00b6 39 A petition for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21 is the exclusive method by which an offender can raise collateral challenges to the validity of his conviction or sentence. R.C. 2953.21(J). The basis for the petition must be \u201csuch a denial or infringement of the person\u2019s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable\n\n2 After Boaston filed his petition in February 2017, R.C. 2953.21 was amended to include provisions regarding postconviction discovery in cases where the petitioner was sentenced to death. See 2016 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 139, effective April 6, 2017. Although the amendment did not make any substantive changes to the provisions affecting Boaston, it did change the lettering of some of the sections applicable in this case. For clarity, all of our citations to R.C. 2953.21 refer to the prior version of the statute that was in effect when Boaston filed his petition and applies to his case. See 2014 Sub.H.B. No. 663.\nunder the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States * * *.\u201d R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a). Under R.C. 2953.21(C), the trial court is required to determine whether the petition presents substantive grounds for relief before granting a hearing. In doing so, the court shall consider the petition and any supporting affidavits and documentary evidence, along with \u201call the files and records pertaining to the proceedings against the petitioner * * *.\u201d Id. To be entitled to a hearing, the petitioner must set forth \u201csufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.\u201d State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999), paragraph two of the syllabus. The court is required to \u201cproceed to a prompt hearing on the issues * * *\u201d unless the petition and the record show that the petitioner is not entitled to relief. R.C. 2953.21(E). If the trial court does not find grounds for granting relief, it is required to deny the petition. R.C. 2953.21(G).\n\n\u00b6 40 The parties dispute the appropriate standard of review. Boaston argues that, because postconviction relief proceedings are civil proceedings collateral to the underlying criminal conviction and the trial court\u2019s dismissal of his petition on its face is akin to a dismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(6), we should review the trial court\u2019s decision de novo, as we would a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) dismissal. He claims that our past reliance on State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, for the abuse-of-discretion standard in postconviction relief cases is misplaced\u2014at least in cases where the trial court denies a petition without a hearing\u2014because Gondor was decided after the trial court held an evidentiary hearing and \u201c[i]t makes sense that abuse of discretion\nwould only apply when there has been a hearing so that the appellate court provides\ndeferece to the trial court\u2019s findings of fact and does not substitute its judgment for that\nof the trial court after taking testimony and evidence in a hearing.\u201d He did not cite to any\ncases involving postconviction relief petitions to support his argument.\n\n\u00b6 41 The state, on the other hand, argues that the Ohio Supreme Court has firmly\nestablished that we are to review the trial court\u2019s dismissal of a postconviction relief\npetition on its face for an abuse of discretion. In support of its argument, the state cites to\nCalhoun. In that case\u2014which involved a postconviction relief petition that the trial court\ndenied without a hearing\u2014the Supreme Court held that a trial court reviewing a\npostconviction relief petition that includes affidavits \u201cshould give due deference to\naffidavits sworn to under oath and filed in support of the petition, but may, in the sound\nexercise of discretion, judge their credibility in determining whether to accept the\naffidavits as true statements of fact. To hold otherwise would require a hearing for every\npostconviction relief petition.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 284. The court also noted that\nthe postconviction relief statute \u201cclearly calls for discretion in determining whether to\ngrant a hearing * * *.\u201d Id. The court concluded by saying that its decision \u201csimply\naffirm[ed] the trial court\u2019s discretion to judge the credibility of the petitions in order to\ndiscard frivolous claims.\u201d Id. at 292.\n\n\u00b6 42 Later, in Gondor, the Supreme Court acknowledged the trial court\u2019s\n\u201cgatekeeping role\u201d in determining whether a petitioner will receive a hearing on his\npostconviction relief petition. Gondor at \u00b6 51. The court reiterated that it\ndetermined in *Calhoun* that the trial court\u2019s gatekeeping function in the postconviction relief process is entitled to deference, including the court\u2019s decision regarding the sufficiency of the facts set forth by the petitioner and the credibility of the affidavits submitted. We established in *Calhoun* that a court reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision in regard to its gatekeeping function should apply an abuse-of-discretion standard. (Emphasis added.)\n\n*Gondor* at \u00b6 52.\n\nThe court determined that the \u201cconsistent approach\u201d was granting the trial court the same level of deference\u2014i.e., abuse-of-discretion review\u2014post-hearing. *Id.*\n\n{\u00b6 43} Because the court determined that the same level of review applied to the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss a petition summarily or after an evidentiary hearing, we believe that the holding in *Gondor* is applicable here. That is, \u201ca trial court\u2019s decision granting or denying a postconviction petition filed pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 should be upheld absent an abuse of discretion; a reviewing court should not overrule the trial court\u2019s finding on a petition for postconviction relief that is supported by competent and credible evidence.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 58.\n\n{\u00b6 44} However, there is an exception to this rule when the court summarily dismisses a postconviction relief petition on purely legal grounds (such as lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or res judicata). We review those grounds for dismissal de novo. *State v. Osley*, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-17-1164, 2017-Ohio-8673, \u00b6 8, citing *State v. Willis*, 2016-Ohio-335, 58 N.E.3d 515, \u00b6 7 (6th Dist.).\nB. The trial court properly denied Boaston\u2019s petition without a hearing.\n\n\u00b6 45 In his first assignment of error, Boaston argues that the trial court erred by dismissing his postconviction relief petition without holding an evidentiary hearing because the state committed a *Brady* violation by failing to provide a written report of Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion before trial and he received ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to appropriately respond to being \u201cambushed\u201d by Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s unwritten opinions and did not call an expert to contradict Gast\u2019s cell tower testimony. He argues that his claims are not barred by res judicata because they rely on evidence outside of the record, and that his petition \u201cclearly contained enough factual matter challenging the State\u2019s key evidence and demonstrating the constitutional violations suffered by Boaston in how that evidence was presented.\u201d Ultimately, he contends, his petition \u201cwas not so meritless to warrant dismissing it without a full evidentiary hearing to test the ultimate substance to [his] claims.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 46 In response, the state argues that (1) the hearsay statements in Hanudel\u2019s affidavit did not provide the operative facts necessary to support the petition; (2) the trial court correctly determined that Boaston\u2019s claims related to Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s and Gast\u2019s testimony were barred by res judicata because he raised the same issues in his direct appeal; (3) Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion did not meet the three-part test required to show a meritorious *Brady* claim; and (4) Boaston could not show that his trial counsel was ineffective because deciding not to call experts\nto rebut Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s and Gast\u2019s testimony was trial strategy and not requesting a\n*Daubert* hearing, alone, does not prove ineffective assistance.\n\n{\u00b6 47} We will address each issue in turn.\n\n1. **Boaston\u2019s claimed *Brady* violation is barred by res judicata.**\n\n{\u00b6 48} Boaston first argues that his right to due process was violated when the\nstate failed to disclose Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion. Because he could have\nraised this issue in his direct appeal, we find that it is barred by res judicata.\n\n{\u00b6 49} The doctrine of res judicata prevents a convicted defendant who was\nrepresented by counsel from raising in any proceeding except an appeal from his\nconviction any defense or claimed lack of due process that he raised or could have raised\nat the trial that resulted in his conviction or on the appeal from the judgment of\nconviction. *State v. Perry*, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph nine of\nthe syllabus. Res judicata applies in postconviction relief proceedings and bars any\nissues that were or could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal. *State v. Heiney*, 6th\nDist. Lucas No. L-19-1115, 2020-Ohio-2761, \u00b6 21. A petitioner can avoid the\napplication of res judicata if he provides new competent, relevant, and material evidence\nfrom outside of the record to support his claims. *State v. Redd*, 6th Dist. Lucas No.\nL-00-1148, 2001 WL 1001182, *1 (Aug. 31, 2001), citing *State v. Smith*, 17 Ohio St.3d\n98, 477 N.E.2d 1128 (1985). However, this \u201cevidence dehors the record\u201d cannot be\nsomething that existed and was available for use at the time of trial. *Id.*\nHere, Boaston and his trial counsel clearly knew about the state\u2019s belated disclosure of Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion (and the state\u2019s complete failure to provide Boaston with a written report of those opinions, as required by Crim.R. 16(K)) at the time of trial. But Boaston did not pursue the issue of a Brady violation in his direct appeal, and his postconviction relief petition did not include any new evidence outside of the record related to the alleged Brady violation. Therefore, his Brady claim is precluded by res judicata. We find that this argument is without merit.\n\n2. Boaston\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is barred by res judicata.\n\nBoaston\u2019s second claim is that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to call experts to rebut Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s and Gast\u2019s testimony and failing to request that the trial court conduct a Daubert hearing to require Dr. Scala-Barnett to justify her time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion. He argues that his ineffective assistance claims are not barred by res judicata because they depend on evidence outside of the record. He also contends that a trial court must presume that the factual allegations in a postconviction relief petition and any accompanying affidavits are true when determining whether to hold a hearing\u2014which the trial court did not do in this case\u2014and, when viewed in that light, his petition at least warranted an evidentiary hearing.\n\n---\n\n3 In his direct appeal, Boaston mentioned in passing that the state committed a Brady violation by failing to provide Dr. Scala-Barnett\u2019s opinions in writing because trial counsel did not know how to begin to challenge the scientific validity of her conclusions, but he did not fully develop the argument, and we did not address Brady in our decision.\nInitially, we note that Boaston\u2019s contention that the trial court is required to presume the truth of the factual allegations in the petition and any accompanying affidavits is incorrect. In *Calhoun*, 86 Ohio St.3d at 284, 714 N.E.2d 905, the Supreme Court specifically held that trial courts have the discretion to judge the credibility of affidavits submitted in support of postconviction relief petitions and do not have to accept the factual allegations in them as true. As the court stated, \u201c[t]o hold otherwise would require a hearing for every postconviction relief petition.\u201d *Id.*\n\nTurning to the merits of this argument, to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial court cannot be relied on as having produced a just result. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Properly licensed Ohio lawyers are presumed to be competent, *Gondor*, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, at \u00b6 62, and there are \u201ccountless\u201d ways for an attorney to provide effective assistance in a case, so \u201c\u2018[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.\u2019\u201d *State v. Bradley*, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 142, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), quoting *Strickland* at 689. \u201c[E]ffective assistance of counsel does not equate with a winning defense strategy * * *.\u201d *State v. Strickland*, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-01-033, 2003-Ohio-491, \u00b6 16.\n\nTo establish ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner must show \u201c(1) deficient performance of counsel, i.e., performance falling below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability\nthat, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been different.\u201d State v. Hale, 119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 204. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d State v. Sanders, 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151, 761 N.E.2d 18 (2002), quoting Strickland at 694.\n\n\u00b6 55 Counsel is \u201cstrongly presumed\u201d to have rendered adequate assistance and \u201cthe defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u2018might be considered sound trial strategy.\u2019\u201d Smith, 17 Ohio St.3d at 100, 477 N.E.2d 1128, quoting Strickland at 694-695. Generally, trial strategy and tactical decisions\u2014even debatable ones\u2014cannot form the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Grissom, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-08-008, 2009-Ohio-2603, \u00b6 22.\n\n\u00b6 56 The decision of whether or not to call an expert is generally considered a matter of trial strategy. Heiney, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-19-1115, 2020-Ohio-2761, at \u00b6 29, citing State v. Teets, 4th Dist. Pickaway No. 17CA21, 2018-Ohio-5019, \u00b6 42; and State v. Coleman, 45 Ohio St.3d 298, 308, 544 N.E.2d 622 (1989). Indeed, \u201cthe failure to call an expert and instead rely on cross-examination does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d State v. Nicholas, 66 Ohio St.3d 431, 436, 613 N.E.2d 225 (1993), citing State v. Thompson, 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 10-11, 514 N.E.2d 407 (1987).\n\n\u00b6 57 In its decision, the trial court found that Boaston\u2019s ineffective assistance claim was barred by res judicata because he raised an ineffective assistance claim in his direct appeal and the only evidence regarding trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness that he\npresented with his postconviction relief petition was Hanudel\u2019s affidavit \u201cdemonstrating only disagreement with trial counsel\u2019s strategy and tactics.\u201d Boaston argues that the information in Hanudel\u2019s affidavit\u2014including his discussions with trial counsel and his consultations with experts\u2014is evidence outside of the record that precludes the application of res judicata to his ineffective assistance claim.\n\n{\u00b6 58} While we agree with Boaston that the information in Hanudel\u2019s affidavit is information that was not available for review in his direct appeal, we find that it is not sufficient to overcome the res judicata bar. This is because merely attaching evidence dehors the record to the petition will not guarantee a postconviction relief hearing. Heiney at \u00b6 24. Rather, the evidence \u201c\u2018must meet some threshold standard of cogency\u2019 to advance the petitioner\u2019s claim beyond mere hypothesis.\u201d State v. Brown, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-99-1251, 2000 WL 20557, *3 (Jan. 14, 2000), quoting State v. Lawson, 103 Ohio App.3d 307, 315, 659 N.E.2d 362 (12th Dist.1995).\n\n{\u00b6 59} In his affidavit, Hanudel outlines his post-trial conversations with trial counsel, which show that trial counsel made certain tactical decisions that Hanudel might not agree with (such as choosing to cross-examine Dr. Scala-Barnett rather than requesting a continuance to try to find an expert to testify or filing a pretrial motion to have her time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion excluded, and choosing not to present the cell tower tracking data expert because he did not believe the expert would be helpful), but that do not fall below an objective standard of reasonable representation. The trial court was within its discretion to find that Hanudel\u2019s hearsay statements\nregarding trial counsel\u2019s representation of Boaston and conversations with potential expert witnesses did not rise to the required \u201c\u2018threshold standard of cogency\u2019 to advance the petitioner\u2019s claim beyond mere hypothesis.\u201d Brown at *3, quoting Lawson at 315. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not err by finding Boaston\u2019s ineffective assistance claim barred by res judicata.\n\n\u00b6 60 Additionally, we note, as the Supreme Court did, that there is substantial evidence in the record\u2014apart from the testimony that Boaston contends was admitted because of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness\u2014that supported a finding that Boaston was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See Boaston, 160 Ohio St.3d 46, 2020-Ohio-1061, 153 N.E.3d 44, at \u00b6 65-70.\n\n\u00b6 61 Because both of Boaston\u2019s constitutional claims are barred by res judicata, we find that the trial court did not err by denying the postconviction relief petition without a hearing. Accordingly, his first assignment of error is not well-taken.\n\nC. Boaston\u2019s request for expert funds is moot.\n\n\u00b6 62 In his second assignment of error, Boaston argues that the trial court erred by finding that he was not entitled to funds to hire court-appointed experts. Because we have determined that the court did not err in denying the postconviction relief petition, we find that the issue of funds to hire experts is moot. Boaston\u2019s second assignment of error is not well-taken.\nIII. Conclusion\n\n\u00b6 63 The October 16, 2017 judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.

Summary of Facts \n In a habeas corpus proceeding instituted by a pers on in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state \ncourt, factual determinations made by state courts  are presumed correct unless rebutted by clear and \nconvincing evidence.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); see also Franklin v. Bradshaw, 695 F.3d 439, 447 (6th Cir. \n2012); Montgomery v. Bobby , 654 F.3d 668, 701 (6th Cir. 2011).  Th e state appellate court summarized \nthe facts underlying Alvarado\u2019s conviction as follows: \n{\u00b6 2} In the early morning hours of New Year\u2019s Day, 2013, a fight broke out at \nthe South Beach Bar on Alexis Road in Toledo, Lucas County, Ohio. Christine \nHenderson suffered a fatal wound to her neck and her fianc\u00e9e, Stacy Bowen, \nsuffered a non-fatal laceration to his upper arm. Appellant, Hector Alvarado, was \nindicted on one count of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B) and R.C. \n2929.02, and one count of felonious assau lt in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2). \nThe case proceeded to trial by jury. The following is a summary of the evidence \npresented. \n{\u00b6 3} Megan Gibson, an empl oyee at the South Beach Bar and Grill, testified that \nshe was working the door in the early morning hours of New Year\u2019s Day 2013 \nwhen \u201cthe bar broke out into a riot.\u201d She did not witness the assault on Bowen or \nHenderson. She did, however, clean-up a large amount of blood in the area \nHenderson was standing before she walked  outside and died in the bar\u2019s parking \nlot. \n{\u00b6 4} A bar patron, Charles Wells, testifie d that he and three of his friends were \non the bar\u2019s back patio \u201csm oking weed and drinking beer \u201d when the violent, yet \nshort-lived, fight began. He entered the bar, but never engage d in the fighting. \nInstead, he stood back and observed the co mmotion, keeping his eye on appellant \nbecause he was \u201cthe biggest guy in the bar.\u201d \n{\u00b6 5} Wells explained that during the figh t appellant had \u201can object\u201d in his hand. \nHe observed appellant swing the object  and noted that \u201ceverybody he swung on \nhurried up and got away from him.\u201d Wells ad mitted that his view was obstructed \nat times because \u201cbodies wa s [sic] moving, chairs was [sic] flying, people was \n[sic] swinging.\u201d \n{\u00b6 6} At one point, Wells observed appella nt near Henderson. He explained, \u201cI \nseen him swing on her and she walk [sic ] away, she grabbed her neck and walk \n[sic] away.  But I didn\u2019t know what had happened right then and there.\u201d Wells \nexplained that appellant had the object in his hand when he \u201cswung on\u201d \nHenderson. \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  2 of 43.  PageID #: 3930 \n3 \n \n{\u00b6 7} Before the fight completely subsid ed, Wells and his friends left the bar \nthrough the front door. Wells explained what he observed when he stepped \noutside: \nA:   All I seen was cars, but I imme diately spinned around because it was a \ncrowd of people coming out, there was some people coming out, so \nthen when I seen who was coming  out, I turned around and started \nwalking backwards and tripped off the curve. \nQ:  Did you see [appellant]? \nA:  He came out right behind me. \nQ: What did you see him with? \nA:  I seen him with a Mexican girl in one hand. I seen him with a knife in \nanother hand. \nQ:  Sure it was a knife? \nA:  Clearly I seen the knife. I wouldn\u2019t turn my back to him because I just \nseen him get into it with all these black people and I didn't want him to \nstab me too. I had my brother and them in the car. They made it in the \ncar. I was walking backwards and my brother and them kept saying, \nChuck, get in the car; Chuck, get in the car. I said fuck that. I\u2019m \nwatching him. He got a knife. \n Q:  How long did you watch him? \n A:  All the way until I got in the car. \n{\u00b6 8} Wells explained that he and his friends came back to the bar later that \nmorning so they could give another frie nd, a bouncer, a ride home. It was then \nthat he heard Henderson had died and that Bowen had killed her with a bottle. He \nexplained, \u201cI said, hell, no, [appellant] did it.\u201d \n{\u00b6 9} Wells did not talk to the police in  the early morning h ours of New Year\u2019s \nDay 2013. He did, however, receive a phone call from Detective Goodlet on \nJanuary 8, 2013. He told th e detective what he saw a nd agreed to come down to \nthe station and give a recorded statement. He explained, \nA:  * * * And the only reason why I really, really went down there, \nbecause like I say, I know the family and they was saying that the \ngirlfriend\u2019s boyfriend was the one that stabbed her with a bottle and I \nsaid, hell no, huh-uh, no. And then I called my friend Dave which [sic] \nwas the bouncer there that night and he asked me was I going down \nthere and I said I'm going to go down there and talk to him. \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  3 of 43.  PageID #: 3931 \n4 \n \nQ: Did you ever voluntarily talk to the police before? \nA: Never in my life. Where I come from that\u2019s a snitch. \n{\u00b6 10} Wells was able to identify himsel f on surveillance video and various still \nphotos taken from the video. On cross exam ination, Wells testified that he and \nBowen were not \u201cfriends\u201d but that he knew Bowen from the neighborhood and \nhad played basketball with him. He also admitted that he knew Henderson \nbecause she drove a recognizable vehicle, a \u201chot pink truck * * * with cartoon \ncharacters on it.\u201d \n{\u00b6 11} Dr. Diane Scala\u2013Barnet, a deputy co roner for Lucas County, performed an \nautopsy on Henderson. She classified  Henderson\u2019s death as a homicide and \ndetermined that a stab wound to the left  side of her neck caused a complete \ntransection of the carotid artery. In her opinion, the fatal wound was caused by an \ninstrument with one sharp edge and one dull edge. She ruled out any suggestion \nthat a broken bottle could have caused the wound. \n{\u00b6 12} Dr. Scala\u2013Barnet described the w ound track as \u201clateral  to medial and \ndownward.\u201d In her opinion, Henderson lik ely received the wound from a frontal \nattack but she could not rule out the possibility that the wound was received from \nan assailant standing behind her. When asked whether it was possible for \nHenderson to have received the wound while bent over, Dr. Scala\u2013Barnet stated, \n\u201c[t]hat would be harder to get the downward trajectory * * * It\u2019s not impossible, \nbut it\u2019s harder to get in there.\u201d Dr. S cala\u2013Barnet agreed that if Henderson did \nreceive the wound while bent over, \u201cthe assailant would almost certainly have to \nbe lower than her.\u201d However, she added that it all depended on where the \nassailant was positioned relative to the Henderson\u2019s body. \n{\u00b6 13} Dr. Scala\u2013Barnet indicated that immediately after being stabbed, blood \nwould have started spurting from He nderson\u2019s wound and death would have \noccurred within a matter of minutes. She indicated that Henderson would have \nbeen able to walk after being stabbed, but that she w ould have felt light headed \nvery quickly. \n{\u00b6 14} Bowen testified that he became i nvolved in the melee after he noticed \nseveral of his male friends fighting with  people he had never seen before. He \ndidn\u2019t know why the fight started and indi cated he had no success in trying to \nbreak things up. He did not recall fighting with appellant. \n{\u00b6 15} Bowen identified himself, Henderson, and appellant on surveillance \nfootage taken at the bar during the fight. He did not see appellant stab Henderson \nbut he recalled\u2014and the surveillance f ootage corroborated\u2014that the three of \nthem were in close proximity to each other in the moments before Henderson \ngrabbed her neck and walked away from the melee. However, a table lifted-up \nand thrown during the fight, obscured the camera at the exact moment Henderson \nlikely received the fatal stab wound to her neck. \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  4 of 43.  PageID #: 3932 \n5 \n \n{\u00b6 16} Detective William Goodlet of the To ledo Police Department testified that \nhe interviewed Bowen shortly after th e fight. While Bowen admitted to \nparticipating in the fight, he was unable to identify anyone he was fighting. \n{\u00b6 17} Detective Goodlet went to a local hospital after receiving information that \nanother potential witness, Basilia Smith , was being treated for injuries she \nreceived during the fight. When questione d, Smith admitted to being at the bar \nand receiving injuries during the melee.  However, she was too intoxicated to \nprovide any additional information helpful to the detective\u2019s investigation. \n{\u00b6 18} A few hours after he interviewed Smith, Detective Goodlet received \nsurveillance video from the bar\u2019s numerous  interior and exterior cameras. The \ntime frame of the preliminary video spa nned from 1:39:00 a.m. through 2:15:00 \na.m. The detective and his team watched th e video in real time but found it grainy \nand \u201creally tough to follow.\u201d Detective Goodlet an d his team of investigating \nofficers made a determination to start analyzing footage of the back lot where \nHenderson\u2019s body was found and work back in time in an effort to determine \nwhere and when she was injured. At the time, they knew the identities of very few \npeople in the bar. During this period of the investigation, appellant\u2019s identity was \nunknown, but he was one of several \u201cpersons of interest\u201d because of his proximity \nto the victims during the melee. \n{\u00b6 19} A short time later, Detective G oodlet obtained additional surveillance \nvideo. After the Detective and his team  watched the additional footage, they \ninvited Bowen back in to the station and showed him still shots of the footage. \nBowen was able to identify himself, but was not able to identify any of the \nsuspects. \n{\u00b6 20} About a week after the incident, Detective Goodlet r eceived a call from \none of the men who had been working s ecurity inside the bar. Based upon that \nconversation, Detective Goodlet made c ontact with Wells. Detective Goodlet \ndescribed his first phone conversation with Wells, as follows: \nHe told me what he had seen, where he was at, he stated he was at the bar with his \nbrother. He\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s having a good time. There\u2019s somebody yelling, security, \nsecurity, security. He comes out, sees ju st fighting. People fighting everywhere. \nHe states he runs out of the bar and while  he\u2019s outside the bar, he sees a large \nHispanic male come out of the bar. He\u2019s got a girl in his right hand and he\u2019s got a \nknife in his left hand. He sa id he saw this Hispanic male run, run from the scene, \nand he said that\u2019s the guy, he did it. \nA week later Wells came down to the sta tion.  During a recorded interview, but \nafter Wells identified a \u201cbig Mexican with tattoos on his head,\u201d Detective Goodlet \nshowed Wells still shots from the surveillan ce video.  Wells was able to point out \nthe appellant. \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  5 of 43.  PageID #: 3933 \n6 \n \n{\u00b6 21} At trial, Detective G oodlet indicated that the majo rity of Wells\u2019 recorded \nstatement was consistent with Wells\u2019 te stimony in court, with one exception; \nduring the recorded interview, Wells did not indicate that \u201che observed [appellant] \npunching or making some striking movement at Miss Henderson.\u201d \n{\u00b6 22} Video footage from outside the bar de monstrated that appellant arrived at \n12:46 a.m. with three women.  A few mo ments later, video footage from inside \nthe bar depicted the thre e women walking past the bouncer without being patted \ndown. Detective Goodall testified that the video showed appellant entering the bar \nafter being given a \u201ccursory pat down * * * at best.\u201d  Detective Goodall pointed \nout that the bouncer did not  pat appellant down toward s his ankles or around his \nback. \n{\u00b6 23} Video footage demonstrates that appellant was on the bar\u2019s back patio \nuntil approximately 1:55 a.m.  At that time, appellant moved into the view of \ncamera 3, inside the bar.  At 1:55:58 a.m., appellant is seen on footage from \ncamera 3 and camera 12, seated, taking a brief phone call.  There is no sign of any \nfighting. At 1:59:29 a.m., appellant abruptly stands up.  At the same time, camera \n11 depicts a fight on the dance floor.  In the moments that follow, appellant walks \nout of and then back into the view of ca mera 12.  Bowen is in the middle of the \nruckus, but appellant is not engaged in the fight. \n{\u00b6 24} At 2:00:32 a.m., appellant is seen  speaking with one of the women he \ncame into the bar with.  Thereafter, a ppellant moves away from the camera and \nout of view.  At 2:01:42 a.m., Bowen is depicted on camera 12;  his shirt and hat \nare off, and he is picking up and throwi ng a chair towards the ruckus.  At the \nsame time, appellant moves back into view  on the far side of the screen.  The \nvideo footage on camera 12 depicts no fewer than 17 individuals participating in \nor in close proximity to the ruckus. \n{\u00b6 25} At 2:01:51 a.m., Henderson is depicted on the left front side of camera 12. \nAppellant is depicted on the center back of  the camera\u2019s footage.  No one appears \nto be attacking appellant, although a chair is  thrown in his general direction.  At \n2:01:54 a.m., Bowen engages with an unide ntified individual.  At 2:01:55 a.m., \nappellant moves toward Bowen and the unidentified individual.  Two frames \nlater, appellant and Bowen are depicted near an exit door, arms swinging.  At the \nsame time, two individuals in the forefront of the screen pick up chairs, while a \nthird individual picks up a table.  At 2:01:58 a.m., Henderson can be seen on the \nedge of the screen just to the left of Bowen.  The table obscures the camera's view \nof appellant, Bowen, and Henderson. \n{\u00b6 26} Detective Goodall identified both Bowen and Henderson at 2:01:59 a.m. \nfully engaged in the ruckus.  Ms. He nderson appears to be bending over and \nmoving away from the ruckus while Bowen remains engaged with two other \nindividuals.  Henderson then stands up and backs away from the commotion.  At \n2:02:00 a.m., Henderson puts he r left hand up to the left side of her neck.  She \nthen exits the view of camera 12 while Bowen continues to engage in the ruckus. \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  6 of 43.  PageID #: 3934 \n7 \n \nThe view of appellant is obscured for fo ur or five frames.  At 2:02:05 a.m., \nBowen throws a chair towards appellant a nd runs out of the view of camera 12. \nAppellant pushes a few individuals out of  the exit door, grabs one of the girls he \ncame in with and exits the bar at 2:02:17 a.m. \n{\u00b6 27} Meanwhile, at 2:02:07 a.m., on cam era 3, Henderson is seen walking \nacross the lobby area of the bar towards th e bouncer\u2019s chair.  Detective Goodall \npoints to what he describes as \u201cdiscolo ration\u201d on her shirt and explains that \nHenderson appears with her left hand on th e left side of her neck, under her long \ndark hair.  At 2:02:12 a.m., Wells is seen exiting the bar from the main lobby \narea.  At 2:02:27 a.m., Bowen exits.  A da rk circle is visible on his upper left \nbicep in the area of his stab wound. \n{\u00b6 28} At 2:02:31 a.m., on footage from ca mera 16, appellant is seen running \nthrough the parking lot with a woman, a second woman following close behind. \nAppellant and both women climb into a pi ck-up truck, appellant in the passenger \nseat, and drive towards the entrance to the bar. \n{\u00b6 29} Before the conclusion of Detectiv e Goodall\u2019s direct examination, he \nindicated that to his knowledge, only two individuals received stab wounds during \nthe fight: Henderson and Bowen.  A third individual, Smith, was treated at the \nhospital for injuries inconsistent with a knife wound. \n{\u00b6 30} On cross examination, Detective Goodall confirmed he did not find a knife \nassociated with appellant nor did he fi nd any blood stained clot hes in appellant\u2019s \npossession. \n{\u00b6 31} Detective Goodall also confirmed that when he spoke with Wells on \nJanuary 15, 2013, Wells did not mention th at he saw appellant strike Henderson \nin the neck. \n{\u00b6 32} A recording of appellant\u2019s interv iew with police was shown to the jury. \nDuring the interview, appellant indicated he  went to the bar with a few girls and \nhe wasn't there long before the fight br oke out.  He denied seeing any weapons \nother than beer bottles and chairs.  When asked whether he stabbed Henderson, he \nshook his head \u201cno.\u201d \n{\u00b6 33} Following the presentation of evidence, the jury found appellant guilty of \nmurder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B)  and 2929.02, an unspecified felony. \nAlvarado was found not guilty of felonious assault.  The trial court sentenced \nAlvarado to 15 years to life in prison. \nState v. Alvarado, 2015 WL 139519 (Ohio Ct. App. Jan. 9, 2015).  \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  7 of 43.  PageID #: 3935 \n8 \n \nII. Procedural History \nA. State Court Proceedings \n  1. Trial Court \n The January 2013 session of the Lucas County Gra nd Jury issued an indictment charging Alvarado \nwith one count of murder in violation of Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 29 03.02(B) and 2929.02 and one count of \nfelonious assault in violation of Ohio Rev. Code  \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2).  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 1.)  Alvarado \nentered a plea of not guilty.  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 2.)  \n The matter proceeded to jury trial.  On Augus t 23, 2013, the jury found Alvarado guilty of murder, \nbut not guilty of felonious assault or the lesser included offense of aggravated assault.  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. \n3.)  On September 10, 2013, the trial court sentenced Alvarado to a prison te rm of 15 years to life.   (Doc. \nNo. 12-1, Ex. 4.)  \n  2. Direct Appeal   \n On October 3, 2013, Alvarado, through the same counsel, filed a notice of appeal to the Sixth \nDistrict Court of Appeals of Ohio (\u201c state appellate court\u201d).  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 5.)  In his merit brief, \nAlvarado raised the following four assignments of error: \nI. Prosecutorial misconduct occurred in th e State\u2019s rebuttal closing when the State \nimpermissibly referred to the content of  Appellant\u2019s character and the Appellant \nacting in conformity with that character. \nII.  The trial court abused its discreti on by not sanctioning State for a discovery \nviolation over the objection of defendant.  \nIII. Appellant\u2019s conviction was against th e manifest weight of the evidence. \nIV. There was insufficient evidence to  sustain Appellant\u2019s conviction. \n(Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 6.)  The State filed a brief in oppos ition.  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 7.)  The state appellate \ncourt affirmed Alvarado\u2019s  conviction and sentence on January 9, 2015.   State v. Alvarado , 2015 WL \n139519 (Ohio Ct. App. Jan. 9, 2015).  \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  8 of 43.  PageID #: 3936 \n9 \n \n On February 20, 2015, Alvarado, through new c ounsel, filed a notice of appeal to the Ohio \nSupreme Court.  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 9.)  In his Me morandum in Support of Juri sdiction, Alvarado raised \nthe following five Propositions of Law: \nI. Defective jury instructions that deprive a defendant of substantive rights \nconstitute plain error as described in Crim. R. 52(B) and may be considered by the \nreviewing court although the error was not objected at trial. \nII. When a prosecutor makes im permissible and prejudicial statements in reference to \na defendant\u2019s character during closing arguments, such comments are improper \nand prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial. \nIII. Defendant is effectively denied his cons titutional right to assistance of counsel \nwhere counsel\u2019s performance is deficient and there is a reasonable probability that \ncounsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced  defendant, depriving him of his due \nprocess right to a fair trial.  \nIV. An appellate court has a duty to reve rse the conviction a nd order a new trial \nwhere a trial court\u2019s verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence. \nV. A judgment may be reversed if the cumula tive effect of multiple errors deprives a \ndefendant of his constitutional rights even though, individually, the errors may not \nrise to the level of prejudicial error or cause for reversal.  \n(Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 10.)  The State filed a brief in opposition.  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 11.)   \nOn July 22, 2015, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to accept jurisdiction of the appeal pursuant to \nS.Ct. Prac. R. 7.08(B)(4).  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 12.)  \n  3. Application to Reopen Appeal \n Meanwhile, on April 7, 2015, Alvarado, through counsel, filed an Application to Reopen his \nAppeal pursuant to Ohio App. R. 26(B).  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 13.)  Alvarado argued appellate counsel was \nineffective for failing to raise the following arguments on direct appeal: \nI. Defendant was effectively denied his cons titutional right to effective assistance of \ncounsel during trial.  \n II. Defective jury instructions deprived Defendant of his right to a fair trial. \nIII. Prosecution\u2019s impermissible and prejudici al statements during closing arguments \ndenied Defendant his Constitutional Right to a Fair Trial. \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  9 of 43.  PageID #: 3937 \n10 \n \nIV. The Cumulative Prejudicial Effect of the Multiple Errors Defendant Suffered \nDuring Trial Deprived Him of Constitutional Rights and Warrant Reversal.  \n(Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 13.)  The State filed a brief in opposition.  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 14.)   The state \nappellate court denied Alvarado\u2019s Application on June 8, 2015 on the merits.  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 15.)  \n On July 17, 2015, Alvarado, through counsel, filed a notice of appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.  \n(Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 16.)  In his Memorandum in Suppor t of Jurisdiction, Alvara do raised the following \nPropositions of Law: \nI. When reviewing an application to re-o pen an appeal, the appellate court owes \nAppellant the right to consider the merits  of a claim where it is apparent in the \nrecord that there is genuine  issue with regard to c ounsel\u2019s effectiveness, in \nviolation of Appellant\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed right to the effective \nassistance of counsel. \nII. When considering an application to re-open an appeal, when presented with \ngenuine issue of with regards to counsel \u2019s effectiveness, the appellate court \nshould be required to ente rtain arguments previously  waived as evidence of \ncounsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness. \n(Doc. No.12-1, Ex. 17.)  The State filed a brief in opposition.  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 18.)   \nOn September 30, 2015, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to accept jurisd iction of the appeal \npursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 7.08(B)(4).  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 19.)  \n  4. Motion for Leave to File Motion for New Trial \n On December 18, 2015, Alvarado, through counsel, filed a Motion for Leave to File a Motion for \nNew Trial in the state trial court.  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 21.)  Therein, Alvarado argued he was entitled to a \nnew trial based on newly acquired evidence that supported his claims of innocence, ineffectiveness of trial \ncounsel, and prosecutorial misconduct both before and after trial.  Most notab ly, Alvarado attached an \naffidavit dated November 11, 2015 from the State\u2019s ke y witness, Charles Wells, in which Mr. Wells \naverred, in relevant part, as follows: \n3. The reason I am here is to clear my c onscious.  I feel bad.  I was coached by the \nprosecutor and persuaded to lie on the stand.  I did not  know at the time that I \nwould be their only witness and my testimony was material to their case.  Now \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  10 of 43.  PageID #: 3938 \n11 \n \nHector is serving a life sentence due to my testimony.  I am here today to go on \nthe record and set things straight. \n  * * *  \n5. What happened that night was that we  w e r e  a t  t h e  b a r ,  m e  a n d  a  f e w  o f  m y  \nbrothers and friends.  A fight jumped off and there was a commotion, ripping, \nrunning, and people standing off in the cut.  I seen the fight a nd I seen my friend \nthe bouncer trying to break the fights up.  After the fight was over, I left the club \nwith my brothers and friends. \n6. I didn\u2019t really see nobody with no knif e.  When I got outsi de, all I knew was the \npolice was pulling up.  We were waiting on my friend Dave, the bouncer, to see if \nhe needed a ride.  He told me a girl got stabbed but he didn\u2019t need no ride. \n7. A couple of days later, me and my friend Dave was talking and he told me the girl \ndied and it was flashing across the news .  My friend Dave reminded me of who \nChristina Henderson was.  Dave used to mess around with her mother.  I \nremember the girl.  I spent a lot of time in the house when she was young, and her \nmother always treated us like family.  She used to cook for us and stuff. \n8. Everyone was mad, I couldn\u2019t believe she was dead.  The family was so upset, I \nknew I had to help. \n9. Next thing I know, Dave told me a bunch of people had been subpoenaed and a \nbunch of people had already talked.  Det ectives asked if I would come down and \ntalk too. \n10. When I got down there, I already had a case pending.  My house got raided for \ncocaine, heroin, weed, pills, etc. so I was thinking \u201cwhat can you do for me?\u201d  \nWhen I first talked to the Prosecutor, they ran the screen the showed me the \n[surveillance] tape.  \n11. There was so much commotion, I couldn\u2019t really identify the man they wanted me \nto identify.  The prosecutor pointed him straight out to me and I just rolled with it. \nThe Prosecutor talked him so bad and told me  he just got out on felonious assault.  \nHe said \u201cI just want that fucker back in there so bad\u201d and that was when he \npointed him out to me.  I did remember seeing Hector, he is noticeable, but I \ndidn\u2019t even know who he was and couldn\u2019t see him on the video. \n12. Even when the Prosecutor pointed Hector  out on video, I di dn\u2019t see any knife in \nhis hand.  I did see him fighting, but ther e was a whole lot of people fighting.  \nThere was so much commotion going on I don\u2019t think anyone saw who had a \nknife.  \n 13. Later, I seen Hector in the parki ng lot leaving, I still didn\u2019t see a knife.  \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  11 of 43.  PageID #: 3939 \n12 \n \n14. The Prosecutor said \u201cI will do everything I can to make it go away.\u201d [it being the \npending charges].  After he promised me that he would make everything go away, \nhe disappeared.  I could never get ahold of him and I ended up doing time. \n15. The family was so upset I thought I was doing the right thing.  It\u2019s been on my \nconscious, it\u2019s been weighing on me. \n  * * *  \n17. In addition, I want to go on the record  and say that [Alvarado\u2019s trial counsel] \nAttorney John Thebes owes me money for a case.  He promised to represent me \non a charge in 2012, on CRB-12-01061-0202 a nd appeared twice on my behalf, \nbut never saw the case through.  The whole trial with Hector, he never acted like \nwe knew each other and never refunded any of my money. \n(Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 21 at Page ID#409-410.)  \n In his motion, Alvarado argued \u201cW ells\u2019 affidavit shows that the prosecution, in bad faith, failed to \ndisclose material evidence favorable to defendant , violating Alvarado\u2019s due process rights and denying \nhim the right to a fair trial.\u201d  ( Id. at Page ID#387.)  Alvarado also asse rted \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s failure to \ndisclose Wells\u2019 prospective deal constitutes a Giglio [v. United States , 405 U.S. 150 (1972)] claim and \nBrady [v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)] error.\u201d  ( Id. at Page ID#389.)  Finally , Alvarado argued \u201cWells\u2019 \naffidavit, in conjunction with Alvarado\u2019s affidav it, shows that Alvarado was effectively denied his \nconstitutional right to assistance of counsel.\u201d  (Id. at Page ID#396.)  \n Also on December 18, 2015, Alvarado filed a Petit ion for Post-Conviction Relief pursuant to Ohio \nRev. Code \u00a7 2953.23.  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 22.)  The Petition incorporated by reference Alvarado\u2019s \nMotion for Leave to File Motion for New Trial and supporting affidavits.  (Id.) The Petition raised the \nfollowing sole ground for relief: \n I. Freestanding actual innocence mandating relief under the Federal and \n  Ohio Constitutions.  \n \n(Id.)  The State moved to dismiss Al varado\u2019s Motion for Leave and Post-Conviction Petition primarily on \nthe grounds they were untimely filed.  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 23, 24.)   \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  12 of 43.  PageID #: 3940 \n13 \n \n On March 16, 2016, the state trial court deni ed Alvarado\u2019s Motion and Petition on the grounds \nAlvarado had \u201cfailed to establish that he was unavoidably prevented from timely discovering the evidence \non which he now relies, and that [Alvarado] has not submitted sufficient evidence of unavoidable delay to \nmerit a hearing on the matter.\u201d  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 25.) \n On April 14, 2016, Alvarado, throug h counsel, filed a notice of appeal to the state appellate court.  \n(Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 26.)  In his merit brief, Alvarado raised the following grounds for relief: \nI. The trial court abused its discretion  when it denied Mr. Alvarado\u2019s motion for \nleave to file a motion for new trial, without holding a hearing on the issue of \nwhether Mr. Alvarado was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the key \nwitness\u2019s recantation. \nII. The trial court erred as a matter of law in denying Mr. Alvarado\u2019s petition for \npost-conviction relief without holding a hearing on the issue of whether Mr. \nAlvarado was unavoidably prevented fr om discovery of the key witness\u2019s \nrecantation. \n(Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 27.)  The State filed a brief in oppos ition, to which Alvarado replied.  (Doc. No. 12-1, \nEx. 28; Doc.  No. 26, Ex. 36.)   \n On May 12, 2017, the state appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of Alvarado\u2019s Motion \nfor New Trial and Petition for Post-Conviction Relief.  (Doc. No. 26, Ex. 37.)  The state appellate court \nexplained as follows: \n{\u00b628} Here, appellant was convicted in August 2013, and he filed his motion for \nleave to file a motion for new trial a nd petition for postconvi ction relief -in \nDecember 2015, well beyond the120-day limit in Crim.R. 33 and the 360-day \nlimit set forth in R.C. 2953.23(A).  Thus, appellant was required to establish that \nhe was unavoidably preven ted from timely discoveri ng the evidence upon which \nhe relies.  Moreover, in order for appe llant to be entitled to a hearing on his \nmotion for leave or petition for postconvic tion relief, the evidence submitted to \nthe trial court by appellant must have, on its face, supported his claim that he was \nunavoidably prevented from timely disc overing the evidence upon which he now \nrelies. \n{\u00b629} As an initial matter, we note no ar gument or issue was raised by appellant \nat the trial court level or in his briefs  before us concerni ng the timeliness of \ndiscovery of the information in the affidavits of Basilia Smith, Nolberto Armenta, \nDeAna and Mario Parraz and the Toledo Police Department Supplemental Crime \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  13 of 43.  PageID #: 3941 \n14 \n \nReport of Detective Rider, which sets forth a summary of Wells\u2019 interview with \nDetective Goodlet, all of which were fi led by appellant in support of his motion \nfor leave and petition for postconviction re lief. We will therefore only concern \nourselves with whether the affidavits of appellant and Wells, on their face, \nsupport the claim that appellant was unavoidably prevented from timely \ndiscovering the new evidence on which he relies. \n{\u00b6 30} A review of appellant\u2019s affidavit and Wells\u2019 affidavit reveals no indication \nas to why or when Wells had a change of conscience and decided to cooperate \nand recant his trial testimony.  There is no av erment in either affidavit as to what \nprompted Wells to contact appellant\u2019s current c ounsel, or when or how Wells \nbecame aware of appellant\u2019s current counsel.  In addition, neither affidavit \nmentions why appellant nor his counsel did not or could not contact Wells prior to \nNovember 2015, when Wells executed his affidavit, to secure Wells\u2019 cooperation. \n{\u00b631} In light of the foregoing, we find the affidavits on their face fail to establish \nthat appellant was unavoidably preven ted from discovering the new evidence \nupon which he now relies.  Thus, the tria l court did not abus e its discretion in \ndenying both appellant\u2019s motion for leav e to file a motion for new trial and \npetition for postconviction relief without holding a hearing. Accordingly, \nappellant\u2019s assignments of error are not well-taken. \n(Id. at PageID# 1303-1304.)  \n On June 23, 2017, Alvarado, through counsel, filed a notice of appeal to th e Ohio Supreme Court.  \n(Doc. No. 26, Ex. 38.)  In his Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, Alvarado raised the following four \nPropositions of Law: \nI.  A defendant\u2019s due process rights are violated and he is unavoidably prevented \nfrom discovering new evidence when th e prosecution (1) w ithholds material, \nexculpatory evidence, and (2) knowingly pres ents false evidence at trial.  5th and \n14th Amendments to the United States Cons titution; Article I, Section 16, Ohio \nConstitution; Crim.

The requirement in Criminal Rule  33(B) that a defenda nt show by clear and \nconvincing  proof that he was \"unavoidably prevented from the discovery of the \nevidence upon which he must rely\" before  he may file a  motion for new trial \nbased on newly discovered evidence does not  require the defendant to contact the \nprosecution's witnesses and implore them to  recant their trial testimony. Crim. R. \n33(B). U.S. Const. 6th and 14th Amend.  \nIII.   A defendant is denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel when his trial \nand appellate attorney has an undisclosed co nflict of interest that prevents him \nfrom timely discovering exonerating eviden ce, failed to inves tigate corroborating \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  14 of 43.

The conviction and incarceration of an  innocent person violates the United States \nConstitution.  U.S. Const. 8th and 14th Amend.  \n(Doc. No. 26, Ex. 39.)  The State filed a brief in opposition.  (Doc. No. 26, Ex. 40.)   \nOn January 30, 2018, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to accept jurisdiction of the appeal \npursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 7.08(B)(4).  (Doc. No. 26, Ex. 41.)  \nB. Proceedings in this Court \n On October 20, 2016, Alvarado, through counsel, filed his original Petition, raising the following \nnine grounds for relief: \nI.  The prosecutor violated Petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial by improper and \nprejudicial statements. \nII. The State violated Petitioner\u2019s rights to due process and fair trial when it \nsuppressed favorable, material evidence.  Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). \nIII. The State violated Petitioner\u2019s right to due  process and fair trial when it presented \nfalse evidence or allowed it to go uncorrected. \nIV. The evidence against Petitioner is insuff icient to sustain hi s conviction, thus \nviolating Petitioner\u2019s due process rights under the 14th Amendment. \nV. Petitioner is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted, and his \nconvictions violate the 14th Amendment. \nVI. The trial court violated Petitioner\u2019s rights to due process and fair trial by \nerroneously instructing the jury and relieving the State from its burden of proving \nevery element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. \nVII. Petitioner was denied his constitutional right to assist ance of counsel provided by \nthe Sixth Amendment. \nVIII. Petitioner was denied his right to eff ective assistance of appellate counsel. U.S. \nConst. Amends. VI and XIV. \nIX. Petitioner was denied his constitutional  right to conflict free counsel when his \nattorney had both represented Petitioner and the State\u2019s main witness against \nPetitioner. \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  15 of 43.  PageID #: 3943 \n16 \n \n(Doc. No. 1.)2 \n Shortly thereafter, on October 28, 2016, Alvara do filed a Motion for Stay and Abeyance.  (Doc. \nNo. 5.)  In his Motion, Alvarado argued his Second, Th ird, Fifth, Seventh and Ninth Grounds for Relief \nwere not yet exhausted because they were raised in hi s Motion for Leave to file Motion for New Trial and \nPetition for Post-Conviction Relief, both of which were the subject of his then-pending appeal in the state \nappellate court.  Alvarado maintain ed his habeas petition should be st ayed because \u201cthere is good cause \nfor his failure to exhaust his claims , his claims are potential ly meritorious, and he has not intentionally \nengaged in dilatory tactics.\u201d  ( Id. at 4.)  Respondent filed a cursory opposition to Alvarado\u2019s Motion to \nStay on November 17, 2016, in which it principally argued the Motion was \u201cpremature.\u201d  (Doc. No. 9.)    \n On December 27, 2016, Respondent filed its Return of Writ, along with portions of the state court \nrecord.  (Doc. No. 12.)  Therein, Respondent argued the majority of Alvarado\u2019s claims (including those \nthat were the subject of his Motion to Stay) were procedurally defaulted.  ( Id.)  Respondent further \nmaintained Alvarado had failed to  establish cause and prejudice, or  actual innocence, to excuse the \ndefault.  (Id.)  \n On February 7, 2017, the unders igned issued a Report & Recommendation that Alvarado\u2019s Motion \nto Stay be granted in order to allow him to exhaust his Second, Third, Seventh, and Ninth Grounds for \nRelief.  (Doc. No. 17.)  No objections were filed, and, on March 3, 2017, the Report & Recommendation \nwas adopted, and the instant matter was stayed.  (Doc. No. 18.)  Alva rado was instructed to (1) file \nquarterly status reports in this Court regarding th e progress of his state c ourt appeal; and (2) seek \nreinstatement on this Court's active docket within thirty  days of fully exhausting his state court remedies.  \n(Id.)  \n \n2 In his Traverse, Alvarado withdrew his Sixth Ground for Relief.

On February 26,  2018, Alvarado filed a Notic e that he had exhausted \nhis claims in state court, and requested the Petition be  reinstated to the Court\u2019s active docket.  (Doc. No. \n23.)  Alvarado\u2019s request was granted shortly thereafter, and this matter was referred to the undersigned for \nfurther proceedings.  (Doc. No. 24.)  \n On March 2, 2018, the undersigned ordered Respondent to supplement the st ate court record to \nreflect proceedings occurring during the stay of the instant Petition.  (Doc. No. 25.)  Respondent filed a \nSupplemental State Court Record on April 2, 2018.  (Doc.  No. 26.) \n On May 8, 2018, Alvarado filed a Motion for Discove ry regarding his Second, Third, Seventh, and \nNinth Grounds for Relief.  (Doc. No. 28.)  Therein, he requested leave to conduct the depositions of \nCharles Wells; defense attorney John Thebes; Toledo Police Detectiv es William Goodlet and Tonya \nRider; and Lucas County Prosecutors Michael Bahne r, Clinton Wasserman, and Charles McDonald.  ( Id. \nat 2.)  Alvarado also sought leave to obtain copies of (1) all files c oncerning his own prosecution; (2) all \nfiles concerning the prosecution of Charles Wells in Lucas County Cour t of Common Pleas Case Nos.

Respondent filed a \nbrief in opposition, to which Alvarado replied.  (Doc.

PageID #: 3945 \n18 \n \n On September 18, 2018, the undersigned granted in part (as to Grounds Two and Three) and \ndenied in part (Grounds Seven and Nine) Alvarado\u2019s Motion for Discovery (Doc. No. 28) and granted his \nMotion to Expand/Complete the Record (Doc. No . 29).  (Doc. No. 36.)  On September 21, 2018, \nRespondent filed objections to the Order granting the motion for discovery (Doc. No. 37), to which \nAlvarado responded (Doc. No. 38).  On November 5, 2018, the Court accepted the undersigned\u2019s Order \ngranting in part and denying in part the motion for discovery and gran ting the motion to expand/complete \nthe record.  (Doc.

PageID #: 3946 \n19 \n \nOn July 6, 2020, Alvarado filed his Amended Pe tition, raising the following nine grounds for \nrelief: \nI. The prosecutor violated Alvarado\u2019s right to a fair trial by making improper and \nprejudicial statements. \nII. The State violated Petitioner\u2019s rights to due process and fair trial when it \nsuppressed favorable, material evidence.  Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). \nIII. The State violated Petitioner\u2019s rights to due process and fair trial when it \npresented false evidence or allowed it to go uncorrected. \nIV. The evidence against Petitioner is insuff icient to sustain hi s conviction, thus \nviolating Petitioner\u2019s due process rights under the 14th Amendment. \nV. Petitioner is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted, and his \nconvictions violate the 14th Amendment. \nVI. The trial court violated Petitioner\u2019s rights to due process and fair trial by \nerroneously instructing the jury and relieving the State from its burden of proving \nevery element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.3 \nVII. Petitioner was denied his constitutional right to assist ance of counsel provided by \nthe Sixth Amendment. \nVIII. Petitioner was denied his right to the effective assistance of appellate counsel. \nU.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV. \nIX. Petitioner was denied his constitutional  right to conflict free counsel when his \nattorney had both represented Petitioner and the State\u2019s main witness against \nPetitioner. \n(Doc. No. 86.) \n On September 4, 2020, Respondent fi led the Return of the Writ.  (D oc. No. 88.)  Alvarado filed an \nAmended Traverse on October 5, 2020.  (Doc. No. 89.)  On October 20, 2020, Respondent filed a Sur-\nReply.  (Doc. No. 90.) \nIII.  Non-cognizable Claims \nRespondent argues \u201c[t]here is no provision of the United States Constitution that supports\u201d \nAlvarado\u2019s claims regarding the det ectives\u2019 destruction of their handwr itten notes after information was \n \n3 As stated supra in n.2, Alvarado withdrew this ground for relief in his Traverse.  \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  19 of 43.  PageID #: 3947 \n20 \n \nincluded in their reports, the prosecutor\u2019s failure  to \u201cmemorialize notes from witness interviews\u201d and \nfailure to preserve emails, and intermingling of the prosecutor\u2019s Alvarado and Wells files.  (Doc. No. 88 at \n19-20.)  Alvarado does not directly respond to this argument in his Amended Traverse.  (Doc. No. 89.)   \nRespondent argues, \u201cTo the extent that Alvarado\u2019s fifth ground for relief alleges a free-standing \nclaim to relief on the grounds of actual innocence, hi s claim is not cognizable before this court and, \naccordingly, does not serve as a ground for habeas relief.\u201d  (Doc. No. 88 at 21.)  \nAlvarado points to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Herrera v. Collins , 506 U.S. 390 (1993), \narguing that \u201c[b]y speculating that the standard for proving a freestanding claim of actual innocence would \nbe \u2018extraordinarily high,\u2019 the Supreme Court indicated  its belief that there coul d be a situation where a \nprovably innocent person\u2019s incarceration would violate the constitution.\u201d  (Doc. No. 89 at 65.)  Alvarado \nclaims the Supreme Court \u201cagain implied\u201d such a claim is cognizable in In re Davis, 557 U.S. 952 (2009).  \n(Id. at 66.)  Alvarado asserts that since Herrera, courts in the Third, Eight h, and Ninth Circuits have \nrecognized a freestanding claim of actual innocence.  (Id. at 65.)  Alvarado also maintains that state courts \nhave recognized such a claim.  (Id. at 65-66.) \nAs the undersigned recommends stay ing this case and holding it in  abeyance for the reasons set \nforth below, the Court does not reach the merits of th e parties\u2019 arguments with respect to the cognizability \nof Grounds Two and Five. \nIV. Exhaustion and Procedural Default  \nA. Legal Standard \nPetitioners must exhaust their state remedies prio r to raising claims in federal habeas corpus \nproceedings.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b), (c).  This requirement is satisfied \u201cwhen the highest court in the \nstate in which the petitioner was convicted has been  given a full and fair opportunity to rule on the \npetitioner\u2019s claims.\u201d  Manning v. Alexander, 912 F.2d 878, 881 (6th Cir.1990).  \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  20 of 43.  PageID #: 3948 \n21 \n \nFederal courts will not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims, unless the petitioner \ndemonstrates cause for the default a nd prejudice resulting therefrom, or where failure to review the claim \nwould result in a fundamental  miscarriage of justice.  See Lundgren v. Mitchell , 440 F.3d 754, 763 (6th \nCir. 2006) (citing Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 87, 97S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977)).  A claim \nmay become procedurally defaulted in two ways. Id.  First, a petitioner may pr ocedurally default a claim \nby failing to comply with state procedural rules in pr esenting his claim to the appropriate state court.  Id.; \nsee also Maupin v. Smith , 785F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986).  If, due to  petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with \nthe procedural rule, the state court declines to reach the merits of the issue, and the state procedural rule is \nan independent and adequate grounds for precluding relief, the claim is procedurally defaulted.4  Id. \nSecond, a petitioner may also proce durally default a claim by faili ng to raise and pursue that claim \nthrough the state\u2019s \u201cordinary appellate review procedures.\u201d  O'Sullivan v. Boerckel , 526 U.S. 838, 848, \n119 S.Ct. 1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999).  If, at the time of  the federal habeas petition, state law no longer \nallows the petitioner to raise the cl aim, it is procedurally defaulted. Engle v. Isaac,  456 U.S. 107, 125 n. \n28, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982);  see also  Coleman v. Thompson , 501 U.S. 722, 731\u201332, 111 \nS.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991); Lovins, 712 F.3d 283, 295 (6th Cir. 2013) (\u201ca claim is procedurally \ndefaulted where the petitioner failed to exhaust state court remedies, and the remedies are no longer \navailable at the time the federal petition is filed because of a state procedural rule.\u201d)  This second type of \nprocedural default is often confused  with exhaustion.  Exhaustion and procedural default, however, are \n \n4 In Maupin, the Sixth Circuit established a four-step analysis to determine whether a claim is procedurally \ndefaulted. 785 F.2d at 135. Under th is test, the Court decides (1) whethe r the petitioner failed to comply \nwith an applicable state procedural rule, (2) whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural \nsanction, (3) whether the state pro cedural bar is an \u201cindependent and adequate\u201d state ground on which the \nstate can foreclose federal review, and (4) whet her the petitioner has demonstrated \u201ccause\u201d and \n\u201cprejudice.\u201d  Id. at 138\u201339; Barkley v. Konteh , 240 F. Supp. 2d 708 (N.D. Ohio 2002). \u201cIn determining \nwhether a state court actually enforced a procedural  rule, we apply the \u2018plain statement\u2019 rule of Michigan \nv. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983).\u201d  Lovins v. Parker , 712 F.3d 283, 296 \n(6th Cir. 2013) (\u201ca procedural defa ult does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either direct or \nhabeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case \u2018clearly and expressly\u2019 states \nthat its judgment rests on the procedural bar.\u201d) (citations omitted). \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  21 of 43.  PageID #: 3949 \n22 \n \ndistinct concepts.  AEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement only \u201crefers to remedies still available at the time of \nthe federal petition.\u201d  Engle, 456 U.S. at 125 n. 28.  Where state court remedies are no longer available to \na petitioner because he failed to use them within the required time period, procedural default and not \nexhaustion bars federal court review.  Id.  In Ohio, a petitioner is not entitled to raise claims in post-\nconviction proceedings where those claims co uld have been raised on direct appeal.   Id.  Thus, if an Ohio \npetitioner failed to raise a claim on direct appeal, whic h could have been raised, the claim is procedurally \ndefaulted.  Id. \nA claim is adequately raised on direct appeal if it was \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state court. To fairly \npresent a claim to a state court a pe titioner must assert both the legal and factual basis for his claim.  See \nMcMeans v. Brigano , 228 F.3d 674, 681 (6th Cir. 2000).  Accordi ngly, a \u201cpetitioner must present his \nclaim to the state courts as a federal constitutional i ssue-not merely as an issu e arising under state law.\u201d  \nKoontz v. Glossa, 731 F.2d 365, 368 (6th Cir. 1984).  A petitioner can take four actions in his brief which \nare significant to the determination as to whether a claim has been fairly presented as a federal \nconstitutional claim: (1) reliance upon federal cases employing consti tutional analysis; (2) reliance upon \nstate cases employing federal constitutional analysis; (3) phrasing the claim in terms of constitutional law \nor in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional right; or (4) alleging facts \nwell within the mainstream of constitutional law.  Williams v. Anderson , 460 F.3d 789, 806 (6th Cir. \n2006). \nA petitioner\u2019s procedural defaul t, however, may be excused upon a showing of \u201ccause\u201d for the \nprocedural default and \u201cactual prej udice\u201d from the alleged error.  See Maupin , 785 F.2d at 138\u201339. \n\u201cDemonstrating cause requires showing that an \u2018objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s \nefforts to comply\u2019 with the state procedural rule.\u201d  Franklin v. Anderson , 434 F.3d 412, 417 (6th Cir. \n2006) (quoting Murray v. Carrier , 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986)). Mean while, \u201c[d]emonstrating prejudice \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  22 of 43.  PageID #: 3950 \n23 \n \nrequires showing that the trial was infected with constitutional error.\u201d Id.  Where there is strong evidence \nof a petitioner\u2019s guilt and the ev idence supporting petitioner\u2019s claim is weak, the actual prejudice \nrequirement is not satisfied.  See United States v. Frady , 456 U.S. 152, 172, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d \n816 (1982); Perkins v. LeCureux, 58 F.3d 214, 219\u201320 (6th Cir. 1995); Rust v. Zent, 17 F.3d 155, 161-62 \n(6th Cir. 1994).  Prejudice does not occur unless pe titioner demonstrates \u201ca r easonable probability\u201d that \nthe outcome of the trial woul d have been different.  See Mason v. Mitchell , 320 F.3d 604, 629 (6th Cir. \n2003) (citing Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 289, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999)). \nFinally, a petitioner\u2019s procedural default may al so be excused where a petitioner is actually \ninnocent in order to prevent a \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d  See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S.722, 749\u201350, 111 \nS.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991).  Conclusory stat ements are not enough\u2014a petitioner must \u201csupport \nhis allegations of constitutional error with new reliable evidence-whether it be exculpatory scientific \nevidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence-t hat was not presented at trial.\u201d  \nSchlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 324, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995).  See also Jones v. Bradshaw , \n489 F. Supp. 2d 786, 807 (N.D. Ohio 2007); Allen v. Harry, 497 F. App\u2019x 473, 480 (6th Cir. 2012). \nB.  Application to Petitioner \n  1. Ground One \n Respondent argues Alvarado failed to properly exhaust the portion of Ground One pertaining to a \n\u201c\u2018third\u2019 remark made during closin g arguments\u201d by raising this issue fo r the first time in the Supreme \nCourt of Ohio, and Alvarado fails to demonstrate cause or prejudice, or identify new, reliable evidence of \nactual innocence, to excuse the default.  (Doc. No. 88 at 26-29.)    \n Alvarado responds this portion of Ground One was ra ised as his Third Assignment of Error in his \n26(B) Application, and so fairly presented this portion of his claim to the state courts.  (Doc. No. 89 at 95.)  \nIn addition, Alvarado argues the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in Whiting v. Burt, 395 F.3d 602 (6th Cir. 2005) \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  23 of 43.  PageID #: 3951 \n24 \n \nstands for the proposition th at fair presentment does not require hi m to specify every factual allegation in \nsupport of a claim.  ( Id. at 96.)  Therefore, by presenting \u201cthe s ubstance\u201d of his prosecutorial misconduct \nconstitutional claim to the state court of appeal s and the Supreme Court of  Ohio, he has properly \nexhausted this portion of Ground One.  (Id.) \n Alvarado also argues that, assuming arguendo this portion of Ground One is procedurally \ndefaulted, he can show cause and prejudi ce to excuse the procedural default.  ( Id. at 98.)  However, in a \nfootnote, Alvarado asks that should the Court find this  claim is not exhausted, the Court stay his Amended \nPetition so that he may present his claim in state court, as Alvarado \u201ccould not have discovered the \nevidence Respondent claims is unexhausted until he was provide d it in federal discovery.\u201d  ( Id. at 101 \nn.12.) \n In the Sur-Reply, Respondent also argues Al varado waived this portion of Ground One, and \nwaiver is an adequate and independe nt state ground to bar this portion of Alvarado\u2019s claim.  (Doc. No. 90 \nat 8.) \n In Alvarado\u2019s brief in th e state appellate court, appellate counsel argued, \u201cAt two points during the \nrebuttal closing argument by the st ate Appellant objected to improper argument by the state when \nreference was made to Appellant\u2019s character.\u201d  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 6, PageID#174) (emphasis added).  \nNowhere in Alvarado\u2019s brief did c ounsel mention the third alleged improper remark  by the prosecutor: \n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that he is a violent guy.  He looks like he could be.\u201d  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 10, \nPageID#252.)  In fact, the only place this comment appears in the state\u2019s appellee brief, in the context of a \nlonger excerpt of the rebuttal argument.  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 7, PageID#205.)  The state appellate court \ndecision only incorporated the portions of the rebuttal argument asserted by Alvarado in his brief.  State v. \nAlvarado, 2015 WL 139519, at *6.  \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  24 of 43.  PageID #: 3952 \n25 \n \nIn his brief to Supreme Court of Ohio, new c ounsel for Alvarado argued,  \u201cIn this case, the \nprosecutor exploited the court\u2019s latitude over closing statements and on three separate occasions made \ninappropriate remarks referencing Defendant\u2019s character, permeating the closing argument and effectively \ndepriving Defendant his right to fa ir trial.\u201d  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 10, PageID#251.)  New counsel noted the \nProsecutor\u2019s third remark was not objected to by trial counsel.  (Id. at PageID#252.)   \nIn Whiting, the Sixth Circuit found the petitioner had fa irly presented his claim where, although he \n\u201cdid not specifically argue at any length the fact that appellate counsel had also been trial counsel, thus \ncreating a conflict of interest which, in addition to being a cause of failing to include claims in the direct \nappeal, resulted in prejudice to Defendant,\u201d petitioner had made a passing mention of the conflict in the \nfollowing sentence contained in his motion for re lief from judgment: \u201c\u2018Sinc e the same attorney \nrepresented the Defendant at the appellate levels, it is  not surprising that the i ssues concerning ineffective \nassistance of counsel were not rais ed at that time.\u2019\u201d  395 F.3d at 614- 15.  Therefore, the Sixth Circuit \ndetermined a \u201cclaim of ineffective a ssistance of counsel, with an allege d conflict of interest component, \nwas fairly presented to the Michigan courts in the collateral relief proceedings.\u201d  Id. at 615.  That is not the \ncase here.  \nWhile Alvarado maintains he raised this issue in his 26(B) application, his application only \ncontains the following statement wi th respect to the pros ecutorial misconduct clai m: \u201cWhile previously \nnoticed, Appellate Counsel was ine ffective in demonstrating how t horoughly the prosecutor misconduct \npermeated the closing argument, effectively depriving De fendant his right to fair trial.\u201d  (Doc. No. 12-1, \nEx. 13, PageID#304.)  Such a vague argument fails to su fficiently state the legal basis for the claim.  See \nWagner v. Smith , 581 F.3d 410, 416 (6th Cir. 2009) (\u201cGeneral references to \u2018pervasive misconduct\u2019 and \n\u2018irrelevant and prejudicial evidence\u2019 simply do not serve as a fair presentation of the specific claim that \nthe prosecutor impermissibly brought up two murders not at issue in the trial.\u201d).   \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  25 of 43.  PageID #: 3953 \n26 \n \nFurthermore, even if Alvarado\u2019s 26(B) applicati on was construed to include  the third remark by \nthe prosecutor, it is well-establishe d that \u201cbringing an ineffective assist ance claim in state court based on \ncounsel's failure to raise an underlying claim does not  preserve the underlying claim for federal habeas \nreview because the two claims are analytically distinct.\u201d  Davie v. Mitchell , 547 F.3d 297, 312 (6th Cir. \n2008).  Alvarado maintains the state court of appeals \u201c\u2018 indicated that the decision rested on an evaluation \nof the merits of his claim,\u2019\u201d thus preserving his underlying prosecuto rial misconduct claim.  (Doc. No. 89 \nat 99).  But the state appellate court did not consider the merits of the underlying prosecutorial misconduct \nclaim; rather, the state appellate court stated, \u201cAppellant raised this issue in his first assignment of error in \nhis direct appeal.  Upon review, we determined that th e prosecutor did err.  However, we determined that \nAlvarado was not prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s statements . . . Therefore, this issue cannot now provide a \nbasis for finding that appellate counsel was ineffective.   Alvarado\u2019s third assignme nt of error is not well \ntaken.\u201d  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 15, PageID#338.)  Cf. James v. Brigano , 470 F.3d 636, 640-42 (6th Cir. \n2006) (\u201cThe Ohio Court of Appeals\u2019 lengthy opinion denying James\u2019s motion to reopen does not frame its \nrejection of James\u2019s underlying claims as a failure to  find prejudice or on procedural grounds, but instead \nrejects those claims on their merits.\u201d); Patterson v. Haskins, 316 F.3d 596, 605 (6th Cir. 2003).  It is clear \nthe state appellate court relied on its previous determination regarding Alvarado\u2019s prosecutorial \nmisconduct claim to determine that Alvarado coul d not show the prejudice necessary to establish \nineffective assistance of counsel.   \n As stated above, exhaustion and procedural defa ult, however, are distinct concepts.  AEDPA\u2019s \nexhaustion requirement \u201crefers to remedies still available at the time of the federal petition.\u201d  Engle, 456 \nU.S. at 125 n. 28.  Where state cour t remedies are no longer available to  a petitioner because he failed to \nuse them within the required time period, procedural default and not e xhaustion bars federal court review.  \nId.  In Ohio, a petitioner is not enti tled to raise claims in post-conviction proceedings where those claims \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  26 of 43.  PageID #: 3954 \n27 \n \ncould have been raised on direct appeal.   Id.  Thus, if an Ohio petitioner fa iled to raise a claim on direct \nappeal, which could have been raised, th e claim is procedurally defaulted.  Id.  However, in his Amended \nPetition, Alvarado argues the three remarks were pl anned, relying on trial notes obtained from the \nprosecutor\u2019s office during discovery in his federal habeas proceeding.  (Doc. No. 86 at 29-30.)   \nRespondent argues that Alvarado\u2019s allegation that the prosecutor\u2019s  allegedly impr oper comments \nduring closing argument were \u201cplanned\u201d has never been presented to the state court, nor has his arguments \nthat Wells was not looking in the victim\u2019s direction when the State alleged she was stabbed and the Crime \nStoppers Tips.  (Doc. No. 88 at 29-30; Doc. No. 90 at 12.)  As Respondent recognizes, \u201cAlvarado may file \na motion for a new trial and/or peti tion for postconviction relief in order to pursue those claims,\u201d and the \nstate court should have \u201cthe opportun ity to exercise its discretion in favor of the availability of the \nremedy.\u201d  (Doc. No. 88 at 30; Doc. No. 90 at 12) (citing Cunningham v. Hudson, 756 F.3d 477, 484 (6th \nCir. 2014); Wagner v. Smith, 581 F.3d 410, 419 (6th Cir. 2009); Godbolt v. Russell, 82 F. App\u2019x 447, 450 \n(6th Cir. 2003)).5  Respondent \u201curges\u201d the Court to dismiss Alvarado\u2019s Amended Petition, rather than stay \nthe case and hold it in abeyance, as Al varado has not met th e requirements under Rhines v. Weber , 544 \nU.S. 269 (2005).  (Doc. No. 88 at 30; Doc. No. 90 at 12.)  In the alternative, Respondent asks the Court to \nallow Alvarado to \u201cdelete\u201d the unexhausted claims from his Amended Petition and proceed with his \nexhausted claims.  (Id.) \n \n5 In order for the state cour ts to consider a second post-conviction petition, Alvarado must show: (a) that \nhe \u201cwas unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which the petitioner must rely to present \nthe claim for relief, or, subsequent to the period prescribed in divi sion (A)(2) of section 2953.21 of the \nRevised Code or to the filing of an earlier petiti on, the United States Supreme Court recognized a new \nfederal or state right that applies retroactively to persons in the petitioner's situation, and the petition \nasserts a claim based on that right\u201d; and (b) \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional \nerror at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which the \npetitioner was convicted or, if the cl aim challenges a sentence of death th at, but for constitutional error at \nthe sentencing hearing, no reasonab le factfinder would have found the petitioner eligible for the death \nsentence.\u201d  O.R.C. \u00a7 2953.23(A)(1)(a)-(b). \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  27 of 43.  PageID #: 3955 \n28 \n \n Alvarado denies he has raised additional claims that require exhaustion; rather, \u201che cites to \nsupporting evidence that was produced following this C ourt\u2019s grant of discovery.\u201d  (Doc. No. 89 at 101.)  \nAlvarado maintains he \u201chas consistently alleged that the prosecutor violated his right to a fair trial by \nmaking improper and prejudicial statements during closing argument,\u201d and \u201cvariations in legal theory or \nfactual allegations do not rende r his claim unexhausted.\u201d  ( Id.) (citing Whiting, 395 F.3d at 613). 6 In a \nfootnote, Alvarado states, \u201cThough Alvarado maintains this claim is exhausted,  if this Court finds \notherwise, he respectfully requests that this Court stay the petition so that he may present the claim in state \ncourt . . . Alvarado could not have discovered the ev idence the Respondent claims is unexhausted until he \nwas provided it in federal discovery .\u201d  (Doc. No. 89 at 101 n.12.)  Al varado further asserts his claim is \npotentially meritorious and he has not engaged in dilatory tactics.  (Id.)  \n In Rhines v. Weber , 544 U.S. 269, 275 (2005), the Supreme C ourt recognized that, \u201cas a result of \nthe interplay between\u201d AEDPA\u2019s one-ye ar statute of limitations and th e total exhaustion requirement of \nLundy, \u201cpetitioners who come to federal court with \u2018mix ed\u2019 petitions run the risk of forever losing their \nopportunity for any federal review of  their unexhausted claims.  If a pe titioner files a timely but mixed \npetition in federal district court, an d the district court dismisses it under Lundy after the limitations period \nhas expired, this will likely mean the termination of any federal review.\u201d  Accordingly, the Court \ndetermined that, in the case of a mixed petition, a district court has the disc retion to employ a \u201cstay and \nabeyance\u201d procedure: \nUnder this procedure, rather than dismi ss the mixed petition. . . a district court \nmight stay the petition and hol d it in abeyance while the petitioner returns to state \ncourt to exhaust his previously unexhaus ted claims. Once the petitioner exhausts \nhis state remedies, the district court will lift the stay and allow the petitioner to \nproceed in federal court. \nId. at 275-76. \n \n6 See the Court\u2019s previous discussion of Whiting, supra. \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  28 of 43.  PageID #: 3956 \n29 \n \n The Court cautioned that \u201cstay and abeyance shoul d be available only in limited circumstances,\u201d \nbecause it \u201chas the potential to undermine . . . AEDPA\u2019s objective of encouraging finality by allowing a \npetitioner to delay the resoluti on of the federal proceedings.\u201d Id. at 277.  Accordingly, the Court \ndetermined that stay and abeyance is appropriate only where the petitioner can show: (1) good cause for \nhis failure to exhaust; (2) that his unexhausted claims are not \u201cplainly meritless\u201d; and (3) that there is no \nindication that the petitioner engaged in \u201cintentionally dila tory litigation tactics.\u201d  Id. at 277-78; see also \nWagner v. Smith , 581 F.3d 410, 419 (6th Cir. 2009).  Generall y, to show good cause  for a failure to \nexhaust state remedies, a petitioner must show why he failed to use available state remedies timely and \nappropriately.  See Hoffman v. Lazaroff, 2015 WL 5729578 at * 3 (N.D. Ohio Sept. 28, 2015); Petkovic v. \nClipper, 2015 WL 3948194 at * 6 (N.D. Ohio June 26, 2015).  Further, in Rhines, the Supreme Court \nopined that a stay should be entered if the unexhausted  claim was \u201cpotentially meritorious.\u201d  544 U.S. at \n278. \n As stated earlier, the Court disagrees that Whiting is analogous to the instant case.  In order to \nproperly exhaust his claims, Alvarado must present the same legal and factual bases for his claims to the \nstate courts as the federal district court.  Cunningham, 756 F.3d at 482 (\u201cExhaustion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2254(b) requires presentation of the sa me factual basis to the federal ha beas court that was presented to \nthe state court.\u201d)  In Cunningham, the Sixth Circuit found  the petitioner had not exhauste d his claim of \njuror bias based on a juror\u2019s alleged relationship to the families of the victims where the juror bias claim \npresented to the state courts was premised on the juro r\u2019s knowledge of the petitioner from her colleagues.  \nId.   As Alvarado admits, the factual support for hi s prosecutorial misconduct claim has changed as a \nresult of obtaining information in discovery during this habeas case.  (Doc. No. 89 at 101.)  Accordingly, \nthe Court finds the instant habeas petition is a \u201cmixed\u201d petition.  Thus, the Court will proceed to consider \nthe remaining Rhines factors; i.e., (1) whether Alvarado has shown good cau se for his failure to exhaust; \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  29 of 43.  PageID #: 3957 \n30 \n \n(2) whether his unexhausted claims are not \u201cplainly me ritless,\u201d and (3) whether there is any evidence that \nAlvarado engaged in \u201cintentionally dilatory litigation tactics.\u201d \n Respondent argues Alvarado fails to  demonstrate good cause for the following reasons: (1) the bar \nsurveillance videos were a part of the trial record and (2) open file discovery was provided and Alvarado \n\u201cacknowledges\u201d the Crime Stoppers Reports were obt ained from the Lucas C ounty Prosecutor\u2019s Office \nfiles during discovery in this fede ral habeas case.  (Doc. No. 90 at 12-13.)  But those arguments have \nnothing to do with whether Alvarado can show good cause  as to his failure to exhaust the \u201cthird remark\u201d \nportion of Ground One, including his allegation that the prosecutor\u2019s no tes show the comments at issue \nwere planned.  Alvarado certainly would not have rece ived the prosecutor\u2019s trial notes in open discovery \nduring his criminal case below.  There is no questi on Alvarado did not become aware of these notes until \nwell after his initial state post-conviction petition,  and only received those notes through discovery \nallowed in this federal habeas proceeding.  Cunningham, 756 F.3d at 486.  Therefore, the Court finds \nAlvarado has demonstrated \u201cgood cause\u201d for having failed to exhaust this portion of Ground One. \nWhether this claim is potentially meritorious is a closer question.  The Supreme Court set forth the \nstandard for claims of prosecutorial misconduct in habeas proceedings in Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. \n168 (1986). It held that to prevail on such claims, \u201cit is not enough th at the prosecutors \u2019 remarks were \nundesirable or even unive rsally condemned.\u201d  Id. at 181 (internal quotation ma rks and citation omitted). \nRather, \u201c\u2018[t]he relevant question is whether the prosecutors\u2019 comments \u2018so in fected the trial with \nunfairness as to make th e resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Donnelly v. \nDeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 642 (1974)).  See also  United States v. Young , 470 U.S. 1, 11 (1985) \n(\u201cNevertheless, a criminal conviction is not to be  lightly overturned on the basis of a prosecutor\u2019s \ncomments standing alone, for the statements or conduct must be viewed in context; only by so doing can it \nbe determined whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct affected the fairness of the trial.\u201d). \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  30 of 43.  PageID #: 3958 \n31 \n \nThe Darden standard \u201cis a very genera l one, leaving courts \u2018more leeway ... in reaching outcomes \nin case-by-case determinations ....\u2019\u201d Parker v. Matthews , 567 U.S. 37, 48 (2012) (quoting Yarlborough v. \nAlvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 664 (2004)). Courts may consider: (1) whether the evidence against the defendant \nwas strong; (2) whether the conduct  of the prosecution tended to misl ead the jury or prejudice the \ndefendant; (3) whether the conduct or remarks were is olated or extensive; and (4) whether the remarks \nwere made deliberately or accidentally. Wogenstahl v. Mitchell , 668 F.3d 307, 328 (6th Cir. 2012). \u201cThe \nprosecution necessarily has \u2018wide latitude\u2019 during closing argument to respond to the defense\u2019s strategies, \nevidence and arguments.\u201d Id. at 329 (quoting Bedford v. Collins, 567 F.3d 225, 233 (6th Cir. 2009)). \nRespondent argues an anticipated an swer to a question in the pros ecutor\u2019s direct examination of \nWells came from Wells and not the prosecutor, and the jury was informed that arguments are not \nevidence.  (Doc. No. 90 at 13.)  Alvarado cites to his arguments supporting the merits of his claim in \nGround One to show his claim is potentially merito rious (Doc. No. 89 at 101 n. 12), but part of that \nargument relies on information available at trial (all eging Wells was looking away from the fight at the \ntime the victim was stabbed).  ( Id. at 5-21.)  The state appellate co urt determined the comments were \nimproper based on the record  before it, but Alvarado suffered no prejudice.  State v. Alvarado , 2015 WL \n139519, at *7.  But Alvarado alleges th e prosecutor\u2019s trial notes show that the comments were deliberate \nand planned, not inadvertent.  (Doc. No. 86 at 29-30; Doc. No. 89 at 15-16.)   Furthermore, Alvarado\u2019s \nargument with respect to Ground One is tied to hi s argument in Ground Three that the prosecutor \npresented false testimony that bol stered the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments in his rebuttal closing \nargument.  (Doc. No. 89 at 15-17.)  In his argument in support of Ground Three, Alvarado relies on Crime \nStopper tips that he only received in disc overy in this federal habeas case.  ( Id. at 49-51.)  As a result, and \nas will be discussed in greater detail infra, this factual basis for Ground Thr ee also has not been presented \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  31 of 43.  PageID #: 3959 \n32 \n \nto the state courts.  For all of these reasons, the Court cannot say, at this stage of the proceedings, that this \nportion of Alvarado\u2019s First Ground for Relief is \u201cplainly meritless.\u201d \nLastly, the Court finds there is no evidence that Alvarado has engaged in intentionally dilatory \nlitigation tactics.  Wells executed his recantation affidavit in November 2015, and Alvarado promptly filed \nhis Motion for Leave to file New Tr ial Motion and Petition fo r Post-Conviction Relief  in state court the \nfollowing month.  Alvarado filed his federal habeas  petition on October 20, 2016 and has been diligently \npursuing his rights both in the state courts and this court since that time .  Accordingly, with respect to the \nunexhausted portion of Ground One, Alvarado has satisfied the Rhines standard for a stay and abeyance in \nthis case. \n  2. Ground Two \n   a. Charles Wells Affidavit \n Respondent argues Alvarado\u2019s claim that the prosecutor suppressed material, exculpatory evidence \nas identified in Charles Wells\u2019 affidavit is procedurally defau lted as the state cour ts found Alvarado\u2019s \nfilings for post-conviction for relief  untimely, which is an adequate  and independent state ground to \nforeclose habeas review.  (Doc. No. 88 at 31.)  Res pondent further argues Alvara do fails to demonstrate \ncause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default, and fails to present any ne w, reliable evidence to \nexcuse the default.  (Id. at 33-34.) \n Alvarado argues in response: \nOhio\u2019s procedural rules do not always satisfy the Maupin test. Ohio does not have \na \u201cfirmly established and regularly fo llowed\u201d procedural rule governing the \ntimeliness of delayed new trial motions in the Ohio courts. The rules are \nparticularly unsettled where a delayed motion for new trial is based on evidence \nof a Brady violation, as it was here. In fact, the Supreme Court of Ohio recently \naccepted for review a case raising the i ssue of whether Ohio\u2019s \u201claw regarding \npostconviction does not provide adequate relief when a defendant\u2019s rights are \nviolated in contravention of Brady, because it unconstitutionally shifts the burden \nto defendant\u201d) [sic]. \n(Doc. No. 89 at 102-03) (citations omitted). \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  32 of 43.  PageID #: 3960 \n33 \n \n Alvarado further argues  that, even assuming arguendo the Court finds Ground Two procedurally \ndefaulted, Alvarado can establish cause a nd prejudice to excuse the default.  ( Id. at 103.)  In addition, \nAlvarado has made a sufficient showing \u201cto pass th rough the actual innocence gateway\u201d and have the \nCourt consider his claim on the merits.  (Id. at 111.) \n Alvarado presented the portion of Ground Two based on the evidence presented in Wells\u2019s \nrecantation affidavit to the state courts in his motion for leave to file a motion for new trial (Doc. No. 12-\n1, Ex. 21, 27; Doc. No. 26, Ex. 36, 39), which the st ate trial court found untimel y.  (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. \n25.)  The state appellate court affirmed.  (Doc. No. 26, Ex. 37.)   \nAs the undersigned recommends stay ing this case and holding it in  abeyance for the reasons set \nforth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to this portion of \nGround Two. \n   b. Prosecutor\u2019s Notes and Other Claims \nRespondent argues that Alvarado \u201cappears to allege as error the detectives [sic] destruction of their \nhandwritten notes after the information was incorporated into their reports\u201d and \u201cthat the prosecutor failed \nto memorialize notes from witness interviews\u201d and preserve emails, claims which have not been presented \nto the state courts.  (Doc. No. 88 at 34.)   Responde nt \u201curges\u201d the Court to dismiss Alvarado\u2019s Amended \nPetition, rather than stay the case and hold it in ab eyance, as Alvarado has not met the requirements under \nRhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269 (2005).  ( Id. at 35.)  In the alternative, Respondent asks the Court to allow \nAlvarado to \u201cdelete\u201d the unexhausted claims from his Amended Petition and proc eed with his exhausted \nclaims.  (Id.)   \nAlvarado does not directly respond to this argume nt; rather, Alvarado\u2019s response set forth above \napplies to Ground Two in its entirety.  (Doc. No. 89 at  101-11.)  However, in support of his response, \nAlvarado relies on evidence produced in discovery duri ng this federal habeas proceeding, including the \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  33 of 43.  PageID #: 3961 \n34 \n \n\u201cintermingled and incomplete\u201d Wells and Alvarado files from the prosecutor\u2019s office and that the \ndetectives and prosecutors \u201cadmittedly failed to document substantial portions of the investigation and its \nprosecution (such as Bahner\u2019s interviews with Wells) or to maintain all relevant documents.\u201d  ( Id. at 105.)  \nAs Alvarado admits, \u201c[I]t was not until this Cour t\u2019s grant of discovery th at Alvarado could fully \nunderstand how Wells\u2019s changing story aligned with critical stages of his own cases, which were not \nresolved until after the conclusion of Alvarado\u2019s trial . . . Nor coul d Alvarado have di scovered the Crime \nStopper tips, which the State failed to disclo se until this Court granted discovery.\u201d  ( Id. at 106.)  \nTherefore, the factual support for his Brady and Giglio claim has changed as a result of obtaining \ninformation in discovery during this habeas case.  There is no question this changed factual basis for his \nclaim has not been presented to the state courts.   \n Respondent argues Alvarado fails to meet the Rhines criteria, but only speci fically addresses the \n\u201cpotentially meritorious\u201d prong.  (Doc. No. 88 at 35.)  In support of this argumen t, Respondent points to \nthe fact that \u201c[o]pen file discovery was provided,\u201d Wells\u2019s statements were provided by the Toledo Police \nDepartment and so \u201cAlvarado cannot dispute that he was aware of [them],\u201d and \u201cAlvarado cannot cite any \nUnited States Supreme Court precede nt\u201d that requires police department s to \u201cpreserve handwritten notes \nin addition to the typed reports incorporating t hose notes,\u201d nor requiring a prosecutor\u2019s office to \n\u201cmemorialize interviews or to preserve e-mails  where there is no evidence of any exculpatory \ninformation.\u201d  (Id.)   \nThere is no question Alvarado did not become aware of this information until  well after his initial \nstate post-conviction petition, and only received this in formation through discovery allowed in this federal \nhabeas proceeding.  Cunningham, 756 F.3d at 486.  Therefore, the Court finds Alvarado has demonstrated \n\u201cgood cause\u201d for having failed to exhaust this portion of Ground Two. \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  34 of 43.  PageID #: 3962 \n35 \n \nFurther, the Court finds this portion of  Ground Two is not \u201cplainly meritless,\u201d i.e., they are \npotentially meritorious.  It is we ll established that a claim under Brady and its progeny contains three \nparts: \u201c(1) The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or \nbecause it is impeaching; (2) that evidence must have  been suppressed by the State, either willfully or \ninadvertently; and (3) prejudice must have ensued.\u201d  Strickler v. Greene , 527 U.S. 263, 281-82 (1999).  \nThe Court acknowledges that recantation affidavits are viewed with skepticism.   See e.g. Carter v. \nMitchell, 443 F.3d 517, 519 (6th Cir. 2006); Byrd v. Collins , 209 F.3d 486, 508 n 16 (6th Cir. 2000).  \nHowever, given that Wells was the key witness agai nst Alvarado, \u201cthe case largely turned on [Wells\u2019] \ntestimony,\u201d and Alvarado points to further evidence obtained in discov ery during this federal habeas \nproceeding that he maintains supp ort Wells\u2019s recantation affidavit (D oc. No. 89 at 105-06), the Court \ncannot say, at this stage of the proceedings, that this portion of Alvarado\u2019s Second Ground for Relief is \n\u201cplainly meritless.\u201d     \nLastly, the Court finds there is no evidence that Alvarado has engaged in intentionally dilatory \nlitigation tactics.  Wells executed his recantation affidavit in November 2015, and Alvarado promptly filed \nhis Motion for Leave to file New Tr ial Motion and Petition fo r Post-Conviction Relief  in state court the \nfollowing month.  Alvarado filed his federal habeas  petition on October 20, 2016 and has been diligently \npursuing his rights both in the state courts and this court since that time .  Accordingly, with respect to the \nunexhausted portion of Ground Two, Alvarado has satisfied the Rhines standard for a stay and abeyance in \nthis case. \n  3. Ground Three \n   a. Charles Wells Affidavit \n Respondent argues Alvarado\u2019s claim that the prosecutor knowingly presented false testimony, \nbased in part on claims contained in  Wells\u2019 affidavit, is pr ocedurally defaulted as  the state courts found \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  35 of 43.  PageID #: 3963 \n36 \n \nAlvarado\u2019s filings for post-conviction for relief untimely, which is an  adequate and independent state \nground to foreclose habeas review.  (Doc. No. 88 at 35-36.)  Respondent further argues Alvarado fails to \ndemonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the procedur al default, and fails to present any new, reliable \nevidence to excuse the default.  (Id. at 37-39.) \nAlvarado combined his response to these arguments  with his response to the arguments regarding \nGround Two.  (Doc. No. 89 at 101-11.) \nAs the undersigned recommends stay ing this case and holding it in  abeyance for the reasons set \nforth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to this portion of \nGround Three. \n   b. Detective Goodlet\u2019s Testimony Regarding Alvarado\u2019s  \nStatements Regarding a Knife \n \n Respondent argues this portion of Ground Three is  based on testimony available on the record, \ntrial counsel could have objected to the redactions and asked for more of  the exhibit to be played to the \njury but did not, and this claim could have been rais ed on direct review.  (Doc. No. 88 at 39.)  Respondent \nfurther argues Alvarado fails to de monstrate cause and prejudice to ex cuse the procedural default, and \nfails to present any new, reliable evidence to excuse the default.  (Id. at 40-44.) \nAlvarado combined his response to these arguments  with his response to the arguments regarding \nGround Two.  (Doc. No. 89 at 101-11.) \nAs the undersigned recommends stay ing this case and holding it in  abeyance for the reasons set \nforth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to this portion of \nGround Three. \n   c. Video from Bar \n \nRespondent argues this portion of Ground Three coul d have been raised in a contemporaneous \nobjection at trial and could have been  raised on direct re view.  (Doc. No. 88 at 44.)  Respondent further \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  36 of 43.  PageID #: 3964 \n37 \n \nargues Alvarado fails to demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default, and fails to \npresent any new, reliable evidence to excuse the default.  (Id. at 44-45.) \nAlvarado combined his response to these arguments  with his response to the arguments regarding \nGround Two.  (Doc. No. 89 at 101-11.) \nAs the undersigned recommends stay ing this case and holding it in  abeyance for the reasons set \nforth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to this portion of \nGround Three. \n   d. Detective Goodlet\u2019s Testimony about Tips \nRespondent argues that Alvarado\u2019s allegation \u201cthat the State allowe d Detective Goodlet to testify \nfalsely that \u2018that [sic] the Toledo Police Department received no tips relating to Henderson\u2019s death\u2019\u201d is \nprocedurally defaulted as it was never raised in the state courts.  (Doc. No. 88 at 45.)   Respondent \u201curges\u201d \nthe Court to dismiss Alvarado\u2019s Ame nded Petition, rather than stay the case and hold it in abeyance, as \nAlvarado has not met th e requirements under Rhines v. Weber , 544 U.S. 269 (2005).  ( Id. at 46.)  In the \nalternative, Respondent asks the Court to allow Alvarado to \u201cdelet e\u201d the unexhausted claims from his \nAmended Petition and proceed with his exhausted claims.  (Id. at 47.) \nRespondent argues Alvarado cannot show good cause because \u201copen file discovery was provided\u201d \nand \u201cAlvarado acknowledges that the Crime Stopper Re ports, [sic] were obtained from the Lucas County \nProsecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s files.\u201d  (Doc. No. 88 at 46.)  Alvarado asserts: \nUntil Wells recanted and this Court granted discovery, Alvarado could not have \nproven that the prosecutor knowingly solicited false evidence at trial.  Respondent \nseemingly implies that Alvarado was provided the evidence through \u201copen \ndiscovery.\u201d  Doc. 88, PageID# 3691.  \u201cOpen discovery,\u201d however, does not mean \nthat every single record or document po ssessed by the State is provided to the \ndefense.  Indeed, sensitive investigatory records, such as Cr ime Stopper tips, and \nrecords the prosecutor determines are work product are not disclosed.  Ohio Crim. \nR. 16(D) and (J).  See Doc. 55 (Lucas County Pros ecutor\u2019s Office Motion to \nQuash, alleging work product and/or law enforcement privilege); Doc. 57 (Toledo \nPolice Department\u2019s Motion to Quash subpoena for \u201cconfidential\u201d Crime Stopper \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  37 of 43.  PageID #: 3965 \n38 \n \ntips).  There is nothing in the record to suggest that the State disclosed the Crime \nStopper tips, Bahner\u2019s case notes, or proof of Wells\u2019s agreement with the State to \nAlvarado.  See United States v. Stifel , 594 F. Supp. 1525, 1540 (N.D. Ohio Oct. \n11, 1984) (\u201c[T]he most persuasive indicati on that the defense did not possess this \nevidence is the fact that the defense never used this evidence at trial.\u201d). \n(Doc. No. 89 at 51-52.) \nAlvarado\u2019s argument is well-taken.  For purposes of determining whether the \u201cgood cause\u201d factor \nof the Rhines test has been met, the Court finds Alvarado did not become aware of this information until \nwell after his initial stat e post-conviction petition, and only r eceived the Crime Stopper Tips through \ndiscovery allowed in this federal habeas proceeding.  Cunningham, 756 F.3d at 486.  Therefore, the Court \nfinds Alvarado has demonstrated \u201cgood cause\u201d for having failed to exhaust this portion of Ground Three. \nFurther, the Court finds this portion of Ground Three is not \u201cplainly meritless,\u201d i.e., it is potentially \nmeritorious. In order to establish a Giglio violation, a petitioner must demonstrate that a witness\u2019s \nstatement was false; the statement was materi al; and the prosecution knew it was false.  See Coe v. Bell , \n161 F.3d 320, 343 (6th Cir. 1998); Rosencratz v. Lafler , 568 F.3d 577, 583-584 (6th Cir. 2009).  The \nparties dispute how to interpret Det ective Goodlet\u2019s testimony.  (Doc. No. 88 at 46; Doc. No. 89 at 49.)  \nAlvarado asserts, \u201cEven when specifically asked a bout receiving information \u2018seven days after\u2019 the \nhomicide, Goodlet mentioned only Wells, not Crime Stopper tips, wh ich, as Respondent concedes, had \nbeen received by that point.\u201d  (Doc. No. 89 at 49.)  Th erefore, the Court cannot say, at this stage of the \nproceedings, that this portion of Alvarado\u2019s Third Ground for Relief is \u201cplainly meritless.\u201d     \nLastly, the Court finds there is no evidence that Alvarado has engaged in intentionally dilatory \nlitigation tactics.  Wells executed his recantation affidavit in November 2015, and Alvarado promptly filed \nhis Motion for Leave to file New Tr ial Motion and Petition fo r Post-Conviction Relief  in state court the \nfollowing month.  Alvarado filed his federal habeas  petition on October 20, 2016 and has been diligently \npursuing his rights both in the state courts and this court since that time .  Accordingly, with respect to the \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  38 of 43.  PageID #: 3966 \n39 \n \nunexhausted portion of Ground Three,  Alvarado has satisfied the Rhines standard for a stay and abeyance \nin this case. \n  4. Ground Four \n Respondent argues Alvarado procedurally defaulte d his insufficiency of the evidence claim by \nfailing to present this claim on appe al to the Supreme Court of Ohio.  (Doc. No. 88 at 47.)  Respondent \nfurther argues Alvarado\u2019s manifest weight of the evidence claim \u201ccannot be deemed inclusive\u201d of his \ninsufficiency of the evidence claim.  (Id.)   \n Alvarado responds that while he framed his clai m as a manifest weight of the evidence claim \nbefore the Supreme Court of Ohio, \u201cthe substan ce of his argument was that his conviction was not \nsupported by sufficient evidence\u201d and he \u201ccited to two leading Supreme Court cases related to sufficiency \nchallenges.\u201d  (Doc. No. 89 at 111).  Alvarado argues he was not required to present his sufficiency of the \nevidence claim as a standalone clai m in the state courts \u201c[i]n order to fairly present and exhaust his \nsufficiency of the evidence claim.\u201d  (Id.) (citing Whiting, 395 F.3d at 613-15).  \nAs the undersigned recommends stay ing this case and holding it in  abeyance for the reasons set \nforth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to Ground Four. \n  5. Ground Five \n In addition to arguing that Alvarado\u2019s free-standing actual innocence cl aim is non-cognizable on \nfederal habeas review, Respondent furthe r argues this claim is procedurally defaulted as it was first raised \nin Alvarado\u2019s motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial and petition for postconviction relief, which \nthe state courts found to be untimel y, and Alvarado fails to  demonstrate cause and prejudice, or new, \nreliable evidence of actual innocence, to excuse the procedural default.  (Doc. No. 88 at 50-53.) \n In response, Alvarado argues the state courts im properly applied a procedural bar to his fifth \nground for relief.  (Doc. No. 89 at 113.)  Howe ver, Alvarado asserts that even assuming, arguendo, the \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  39 of 43.  PageID #: 3967 \n40 \n \nstate courts properly applied this procedural bar to this claim, he  can establish both cause and prejudice.  \n(Id.)   \nAs the undersigned recommends stay ing this case and holding it in  abeyance for the reasons set \nforth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to Ground Four. \n  6. Ground Seven \n Respondent argues first that other than Alvarado\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel with \nrespect to his attorney\u2019s advice in plea negotiations, his at torney\u2019s failure to talk to Wells, and the alleged \nconflict of interest, his remaining claims \u201care conclusory without any argument in support.\u201d  (Doc. No. 88 \nat 53.)  Respondent further argues Alvarado\u2019s ineffec tive assistance of counsel claims are procedurally \ndefaulted on the grounds of: raisi ng an issue for the first time be fore the Supreme Court of Ohio; \nAlvarado\u2019s 26(B) allocati on would not preserve the underlyi ng claims; Alvarado\u2019s memorandum in \nsupport of jurisdiction and hi s 26(B) application were conclusory; his ineffectiv e assistance of counsel \nclaims in his motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial were likewise conclusory and omitted any \nclaim that trial counsel was ineffect ive for failing to object to prosecu torial misconduct; the state courts \nfound Alvarado\u2019s motion for leave to fi le a motion for a new trial untimel y; and Alvarado failed to raise \nthese claims in the first proceeding.

In addition, Alvarado responds he could not have raised \nhis ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim in his direct appeal as he was represented by the same \nlawyer at trial and on appeal.  ( Id.)  Alvarado asserts he prop erly raised his ineffec tive assistance of trial \ncounsel claims in his 26(B) application and argues his underlying ineffective as sistance of trial counsel \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  40 of 43.  PageID #: 3968 \n41 \n \nclaim was preserved because \u201cit would seem the c ourt of appeals undertook a merits analysis.\u201d  ( Id. at \n117.)  Alvarado maintains that, even if the Court should  find this claim is proce durally defaulted, he can \ndemonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the default.  ( Id.)  Moreover, Alvarado as serts he \u201chas made a \ncompelling case of actual innocence.\u201d  (Id. at 118.)         \n Respondent maintains that Alvara do\u2019s claims raised in his Ame nded Traverse that trial counsel \nwas ineffective for failing to introduce the surveillan ce video in Alvarado\u2019s case in chief and that trial \ncounsel failed to investigate and call witnesses who would have stated  they did not see Alvarado with a \nknife, that they saw Alvarado with two cell phones, and would have provided context to the video were \nnot raised in Alvarado\u2019s initial Petition, Alvarado did not seek to amend his seventh ground for relief, and \nthese claims were not raised in his Amended Petiti on.  (Doc. No. 90 at 41-42.)  As a result, Respondent \nasserts these claims are not pr operly before the Court.  ( Id. at 42.)  Moreover, Respondent maintains \n\u201c[t]here is no question that the cl aim of ineffective assist ance of trial counsel regarding the surveillance \nvideo was not raised in the state courts,\u201d even t hough the claim \u201ccould have been, but was not, raised in \nAlvarado\u2019s petition for pos t-conviction relief.\u201d  ( Id.)  Respondent also asserts \u201cthe claim regarding the \ninvestigation and witnesses was not fa irly presented to the state courts  because Alvarado failed to brief \nand argue both the factual and legal substance of the claim.\u201d  ( Id.)  Respondent further argues that even if \nthese claims had been raised in Alvarado\u2019s motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial, the state courts \nfound that motion and Alvarado\u2019s petition for postconv iction relief untimely, and Alvarado fails to \ndemonstrate cause and prejudice, or new, reliable evid ence of actual innocence, to excuse the default.  \n(Id.)                        \nAs the undersigned recommends stay ing this case and holding it in  abeyance for the reasons set \nforth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to Ground Seven.             \nCase: 3:16-cv-02563-PAG  Doc #: 93  Filed:  12/07/20  41 of 43.  PageID #: 3969 \n42 \n \n  7. Ground Nine \n Respondent argues Alvarado\u2019s claim that he was denied the right to  conflict-free counsel has been \nprocedurally defaulted as it was raised for the first time in Alvarado\u2019s motion for leave to file a motion for \na new trial, which the state courts found untimely.  (Doc. No. 88 at 56-57. )  Respondent maintains \nAlvarado fails to demonstrate cause and prejudice, or new, reliable evidence of actual innocence, to \nexcuse the procedural default.  (Id. at 58-59.) \nIn response, Alvarado argues the state courts im properly applied a procedural bar to his ninth \nground for relief.  (Doc. No. 89 at 113.)  Howe ver, Alvarado asserts that even assuming, arguendo, the \nstate courts properly applied this procedural bar to this claim, he can establish both cause and prejudice.  \n(Id.)   \nAs the undersigned recommends stay ing this case and holding it in  abeyance for the reasons set \nforth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to Ground Nine. \nV. Conclusion \nAccordingly, and for all the reasons set forth above, it is recommended that this case be stayed and \nheld in abeyance to allow Alvarado the opportunity to present his unexh austed claims to the state courts.  \nIt is further recommended that the stay be granted on the condition that Alvarado (1) file quarterly status \nreports in this Court regarding the progress of his state court appeal; and (2) seek reinstatement on this \nCourt\u2019s active docket within thirty (30) days of fully exhausting his state court remedies.  \nIT IS SO RECOMMENDED.  \n \nDate:  December 7, 2020    s/ Jonathan Greenberg                         \nJonathan D.

Before the Court is the Petition of Hector Alvarado (\u201cAlvarado\u201d or \u201cPetitioner\u201d), for a Writ of Habeas Corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Alvarado is in the custody of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction pursuant to journal entry of sentence in the case State v. Alvarado, Lucas County Court of Common Pleas Case No. G-4801-CR-201301381. For the following reasons, the undersigned recommends that this case be stayed and held in abeyance to allow Alvarado the opportunity to present his unexhausted claims to the state courts. It is further recommended that the stay be granted on the condition that Alvarado (1) file quarterly status reports in this Court regarding the progress of his state court appeal; and (2) seek reinstatement on this Court\u2019s active docket within thirty (30) days of fully exhausting his state court remedies.\n\n1 In his Amended Traverse, Alvarado states he was incarcerated at Ohio State Penitentiary at the beginning of his federal habeas proceedings but has since been transferred to Mansfield Correctional Institution. (Doc. No. 89 n.1.) The Court substitutes the Warden of Mansfield Correctional Institution, Tim McConahay, for the Warden of Ohio State Penitentiary. See Gornall v. Clipper, No. 1:18CV1102, 2020 WL 820731, at *1 n.1 (N.D. Ohio Feb 18, 2020); Stevens v. Turner, No. 3:17CV1245, 2019 WL 6251454, at *1 n.1 (N.D. Ohio Nov. 22, 2019).\nI. Summary of Facts\n\nIn a habeas corpus proceeding instituted by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court, factual determinations made by state courts are presumed correct unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); see also Franklin v. Bradshaw, 695 F.3d 439, 447 (6th Cir. 2012); Montgomery v. Bobby, 654 F.3d 668, 701 (6th Cir. 2011). The state appellate court summarized the facts underlying Alvarado\u2019s conviction as follows:\n\n{\u00b6 2} In the early morning hours of New Year\u2019s Day, 2013, a fight broke out at the South Beach Bar on Alexis Road in Toledo, Lucas County, Ohio. Christine Henderson suffered a fatal wound to her neck and her fianc\u00e9e, Stacy Bowen, suffered a non-fatal laceration to his upper arm. Appellant, Hector Alvarado, was indicted on one count of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B) and R.C. 2929.02, and one count of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2). The case proceeded to trial by jury. The following is a summary of the evidence presented.\n\n{\u00b6 3} Megan Gibson, an employee at the South Beach Bar and Grill, testified that she was working the door in the early morning hours of New Year\u2019s Day 2013 when \u201cthe bar broke out into a riot.\u201d She did not witness the assault on Bowen or Henderson. She did, however, clean-up a large amount of blood in the area Henderson was standing before she walked outside and died in the bar\u2019s parking lot.\n\n{\u00b6 4} A bar patron, Charles Wells, testified that he and three of his friends were on the bar\u2019s back patio \u201csmoking weed and drinking beer\u201d when the violent, yet short-lived, fight began. He entered the bar, but never engaged in the fighting. Instead, he stood back and observed the commotion, keeping his eye on appellant because he was \u201cthe biggest guy in the bar.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6 5} Wells explained that during the fight appellant had \u201can object\u201d in his hand. He observed appellant swing the object and noted that \u201ceverybody he swung on hurried up and got away from him.\u201d Wells admitted that his view was obstructed at times because \u201cbodies was [sic] moving, chairs was [sic] flying, people was [sic] swinging.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6 6} At one point, Wells observed appellant near Henderson. He explained, \u201cI seen him swing on her and she walk [sic] away, she grabbed her neck and walk [sic] away. But I didn\u2019t know what had happened right then and there.\u201d Wells explained that appellant had the object in his hand when he \u201cswung on\u201d Henderson.\nBefore the fight completely subsided, Wells and his friends left the bar through the front door. Wells explained what he observed when he stepped outside:\n\nA: All I seen was cars, but I immediately spinned around because it was a crowd of people coming out, there was some people coming out, so then when I seen who was coming out, I turned around and started walking backwards and tripped off the curve.\n\nQ: Did you see [appellant]?\n\nA: He came out right behind me.\n\nQ: What did you see him with?\n\nA: I seen him with a Mexican girl in one hand. I seen him with a knife in another hand.\n\nQ: Sure it was a knife?\n\nA: Clearly I seen the knife. I wouldn\u2019t turn my back to him because I just seen him get into it with all these black people and I didn't want him to stab me too. I had my brother and them in the car. They made it in the car. I was walking backwards and my brother and them kept saying, Chuck, get in the car; Chuck, get in the car. I said fuck that. I\u2019m watching him. He got a knife.\n\nQ: How long did you watch him?\n\nA: All the way until I got in the car.\n\nWells explained that he and his friends came back to the bar later that morning so they could give another friend, a bouncer, a ride home. It was then that he heard Henderson had died and that Bowen had killed her with a bottle. He explained, \u201cI said, hell, no, [appellant] did it.\u201d\n\nWells did not talk to the police in the early morning hours of New Year\u2019s Day 2013. He did, however, receive a phone call from Detective Goodlet on January 8, 2013. He told the detective what he saw and agreed to come down to the station and give a recorded statement. He explained,\n\nA: * * * And the only reason why I really, really went down there, because like I say, I know the family and they was saying that the girlfriend\u2019s boyfriend was the one that stabbed her with a bottle and I said, hell no, huh-uh, no. And then I called my friend Dave which [sic] was the bouncer there that night and he asked me was I going down there and I said I'm going to go down there and talk to him.\nQ: Did you ever voluntarily talk to the police before?\n\nA: Never in my life. Where I come from that\u2019s a snitch.\n\n{\u00b6 10} Wells was able to identify himself on surveillance video and various still photos taken from the video. On cross examination, Wells testified that he and Bowen were not \u201cfriends\u201d but that he knew Bowen from the neighborhood and had played basketball with him. He also admitted that he knew Henderson because she drove a recognizable vehicle, a \u201chot pink truck * * * with cartoon characters on it.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6 11} Dr. Diane Scala\u2013Barnet, a deputy coroner for Lucas County, performed an autopsy on Henderson. She classified Henderson\u2019s death as a homicide and determined that a stab wound to the left side of her neck caused a complete transection of the carotid artery. In her opinion, the fatal wound was caused by an instrument with one sharp edge and one dull edge. She ruled out any suggestion that a broken bottle could have caused the wound.\n\n{\u00b6 12} Dr. Scala\u2013Barnet described the wound track as \u201clateral to medial and downward.\u201d In her opinion, Henderson likely received the wound from a frontal attack but she could not rule out the possibility that the wound was received from an assailant standing behind her. When asked whether it was possible for Henderson to have received the wound while bent over, Dr. Scala\u2013Barnet stated, \u201c[t]hat would be harder to get the downward trajectory * * * It\u2019s not impossible, but it\u2019s harder to get in there.\u201d Dr. Scala\u2013Barnet agreed that if Henderson did receive the wound while bent over, \u201cthe assailant would almost certainly have to be lower than her.\u201d However, she added that it all depended on where the assailant was positioned relative to the Henderson\u2019s body.\n\n{\u00b6 13} Dr. Scala\u2013Barnet indicated that immediately after being stabbed, blood would have started spurting from Henderson\u2019s wound and death would have occurred within a matter of minutes. She indicated that Henderson would have been able to walk after being stabbed, but that she would have felt light headed very quickly.\n\n{\u00b6 14} Bowen testified that he became involved in the melee after he noticed several of his male friends fighting with people he had never seen before. He didn\u2019t know why the fight started and indicated he had no success in trying to break things up. He did not recall fighting with appellant.\n\n{\u00b6 15} Bowen identified himself, Henderson, and appellant on surveillance footage taken at the bar during the fight. He did not see appellant stab Henderson but he recalled\u2014and the surveillance footage corroborated\u2014that the three of them were in close proximity to each other in the moments before Henderson grabbed her neck and walked away from the melee. However, a table lifted-up and thrown during the fight, obscured the camera at the exact moment Henderson likely received the fatal stab wound to her neck.\nDetective William Goodlet of the Toledo Police Department testified that he interviewed Bowen shortly after the fight. While Bowen admitted to participating in the fight, he was unable to identify anyone he was fighting.\n\nDetective Goodlet went to a local hospital after receiving information that another potential witness, Basilia Smith, was being treated for injuries she received during the fight. When questioned, Smith admitted to being at the bar and receiving injuries during the melee. However, she was too intoxicated to provide any additional information helpful to the detective\u2019s investigation.\n\nA few hours after he interviewed Smith, Detective Goodlet received surveillance video from the bar\u2019s numerous interior and exterior cameras. The time frame of the preliminary video spanned from 1:39:00 a.m. through 2:15:00 a.m. The detective and his team watched the video in real time but found it grainy and \u201creally tough to follow.\u201d Detective Goodlet and his team of investigating officers made a determination to start analyzing footage of the back lot where Henderson\u2019s body was found and work back in time in an effort to determine where and when she was injured. At the time, they knew the identities of very few people in the bar. During this period of the investigation, appellant\u2019s identity was unknown, but he was one of several \u201cpersons of interest\u201d because of his proximity to the victims during the melee.\n\nA short time later, Detective Goodlet obtained additional surveillance video. After the Detective and his team watched the additional footage, they invited Bowen back in to the station and showed him still shots of the footage. Bowen was able to identify himself, but was not able to identify any of the suspects.\n\nAbout a week after the incident, Detective Goodlet received a call from one of the men who had been working security inside the bar. Based upon that conversation, Detective Goodlet made contact with Wells. Detective Goodlet described his first phone conversation with Wells, as follows:\n\nHe told me what he had seen, where he was at, he stated he was at the bar with his brother. He\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s having a good time. There\u2019s somebody yelling, security, security, security. He comes out, sees just fighting. People fighting everywhere. He states he runs out of the bar and while he\u2019s outside the bar, he sees a large Hispanic male come out of the bar. He\u2019s got a girl in his right hand and he\u2019s got a knife in his left hand. He said he saw this Hispanic male run, run from the scene, and he said that\u2019s the guy, he did it.\n\nA week later Wells came down to the station. During a recorded interview, but after Wells identified a \u201cbig Mexican with tattoos on his head,\u201d Detective Goodlet showed Wells still shots from the surveillance video. Wells was able to point out the appellant.\nAt trial, Detective Goodlet indicated that the majority of Wells\u2019 recorded statement was consistent with Wells\u2019 testimony in court, with one exception; during the recorded interview, Wells did not indicate that \u201che observed [appellant] punching or making some striking movement at Miss Henderson.\u201d\n\nVideo footage from outside the bar demonstrated that appellant arrived at 12:46 a.m. with three women. A few moments later, video footage from inside the bar depicted the three women walking past the bouncer without being patted down. Detective Goodall testified that the video showed appellant entering the bar after being given a \u201ccursory pat down * * * at best.\u201d Detective Goodall pointed out that the bouncer did not pat appellant down towards his ankles or around his back.\n\nVideo footage demonstrates that appellant was on the bar\u2019s back patio until approximately 1:55 a.m. At that time, appellant moved into the view of camera 3, inside the bar. At 1:55:58 a.m., appellant is seen on footage from camera 3 and camera 12, seated, taking a brief phone call. There is no sign of any fighting. At 1:59:29 a.m., appellant abruptly stands up. At the same time, camera 11 depicts a fight on the dance floor. In the moments that follow, appellant walks out of and then back into the view of camera 12. Bowen is in the middle of the ruckus, but appellant is not engaged in the fight.\n\nAt 2:00:32 a.m., appellant is seen speaking with one of the women he came into the bar with. Thereafter, appellant moves away from the camera and out of view. At 2:01:42 a.m., Bowen is depicted on camera 12; his shirt and hat are off, and he is picking up and throwing a chair towards the ruckus. At the same time, appellant moves back into view on the far side of the screen. The video footage on camera 12 depicts no fewer than 17 individuals participating in or in close proximity to the ruckus.\n\nAt 2:01:51 a.m., Henderson is depicted on the left front side of camera 12. Appellant is depicted on the center back of the camera\u2019s footage. No one appears to be attacking appellant, although a chair is thrown in his general direction. At 2:01:54 a.m., Bowen engages with an unidentified individual. At 2:01:55 a.m., appellant moves toward Bowen and the unidentified individual. Two frames later, appellant and Bowen are depicted near an exit door, arms swinging. At the same time, two individuals in the forefront of the screen pick up chairs, while a third individual picks up a table. At 2:01:58 a.m., Henderson can be seen on the edge of the screen just to the left of Bowen. The table obscures the camera\u2019s view of appellant, Bowen, and Henderson.\n\nDetective Goodall identified both Bowen and Henderson at 2:01:59 a.m. fully engaged in the ruckus. Ms. Henderson appears to be bending over and moving away from the ruckus while Bowen remains engaged with two other individuals. Henderson then stands up and backs away from the commotion. At 2:02:00 a.m., Henderson puts her left hand up to the left side of her neck. She then exits the view of camera 12 while Bowen continues to engage in the ruckus.\nThe view of appellant is obscured for four or five frames. At 2:02:05 a.m., Bowen throws a chair towards appellant and runs out of the view of camera 12. Appellant pushes a few individuals out of the exit door, grabs one of the girls he came in with and exits the bar at 2:02:17 a.m.\n\n{\u00b6 27} Meanwhile, at 2:02:07 a.m., on camera 3, Henderson is seen walking across the lobby area of the bar towards the bouncer\u2019s chair. Detective Goodall points to what he describes as \u201cdiscoloration\u201d on her shirt and explains that Henderson appears with her left hand on the left side of her neck, under her long dark hair. At 2:02:12 a.m., Wells is seen exiting the bar from the main lobby area. At 2:02:27 a.m., Bowen exits. A dark circle is visible on his upper left bicep in the area of his stab wound.\n\n{\u00b6 28} At 2:02:31 a.m., on footage from camera 16, appellant is seen running through the parking lot with a woman, a second woman following close behind. Appellant and both women climb into a pick-up truck, appellant in the passenger seat, and drive towards the entrance to the bar.\n\n{\u00b6 29} Before the conclusion of Detective Goodall\u2019s direct examination, he indicated that to his knowledge, only two individuals received stab wounds during the fight: Henderson and Bowen. A third individual, Smith, was treated at the hospital for injuries inconsistent with a knife wound.\n\n{\u00b6 30} On cross examination, Detective Goodall confirmed he did not find a knife associated with appellant nor did he find any blood stained clothes in appellant\u2019s possession.\n\n{\u00b6 31} Detective Goodall also confirmed that when he spoke with Wells on January 15, 2013, Wells did not mention that he saw appellant strike Henderson in the neck.\n\n{\u00b6 32} A recording of appellant\u2019s interview with police was shown to the jury. During the interview, appellant indicated he went to the bar with a few girls and he wasn't there long before the fight broke out. He denied seeing any weapons other than beer bottles and chairs. When asked whether he stabbed Henderson, he shook his head \u201cno.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6 33} Following the presentation of evidence, the jury found appellant guilty of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B) and 2929.02, an unspecified felony. Alvarado was found not guilty of felonious assault. The trial court sentenced Alvarado to 15 years to life in prison.\n\nState v. Alvarado, 2015 WL 139519 (Ohio Ct. App. Jan. 9, 2015).\nII. Procedural History\n\nA. State Court Proceedings\n\n1. Trial Court\n\nThe January 2013 session of the Lucas County Grand Jury issued an indictment charging Alvarado with one count of murder in violation of Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2903.02(B) and 2929.02 and one count of felonious assault in violation of Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2903.11(A)(2). (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 1.) Alvarado entered a plea of not guilty. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 2.)\n\nThe matter proceeded to jury trial. On August 23, 2013, the jury found Alvarado guilty of murder, but not guilty of felonious assault or the lesser included offense of aggravated assault. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 3.) On September 10, 2013, the trial court sentenced Alvarado to a prison term of 15 years to life. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 4.)\n\n2. Direct Appeal\n\nOn October 3, 2013, Alvarado, through the same counsel, filed a notice of appeal to the Sixth District Court of Appeals of Ohio (\u201cstate appellate court\u201d). (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 5.) In his merit brief, Alvarado raised the following four assignments of error:\n\nI. Prosecutorial misconduct occurred in the State\u2019s rebuttal closing when the State impermissibly referred to the content of Appellant\u2019s character and the Appellant acting in conformity with that character.\n\nII. The trial court abused its discretion by not sanctioning State for a discovery violation over the objection of defendant.\n\nIII. Appellant\u2019s conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nIV. There was insufficient evidence to sustain Appellant\u2019s conviction.\n\n(Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 6.) The State filed a brief in opposition. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 7.) The state appellate court affirmed Alvarado\u2019s conviction and sentence on January 9, 2015. State v. Alvarado, 2015 WL 139519 (Ohio Ct. App. Jan. 9, 2015).\nOn February 20, 2015, Alvarado, through new counsel, filed a notice of appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 9.) In his Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, Alvarado raised the following five Propositions of Law:\n\nI. Defective jury instructions that deprive a defendant of substantive rights constitute plain error as described in Crim. R. 52(B) and may be considered by the reviewing court although the error was not objected at trial.\n\nII. When a prosecutor makes impermissible and prejudicial statements in reference to a defendant\u2019s character during closing arguments, such comments are improper and prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a fair trial.\n\nIII. Defendant is effectively denied his constitutional right to assistance of counsel where counsel\u2019s performance is deficient and there is a reasonable probability that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced defendant, depriving him of his due process right to a fair trial.\n\nIV. An appellate court has a duty to reverse the conviction and order a new trial where a trial court\u2019s verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nV. A judgment may be reversed if the cumulative effect of multiple errors deprives a defendant of his constitutional rights even though, individually, the errors may not rise to the level of prejudicial error or cause for reversal.\n\n(Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 10.) The State filed a brief in opposition. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 11.)\n\nOn July 22, 2015, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to accept jurisdiction of the appeal pursuant to S.Ct. Prac. R. 7.08(B)(4). (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 12.)\n\n3. Application to Reopen Appeal\n\nMeanwhile, on April 7, 2015, Alvarado, through counsel, filed an Application to Reopen his Appeal pursuant to Ohio App. R. 26(B). (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 13.) Alvarado argued appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the following arguments on direct appeal:\n\nI. Defendant was effectively denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel during trial.\n\nII. Defective jury instructions deprived Defendant of his right to a fair trial.\n\nIII. Prosecution\u2019s impermissible and prejudicial statements during closing arguments denied Defendant his Constitutional Right to a Fair Trial.\nIV. The Cumulative Prejudicial Effect of the Multiple Errors Defendant Suffered During Trial Deprived Him of Constitutional Rights and Warrant Reversal.\n\n(Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 13.) The State filed a brief in opposition. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 14.) The state appellate court denied Alvarado\u2019s Application on June 8, 2015 on the merits. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 15.)\n\nOn July 17, 2015, Alvarado, through counsel, filed a notice of appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 16.) In his Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, Alvarado raised the following Propositions of Law:\n\nI. When reviewing an application to re-open an appeal, the appellate court owes Appellant the right to consider the merits of a claim where it is apparent in the record that there is genuine issue with regard to counsel\u2019s effectiveness, in violation of Appellant\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed right to the effective assistance of counsel.\n\nII. When considering an application to re-open an appeal, when presented with genuine issue of with regards to counsel\u2019s effectiveness, the appellate court should be required to entertain arguments previously waived as evidence of counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness.\n\n(Doc. No.12-1, Ex. 17.) The State filed a brief in opposition. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 18.)\n\nOn September 30, 2015, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to accept jurisdiction of the appeal pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 7.08(B)(4). (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 19.)\n\n4. Motion for Leave to File Motion for New Trial\n\nOn December 18, 2015, Alvarado, through counsel, filed a Motion for Leave to File a Motion for New Trial in the state trial court. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 21.) Therein, Alvarado argued he was entitled to a new trial based on newly acquired evidence that supported his claims of innocence, ineffectiveness of trial counsel, and prosecutorial misconduct both before and after trial. Most notably, Alvarado attached an affidavit dated November 11, 2015 from the State\u2019s key witness, Charles Wells, in which Mr. Wells averred, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n3. The reason I am here is to clear my conscious. I feel bad. I was coached by the prosecutor and persuaded to lie on the stand. I did not know at the time that I would be their only witness and my testimony was material to their case. Now\nHector is serving a life sentence due to my testimony. I am here today to go on the record and set things straight.\n\n* * *\n\n5. What happened that night was that we were at the bar, me and a few of my brothers and friends. A fight jumped off and there was a commotion, ripping, running, and people standing off in the cut. I seen the fight and I seen my friend the bouncer trying to break the fights up. After the fight was over, I left the club with my brothers and friends.\n\n6. I didn\u2019t really see nobody with no knife. When I got outside, all I knew was the police was pulling up. We were waiting on my friend Dave, the bouncer, to see if he needed a ride. He told me a girl got stabbed but he didn\u2019t need no ride.\n\n7. A couple of days later, me and my friend Dave was talking and he told me the girl died and it was flashing across the news. My friend Dave reminded me of who Christina Henderson was. Dave used to mess around with her mother. I remember the girl. I spent a lot of time in the house when she was young, and her mother always treated us like family. She used to cook for us and stuff.\n\n8. Everyone was mad, I couldn\u2019t believe she was dead. The family was so upset, I knew I had to help.\n\n9. Next thing I know, Dave told me a bunch of people had been subpoenaed and a bunch of people had already talked. Detectives asked if I would come down and talk too.\n\n10. When I got down there, I already had a case pending. My house got raided for cocaine, heroin, weed, pills, etc. so I was thinking \u201cwhat can you do for me?\u201d When I first talked to the Prosecutor, they ran the screen the showed me the [surveillance] tape.\n\n11. There was so much commotion, I couldn\u2019t really identify the man they wanted me to identify. The prosecutor pointed him straight out to me and I just rolled with it. The Prosecutor talked him so bad and told me he just got out on felonious assault. He said \u201cI just want that fucker back in there so bad\u201d and that was when he pointed him out to me. I did remember seeing Hector, he is noticeable, but I didn\u2019t even know who he was and couldn\u2019t see him on the video.\n\n12. Even when the Prosecutor pointed Hector out on video, I didn\u2019t see any knife in his hand. I did see him fighting, but there was a whole lot of people fighting. There was so much commotion going on I don\u2019t think anyone saw who had a knife.\n\n13. Later, I seen Hector in the parking lot leaving, I still didn\u2019t see a knife.\n14. The Prosecutor said \u201cI will do everything I can to make it go away.\u201d [it being the pending charges]. After he promised me that he would make everything go away, he disappeared. I could never get ahold of him and I ended up doing time.\n\n15. The family was so upset I thought I was doing the right thing. It\u2019s been on my conscious, it\u2019s been weighing on me.\n\n* * *\n\n17. In addition, I want to go on the record and say that [Alvarado\u2019s trial counsel] Attorney John Thebes owes me money for a case. He promised to represent me on a charge in 2012, on CRB-12-01061-0202 and appeared twice on my behalf, but never saw the case through. The whole trial with Hector, he never acted like we knew each other and never refunded any of my money.\n\n(Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 21 at Page ID#409-410.)\n\nIn his motion, Alvarado argued \u201cWells\u2019 affidavit shows that the prosecution, in bad faith, failed to disclose material evidence favorable to defendant, violating Alvarado\u2019s due process rights and denying him the right to a fair trial.\u201d (Id. at Page ID#387.) Alvarado also asserted \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s failure to disclose Wells\u2019 prospective deal constitutes a Giglio [v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)] claim and Brady [v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)] error.\u201d (Id. at Page ID#389.) Finally, Alvarado argued \u201cWells\u2019 affidavit, in conjunction with Alvarado\u2019s affidavit, shows that Alvarado was effectively denied his constitutional right to assistance of counsel.\u201d (Id. at Page ID#396.)\n\nAlso on December 18, 2015, Alvarado filed a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2953.23. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 22.) The Petition incorporated by reference Alvarado\u2019s Motion for Leave to File Motion for New Trial and supporting affidavits. (Id.) The Petition raised the following sole ground for relief:\n\nI. Freestanding actual innocence mandating relief under the Federal and Ohio Constitutions.\n\n(Id.) The State moved to dismiss Alvarado\u2019s Motion for Leave and Post-Conviction Petition primarily on the grounds they were untimely filed. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 23, 24.)\nOn March 16, 2016, the state trial court denied Alvarado\u2019s Motion and Petition on the grounds Alvarado had \u201cfailed to establish that he was unavoidably prevented from timely discovering the evidence on which he now relies, and that [Alvarado] has not submitted sufficient evidence of unavoidable delay to merit a hearing on the matter.\u201d (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 25.)\n\nOn April 14, 2016, Alvarado, through counsel, filed a notice of appeal to the state appellate court. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 26.) In his merit brief, Alvarado raised the following grounds for relief:\n\nI. The trial court abused its discretion when it denied Mr. Alvarado\u2019s motion for leave to file a motion for new trial, without holding a hearing on the issue of whether Mr. Alvarado was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the key witness\u2019s recantation.\n\nII. The trial court erred as a matter of law in denying Mr. Alvarado\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief without holding a hearing on the issue of whether Mr. Alvarado was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the key witness\u2019s recantation.\n\n(Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 27.) The State filed a brief in opposition, to which Alvarado replied. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 28; Doc. No. 26, Ex. 36.)\n\nOn May 12, 2017, the state appellate court affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of Alvarado\u2019s Motion for New Trial and Petition for Post-Conviction Relief. (Doc. No. 26, Ex. 37.) The state appellate court explained as follows:\n\n{\u00b628} Here, appellant was convicted in August 2013, and he filed his motion for leave to file a motion for new trial and petition for postconviction relief -in December 2015, well beyond the120-day limit in Crim.R. 33 and the 360-day limit set forth in R.C. 2953.23(A). Thus, appellant was required to establish that he was unavoidably prevented from timely discovering the evidence upon which he relies. Moreover, in order for appellant to be entitled to a hearing on his motion for leave or petition for postconviction relief, the evidence submitted to the trial court by appellant must have, on its face, supported his claim that he was unavoidably prevented from timely discovering the evidence upon which he now relies.\n\n{\u00b629} As an initial matter, we note no argument or issue was raised by appellant at the trial court level or in his briefs before us concerning the timeliness of discovery of the information in the affidavits of Basilia Smith, Nolberto Armenta, DeAna and Mario Parraz and the Toledo Police Department Supplemental Crime\nReport of Detective Rider, which sets forth a summary of Wells\u2019 interview with Detective Goodlet, all of which were filed by appellant in support of his motion for leave and petition for postconviction relief. We will therefore only concern ourselves with whether the affidavits of appellant and Wells, on their face, support the claim that appellant was unavoidably prevented from timely discovering the new evidence on which he relies.\n\n{\u00b6 30} A review of appellant\u2019s affidavit and Wells\u2019 affidavit reveals no indication as to why or when Wells had a change of conscience and decided to cooperate and recant his trial testimony. There is no averment in either affidavit as to what prompted Wells to contact appellant\u2019s current counsel, or when or how Wells became aware of appellant\u2019s current counsel. In addition, neither affidavit mentions why appellant nor his counsel did not or could not contact Wells prior to November 2015, when Wells executed his affidavit, to secure Wells\u2019 cooperation.\n\n{\u00b631} In light of the foregoing, we find the affidavits on their face fail to establish that appellant was unavoidably prevented from discovering the new evidence upon which he now relies. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying both appellant\u2019s motion for leave to file a motion for new trial and petition for postconviction relief without holding a hearing. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s assignments of error are not well-taken.\n\n(Id. at PageID# 1303-1304.)\n\nOn June 23, 2017, Alvarado, through counsel, filed a notice of appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. (Doc. No. 26, Ex. 38.) In his Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, Alvarado raised the following four Propositions of Law:\n\nI. A defendant\u2019s due process rights are violated and he is unavoidably prevented from discovering new evidence when the prosecution (1) withholds material, exculpatory evidence, and (2) knowingly presents false evidence at trial. 5th and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution; Article I, Section 16, Ohio Constitution; Crim. R.33(B).\n\nII. The requirement in Criminal Rule 33(B) that a defendant show by clear and convincing proof that he was \"unavoidably prevented from the discovery of the evidence upon which he must rely\" before he may file a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence does not require the defendant to contact the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and implore them to recant their trial testimony. Crim. R. 33(B). U.S. Const. 6th and 14th Amend.\n\nIII. A defendant is denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel when his trial and appellate attorney has an undisclosed conflict of interest that prevents him from timely discovering exonerating evidence, failed to investigate corroborating\nwitnesses, and failed to properly advise on plea. U.S. Const. 6th Amend.; Article I, Section 10, Ohio Constitution.\n\nIV. The conviction and incarceration of an innocent person violates the United States Constitution. U.S. Const. 8th and 14th Amend.\n\n(Doc. No. 26, Ex. 39.) The State filed a brief in opposition. (Doc. No. 26, Ex. 40.)\n\nOn January 30, 2018, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to accept jurisdiction of the appeal pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 7.08(B)(4). (Doc. No. 26, Ex. 41.)\n\nB. Proceedings in this Court\n\nOn October 20, 2016, Alvarado, through counsel, filed his original Petition, raising the following nine grounds for relief:\n\nI. The prosecutor violated Petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial by improper and prejudicial statements.\n\nII. The State violated Petitioner\u2019s rights to due process and fair trial when it suppressed favorable, material evidence. *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\n\nIII. The State violated Petitioner\u2019s right to due process and fair trial when it presented false evidence or allowed it to go uncorrected.\n\nIV. The evidence against Petitioner is insufficient to sustain his conviction, thus violating Petitioner\u2019s due process rights under the 14th Amendment.\n\nV. Petitioner is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted, and his convictions violate the 14th Amendment.\n\nVI. The trial court violated Petitioner\u2019s rights to due process and fair trial by erroneously instructing the jury and relieving the State from its burden of proving every element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nVII. Petitioner was denied his constitutional right to assistance of counsel provided by the Sixth Amendment.\n\nVIII. Petitioner was denied his right to effective assistance of appellate counsel. U.S. Const. Amends. VI and XIV.\n\nIX. Petitioner was denied his constitutional right to conflict free counsel when his attorney had both represented Petitioner and the State\u2019s main witness against Petitioner.\nShortly thereafter, on October 28, 2016, Alvarado filed a Motion for Stay and Abeyance. (Doc. No. 5.) In his Motion, Alvarado argued his Second, Third, Fifth, Seventh and Ninth Grounds for Relief were not yet exhausted because they were raised in his Motion for Leave to file Motion for New Trial and Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, both of which were the subject of his then-pending appeal in the state appellate court. Alvarado maintained his habeas petition should be stayed because \u201cthere is good cause for his failure to exhaust his claims, his claims are potentially meritorious, and he has not intentionally engaged in dilatory tactics.\u201d (Id. at 4.) Respondent filed a cursory opposition to Alvarado\u2019s Motion to Stay on November 17, 2016, in which it principally argued the Motion was \u201cpremature.\u201d (Doc. No. 9.)\n\nOn December 27, 2016, Respondent filed its Return of Writ, along with portions of the state court record. (Doc. No. 12.) Therein, Respondent argued the majority of Alvarado\u2019s claims (including those that were the subject of his Motion to Stay) were procedurally defaulted. (Id.) Respondent further maintained Alvarado had failed to establish cause and prejudice, or actual innocence, to excuse the default. (Id.)\n\nOn February 7, 2017, the undersigned issued a Report & Recommendation that Alvarado\u2019s Motion to Stay be granted in order to allow him to exhaust his Second, Third, Seventh, and Ninth Grounds for Relief. (Doc. No. 17.) No objections were filed, and, on March 3, 2017, the Report & Recommendation was adopted, and the instant matter was stayed. (Doc. No. 18.) Alvarado was instructed to (1) file quarterly status reports in this Court regarding the progress of his state court appeal; and (2) seek reinstatement on this Court\u2019s active docket within thirty days of fully exhausting his state court remedies. (Id.)\n\n2 In his Traverse, Alvarado withdrew his Sixth Ground for Relief. (Doc. No. 32 at 38.)\nAlvarado filed Quarterly Status Reports on March 28, June 28, September 29, and December 29, 2017. (Doc. Nos. 19, 20, 21, 22.) On February 26, 2018, Alvarado filed a Notice that he had exhausted his claims in state court, and requested the Petition be reinstated to the Court\u2019s active docket. (Doc. No. 23.) Alvarado\u2019s request was granted shortly thereafter, and this matter was referred to the undersigned for further proceedings. (Doc. No. 24.)\n\nOn March 2, 2018, the undersigned ordered Respondent to supplement the state court record to reflect proceedings occurring during the stay of the instant Petition. (Doc. No. 25.) Respondent filed a Supplemental State Court Record on April 2, 2018. (Doc. No. 26.)\n\nOn May 8, 2018, Alvarado filed a Motion for Discovery regarding his Second, Third, Seventh, and Ninth Grounds for Relief. (Doc. No. 28.) Therein, he requested leave to conduct the depositions of Charles Wells; defense attorney John Thebes; Toledo Police Detectives William Goodlet and Tonya Rider; and Lucas County Prosecutors Michael Bahner, Clinton Wasserman, and Charles McDonald. (Id. at 2.) Alvarado also sought leave to obtain copies of (1) all files concerning his own prosecution; (2) all files concerning the prosecution of Charles Wells in Lucas County Court of Common Pleas Case Nos. G-4801-CR-201302717-000 and G-201301780-000; and (3) all files \u201cconcerning the incident at the South Beach Bar and Grill on December 31, 2012 and January 1, 2013, and the murder of Christina Henderson and assault on Stacey Bowen, in possession of the Toledo Police Department.\u201d (Id.) Respondent filed a brief in opposition, to which Alvarado replied. (Doc. Nos. 30, 31.)\n\nOn May 21, 2018, Alvarado filed a Motion to Expand/Complete the Record, in which he sought an Order requiring Respondent to submit the exhibits from his underlying state court trial. (Doc. No. 29.) Respondent filed a brief in opposition, to which Alvarado replied. (Doc. Nos. 33, 34.)\n\nMeanwhile, and while these Motions were pending, Alvarado filed his Traverse on June 1, 2018. (Doc. No. 32.) Respondent filed a Sur-Reply to the Traverse on June 18, 2018. (Doc. No. 35.)\nOn September 18, 2018, the undersigned granted in part (as to Grounds Two and Three) and denied in part (Grounds Seven and Nine) Alvarado\u2019s Motion for Discovery (Doc. No. 28) and granted his Motion to Expand/Complete the Record (Doc. No. 29). (Doc. No. 36.) On September 21, 2018, Respondent filed objections to the Order granting the motion for discovery (Doc. No. 37), to which Alvarado responded (Doc. No. 38). On November 5, 2018, the Court accepted the undersigned\u2019s Order granting in part and denying in part the motion for discovery and granting the motion to expand/complete the record. (Doc. No. 39.)\n\nAlvarado had until September 30, 2019 to file a motion for leave to amend his petition and/or traverse and a motion to expand the record. (Non-document Order dated July 22, 2019.) On September 30, 2019, Alvarado filed his: (1) Motion for Leave to File an Amended Petition or in the Alternative to File an Amended Traverse (Doc. No. 73); (2) Motion to Expand the Record under Rule 7 (Doc. No. 72); and (3) Unopposed Motion for Order to File Exhibit Under Seal (Doc. No. 71).\n\nOn October 2, 2019, the Court granted Alvarado leave to file an exhibit under seal. (Doc. No. 74.)\n\nOn October 30, 2019, Respondent filed responses in opposition to Alvarado\u2019s motion to amend and motion to expand the record (Doc. Nos. 76, 77), to which Alvarado replied (Doc. Nos. 78, 79).\n\nOn February 3, 2020, the undersigned granted in part and denied in part Alvarado\u2019s motion for leave to amend and motion to expand the record and set a new briefing schedule. (Doc. No. 80.)\n\nOn February 18, 2020, Respondent filed objections to the undersigned\u2019s Order. (Doc. No. 82.)\n\nOn June 3, 2020, the Court determined the undersigned\u2019s Order would not be set aside as clearly erroneous or contrary to law. (Doc. No. 85.)\n\nPursuant to an unopposed motion to amend the briefing schedule (Doc. No. 83), which the Court granted (Non-document Order dated February 21, 2020), Alvarado had thirty days from the Court\u2019s June 3, 2020 Order to file an Amended Petition.\nOn July 6, 2020, Alvarado filed his Amended Petition, raising the following nine grounds for relief:\n\nI. The prosecutor violated Alvarado\u2019s right to a fair trial by making improper and prejudicial statements.\n\nII. The State violated Petitioner\u2019s rights to due process and fair trial when it suppressed favorable, material evidence. *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).\n\nIII. The State violated Petitioner\u2019s rights to due process and fair trial when it presented false evidence or allowed it to go uncorrected.\n\nIV. The evidence against Petitioner is insufficient to sustain his conviction, thus violating Petitioner\u2019s due process rights under the 14th Amendment.\n\nV. Petitioner is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted, and his convictions violate the 14th Amendment.\n\nVI. The trial court violated Petitioner\u2019s rights to due process and fair trial by erroneously instructing the jury and relieving the State from its burden of proving every element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.3\n\nVII. Petitioner was denied his constitutional right to assistance of counsel provided by the Sixth Amendment.\n\nVIII. Petitioner was denied his right to the effective assistance of appellate counsel. U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV.\n\nIX. Petitioner was denied his constitutional right to conflict free counsel when his attorney had both represented Petitioner and the State\u2019s main witness against Petitioner.\n\n(Doc. No. 86.)\n\nOn September 4, 2020, Respondent filed the Return of the Writ. (Doc. No. 88.) Alvarado filed an Amended Traverse on October 5, 2020. (Doc. No. 89.) On October 20, 2020, Respondent filed a Sur-Reply. (Doc. No. 90.)\n\nIII. Non-cognizable Claims\n\nRespondent argues \u201c[t]here is no provision of the United States Constitution that supports\u201d Alvarado\u2019s claims regarding the detectives\u2019 destruction of their handwritten notes after information was\n\n3 As stated *supra* in n.2, Alvarado withdrew this ground for relief in his Traverse.\nincluded in their reports, the prosecutor\u2019s failure to \u201cmemorialize notes from witness interviews\u201d and failure to preserve emails, and intermingling of the prosecutor\u2019s Alvarado and Wells files. (Doc. No. 88 at 19-20.) Alvarado does not directly respond to this argument in his Amended Traverse. (Doc. No. 89.)\n\nRespondent argues, \u201cTo the extent that Alvarado\u2019s fifth ground for relief alleges a free-standing claim to relief on the grounds of actual innocence, his claim is not cognizable before this court and, accordingly, does not serve as a ground for habeas relief.\u201d (Doc. No. 88 at 21.)\n\nAlvarado points to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in *Herrera v. Collins*, 506 U.S. 390 (1993), arguing that \u201c[b]y speculating that the standard for proving a freestanding claim of actual innocence would be \u2018extraordinarily high,\u2019 the Supreme Court indicated its belief that there could be a situation where a provably innocent person\u2019s incarceration would violate the constitution.\u201d (Doc. No. 89 at 65.) Alvarado claims the Supreme Court \u201cagain implied\u201d such a claim is cognizable in *In re Davis*, 557 U.S. 952 (2009). (Id. at 66.) Alvarado asserts that since *Herrera*, courts in the Third, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits have recognized a freestanding claim of actual innocence. (Id. at 65.) Alvarado also maintains that state courts have recognized such a claim. (Id. at 65-66.)\n\nAs the undersigned recommends staying this case and holding it in abeyance for the reasons set forth below, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to the cognizability of Grounds Two and Five.\n\n**IV. Exhaustion and Procedural Default**\n\n**A. Legal Standard**\n\nPetitioners must exhaust their state remedies prior to raising claims in federal habeas corpus proceedings. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b), (c). This requirement is satisfied \u201cwhen the highest court in the state in which the petitioner was convicted has been given a full and fair opportunity to rule on the petitioner\u2019s claims.\u201d *Manning v. Alexander*, 912 F.2d 878, 881 (6th Cir.1990).\nFederal courts will not consider the merits of procedurally defaulted claims, unless the petitioner demonstrates cause for the default and prejudice resulting therefrom, or where failure to review the claim would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See Lundgren v. Mitchell, 440 F.3d 754, 763 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 87, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977)). A claim may become procedurally defaulted in two ways. Id. First, a petitioner may procedurally default a claim by failing to comply with state procedural rules in presenting his claim to the appropriate state court. Id.; see also Maupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986). If, due to petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with the procedural rule, the state court declines to reach the merits of the issue, and the state procedural rule is an independent and adequate grounds for precluding relief, the claim is procedurally defaulted.4 Id.\n\nSecond, a petitioner may also procedurally default a claim by failing to raise and pursue that claim through the state\u2019s \u201cordinary appellate review procedures.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 848, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999). If, at the time of the federal habeas petition, state law no longer allows the petitioner to raise the claim, it is procedurally defaulted. Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 125 n. 28, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982); see also Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 731\u201332, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991); Lovins, 712 F.3d 283, 295 (6th Cir. 2013) (\u201ca claim is procedurally defaulted where the petitioner failed to exhaust state court remedies, and the remedies are no longer available at the time the federal petition is filed because of a state procedural rule.\u201d) This second type of procedural default is often confused with exhaustion. Exhaustion and procedural default, however, are\n\n4 In Maupin, the Sixth Circuit established a four-step analysis to determine whether a claim is procedurally defaulted. 785 F.2d at 135. Under this test, the Court decides (1) whether the petitioner failed to comply with an applicable state procedural rule, (2) whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction, (3) whether the state procedural bar is an \u201cindependent and adequate\u201d state ground on which the state can foreclose federal review, and (4) whether the petitioner has demonstrated \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice.\u201d Id. at 138\u201339; Barkley v. Konteh, 240 F. Supp. 2d 708 (N.D. Ohio 2002). \u201cIn determining whether a state court actually enforced a procedural rule, we apply the \u2018plain statement\u2019 rule of Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983).\u201d Lovins v. Parker, 712 F.3d 283, 296 (6th Cir. 2013) (\u201ca procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either direct or habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case \u2018clearly and expressly\u2019 states that its judgment rests on the procedural bar.\u201d) (citations omitted).\ndistinct concepts. AEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement only \u201crefers to remedies still available at the time of the federal petition.\u201d Engle, 456 U.S. at 125 n. 28. Where state court remedies are no longer available to a petitioner because he failed to use them within the required time period, procedural default and not exhaustion bars federal court review. Id. In Ohio, a petitioner is not entitled to raise claims in post-conviction proceedings where those claims could have been raised on direct appeal. Id. Thus, if an Ohio petitioner failed to raise a claim on direct appeal, which could have been raised, the claim is procedurally defaulted. Id.\n\nA claim is adequately raised on direct appeal if it was \u201cfairly presented\u201d to the state court. To fairly present a claim to a state court a petitioner must assert both the legal and factual basis for his claim. See McMeans v. Brigano, 228 F.3d 674, 681 (6th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, a \u201cpetitioner must present his claim to the state courts as a federal constitutional issue-not merely as an issue arising under state law.\u201d Koontz v. Glossa, 731 F.2d 365, 368 (6th Cir. 1984). A petitioner can take four actions in his brief which are significant to the determination as to whether a claim has been fairly presented as a federal constitutional claim: (1) reliance upon federal cases employing constitutional analysis; (2) reliance upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis; (3) phrasing the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional right; or (4) alleging facts well within the mainstream of constitutional law. Williams v. Anderson, 460 F.3d 789, 806 (6th Cir. 2006).\n\nA petitioner\u2019s procedural default, however, may be excused upon a showing of \u201ccause\u201d for the procedural default and \u201cactual prejudice\u201d from the alleged error. See Maupin, 785 F.2d at 138\u201339. \u201cDemonstrating cause requires showing that an \u2018objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel\u2019s efforts to comply\u2019 with the state procedural rule.\u201d Franklin v. Anderson, 434 F.3d 412, 417 (6th Cir. 2006) (quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 488 (1986)). Meanwhile, \u201c[d]emonstrating prejudice\nrequires showing that the trial was infected with constitutional error.\u201d *Id.* Where there is strong evidence of a petitioner\u2019s guilt and the evidence supporting petitioner\u2019s claim is weak, the actual prejudice requirement is not satisfied. *See United States v. Frady*, 456 U.S. 152, 172, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982); *Perkins v. LeCureux*, 58 F.3d 214, 219\u201320 (6th Cir. 1995); *Rust v. Zent*, 17 F.3d 155, 161-62 (6th Cir. 1994). Prejudice does not occur unless petitioner demonstrates \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d that the outcome of the trial would have been different. *See Mason v. Mitchell*, 320 F.3d 604, 629 (6th Cir. 2003) (citing *Strickler v. Greene*, 527 U.S. 263, 289, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999)).\n\nFinally, a petitioner\u2019s procedural default may also be excused where a petitioner is actually innocent in order to prevent a \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d *See Coleman v. Thompson*, 501 U.S.722, 749\u201350, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). Conclusory statements are not enough\u2014a petitioner must \u201csupport his allegations of constitutional error with new reliable evidence\u2014whether it be exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence\u2014that was not presented at trial.\u201d *Schlup v. Delo*, 513 U.S. 298, 324, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995). *See also Jones v. Bradshaw*, 489 F. Supp. 2d 786, 807 (N.D. Ohio 2007); *Allen v. Harry*, 497 F. App\u2019x 473, 480 (6th Cir. 2012).\n\n**B. Application to Petitioner**\n\n1. **Ground One**\n\nRespondent argues Alvarado failed to properly exhaust the portion of Ground One pertaining to a \u201c\u2018third\u2019 remark made during closing arguments\u201d by raising this issue for the first time in the Supreme Court of Ohio, and Alvarado fails to demonstrate cause or prejudice, or identify new, reliable evidence of actual innocence, to excuse the default. (Doc. No. 88 at 26-29.)\n\nAlvarado responds this portion of Ground One was raised as his Third Assignment of Error in his 26(B) Application, and so fairly presented this portion of his claim to the state courts. (Doc. No. 89 at 95.) In addition, Alvarado argues the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in *Whiting v. Burt*, 395 F.3d 602 (6th Cir. 2005)\nstands for the proposition that fair presentment does not require him to specify every factual allegation in support of a claim. (Id. at 96.) Therefore, by presenting \u201cthe substance\u201d of his prosecutorial misconduct constitutional claim to the state court of appeals and the Supreme Court of Ohio, he has properly exhausted this portion of Ground One. (Id.)\n\nAlvarado also argues that, assuming arguendo this portion of Ground One is procedurally defaulted, he can show cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default. (Id. at 98.) However, in a footnote, Alvarado asks that should the Court find this claim is not exhausted, the Court stay his Amended Petition so that he may present his claim in state court, as Alvarado \u201ccould not have discovered the evidence Respondent claims is unexhausted until he was provided it in federal discovery.\u201d (Id. at 101 n.12.)\n\nIn the Sur-Reply, Respondent also argues Alvarado waived this portion of Ground One, and waiver is an adequate and independent state ground to bar this portion of Alvarado\u2019s claim. (Doc. No. 90 at 8.)\n\nIn Alvarado\u2019s brief in the state appellate court, appellate counsel argued, \u201cAt two points during the rebuttal closing argument by the state Appellant objected to improper argument by the state when reference was made to Appellant\u2019s character.\u201d (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 6, PageID#174) (emphasis added). Nowhere in Alvarado\u2019s brief did counsel mention the third alleged improper remark by the prosecutor: \u201cI\u2019m not saying that he is a violent guy. He looks like he could be.\u201d (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 10, PageID#252.) In fact, the only place this comment appears in the state\u2019s appellee brief, in the context of a longer excerpt of the rebuttal argument. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 7, PageID#205.) The state appellate court decision only incorporated the portions of the rebuttal argument asserted by Alvarado in his brief. State v. Alvarado, 2015 WL 139519, at *6.\nIn his brief to Supreme Court of Ohio, new counsel for Alvarado argued, \u201cIn this case, the prosecutor exploited the court\u2019s latitude over closing statements and on three separate occasions made inappropriate remarks referencing Defendant\u2019s character, permeating the closing argument and effectively depriving Defendant his right to fair trial.\u201d (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 10, PageID#251.) New counsel noted the Prosecutor\u2019s third remark was not objected to by trial counsel. (Id. at PageID#252.)\n\nIn Whiting, the Sixth Circuit found the petitioner had fairly presented his claim where, although he \u201cdid not specifically argue at any length the fact that appellate counsel had also been trial counsel, thus creating a conflict of interest which, in addition to being a cause of failing to include claims in the direct appeal, resulted in prejudice to Defendant,\u201d petitioner had made a passing mention of the conflict in the following sentence contained in his motion for relief from judgment: \u201cSince the same attorney represented the Defendant at the appellate levels, it is not surprising that the issues concerning ineffective assistance of counsel were not raised at that time.\u201d 395 F.3d at 614-15. Therefore, the Sixth Circuit determined a \u201cclaim of ineffective assistance of counsel, with an alleged conflict of interest component, was fairly presented to the Michigan courts in the collateral relief proceedings.\u201d Id. at 615. That is not the case here.\n\nWhile Alvarado maintains he raised this issue in his 26(B) application, his application only contains the following statement with respect to the prosecutorial misconduct claim: \u201cWhile previously noticed, Appellate Counsel was ineffective in demonstrating how thoroughly the prosecutor misconduct permeated the closing argument, effectively depriving Defendant his right to fair trial.\u201d (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 13, PageID#304.) Such a vague argument fails to sufficiently state the legal basis for the claim. See Wagner v. Smith, 581 F.3d 410, 416 (6th Cir. 2009) (\u201cGeneral references to \u2018pervasive misconduct\u2019 and \u2018irrelevant and prejudicial evidence\u2019 simply do not serve as a fair presentation of the specific claim that the prosecutor impermissibly brought up two murders not at issue in the trial.\u201d).\nFurthermore, even if Alvarado\u2019s 26(B) application was construed to include the third remark by the prosecutor, it is well-established that \u201cbringing an ineffective assistance claim in state court based on counsel\u2019s failure to raise an underlying claim does not preserve the underlying claim for federal habeas review because the two claims are analytically distinct.\u201d Davie v. Mitchell, 547 F.3d 297, 312 (6th Cir. 2008). Alvarado maintains the state court of appeals \u201c\u2018indicated that the decision rested on an evaluation of the merits of his claim,\u2019\u201d thus preserving his underlying prosecutorial misconduct claim. (Doc. No. 89 at 99). But the state appellate court did not consider the merits of the underlying prosecutorial misconduct claim; rather, the state appellate court stated, \u201cAppellant raised this issue in his first assignment of error in his direct appeal. Upon review, we determined that the prosecutor did err. However, we determined that Alvarado was not prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s statements . . . Therefore, this issue cannot now provide a basis for finding that appellate counsel was ineffective. Alvarado\u2019s third assignment of error is not well taken.\u201d (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 15, PageID#338.) Cf. James v. Brigano, 470 F.3d 636, 640-42 (6th Cir. 2006) (\u201cThe Ohio Court of Appeals\u2019 lengthy opinion denying James\u2019s motion to reopen does not frame its rejection of James\u2019s underlying claims as a failure to find prejudice or on procedural grounds, but instead rejects those claims on their merits.\u201d); Patterson v. Haskins, 316 F.3d 596, 605 (6th Cir. 2003). It is clear the state appellate court relied on its previous determination regarding Alvarado\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim to determine that Alvarado could not show the prejudice necessary to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nAs stated above, exhaustion and procedural default, however, are distinct concepts. AEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement \u201crefers to remedies still available at the time of the federal petition.\u201d Engle, 456 U.S. at 125 n. 28. Where state court remedies are no longer available to a petitioner because he failed to use them within the required time period, procedural default and not exhaustion bars federal court review. Id. In Ohio, a petitioner is not entitled to raise claims in post-conviction proceedings where those claims\ncould have been raised on direct appeal. *Id.* Thus, if an Ohio petitioner failed to raise a claim on direct appeal, which could have been raised, the claim is procedurally defaulted. *Id.* However, in his Amended Petition, Alvarado argues the three remarks were planned, relying on trial notes obtained from the prosecutor\u2019s office during discovery in his federal habeas proceeding. (Doc. No. 86 at 29-30.)\n\nRespondent argues that Alvarado\u2019s allegation that the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper comments during closing argument were \u201cplanned\u201d has never been presented to the state court, nor has his arguments that Wells was not looking in the victim\u2019s direction when the State alleged she was stabbed and the Crime Stoppers Tips. (Doc. No. 88 at 29-30; Doc. No. 90 at 12.) As Respondent recognizes, \u201cAlvarado may file a motion for a new trial and/or petition for postconviction relief in order to pursue those claims,\u201d and the state court should have \u201cthe opportunity to exercise its discretion in favor of the availability of the remedy.\u201d (Doc. No. 88 at 30; Doc. No. 90 at 12) (citing *Cunningham v. Hudson*, 756 F.3d 477, 484 (6th Cir. 2014); *Wagner v. Smith*, 581 F.3d 410, 419 (6th Cir. 2009); *Godbolt v. Russell*, 82 F. App\u2019x 447, 450 (6th Cir. 2003)). Respondent \u201curges\u201d the Court to dismiss Alvarado\u2019s Amended Petition, rather than stay the case and hold it in abeyance, as Alvarado has not met the requirements under *Rhines v. Weber*, 544 U.S. 269 (2005). (Doc. No. 88 at 30; Doc. No. 90 at 12.) In the alternative, Respondent asks the Court to allow Alvarado to \u201cdelete\u201d the unexhausted claims from his Amended Petition and proceed with his exhausted claims. (*Id.*)\n\n---\n\n5 In order for the state courts to consider a second post-conviction petition, Alvarado must show: (a) that he \u201cwas unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which the petitioner must rely to present the claim for relief, or, subsequent to the period prescribed in division (A)(2) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code or to the filing of an earlier petition, the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons in the petitioner's situation, and the petition asserts a claim based on that right\u201d; and (b) \u201cby clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted or, if the claim challenges a sentence of death that, but for constitutional error at the sentencing hearing, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner eligible for the death sentence.\u201d O.R.C. \u00a7 2953.23(A)(1)(a)-(b).\nAlvarado denies he has raised additional claims that require exhaustion; rather, \u201che cites to supporting evidence that was produced following this Court\u2019s grant of discovery.\u201d (Doc. No. 89 at 101.) Alvarado maintains he \u201chas consistently alleged that the prosecutor violated his right to a fair trial by making improper and prejudicial statements during closing argument,\u201d and \u201cvariations in legal theory or factual allegations do not render his claim unexhausted.\u201d (Id.) (citing Whiting, 395 F.3d at 613). In a footnote, Alvarado states, \u201cThough Alvarado maintains this claim is exhausted, if this Court finds otherwise, he respectfully requests that this Court stay the petition so that he may present the claim in state court . . . Alvarado could not have discovered the evidence the Respondent claims is unexhausted until he was provided it in federal discovery.\u201d (Doc. No. 89 at 101 n.12.) Alvarado further asserts his claim is potentially meritorious and he has not engaged in dilatory tactics. (Id.)\n\nIn Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269, 275 (2005), the Supreme Court recognized that, \u201cas a result of the interplay between\u201d AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations and the total exhaustion requirement of Lundy, \u201cpetitioners who come to federal court with \u2018mixed\u2019 petitions run the risk of forever losing their opportunity for any federal review of their unexhausted claims. If a petitioner files a timely but mixed petition in federal district court, and the district court dismisses it under Lundy after the limitations period has expired, this will likely mean the termination of any federal review.\u201d Accordingly, the Court determined that, in the case of a mixed petition, a district court has the discretion to employ a \u201cstay and abeyance\u201d procedure:\n\nUnder this procedure, rather than dismiss the mixed petition. . . a district court might stay the petition and hold it in abeyance while the petitioner returns to state court to exhaust his previously unexhausted claims. Once the petitioner exhausts his state remedies, the district court will lift the stay and allow the petitioner to proceed in federal court.\n\nId. at 275-76.\n\n---\n\n6 See the Court\u2019s previous discussion of Whiting, supra.\nThe Court cautioned that \u201cstay and abeyance should be available only in limited circumstances,\u201d because it \u201chas the potential to undermine . . . AEDPA\u2019s objective of encouraging finality by allowing a petitioner to delay the resolution of the federal proceedings.\u201d Id. at 277. Accordingly, the Court determined that stay and abeyance is appropriate only where the petitioner can show: (1) good cause for his failure to exhaust; (2) that his unexhausted claims are not \u201cplainly meritless\u201d; and (3) that there is no indication that the petitioner engaged in \u201cintentionally dilatory litigation tactics.\u201d Id. at 277-78; see also Wagner v. Smith, 581 F.3d 410, 419 (6th Cir. 2009). Generally, to show good cause for a failure to exhaust state remedies, a petitioner must show why he failed to use available state remedies timely and appropriately. See Hoffman v. Lazaroff, 2015 WL 5729578 at * 3 (N.D. Ohio Sept. 28, 2015); Petkovic v. Clipper, 2015 WL 3948194 at * 6 (N.D. Ohio June 26, 2015). Further, in Rhines, the Supreme Court opined that a stay should be entered if the unexhausted claim was \u201cpotentially meritorious.\u201d 544 U.S. at 278.\n\nAs stated earlier, the Court disagrees that Whiting is analogous to the instant case. In order to properly exhaust his claims, Alvarado must present the same legal and factual bases for his claims to the state courts as the federal district court. Cunningham, 756 F.3d at 482 (\u201cExhaustion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) requires presentation of the same factual basis to the federal habeas court that was presented to the state court.\u201d) In Cunningham, the Sixth Circuit found the petitioner had not exhausted his claim of juror bias based on a juror\u2019s alleged relationship to the families of the victims where the juror bias claim presented to the state courts was premised on the juror\u2019s knowledge of the petitioner from her colleagues. Id. As Alvarado admits, the factual support for his prosecutorial misconduct claim has changed as a result of obtaining information in discovery during this habeas case. (Doc. No. 89 at 101.) Accordingly, the Court finds the instant habeas petition is a \u201cmixed\u201d petition. Thus, the Court will proceed to consider the remaining Rhines factors; i.e., (1) whether Alvarado has shown good cause for his failure to exhaust;\n(2) whether his unexhausted claims are not \u201cplainly meritless,\u201d and (3) whether there is any evidence that Alvarado engaged in \u201cintentionally dilatory litigation tactics.\u201d\n\nRespondent argues Alvarado fails to demonstrate good cause for the following reasons: (1) the bar surveillance videos were a part of the trial record and (2) open file discovery was provided and Alvarado \u201cacknowledges\u201d the Crime Stoppers Reports were obtained from the Lucas County Prosecutor\u2019s Office files during discovery in this federal habeas case. (Doc. No. 90 at 12-13.) But those arguments have nothing to do with whether Alvarado can show good cause as to his failure to exhaust the \u201cthird remark\u201d portion of Ground One, including his allegation that the prosecutor\u2019s notes show the comments at issue were planned. Alvarado certainly would not have received the prosecutor\u2019s trial notes in open discovery during his criminal case below. There is no question Alvarado did not become aware of these notes until well after his initial state post-conviction petition, and only received those notes through discovery allowed in this federal habeas proceeding. Cunningham, 756 F.3d at 486. Therefore, the Court finds Alvarado has demonstrated \u201cgood cause\u201d for having failed to exhaust this portion of Ground One.\n\nWhether this claim is potentially meritorious is a closer question. The Supreme Court set forth the standard for claims of prosecutorial misconduct in habeas proceedings in Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168 (1986). It held that to prevail on such claims, \u201cit is not enough that the prosecutors\u2019 remarks were undesirable or even universally condemned.\u201d Id. at 181 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Rather, \u201c[t]he relevant question is whether the prosecutors\u2019 comments \u2018so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 642 (1974)). See also United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 11 (1985) (\u201cNevertheless, a criminal conviction is not to be lightly overturned on the basis of a prosecutor\u2019s comments standing alone, for the statements or conduct must be viewed in context; only by so doing can it be determined whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct affected the fairness of the trial.\u201d).\nThe *Darden* standard \u201cis a very general one, leaving courts \u2018more leeway ... in reaching outcomes in case-by-case determinations ....\u2019\u201d *Parker v. Matthews*, 567 U.S. 37, 48 (2012) (quoting *Yarlborough v. Alvarado*, 541 U.S. 652, 664 (2004)). Courts may consider: (1) whether the evidence against the defendant was strong; (2) whether the conduct of the prosecution tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (3) whether the conduct or remarks were isolated or extensive; and (4) whether the remarks were made deliberately or accidentally. *Wogenstahl v. Mitchell*, 668 F.3d 307, 328 (6th Cir. 2012). \u201cThe prosecution necessarily has \u2018wide latitude\u2019 during closing argument to respond to the defense\u2019s strategies, evidence and arguments.\u201d *Id.* at 329 (quoting *Bedford v. Collins*, 567 F.3d 225, 233 (6th Cir. 2009)).\n\nRespondent argues an anticipated answer to a question in the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination of Wells came from Wells and not the prosecutor, and the jury was informed that arguments are not evidence. (Doc. No. 90 at 13.) Alvarado cites to his arguments supporting the merits of his claim in Ground One to show his claim is potentially meritorious (Doc. No. 89 at 101 n.12), but part of that argument relies on information available at trial (alleging Wells was looking away from the fight at the time the victim was stabbed). (*Id.* at 5-21.) The state appellate court determined the comments were improper based on the record before it, but Alvarado suffered no prejudice. *State v. Alvarado*, 2015 WL 139519, at *7. But Alvarado alleges the prosecutor\u2019s trial notes show that the comments were deliberate and planned, not inadvertent. (Doc. No. 86 at 29-30; Doc. No. 89 at 15-16.) Furthermore, Alvarado\u2019s argument with respect to Ground One is tied to his argument in Ground Three that the prosecutor presented false testimony that bolstered the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments in his rebuttal closing argument. (Doc. No. 89 at 15-17.) In his argument in support of Ground Three, Alvarado relies on Crime Stopper tips that he only received in discovery in this federal habeas case. (*Id.* at 49-51.) As a result, and as will be discussed in greater detail *infra*, this factual basis for Ground Three also has not been presented.\nto the state courts. For all of these reasons, the Court cannot say, at this stage of the proceedings, that this portion of Alvarado\u2019s First Ground for Relief is \u201cplainly meritless.\u201d\n\nLastly, the Court finds there is no evidence that Alvarado has engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. Wells executed his recantation affidavit in November 2015, and Alvarado promptly filed his Motion for Leave to file New Trial Motion and Petition for Post-Conviction Relief in state court the following month. Alvarado filed his federal habeas petition on October 20, 2016 and has been diligently pursuing his rights both in the state courts and this court since that time. Accordingly, with respect to the unexhausted portion of Ground One, Alvarado has satisfied the Rhines standard for a stay and abeyance in this case.\n\n2. Ground Two\n\na. Charles Wells Affidavit\n\nRespondent argues Alvarado\u2019s claim that the prosecutor suppressed material, exculpatory evidence as identified in Charles Wells\u2019 affidavit is procedurally defaulted as the state courts found Alvarado\u2019s filings for post-conviction for relief untimely, which is an adequate and independent state ground to foreclose habeas review. (Doc. No. 88 at 31.) Respondent further argues Alvarado fails to demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default, and fails to present any new, reliable evidence to excuse the default. (Id. at 33-34.)\n\nAlvarado argues in response:\n\nOhio\u2019s procedural rules do not always satisfy the Maupin test. Ohio does not have a \u201cfirmly established and regularly followed\u201d procedural rule governing the timeliness of delayed new trial motions in the Ohio courts. The rules are particularly unsettled where a delayed motion for new trial is based on evidence of a Brady violation, as it was here. In fact, the Supreme Court of Ohio recently accepted for review a case raising the issue of whether Ohio\u2019s \u201claw regarding postconviction does not provide adequate relief when a defendant\u2019s rights are violated in contravention of Brady, because it unconstitutionally shifts the burden to defendant\u201d) [sic].\n\n(Doc. No. 89 at 102-03) (citations omitted).\nAlvarado further argues that, even assuming *arguendo* the Court finds Ground Two procedurally defaulted, Alvarado can establish cause and prejudice to excuse the default. (*Id.* at 103.) In addition, Alvarado has made a sufficient showing \u201cto pass through the actual innocence gateway\u201d and have the Court consider his claim on the merits. (*Id.* at 111.)\n\nAlvarado presented the portion of Ground Two based on the evidence presented in Wells\u2019s recantation affidavit to the state courts in his motion for leave to file a motion for new trial (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 21, 27; Doc. No. 26, Ex. 36, 39), which the state trial court found untimely. (Doc. No. 12-1, Ex. 25.) The state appellate court affirmed. (Doc. No. 26, Ex. 37.)\n\nAs the undersigned recommends staying this case and holding it in abeyance for the reasons set forth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to this portion of Ground Two.\n\nb. **Prosecutor\u2019s Notes and Other Claims**\n\nRespondent argues that Alvarado \u201cappears to allege as error the detectives [sic] destruction of their handwritten notes after the information was incorporated into their reports\u201d and \u201cthat the prosecutor failed to memorialize notes from witness interviews\u201d and preserve emails, claims which have not been presented to the state courts. (Doc. No. 88 at 34.) Respondent \u201curges\u201d the Court to dismiss Alvarado\u2019s Amended Petition, rather than stay the case and hold it in abeyance, as Alvarado has not met the requirements under *Rhines v. Weber*, 544 U.S. 269 (2005). (*Id.* at 35.) In the alternative, Respondent asks the Court to allow Alvarado to \u201cdelete\u201d the unexhausted claims from his Amended Petition and proceed with his exhausted claims. (*Id.*)\n\nAlvarado does not directly respond to this argument; rather, Alvarado\u2019s response set forth above applies to Ground Two in its entirety. (Doc. No. 89 at 101-11.) However, in support of his response, Alvarado relies on evidence produced in discovery during this federal habeas proceeding, including the\n\u201cintermingled and incomplete\u201d Wells and Alvarado files from the prosecutor\u2019s office and that the detectives and prosecutors \u201cadmittedly failed to document substantial portions of the investigation and its prosecution (such as Bahner\u2019s interviews with Wells) or to maintain all relevant documents.\u201d (Id. at 105.) As Alvarado admits, \u201c[I]t was not until this Court\u2019s grant of discovery that Alvarado could fully understand how Wells\u2019s changing story aligned with critical stages of his own cases, which were not resolved until after the conclusion of Alvarado\u2019s trial . . . Nor could Alvarado have discovered the Crime Stopper tips, which the State failed to disclose until this Court granted discovery.\u201d (Id. at 106.) Therefore, the factual support for his Brady and Giglio claim has changed as a result of obtaining information in discovery during this habeas case. There is no question this changed factual basis for his claim has not been presented to the state courts.\n\nRespondent argues Alvarado fails to meet the Rhines criteria, but only specifically addresses the \u201cpotentially meritorious\u201d prong. (Doc. No. 88 at 35.) In support of this argument, Respondent points to the fact that \u201c[o]pen file discovery was provided,\u201d Wells\u2019s statements were provided by the Toledo Police Department and so \u201cAlvarado cannot dispute that he was aware of [them],\u201d and \u201cAlvarado cannot cite any United States Supreme Court precedent\u201d that requires police departments to \u201cpreserve handwritten notes in addition to the typed reports incorporating those notes,\u201d nor requiring a prosecutor\u2019s office to \u201cmemorialize interviews or to preserve e-mails where there is no evidence of any exculpatory information.\u201d (Id.)\n\nThere is no question Alvarado did not become aware of this information until well after his initial state post-conviction petition, and only received this information through discovery allowed in this federal habeas proceeding. Cunningham, 756 F.3d at 486. Therefore, the Court finds Alvarado has demonstrated \u201cgood cause\u201d for having failed to exhaust this portion of Ground Two.\nFurther, the Court finds this portion of Ground Two is not \u201cplainly meritless,\u201d i.e., they are potentially meritorious. It is well established that a claim under Brady and its progeny contains three parts: \u201c(1) The evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching; (2) that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; and (3) prejudice must have ensued.\u201d Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281-82 (1999). The Court acknowledges that recantation affidavits are viewed with skepticism. See e.g. Carter v. Mitchell, 443 F.3d 517, 519 (6th Cir. 2006); Byrd v. Collins, 209 F.3d 486, 508 n 16 (6th Cir. 2000). However, given that Wells was the key witness against Alvarado, \u201cthe case largely turned on [Wells\u2019] testimony,\u201d and Alvarado points to further evidence obtained in discovery during this federal habeas proceeding that he maintains support Wells\u2019s recantation affidavit (Doc. No. 89 at 105-06), the Court cannot say, at this stage of the proceedings, that this portion of Alvarado\u2019s Second Ground for Relief is \u201cplainly meritless.\u201d\n\nLastly, the Court finds there is no evidence that Alvarado has engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. Wells executed his recantation affidavit in November 2015, and Alvarado promptly filed his Motion for Leave to file New Trial Motion and Petition for Post-Conviction Relief in state court the following month. Alvarado filed his federal habeas petition on October 20, 2016 and has been diligently pursuing his rights both in the state courts and this court since that time. Accordingly, with respect to the unexhausted portion of Ground Two, Alvarado has satisfied the Rhines standard for a stay and abeyance in this case.\n\n3. **Ground Three**\n\n   a. **Charles Wells Affidavit**\n\n   Respondent argues Alvarado\u2019s claim that the prosecutor knowingly presented false testimony, based in part on claims contained in Wells\u2019 affidavit, is procedurally defaulted as the state courts found\nAlvarado\u2019s filings for post-conviction for relief untimely, which is an adequate and independent state ground to foreclose habeas review. (Doc. No. 88 at 35-36.) Respondent further argues Alvarado fails to demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default, and fails to present any new, reliable evidence to excuse the default. (Id. at 37-39.)\n\nAlvarado combined his response to these arguments with his response to the arguments regarding Ground Two. (Doc. No. 89 at 101-11.)\n\nAs the undersigned recommends staying this case and holding it in abeyance for the reasons set forth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to this portion of Ground Three.\n\nb. Detective Goodlet\u2019s Testimony Regarding Alvarado\u2019s Statements Regarding a Knife\n\nRespondent argues this portion of Ground Three is based on testimony available on the record, trial counsel could have objected to the redactions and asked for more of the exhibit to be played to the jury but did not, and this claim could have been raised on direct review. (Doc. No. 88 at 39.) Respondent further argues Alvarado fails to demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default, and fails to present any new, reliable evidence to excuse the default. (Id. at 40-44.)\n\nAlvarado combined his response to these arguments with his response to the arguments regarding Ground Two. (Doc. No. 89 at 101-11.)\n\nAs the undersigned recommends staying this case and holding it in abeyance for the reasons set forth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to this portion of Ground Three.\n\nc. Video from Bar\n\nRespondent argues this portion of Ground Three could have been raised in a contemporaneous objection at trial and could have been raised on direct review. (Doc. No. 88 at 44.) Respondent further\nargues Alvarado fails to demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the procedural default, and fails to present any new, reliable evidence to excuse the default. (Id. at 44-45.)\n\nAlvarado combined his response to these arguments with his response to the arguments regarding Ground Two. (Doc. No. 89 at 101-11.)\n\nAs the undersigned recommends staying this case and holding it in abeyance for the reasons set forth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to this portion of Ground Three.\n\nd. Detective Goodlet\u2019s Testimony about Tips\n\nRespondent argues that Alvarado\u2019s allegation \u201cthat the State allowed Detective Goodlet to testify falsely that \u2018that [sic] the Toledo Police Department received no tips relating to Henderson\u2019s death\u2019\u201d is procedurally defaulted as it was never raised in the state courts. (Doc. No. 88 at 45.) Respondent \u201curges\u201d the Court to dismiss Alvarado\u2019s Amended Petition, rather than stay the case and hold it in abeyance, as Alvarado has not met the requirements under Rhines v. Weber, 544 U.S. 269 (2005). (Id. at 46.) In the alternative, Respondent asks the Court to allow Alvarado to \u201cdelete\u201d the unexhausted claims from his Amended Petition and proceed with his exhausted claims. (Id. at 47.)\n\nRespondent argues Alvarado cannot show good cause because \u201copen file discovery was provided\u201d and \u201cAlvarado acknowledges that the Crime Stopper Reports, [sic] were obtained from the Lucas County Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s files.\u201d (Doc. No. 88 at 46.) Alvarado asserts:\n\nUntil Wells recanted and this Court granted discovery, Alvarado could not have proven that the prosecutor knowingly solicited false evidence at trial. Respondent seemingly implies that Alvarado was provided the evidence through \u201copen discovery.\u201d Doc. 88, PageID# 3691. \u201cOpen discovery,\u201d however, does not mean that every single record or document possessed by the State is provided to the defense. Indeed, sensitive investigatory records, such as Crime Stopper tips, and records the prosecutor determines are work product are not disclosed. Ohio Crim. R. 16(D) and (J). See Doc. 55 (Lucas County Prosecutor\u2019s Office Motion to Quash, alleging work product and/or law enforcement privilege); Doc. 57 (Toledo Police Department\u2019s Motion to Quash subpoena for \u201cconfidential\u201d Crime Stopper\ntips). There is nothing in the record to suggest that the State disclosed the Crime Stopper tips, Bahner\u2019s case notes, or proof of Wells\u2019s agreement with the State to Alvarado. See United States v. Stifel, 594 F. Supp. 1525, 1540 (N.D. Ohio Oct. 11, 1984) (\u201c[T]he most persuasive indication that the defense did not possess this evidence is the fact that the defense never used this evidence at trial.\u201d).\n\n(Doc. No. 89 at 51-52.)\n\nAlvarado\u2019s argument is well-taken. For purposes of determining whether the \u201cgood cause\u201d factor of the Rhines test has been met, the Court finds Alvarado did not become aware of this information until well after his initial state post-conviction petition, and only received the Crime Stopper Tips through discovery allowed in this federal habeas proceeding. Cunningham, 756 F.3d at 486. Therefore, the Court finds Alvarado has demonstrated \u201cgood cause\u201d for having failed to exhaust this portion of Ground Three.\n\nFurther, the Court finds this portion of Ground Three is not \u201cplainly meritless,\u201d i.e., it is potentially meritorious. In order to establish a Giglio violation, a petitioner must demonstrate that a witness\u2019s statement was false; the statement was material; and the prosecution knew it was false. See Coe v. Bell, 161 F.3d 320, 343 (6th Cir. 1998); Rosencratz v. Lafler, 568 F.3d 577, 583-584 (6th Cir. 2009). The parties dispute how to interpret Detective Goodlet\u2019s testimony. (Doc. No. 88 at 46; Doc. No. 89 at 49.) Alvarado asserts, \u201cEven when specifically asked about receiving information \u2018seven days after\u2019 the homicide, Goodlet mentioned only Wells, not Crime Stopper tips, which, as Respondent concedes, had been received by that point.\u201d (Doc. No. 89 at 49.) Therefore, the Court cannot say, at this stage of the proceedings, that this portion of Alvarado\u2019s Third Ground for Relief is \u201cplainly meritless.\u201d\n\nLastly, the Court finds there is no evidence that Alvarado has engaged in intentionally dilatory litigation tactics. Wells executed his recantation affidavit in November 2015, and Alvarado promptly filed his Motion for Leave to file New Trial Motion and Petition for Post-Conviction Relief in state court the following month. Alvarado filed his federal habeas petition on October 20, 2016 and has been diligently pursuing his rights both in the state courts and this court since that time. Accordingly, with respect to the\nunexhausted portion of Ground Three, Alvarado has satisfied the Rhines standard for a stay and abeyance in this case.\n\n4. **Ground Four**\n\nRespondent argues Alvarado procedurally defaulted his insufficiency of the evidence claim by failing to present this claim on appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio. (Doc. No. 88 at 47.) Respondent further argues Alvarado\u2019s manifest weight of the evidence claim \u201ccannot be deemed inclusive\u201d of his insufficiency of the evidence claim. (Id.)\n\nAlvarado responds that while he framed his claim as a manifest weight of the evidence claim before the Supreme Court of Ohio, \u201cthe substance of his argument was that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence\u201d and he \u201ccited to two leading Supreme Court cases related to sufficiency challenges.\u201d (Doc. No. 89 at 111). Alvarado argues he was not required to present his sufficiency of the evidence claim as a standalone claim in the state courts \u201c[i]n order to fairly present and exhaust his sufficiency of the evidence claim.\u201d (Id.) (citing Whiting, 395 F.3d at 613-15).\n\nAs the undersigned recommends staying this case and holding it in abeyance for the reasons set forth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to Ground Four.\n\n5. **Ground Five**\n\nIn addition to arguing that Alvarado\u2019s free-standing actual innocence claim is non-cognizable on federal habeas review, Respondent further argues this claim is procedurally defaulted as it was first raised in Alvarado\u2019s motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial and petition for postconviction relief, which the state courts found to be untimely, and Alvarado fails to demonstrate cause and prejudice, or new, reliable evidence of actual innocence, to excuse the procedural default. (Doc. No. 88 at 50-53.)\n\nIn response, Alvarado argues the state courts improperly applied a procedural bar to his fifth ground for relief. (Doc. No. 89 at 113.) However, Alvarado asserts that even assuming, arguendo, the\nstate courts properly applied this procedural bar to this claim, he can establish both cause and prejudice. (Id.)\n\nAs the undersigned recommends staying this case and holding it in abeyance for the reasons set forth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to Ground Four.\n\n6. Ground Seven\n\nRespondent argues first that other than Alvarado\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to his attorney\u2019s advice in plea negotiations, his attorney\u2019s failure to talk to Wells, and the alleged conflict of interest, his remaining claims \u201care conclusory without any argument in support.\u201d (Doc. No. 88 at 53.) Respondent further argues Alvarado\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims are procedurally defaulted on the grounds of: raising an issue for the first time before the Supreme Court of Ohio; Alvarado\u2019s 26(B) allocation would not preserve the underlying claims; Alvarado\u2019s memorandum in support of jurisdiction and his 26(B) application were conclusory; his ineffective assistance of counsel claims in his motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial were likewise conclusory and omitted any claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to prosecutorial misconduct; the state courts found Alvarado\u2019s motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial untimely; and Alvarado failed to raise these claims in the first proceeding. (Id. at 54-55.) In addition, Respondent argues Alvarado cannot demonstrate cause and prejudice, or new, reliable evidence of actual innocence, to excuse the default. (Id. at 56.)\n\nAlvarado disputes Respondent\u2019s characterization of his ineffective assistance of counsel claims in his Petition as conclusory. (Doc. No. 89 at 116.) In addition, Alvarado responds he could not have raised his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim in his direct appeal as he was represented by the same lawyer at trial and on appeal. (Id.) Alvarado asserts he properly raised his ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims in his 26(B) application and argues his underlying ineffective assistance of trial counsel\nclaim was preserved because \u201cit would seem the court of appeals undertook a merits analysis.\u201d (Id. at 117.) Alvarado maintains that, even if the Court should find this claim is procedurally defaulted, he can demonstrate cause and prejudice to excuse the default. (Id.) Moreover, Alvarado asserts he \u201chas made a compelling case of actual innocence.\u201d (Id. at 118.)\n\nRespondent maintains that Alvarado\u2019s claims raised in his Amended Traverse that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce the surveillance video in Alvarado\u2019s case in chief and that trial counsel failed to investigate and call witnesses who would have stated they did not see Alvarado with a knife, that they saw Alvarado with two cell phones, and would have provided context to the video were not raised in Alvarado\u2019s initial Petition, Alvarado did not seek to amend his seventh ground for relief, and these claims were not raised in his Amended Petition. (Doc. No. 90 at 41-42.) As a result, Respondent asserts these claims are not properly before the Court. (Id. at 42.) Moreover, Respondent maintains \u201c[t]here is no question that the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel regarding the surveillance video was not raised in the state courts,\u201d even though the claim \u201ccould have been, but was not, raised in Alvarado\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief.\u201d (Id.) Respondent also asserts \u201cthe claim regarding the investigation and witnesses was not fairly presented to the state courts because Alvarado failed to brief and argue both the factual and legal substance of the claim.\u201d (Id.) Respondent further argues that even if these claims had been raised in Alvarado\u2019s motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial, the state courts found that motion and Alvarado\u2019s petition for postconviction relief untimely, and Alvarado fails to demonstrate cause and prejudice, or new, reliable evidence of actual innocence, to excuse the default. (Id.)\n\nAs the undersigned recommends staying this case and holding it in abeyance for the reasons set forth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to Ground Seven.\n7. **Ground Nine**\n\nRespondent argues Alvarado\u2019s claim that he was denied the right to conflict-free counsel has been procedurally defaulted as it was raised for the first time in Alvarado\u2019s motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial, which the state courts found untimely. (Doc. No. 88 at 56-57.) Respondent maintains Alvarado fails to demonstrate cause and prejudice, or new, reliable evidence of actual innocence, to excuse the procedural default. (*Id.* at 58-59.)\n\nIn response, Alvarado argues the state courts improperly applied a procedural bar to his ninth ground for relief. (Doc. No. 89 at 113.) However, Alvarado asserts that even assuming, *arguendo*, the state courts properly applied this procedural bar to this claim, he can establish both cause and prejudice. (*Id.*)\n\nAs the undersigned recommends staying this case and holding it in abeyance for the reasons set forth herein, the Court does not reach the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments with respect to Ground Nine.\n\n**V. Conclusion**\n\nAccordingly, and for all the reasons set forth above, it is recommended that this case be stayed and held in abeyance to allow Alvarado the opportunity to present his unexhausted claims to the state courts. It is further recommended that the stay be granted on the condition that Alvarado (1) file quarterly status reports in this Court regarding the progress of his state court appeal; and (2) seek reinstatement on this Court\u2019s active docket within thirty (30) days of fully exhausting his state court remedies.\n\n**IT IS SO RECOMMENDED.**\n\nDate: December 7, 2020\n\ns/ Jonathan Greenberg\nJonathan D.

Vigluicci , Portage County Prosecutor, and Pamela J. Holder , Assistant \nProsecutor, 241 South Chestnut Street, Ravenna, OH 44266 (For Plaintiff-Appellee). \n \nDavid E. Feathers, pro se, PID# A763-828, Marion Correctional Institution, 940 Marion-\nWilliamsport Road, P.O. Box 57, Marion, OH 43302 (Defendant-Appellant). \n \n \nMATT LYNCH, J. \n{\u00b61} Defendant-appellant, David E. Feathers, appeals from the judgme nt of the \nPortage County Court of Common Pleas, denying his request to wi thdraw his guilty plea.  \nFor the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the lower court.   \n{\u00b62} On November 4, 2004, Feathers was indicted for Aggravated Burgl ary, a \nfelony of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(1) and (2); Felonious Assault, a \nfelony of the second degree, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1)  and (2); and Domestic \nViolence, a felony of the fifth degree, in violation of R.C. 2919.25.  He was convicted of these \noffenses following a jury trial.  On appeal, this court found r eversible error relating to the 2 \n \nCase No. 2021-P-0004 \nadmission of evidence and remanded for a new trial.  State v. Feathers, 11th Dist. Portage \nNo. 2005-P-0039, 2007-Ohio-3024.   \n{\u00b63} Feathers filed a supplemental motion to dismiss the indictment on January 28, \n2008, arguing that the Domestic Violence offense arose from dif ferent circumstances than \nthe other two offenses and it should not be joined with those charges in the indictment.  The \ncourt denied the motion. \n{\u00b64} On January 31, 2008, an amended indictment was issued, which, i nter alia, \nchanged the level of offense for Domestic Violence to a fourth- degree felony.  On May 28, \n2008, Feathers entered a plea of guilty to the offenses as char ged in the amended \nindictment.  He was sentenced to consecutive prison terms of ei ght years for Aggravated \nBurglary, four years for Felonious Assault, and one year for Domestic Violence. \n{\u00b65} After receiving judicial release in 2015, a motion to revoke wa s granted and \nthe trial court issued an October 23, 2019 judgment ordering Fe athers to serve the \nremainder of his prison term.   \n{\u00b66} Feathers filed a December 14, 2020 Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea, asserting \nhis guilty plea was invalid because the indictment was void.  T he trial court denied this \nmotion. \n{\u00b67} On appeal, Feathers raises the following assignments of error: \n{\u00b68} \u201c[1.] The trial court abused its discretion in not properly reviewing jurisdictional \ndefects addressed in the appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his gui lty plea to a void offense to \nthe prejudice of appellant in failing to take corrective measures and to dismiss the indictment \nafter defendant successfully demonstrated that the original ind ictment was obtained on the \nbasis of false or misleading information and an abuse of grand jury by the prosecution, as 3 \n \nCase No. 2021-P-0004 \nwell as prosecutorial misconduct during the course of the pre trial and trial adjudications, the \nnet effect of which permeated the entire course of the proceedings in the trial court including \nbut not limited to the following appeals on remand, and followi ng the guilty plea, conviction \nand sentence.  \n{\u00b69} \u201c[2.]  The appellant unknowingly entered a guilty plea to an in valid amended \nindictment when the jurisdiction of the unrelated domestic viol ence offense was gone.\u201d  \n(Typographical errors edited throughout for clarity.) \n{\u00b610} We will consider Feathers\u2019 assignments of error jointly since t hey both relate \nto whether his guilty pleas wer e intelligently and voluntarily entered when there was an \nallegedly invalid indictment.  Feathers argues that the date an d time of the Domestic \nViolence offense differed from that of the other two offenses a nd, thus, should have been \ncharged in a separate indictment.  He further questions whether  the facts presented to the \ngrand jury regarding the date and location of the Domestic Viol ence offense were accurate \ngiven testimony presented at the trial.   \n{\u00b611} Criminal Rule 32.1 provides that \u201cto correct manifest injustice  the court after \nsentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his \nor her plea.\u201d  \u201cA defendant who seeks to withdraw a plea of gui lty after the imposition of \nsentence has the burden of establishing the existence of manifest injustice.\u201d  State v. Smith, \n49 Ohio St.2d 261, 361 N.E.2d 1324 (1977), paragraph one of the syllabus.  \u201cThis term has \nbeen variously defined, but it is clear that under such standar d, a postsentence withdrawal \nmotion is allowable only in extraordinary cases.\u201d   Id. at 264.  Appellate review of the present \nmatter \u201cis somewhat limited as a motion made pursuant to Crim.R . 32.1 is left to the sound \ndiscretion of the trial court.\u201d  State v. Carabello, 17 Ohio St.3d 66, 67, 477 N.E.2d 627 (1985). 4 \n \nCase No. 2021-P-0004 \n{\u00b612} \u201cRes judicata bars the assertion of claims against a valid, fin al judgment of \nconviction that have been raised or could have been raised on a ppeal.\u201d  State v. Ketterer, \n126 Ohio St.3d 448, 2010-Ohio-3831, 935 N.E.2d 9, \u00b6 59, citing State v. Perry , 10 Ohio \nSt.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph nine of the syllabu s.  \u201c[I]t is well-established \nthat claims raised in a post-sentence motion to withdraw a guil ty plea that were raised or \ncould have been raised in a direct appeal may be barred by res judicata.\u201d  State v. Carnes, \n11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2020-T-0004, 2020-Ohio-3566, \u00b6 14; Ketterer at \u00b6 59.   \n{\u00b613} Feathers raises concerns with the indictment, specifically asse rting that he \nbelieves Domestic Violence should not have been indicted together with the other offenses \ndue to the difference in time and location of the crimes.  This  is an issue that should have \nbeen properly raised in a prior appeal.  See State v. Carnes, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2017-\nT-0088, 2018-Ohio-2075, \u00b6 13 (appellant\u2019s \u201cargument could have been raised in his direct \nappeal, as he relies on information that was known or available  at that time, to wit: the \nallegations on the face of his indictment\u201d).  Of note, Feathers  did raise the related issue of \nwhether the offenses could be joined in one trial in a prior ap peal, which issue this court \nfound had been waived since he failed to renew his motion for severance.  Feathers, 2007-\nOhio-3024, at \u00b6 134-135.  Further, it has been held that issues  relating to the validity of the \nindictment, including the severance of offenses, are waived when a defendant enters a plea \nof guilty to the indictment.  State v. Patterson, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2003CA00135, 2004-Ohio-\n1569, \u00b6 13; see also State v. Heise , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 108286 and 108776, 2020-\nOhio-662, \u00b6 13 (\u201cby failing to timely object to the indictment and by pleading guilty to \naggravated burglary pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, we  find [the defendant] has \nwaived his right to challenge any alleged defect in the indictm ent\u201d).  Thus, Feathers\u2019 5 \n \nCase No. 2021-P-0004 \narguments relating to the indictment have been waived and are barred by the doctrine of res \njudicata. \n{\u00b614} Feathers argues that the doctrine of res judicata does not appl y because the \nindictment was void.  \u201cA judgment of conviction based on an ind ictment which does not \ncharge an offense is void for lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter and may be successfully \nattacked either on direct appeal to a reviewing court or by a collateral proceeding.\u201d  State v. \nCimpritz, 158 Ohio St. 490, 110 N.E.2d 416 (1953), paragraph six of the syllabus.  However, \n\u201c[a] defective indictment renders the charge voidable, not void,\u201d which \u201cdoes not deprive the \ntrial court of subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d  (Citations omitte d.)  State v. Snowden, 11th Dist. \nTrumbull No. 2021-T-0008, 2021-Ohio-2885, \u00b6 14; State ex rel. Rackley v. Sloan, 150 Ohio \nSt.3d 11, 2016-Ohio-3416, 78 N.E.3d 819, \u00b6 9 (challenges to the validity or sufficiency of an \nindictment are \u201cnonjurisdictional in nature\u201d) (citation omitted ).  A void indictment has been \ndescribed as one \u201csetting forth facts which in no conceivable f orm can constitute a criminal \noffense; or if they might constitute an offense, the court issu ing the process had no \njurisdiction over such offense or the person charged with the o ffense.\u201d  Id. at \u00b6 16, citing \nBrinkman v. Drolesbaugh, 97 Ohio St. 171, 119 N.E. 451 (1918), syllabus.  In contrast,  a \nvoidable indictment is one where \u201ca bona fide attempt has been made to charge a possible \noffense under the statute, but by reason of some defect or irregularity such charge is per se \ninsufficient in law.\u201d  Id. \n{\u00b615} Here, there is no question the offense of Domestic Violence as charged in the \nindictment was a valid offense and Feathers has made no demonst ration that the court \nlacked jurisdiction.  The fact that Feathers believed this offe nse should have been severed 6 \n \nCase No. 2021-P-0004 \nfrom the others does not render the indictment void.  Thus, the  doctrine of res judicata \napplies.   \n{\u00b616} Feathers also contends the domestic violence offense \u201cwas not p resented to \nthe grand jury with the facts that were based on the alleged ch arges.\u201d  This appears to be \nbased on his assertion that facts presented at his 2005 trial e stablished a different location \nof the offenses than the indictment.  This argument is somewhat unclear since the indictment \ndoes not state the specific location of the domestic violence o ffense except to indicate that \nit occurred in Portage County.  Nonetheless, to the extent that  Feathers attempts to raise \nissues with the evidence presented at trial, we emphasize that the convictions resulting from \nthat trial were reversed and Feathers chose to enter a guilty p lea to each of the charges in \nthe amended indictment.  There are no grounds to compare the facts presented at a trial to \nthose presented to the grand jury.  Similarly, to the extent Feathers appears to raise an issue \nwith venue and jurisdiction relating to the location of the off enses, as noted above, the \nindictment alleged that the offenses occurred in Portage County  and Feathers entered a \nplea of guilty under this indictment in the proper venue of the  Portage County Court of \nCommon Pleas.   \n{\u00b617} Feathers\u2019 first and second assignments of error are without merit. \n{\u00b618} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Portage County C ourt of \nCommon Pleas, denying Feathers\u2019 request to withdraw his guilty plea, is affirmed.

Feathers, appeals from the judgment of the\nPortage County Court of Common Pleas, denying his request to withdraw his guilty plea.\nFor the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the lower court.\n\n{\u00b62} On November 4, 2004, Feathers was indicted for Aggravated Burglary, a\nfelony of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2911.11(A)(1) and (2); Felonious Assault, a\nfelony of the second degree, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) and (2); and Domestic\nViolence, a felony of the fifth degree, in violation of R.C. 2919.25. He was convicted of these\noffenses following a jury trial. On appeal, this court found reversible error relating to the\nadmission of evidence and remanded for a new trial. *State v. Feathers*, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2005-P-0039, 2007-Ohio-3024.\n\n{\u00b63} Feathers filed a supplemental motion to dismiss the indictment on January 28, 2008, arguing that the Domestic Violence offense arose from different circumstances than the other two offenses and it should not be joined with those charges in the indictment. The court denied the motion.\n\n{\u00b64} On January 31, 2008, an amended indictment was issued, which, inter alia, changed the level of offense for Domestic Violence to a fourth-degree felony. On May 28, 2008, Feathers entered a plea of guilty to the offenses as charged in the amended indictment. He was sentenced to consecutive prison terms of eight years for Aggravated Burglary, four years for Felonious Assault, and one year for Domestic Violence.\n\n{\u00b65} After receiving judicial release in 2015, a motion to revoke was granted and the trial court issued an October 23, 2019 judgment ordering Feathers to serve the remainder of his prison term.\n\n{\u00b66} Feathers filed a December 14, 2020 Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea, asserting his guilty plea was invalid because the indictment was void. The trial court denied this motion.\n\n{\u00b67} On appeal, Feathers raises the following assignments of error:\n\n{\u00b68} \u201c[1.] The trial court abused its discretion in not properly reviewing jurisdictional defects addressed in the appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to a void offense to the prejudice of appellant in failing to take corrective measures and to dismiss the indictment after defendant successfully demonstrated that the original indictment was obtained on the basis of false or misleading information and an abuse of grand jury by the prosecution, as\nwell as prosecutorial misconduct during the course of the pre trial and trial adjudications, the net effect of which permeated the entire course of the proceedings in the trial court including but not limited to the following appeals on remand, and following the guilty plea, conviction and sentence.\n\n{\u00b69} \u201c[2.] The appellant unknowingly entered a guilty plea to an invalid amended indictment when the jurisdiction of the unrelated domestic violence offense was gone.\u201d (Typographical errors edited throughout for clarity.)\n\n{\u00b610} We will consider Feathers\u2019 assignments of error jointly since they both relate to whether his guilty pleas were intelligently and voluntarily entered when there was an allegedly invalid indictment. Feathers argues that the date and time of the Domestic Violence offense differed from that of the other two offenses and, thus, should have been charged in a separate indictment. He further questions whether the facts presented to the grand jury regarding the date and location of the Domestic Violence offense were accurate given testimony presented at the trial.\n\n{\u00b611} Criminal Rule 32.1 provides that \u201cto correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.\u201d \u201cA defendant who seeks to withdraw a plea of guilty after the imposition of sentence has the burden of establishing the existence of manifest injustice.\u201d State v. Smith, 49 Ohio St.2d 261, 361 N.E.2d 1324 (1977), paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cThis term has been variously defined, but it is clear that under such standard, a postsentence withdrawal motion is allowable only in extraordinary cases.\u201d Id. at 264. Appellate review of the present matter \u201cis somewhat limited as a motion made pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1 is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d State v. Carabello, 17 Ohio St.3d 66, 67, 477 N.E.2d 627 (1985).\n\u201cRes judicata bars the assertion of claims against a valid, final judgment of conviction that have been raised or could have been raised on appeal.\u201d State v. Ketterer, 126 Ohio St.3d 448, 2010-Ohio-3831, 935 N.E.2d 9, \u00b6 59, citing State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph nine of the syllabus. \u201c[I]t is well-established that claims raised in a post-sentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea that were raised or could have been raised in a direct appeal may be barred by res judicata.\u201d State v. Carnes, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2020-T-0004, 2020-Ohio-3566, \u00b6 14; Ketterer at \u00b6 59.\n\nFeathers raises concerns with the indictment, specifically asserting that he believes Domestic Violence should not have been indicted together with the other offenses due to the difference in time and location of the crimes. This is an issue that should have been properly raised in a prior appeal. See State v. Carnes, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2017-T-0088, 2018-Ohio-2075, \u00b6 13 (appellant\u2019s \u201cargument could have been raised in his direct appeal, as he relies on information that was known or available at that time, to wit: the allegations on the face of his indictment\u201d). Of note, Feathers did raise the related issue of whether the offenses could be joined in one trial in a prior appeal, which issue this court found had been waived since he failed to renew his motion for severance. Feathers, 2007-Ohio-3024, at \u00b6 134-135. Further, it has been held that issues relating to the validity of the indictment, including the severance of offenses, are waived when a defendant enters a plea of guilty to the indictment. State v. Patterson, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2003CA00135, 2004-Ohio-1569, \u00b6 13; see also State v. Heise, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 108286 and 108776, 2020-Ohio-662, \u00b6 13 (\u201cby failing to timely object to the indictment and by pleading guilty to aggravated burglary pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, we find [the defendant] has waived his right to challenge any alleged defect in the indictment\u201d). Thus, Feathers'\narguments relating to the indictment have been waived and are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\n\n\u00b614 Feathers argues that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply because the indictment was void. \u201cA judgment of conviction based on an indictment which does not charge an offense is void for lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter and may be successfully attacked either on direct appeal to a reviewing court or by a collateral proceeding.\u201d State v. Cimpritz, 158 Ohio St. 490, 110 N.E.2d 416 (1953), paragraph six of the syllabus. However, \u201c[a] defective indictment renders the charge voidable, not void,\u201d which \u201cdoes not deprive the trial court of subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d (Citations omitted.) State v. Snowden, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2021-T-0008, 2021-Ohio-2885, \u00b6 14; State ex rel. Rackley v. Sloan, 150 Ohio St.3d 11, 2016-Ohio-3416, 78 N.E.3d 819, \u00b6 9 (challenges to the validity or sufficiency of an indictment are \u201cnonjurisdictional in nature\u201d) (citation omitted). A void indictment has been described as one \u201csetting forth facts which in no conceivable form can constitute a criminal offense; or if they might constitute an offense, the court issuing the process had no jurisdiction over such offense or the person charged with the offense.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 16, citing Brinkman v. Drolesbaugh, 97 Ohio St. 171, 119 N.E. 451 (1918), syllabus. In contrast, a voidable indictment is one where \u201ca bona fide attempt has been made to charge a possible offense under the statute, but by reason of some defect or irregularity such charge is per se insufficient in law.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b615 Here, there is no question the offense of Domestic Violence as charged in the indictment was a valid offense and Feathers has made no demonstration that the court lacked jurisdiction. The fact that Feathers believed this offense should have been severed\nfrom the others does not render the indictment void. Thus, the doctrine of res judicata applies.\n\n{\u00b616} Feathers also contends the domestic violence offense \u201cwas not presented to the grand jury with the facts that were based on the alleged charges.\u201d This appears to be based on his assertion that facts presented at his 2005 trial established a different location of the offenses than the indictment. This argument is somewhat unclear since the indictment does not state the specific location of the domestic violence offense except to indicate that it occurred in Portage County. Nonetheless, to the extent that Feathers attempts to raise issues with the evidence presented at trial, we emphasize that the convictions resulting from that trial were reversed and Feathers chose to enter a guilty plea to each of the charges in the amended indictment. There are no grounds to compare the facts presented at a trial to those presented to the grand jury. Similarly, to the extent Feathers appears to raise an issue with venue and jurisdiction relating to the location of the offenses, as noted above, the indictment alleged that the offenses occurred in Portage County and Feathers entered a plea of guilty under this indictment in the proper venue of the Portage County Court of Common Pleas.\n\n{\u00b617} Feathers\u2019 first and second assignments of error are without merit.\n\n{\u00b618} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Portage County Court of Common Pleas, denying Feathers\u2019 request to withdraw his guilty plea, is affirmed.

{"Index": "290-Rock", "Context": " \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nNORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO \nEASTERN DIVISION \n \nOn July 16, 2014, David Rock drove his car into a guardrail and fled the scene.  When \npolice caught up to him, he admitted taking Oxycontin and Prozac, and a breathalyzer test \nshowed a blood alcohol content of .177.  Rock pleaded guilty to operating a vehicle under the \ninfluence (\u201cOVI\u201d) and to an Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2941.1413 specification for previously having \nbeen convicted of 5 OVI offenses in 20 years (\u201c5 in 20 specification\u201d).  And he was sentenced to \nan aggregate seven-year sentence2.  Rock now seeks a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2254 (ECF Doc. 1), raising three claims:  \nGround One: Rock\u2019s conviction on the 5 in 20 specification was unconstitutional \nbecause two of the underlying OVI convictions were the result of uncounseled \npleas (ECF Doc. 1 at 5; ECF Doc. 1-2 at 9-11);  \n \n1 This matter is before me by an automatic order of reference under Local Rule 72.2 for preparation of a \nreport and recommendation pursuant to Local Rule 72.1, as well as by an express order of referral.  ECF \nDoc. 6. \n2 Rock was originally sentenced to serve his prison terms consecutive to a sentence imposed in a different \ncase by the Ashland County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas.  After the Ohio Court of Appeals reversed the \nsentence because the trial court failed to make the requisite statutory findings for imposing a consecutive \nsentence, the case was remanded for resentencing.  Upon further consideration, the trial court elected not \nto order Rock\u2019s prison terms to be served consecutive to his Ashland County sentence.  Nothing about \nthat turn of events is raised as an issue in this action. \nDAVID V.

Maryland, 373 U.S. \n83 (1963), evidence that two of Rock\u2019s prior OVI convictions were uncounseled \n(ECF Doc. 1 at 8; ECF Doc. 1-2 at 13-15). \n \nRespondent Warden LaShann Eppinger filed a return of writ on June 1, 2020.  (ECF Doc. 12).  \nAnd Rock filed a traverse on October 20, 2020 (ECF Doc. 18), to which Warden Eppinger has \nfiled a reply (ECF Doc. 19).   \n Because all of Rock\u2019s claims are procedurally defaulted, I recommend that all of Rock\u2019s \nclaims be DISMISSED and that his petition for writ of habeas corpus be DENIED.

Trial Court  \nOn November 12, 2014, a Lake County, Ohio, grand jury charged Rock with two counts \nof OVI and one count of leaving the scene of an accident.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 13-15.  The OVI \noffenses each had a 5 in 20 specification attached, based on Rock\u2019s five prior OVI convictions, \nincluding his: (1) November 6, 1995 conviction in Willoughby Municipal Court Case No. \n95C09727; and (2) May 22, 1997 conviction in Willoughby Municipal Court Case No. \n97C03446.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 13-14.  Rock pleaded not guilty.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 16.  \nOn February 23, 2015, Rock changed his plea.  ECF Doc. 12-5 at 4-5.  After a plea \ncolloquy, Rock pleaded guilty to one count of OVI and a 5 in 20 specification.  ECF Doc. 12-5 at \n7-38.  The trial court accepted Rock\u2019s plea, found him guilty and dismissed the remaining \ncharges..  ECF Doc. 12-5 at 38-39; ECF Doc. 12-1 at 32.  \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  2 of 28.  PageID #: 14083 \n \nRock expressed some doubt about the number of prior OVI convictions at his March 26, \n2015 sentencing hearing.  ECF Doc. 12-5 at 60-62, 70.  He confirmed his intention to plead \nguilty to the 5 in 20 specification but said counsel had advised him that \u2013 had they spoken sooner \n\u2013 counsel could have looked into his predicate OVI convictions.  ECF Doc. 12-5 at 72-73.  \nCounsel interjected to say: \nYour Honor, I think what he\u2019s trying to explain to you is that when he entered the \npleas on the priors, he\u2019s telling me after he entered the plea on this case that he \ndidn\u2019t have an attorney and that the Court didn\u2019t advise him that he had \nvoluntarily waived that right.  And that\u2019s why I told him not to pursue that one. \n \nECF Doc. 12-5 at 73-74.  The court sentenced Rock to a 4-year mandatory prison term on the 5 \nin 20 specification and a consecutive 3-year prison term on the OVI charge.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at \n32-33; ECF Doc. 12-5 at 82.     \nB. Direct Appeal \nOn April 29, 2015, Rock timely appealed his convictions to the Ohio Court of Appeals.  \nECF Doc. 12-1 at 46.  Through new counsel, Rock filed a merits brief, arguing that: (1) the trial \ncourt failed to make the requisite statutory findings before imposing a sentence consecutive to \nanother county\u2019s sentence; and (2) the court failed to consider the statutory factors in fashioning \nits sentence.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 55-70.  The state filed an appellee brief.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 71-\n82.  On November 9, 2015, the Ohio Court of Appeals sustained Rock\u2019s first assignment of error \nand reversed and remanded so that the trial court could make the findings needed to justify a \nconsecutive sentence.  ECF Doc. 12 at 83-87; State v. Rock, 2015-Ohio-4639 (Ohio Ct. App. \n2015). \nOn December 8, 2015, the trial court ordered that Rock\u2019s sentence be served concurrent \nto his Ashland County sentence.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 91.  On February 19, 2016, the Ohio Court of \nAppeals granted Rock leave to file a delayed appeal.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 101-05, 112-13.  \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  3 of 28.  PageID #: 14094 \n \nThrough new counsel, Rock filed a merits brief, asserting three assignments of error, none of \nwhich is relevant to Rock\u2019s current petition.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 118-35.  The state filed an \nappellee brief.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 136-45.  On December 30, 2016, the Ohio Court of Appeals \noverruled Rock\u2019s assignments of error and affirmed Rock\u2019s convictions and sentences.  ECF \nDoc. 12-1 at 146-152; State v. Rock, 2016-Ohio-8516 (Ohio Ct. App. 2016).  On May 14, 2017, \nRock filed an untimely notice of appeal with the Ohio Supreme Court and amotion for leave to \nfile a delayed appeal.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 154-61.  On May 17, 2017, the Ohio Supreme Court \ndenied the motion.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 171. \nC. First App. R. 26(B) Application to Reopen \n \nMeanwhile, on February 8, 2016, Rock filed a pro se application to reopen his direct \nappeal pursuant to Ohio App. R. 26(B), alleging \u2013 as relevant here \u2013 that appellate counsel was \nineffective for: (1) not investigating the predicate convictions that the state offered to support \nRock\u2019s 5 in 20 specification; and (2) not raising trial counsel\u2019s failure to challenge his 5 in 20 \nspecification.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 172-75.  In support of his first proposed issue, Rock argued that \nappellate counsel had failed to collaterally attack his November 16, 1995 OVI conviction as \nunconstitutional for lack of a waiver of counsel and his May 22, 1997 OVI conviction for non-\ncompliance with Ohio Crim. R. 22 and 44.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 174.  He further argued that \nappellate counsel had mailed him evidence showing that his 5 in 20 specification was \nunconstitutional.  Id.  In support of his second proposed issue, Rock argued \u2013 without elaboration \n\u2013 that trial counsel erroneously informed the trial court at sentencing about his uncounseled OVI \nconvictions.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 175. \nRock attached to his application to reopen a September 29, 2010 affidavit, stating that his \nNovember 16, 1995 OVI conviction was the result of a no contest plea made without counsel or \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  4 of 28.  PageID #: 14105 \n \nan explanation of his rights and consequences of entering a plea.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 178.  He \nstated his May 22, 1997 OVI conviction also was the result of a no contest plea without counsel \nand an explanation of his rights and consequences of his plea, but he had signed a \u201cboilerplate \nwaiver of counsel form.\u201d  Id.  Rock also attached the judgment entry from his November 16, \n1995 OVI conviction, adjudicating him guilty after a no contest plea.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 179.  At \nthe top, the judgment stated, \u201cDefendant appeared.  Constitutional rights and pleas explained.\u201d  \nECF Doc. 12-1 at 179, 181.  A separate, undated judgment entry stated that Rock pleaded not \nguilty and waived an attorney on November 2, 1995.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 181.  \nAnd Rock attached the affidavit of Kenneth Sutherland (Chief Bailiff of the Willoughby \nMunicipal Court) dated September 3, 2010.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 180.  An attorney had requested \nthat Sutherland locate and produce any and all audio documentation related to Rock\u2019s criminal \nproceeding in Case Nos. 95C09727 and 97C03446.  Id.  But the audio recordings of the \nproceedings were destroyed in the normal course of the court\u2019s business and no longer existed.  \nId.  Thus, Sutherland stated, the court could not establish that a plea colloquy occurred or that \nRock voluntarily waived his right to counsel in either case.  Id. \nThe state filed an opposition to Rock\u2019s application to reopen.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 186-95.  \nOn June 30, 2016, the Ohio Court of Appeals denied Rock\u2019s application to reopen.  ECF Doc. \n12-1 at 208-12.  The court reasoned: \n[Rock] had the opportunity to raise the issue of his prior uncounseled \nmisdemeanor convictions on appeal in both Lake County Common Pleas Case \nNo. 97CR000363 and \u2026 Case No. 02CR000085.  [Rock] did not file a direct \nappeal in Case No. 97CR000363.  He filed a direct appeal in Case No. \n02CR000085, but it was dismissed for failure to prosecute.  In both cases [Rock] \nfiled motions for postconviction relief, claiming that his misdemeanor convictions \nwere uncounseled.  Both motions were denied, with both decisions citing that his \nclaims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.  [Rock] never raised the issue \nof his uncounseled prior convictions on direct appeal of his motions for \npostconviction relief, and those issues were barred by the doctrine of res judicata \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  5 of 28.  PageID #: 14116 \n \nfrom being raised at trial or on appeal in the present case.  Therefore, appellate \ncounsel was not ineffective for not investigating the allegedly uncounseled priors \nand for not raising the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. \n \nECF Doc. 12-1 at 210-11. \n On July 25, 2016, Rock moved for reconsideration of the denial of his application to \nreopen his direct appeal.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 213-18.  The state filed a response in opposition.  \nECF Doc. 12-1 at 219-222.  On August 15, 2016, the Ohio Court of Appeals denied Rock\u2019s \nmotion for reconsideration as untimely and, alternatively, for failure to establish obvious error or \noversight.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 223-24. \n On September 26, 2016, Rock filed a notice of appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.  ECF \nDoc. 12-1 at 224-27.  In his memorandum in support of jurisdiction, Rock largely reiterated the \narguments he raised in his application to reopen.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 228-39.  On January 25, \n2017, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to accept jurisdiction over the case.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at \n263.  \nD. Petition for Postconviction Relief \nWhile his first application to reopen was still pending with the Ohio Court of Appeals, \nRock filed on June 10, 2016, a pro se petition for postconviction relief in the trial court, raising \nfour grounds for relief, two of which are relevant to his current petition.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 299-\n312.  First, Rock argued that trial counsel was ineffective when he told the trial court at \nsentencing that he had voluntarily waived his right to counsel.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 301-02.  He \nargued that counsel failed to investigate evidence showing that he had no counsel and that there \nwere no audio recordings of his plea colloquies in Case Nos. 95C09727 and 97C03446.  Id.  Had \ncounsel investigated Rock\u2019s prior OVI convictions and withdrawn his guilty plea before \nsentencing, Rock argued that the state likely would have dismissed the 5 in 20 specification.  Id.   \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  6 of 28.  PageID #: 14127 \n \nSecond, Rock claimed that the prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct when he \nsigned an indictment charging Rock with a 5 in 20 specification while knowing that two of the \nfive predicate convictions were uncounseled.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 303-04.  He argued that this \ninformation was not made available to the trial court; and, if it had it been, the specification \nwould have been dismissed.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 304. \nThe state filed a response in opposition.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 341-49.  On July 26, 2016, the \ntrial court denied Rock\u2019s petition as untimely because the transcript was filed in the Ohio Court \nof Appeals on June 8, 2015, making the deadline for filing a petition for postconviction relief \nJune 7, 2016.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 350.  Alternatively, the court found that the claims Rock raised \ntherein would be barred by res judicata.  Id.   \nOn December 7, 2016, Rock filed an Ohio Civ. R. 60(B) motion for relief from the trial \ncourt\u2019s July 26, 2016 judgment.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 400.  He argued that he timely delivered his \npostconviction motion for mailing on June 3, 2016, but due to delays in the prison mail system, it \nwas not mailed until June 6, 2016 and \u2013 consequently \u2013 not received by the court until June 10, \n2016.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 401.  And a three-day extension to the due date, he argued, should be \nafforded under Ohio App. R. 14(C).  Id.  He also argued that a claim of ineffective assistance of \ncounsel was not always barred by res judicata.  Id.   \nThe state filed a response.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 404-07.  On December 28, 2016, the trial \ncourt summarily denied Rock\u2019s motion.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 408.  On January 17, 2017, Rock filed \na notice of appeal.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 411.  He filed a merits brief, arguing that the trial court \nshould have applied Ohio Civ. R. 6(E) and add three days to the filing deadline for service \neffected by mail.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 421-22.  The state filed an appellee brief.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at \n425-32.    \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  7 of 28.  PageID #: 14138 \n \nOn August 2, 2017, the Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed, determining that Rock could not \nuse a Rule 60(B) motion as a substitute for a timely appeal and he failed to demonstrate that the \ntrial court would have granted his petition for postconviction relief had the Rule 60(B) motion \nbeen granted.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 433-37.   \nOn September 18, 2017, Rock appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at \n505-06.  In his memorandum in support of jurisdiction and amended memorandum, he largely \nreiterated the arguments raised in his court of appeals merits brief.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 508-10, \n520-24.  On January 31, 2018, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to exercise jurisdiction.  ECF \nDoc. 12-1 at 532. \nE. Second App. R. 26(B) Application to Reopen \nWhile his appeal from the denial of his Rule 60(B) motion was pending, Rock filed pro \nse on June 22, 2017 a second Ohio App. R. 26(B) application to reopen his direct criminal appeal \nand his appeal after remand.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 264.  Rock alleged that the prosecutor withheld \nexculpatory mitigating sentence, in violation of Brady: that 2 of the 5 in 20 specification OVI \npredicates were uncounseled misdemeanor convictions and therefore could not be used for \nenhancement purposes.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 265.  Rock argued that: (i) had the uncounseled nature \nof his prior convictions been brought to light, (ii) the prosecutor not misled the grand jury and \nthe trial court, and (iii) the prosecutor not violated Ohio Evid. R. 16.1, his counsel would have \nmoved to strike the 5 in 20 specification.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 266.  In passing, Rock added that \ntrial counsel should have investigated his prior OVI convictions.  Id.  Rock attached to his \napplication the same judgment entries and affidavits he had attached to his first Rule 26(B) \napplication.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 267-70.   \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  8 of 28.  PageID #: 14149 \n \nThe state filed a response in opposition.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 275-79.  Rock filed a reply \nwith new supporting evidence.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 282-84.  Among them was an August 2, 2016 \nletter from his appellate attorney in his post-remand appeal responding to Rock\u2019s request that she \nraise the issue of his uncounseled prior OVI convictions.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 285-88.  Counsel \nwrote that she could not raise the issue because it was not raised in the trial court.  ECF Doc. 12-\n1 at 285-86. \nOn July 21, 2017, the Ohio Court of Appeals denied Rock\u2019s second application to reopen \nas untimely and because he failed to demonstrate good cause for the late filing.  ECF Doc. 12-1 \nat 295-96.  Rock did not further appeal the decision to the Ohio Supreme Court.  Docket for Ohio \nApp. Ct., 11th Dist. Case Nos. 2015-L-047, 2016-L-011. \nF. Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea  \nWhile his second application to reopen was pending, Rock filed on June 22, 2017 a pro se \nmotion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Ohio Crim. R. 32.1, arguing that the prosecutor \nwithheld evidence that two of his predicate OVI convictions were uncounseled and could not be \nused to enhance his sentence and that trial counsel was ineffective for not investigating the \nmatter.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 13-15.  The state filed a response.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 24-28. \nOn July 19, 2017, the trial court denied Rock\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, \nreasoning: \nHere, [Rock\u2019s] exhibits include his own affidavit, dated September 29, 2010, \naverring that the two complained of prior convictions were uncounseled and that \nhe was not properly advised of his rights.  Thus, assuming arguendo that these \nprior convictions were uncounseled, the defendant was aware of that at least by \nSeptember 29, 2010.  Therefore, the defendant was aware of the information that \nforms the basis of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and could have raised \nthis issue in a motion to dismiss before this court, at trial, had he elected to try this \ncase rather than plea, or on either of his two appeals.  Thus, this issue is barred by \nres judicata.   \n \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  9 of 28.  PageID #: 141510 \n \nECF Doc. 12-2 at 31-32. \n \n On July 31, 2017, Rock moved for reconsideration, reiterating the merits of his claims.  \nECF Doc. 12-2 at 50-51.  On August 30, 2017, the trial court summarily denied the motion.  ECF \nDoc. 12-2 at 61.  Rock appealed.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 74-81.  The state filed an appellee brief.  \nECF Doc. 12-2 at 86-94.  On December 29, 2017, the Ohio Court of Appeals dismissed Rock\u2019s \nappeal, ruling that he could not appeal the denial of his motion for reconsideration because a \nmotion for reconsideration of a final, appealable order (a motion to withdraw a guilty plea) is a \nnullity.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 95-97.   \n On January 31, 2018, Rock filed a motion for a delayed appeal of the order denying his \nmotion to withdraw his guilty plea.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 111-13, 117-22.  On March 14, 2018, the \nOhio Court of Appeals granted Rock\u2019s motion.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 123-24.   \n Rock then filed a merits brief, raising three assignments of error, two of which are \nrelevant to his current petition: (1) trial counsel was ineffective for not investigating his prior \nOVI convictions; and (2) the state committed prosecutorial misconduct by concealing from the \ngrand jury, the trial court, and trial counsel the constitutionally infirm nature of his prior OVI \nconvictions.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 141.  In support, Rock largely reiterated his arguments that trial \ncounsel should have investigated his prior OVI convictions and trial counsel\u2019s statements at \nsentencing were false.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 147, 148-49, 151.  He added that trial counsel should \nalso have objected, moved to suppress, moved to dismiss the indictment.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 151-\n52. \nIn support of his second argument, Rock contended that the state failed to properly \npresent and explain the judgment entries of his 5 in 20 specification OVI predicates.  ECF Doc. \n12-2 at 153.  He argued that when proof of a prior conviction was an element to an offense, Ohio \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  10 of 28.  PageID #: 141611 \n \nRev. Code \u00a7 2945.75(B)(1) required a certified copy of the entry of judgment of the prior \nconviction and other evidence to identify the defendant in the prior case.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 149.  \nBut under \u00a7 2945.75(B)(2) and the best evidence rule, he argued, the state provided incomplete \nrecords that lacked sufficient information to the grand jury for them to determine whether his \nprior OVI convictions could be used in his current OVI charge.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 148-49. \nThe state filed an appellee brief.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 169-78.  On October 15, 2018, the \nOhio Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of Rock\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty \nplea.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 179-83.  The court reasoned: \n{\u00b613} Attached to [Rock\u2019s] Crim. R. 32.1 motion was his own affidavit dated \nSeptember 29, 2010.  [Rock] averred that when he entered a plea of no contest in \nthe 1995 case, he appeared without counsel, did not waive his right to counsel, \nand was not informed of the consequences of entering a plea of no contest.  He \nfurther averred that when he entered a plea of no contest in the 1997 case, he \nappeared without counsel and signed a \u201cboilerplate waiver of counsel form\u201d but \nwas not informed of his rights or of the consequences of entering a plea of no \ncontest.  [Rock] was therefore aware of the alleged uncounseled convictions since \nSeptember 29, 2010.  Further, the record reflects defense counsel raised in the \ntrial court the issue of [Rock\u2019s] previous pleas.  During [Rock\u2019s] sentencing \nhearing, defense counsel stated: \u201cYour honor, I think what he\u2019s trying to explain \nto you is that when he entered the pleas on the priors, he\u2019s telling me after he \nentered the plea on this case that he didn\u2019t have an attorney and that the Court \ndidn\u2019t advise him that he had voluntarily waived that right.  And that\u2019s why I told \nhim not to pursue that one.\u201d  Thus, [Rock] could have raised the issues pertaining \nto ineffective assistance of counsel and the state\u2019s withholding exculpatory \nevidence in his direct appeal.  He did not.  *** Consequently, the issues are barred \nby res judicata.   \n \nECF Doc. 12-2 at 182-83. \n \n On October 26, 2018, Rock filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the Ohio \nCourt of Appeals misapplied res judicata to preclude review of his claims because appellate \ncounsel had been Rock\u2019s attorney in Case No. 97CR363, and she had a conflict of interest in \nraising her own deficient performance in that prior case.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 188.  He also argued \nthat a Brady claim could not be barred by res judicata.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 189.   \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  11 of 28.  PageID #: 141712 \n \n The state filed an opposition to Rock\u2019s motion for reconsideration.   ECF Doc. 12-2 at \n191-93.  Rock filed a reply, reiterating the merits of his claims.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 194-97.  On \nDecember 10, 2018, the Ohio Court of Appeals denied Rock\u2019s motion, reaffirming its prior \ndetermination that res judicata barred consideration of Rock\u2019s claims.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 199-\n200. \n Meanwhile, on October 29, 2018, Rock filed a notice of appeal in the Ohio Supreme \nCourt, seeking to appeal the Ohio Court of Appeals\u2019 October 15, 2018 decision.  ECF Doc. 12-2 \nat 201-02.  In his memorandum in support of jurisdiction, he largely reiterated the same issues \nand supporting arguments he raised in his merits brief.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 203-21. \n On December 26, 2018, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to exercise jurisdiction.  ECF \nDoc. 12-2 at 232.   \nG. Motion to Vacate  \nWhile his motion to withdraw his guilty plea pending, Rock filed on December 6, 2017, a \nmotion to vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment, under Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B)(5) on the basis that his \nindictment was defective because two of his predicate OVI convictions were constitutionally \ninfirm.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 233-34.  The state filed a response, and Rock filed a reply.  ECF Doc. \n12-2 at 243-48.  On December 28, 2017, the trial court summarily denied Rock\u2019s motion.  ECF \nDoc. 12-2 at 249.  Rock filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied in a February 7, 2018 \ndecision.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 252-54, 256.  Rock did not appeal.  Docket for Lake Cnty. Ct. of \nComm. Pl. Case No. 14CR525.   \nH. State Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus  \nOn March 21, 2018, Rock filed a pro se state petition for writ of habeas corpus, which \nwas later dismissed pursuant to his notice of voluntary dismissal on April 23, 2018.  ECF Doc. \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  12 of 28.  PageID #: 141813 \n \n12-3 at 13-42.  On May 4, 2018, Rock filed a second pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus.  \nECF Doc. 12-3 at 43.  He argued that the grand jury that issued the indictment in his May 22, \n1997 case lacked probable cause to enhance his misdemeanor offense into a felony.  ECF Doc. \n12-3 at 44.  He also argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to indict him on a 5 in 20 \nspecification because two of his predicate OVI convictions were uncounseled and the result of \nimproper plea colloquies.  ECF Doc. 12-3 at 44-48.  The state moved to dismiss.  ECF Doc. 12-3 \nat 62-69.  And Rock filed a reply.  ECF Doc. 12-3 at 71-73.     \nOn July 23, 2018, the Ohio Court of Appeals granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, \nbecause Rock previously could have challenged the validity of the indictment on direct or \ncollateral review.  ECF Doc. 12-3 at 80-82.  On August 10, 2018, Rock filed a notice of appeal \nwith the Ohio Supreme Court.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 13-14.  In his supporting memorandum of law, \nRock raised two propositions of law:  \n1st Proposition of Law: Was it an abus[e] of discretion and fraud upon the Court \nfor [the] prosecutor to withhold documents and negate R.C.2945.75(B)(1) and \nR.C.2945.75(B)(3)? \n \n2nd Proposition of [L]aw: Did the 11th Dist. abuse its discretion by dismissing \n[Rock\u2019s] petition where relief can be granted?  And just as important did the \njudges dismiss their judicial duty of petitions Great Writ? \n \nECF Doc. 12-4 at 44.  In support, he reiterated his jurisdictional challenge to the grand jury \nindictment, adding that the prosecutor withheld documents showing that his OVI predicate \nconvictions were unconstitutional.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 50-51.   \n On October 19, 2018, the Ohio Supreme Court determined that the appeal should proceed \nas an appeal of right.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 71.  Rock thereafter filed a merits brief, raising four \npropositions of law, three of which are relevant to his current petition:  \n1st Proposition of Law: \u201cConstitutionally infirm\u201d conviction(s) cannot be used \nfor enhancement, as they are void from the start ***. \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  13 of 28.  PageID #: 141914 \n \n \n2nd Proposition of Law: Prosecutorial misconduct; Brady violation(s) as \nprosecutor used \u201cConstitutionally Infirm\u201d convictions \nto mislead the grand jury, commit Fraud Upon the \nCourt and deceived the defense, all ethical violations \nand violation of criminal procedure(s). \n \n3rd Proposition of Law: Ineffective assistance of counsel resulted from the \nfailure to investigate and failure to suppress \nuncounseled convictions, thus violating [Rock\u2019s] \nconstitutional rights. \n \nECF Doc. 12-4 at 73.  In support of his first proposition of law, Rock argued that his conviction \non the 5 in 20 specification was void and unlawful because his predicate November 16, 1995 and \nMay 22, 1997 OVI convictions were unconstitutional.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 81-84.  The November \n16, 1995 conviction, he argued, was unconstitutional because it was the result of an uncounseled \nno contest plea for which he never waived the right to counsel.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 81.  The May \n22, 1997 conviction, he argued, was unconstitutional because counsel was appointed and then \nvacated and then he entered a plea without a proper explanation of his rights and the \nconsequences of a plea.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 82.  The rights waiver he did sign, he argued, was \ninvalidated by the lack of adequate explanation of his rights and the consequences of a plea.  \nECF Doc. 12-4 at 82-83. \n In support of his second proposition of law, Rock argued that the state engaged in \nprosecutorial misconduct because the prosecutor knew two of his predicate OVI convictions \nwere unconstitutional and yet brought the charge to the grand jury without providing them \nevidence of the deficiencies in his prior convictions.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 84-85.  He also faulted \nthe prosecutor for continuing to withhold information of the deficient prior OVI convictions \nthrough discovery, the plea hearing, and at sentencing.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 85-86.   \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  14 of 28.  PageID #: 142015 \n \n In support of his third proposition of law, Rock argued that trial counsel was ineffective \nfor not investigating his predicate OVI convictions and not moving to suppress them after he told \ncounsel before sentencing of the deficiencies in those convictions.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 86-89.  He \nfurther stated that his attorney on direct appeal told him the issue was res judicata barred and \nrefused to argue the issue.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 89.   \n  The state filed an appellee brief.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 155-66.  And Rock filed a \nreply.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 167-83.  On May 16, 2019, the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the Court \nof Appeals\u2019 denial of Rock\u2019s state petition for writ of habeas corpus.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 184-88; \nRock v. Harris, 157 Ohio St.3d 6 (Ohio 2019).  The Ohio Supreme Court reasoned: \n{\u00b68} First, Rock makes three arguments challenging his OVI convictions: (1) a \n1997 grand jury did not have probable cause to enhance a misdemeanor OVI \ncharge to a felony, (2) he did not validly waive counsel in his 1995 and 1997 \ncases, thereby rendering those OVI convictions void, and (3) the prosecutor \ncommitted misconduct in the 2014 case.  None of these claims are cognizable in \nhabeas corpus.  *** \n \n{\u00b69} Rock also argues that his repeat-offender specification was improper \nbecause of the alleged deficiencies of his 1995 and 1997 convictions and also that \nhis counsel in the 2014 case was ineffective for failing to argue that the prior \nconvictions were void.  Neither claim is cognizable in habeas.  Rock could have \nchallenged the specification on appeal from his 2014 conviction, especially given \nthe fact that he challenged it in the trial court prior to pleading guilty in his 2014 \ncase.  And claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel are not cognizable in \nhabeas corpus. \n \nECF Doc. 12-4 at 186. \n \nII. Discussion \nA. Ground One: Unconstitutional 5 in 20 specification  \nIn his Ground One claim, Rock contends that the use of uncounseled OVI convictions \nrenders his conviction and sentence on the 5 in 20 specification unlawful.  ECF Doc. 1 at 5.  In \nhis supporting memorandum of law, he asserts that his supporting exhibits show that two of his \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  15 of 28.  PageID #: 142116 \n \nprior OVI convictions are invalid for lack of counsel and lack of a voluntary waiver of his right \nto counsel.  ECF Doc. 1-2 at 9-11.  These exhibits included the docket and judgment entries for \nCase Nos. 95C09727 and 97C03446, Sutherland\u2019s September 3, 2010 affidavit, and Rock\u2019s \nSeptember 29, 2010 affidavit.  ECF Doc. 1-3 at 8-19.   \nWarden Eppinger responds that Rock\u2019s Ground One claim is not cognizable to the extent \nit alleges a violation of Ohio\u2019s Criminal Rules and Ohio\u2019s Rules of Evidence.  ECF Doc. 12 at \n33-34.  Warden Eppinger argues that Rock\u2019s Ground One claim is also noncognizable because \nhis conviction is the result of a guilty plea that he has not established was involuntary.  ECF Doc. \n12 at 34.  Warden Eppinger alternatively argues that Rock\u2019s Ground One claim is procedurally \ndefaulted because he failed to fairly present and properly exhaust a federal constitutional claim \nconcerning the use of his prior OVI convictions in state court.  ECF Doc. 12 at 35-36.  And, \nWarden Eppinger argues, Rock has not established cause, prejudice, or actual innocence to \nexcuse his default.  ECF Doc. 12 at 36-37.  Last, Warden Eppinger argues that Rock\u2019s Ground \nOne claim is meritless.  ECF Doc. 12 at 37-41. \nIn his traverse, Rock maintains that he has exhausted all available state court remedies, \nnoting his state petition for writ of habeas corpus.  ECF Doc. 18 at 2.  Rock otherwise issues a \nblanket statement disputing Warden Eppinger\u2019s arguments.  Id.   \n1. Cognizability  \nI disagree with Warden Eppinger\u2019s reading of Rock\u2019s Ground One claim.  Warden \nEppinger reads the claim as alleging violations of the Ohio Rules of Evidence during Rock\u2019s \ngrand jury proceedings and underlying violations of Ohio Crim R. 44 in two of his predicate OVI \npleas.  If that were the true extent of Rock\u2019s Ground One claim, the claim would not be \ncognizable because it would seek federal habeas relief for an alleged violation of state law.  \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  16 of 28.  PageID #: 142217 \n \nEstelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67 (1991) (\u201c[F]ederal habeas corpus relief does not lie for \nerrors of state law.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).   \nAs I read it, however, Rock\u2019s Ground One claim, as stated in his \u00a7 2254 petition and \nelaborated on in his supporting memorandum, challenges instead the use of constitutionally \ndefective guilty plea convictions to support to impose a punishment under a state recidivist \nstatute.  See ECF Doc. 1 at 5; ECF Doc. 1-2 at 9-11.  Indeed, Rock cites and discusses Supreme \nCourt precedent on that very issue.  ECF Doc. 1-2 at 9-10 (citing Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 \nU.S. 25 (1972); Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109 (1967)).  The Supreme Court has long held that \nthe Sixth Amendment right to counsel was a fundamental right incorporated against the states \nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment.  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 343-45 (1963).  In \nBurgett, the Court held that a conviction obtained in violation of Gideon could not be used in a \nlater case \u201cto support guilt or enhance punishment.\u201d  389 U.S. at 115.  And in Argersinger, the \nCourt extended the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to misdemeanor prosecutions that result in \nimprisonment.  407 U.S. at 36-37; see Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367, 369, 373-74 (1979) \n(limiting Argersinger to misdemeanor convictions that actually result in prison sentences).  \nTaken in context with his cited precedent, Rock\u2019s Ground One claim is best read as raising Sixth \nAmendment challenge to the use of his prior convictions, under Burgett, to support a later charge \nof violating Ohio\u2019s recidivist statute (Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2941.1413).  Such a claim is cognizable \nin federal habeas.    \nNext, as Warden Eppinger correctly observes, a guilty plea waives all non-jurisdictional \nconstitutional claims based on pre-plea events.  Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973).  \nThat includes a challenge to the propriety of the indictment or sufficiency of the evidence to \nconvict the habeas petitioner, under which Rock\u2019s challenge to the use of his prior convictions \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  17 of 28.  PageID #: 142318 \n \nwould fall.  Broadway v. Stewart, No. 2:15-CV-11917, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53981, at *8 \n(E.D. Mich. Apr. 22, 2016); Brooks v. Warden, S. Ohio Corr. Facility, No. 1:10-cv-953, 2011 \nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 150608, at *11-12 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 8, 2011); see also McMann v. Richardson, \n397 U.S. 759, 766 (1970) (stating that a guilty plea waives \u201cthe right to contest the admissibility \nof any evidence the State might have offered against the defendant\u201d).  A habeas petitioner in \nsuch an instance is limited only to attacking the voluntary and intelligent nature of his guilty \nplea.  Tollett, 411 U.S. at 267.  Although that would not render Rock\u2019s Ground One claim \nnoncognizable; it would limit the scope of our merits review.  Hunter v. Bowersox, 172 F.3d \n1016, 1022 (8th Cir. 1999) (\u201cWhether a plea of guilty was constitutionally voluntary is a \nquestion of federal law.\u201d (citation omitted)).   \n2. Procedural Default  \nAlthough Rock\u2019s Ground One claim is cognizable to the extent it challenges the \nvoluntary nature of his plea, it is, nevertheless, procedurally defaulted.   \nProcedural default is \u201ca critical failure to comply with state procedural law,\u201d Trest v. \nCain, 522 U.S. 87, 89 (1997), resulting in a bar to federal habeas review unless the petitioner \nmakes the requisite showing, Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991).  Procedural \ndefault occurs when: (1) the state courts didn\u2019t review the petitioner\u2019s claim on the merits \nbecause he didn\u2019t comply with some state procedural rule; or (2) he failed to fairly present the \nclaim to the state courts while state court remedies were still available.  Williams v. Anderson, \n460 F.3d 789, 806 (6th Cir. 2006).  The former occurs when: (1) the petitioner failed to comply \nwith an applicable state procedural rule; (2) the state court actually enforced the rule; (3) the rule \nconstituted an \u201cadequate an independent state ground;\u201d and (4) the petitioner cannot overcome \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  18 of 28.  PageID #: 142419 \n \nhis procedural default through cause and prejudice.  Coleman v. Mitchell, 268 F.3d 417, 427 (6th \nCir. 2001).   \nRock\u2019s Ground One claim is procedurally defaulted because the Ohio Supreme Court \napplied a state procedural rule to preclude merits review of the claim.  Williams, 460 F.3d at 806; \nECF Doc. 12-4 at 186.  Rock raised his Ground One claim in his state petition for writ of habeas \ncorpus, both initially to the Ohio Court of Appeals and on appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.  \nECF Doc. 12-3 at 44-48; ECF Doc. 12-4 at 81-83.  But \u201c[t]he availability of adequate remedies \nat law, even if those remedies were not sought or were unsuccessful, preclude a writ of habeas \ncorpus.\u201d  Perry v. Sloan, 149 Ohio St.3d 690, 690 (Ohio 2017).  Rock could have challenged the \nuse of the use of his prior convictions on direct appeal.  State v. Wood, 2018-Ohio-875, \u00b628 \n(Ohio Ct. App. 2018).  He likewise could have challenged the validity/sufficiency of the \nindictment on direct appeal.  Luna v. Russell, 70 Ohio St.3d 561, 562 (Ohio 1994).   \nThe Ohio Supreme Court \u2013 the relevant decision for purposes of our procedural default \nanalysis \u2013 denied the claim as noncognizable because it could have been raised on direct appeal, \nthereby actually enforcing the bar on claims raised in state habeas for which adequate remedies \nat law existed.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 186; Coleman, 268 F.3d at 427; see also Haliym v. Mitchell, \n492 F.3d 680, 691 (6th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[I]n determining whether a claim is procedurally defaulted, \nthis Court must look to the last explained state court judgment.\u201d (emphasis in original)).  And the \nbar against claims in a state habeas petition that could have been raised on direct review is an \nadequate and independent state ground for barring federal habeas review.  Gibson v. Haviland, \nNo. 5:17-cv-00008, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216407, at *41-42 (N.D. Ohio Aug. 14, 2017). \nLast, Rock cannot establish cause to overcome his procedural default.  As the Ohio \nSupreme Court stated, Rock could have raised his Ground One claim on direct appeal but didn\u2019t.  \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  19 of 28.  PageID #: 142520 \n \nRock faults his appointed counsel for not arguing the issue on direct appeal.  ECF Doc. 1 at 6.  \nIneffective assistance of counsel can establish cause to excuse procedural default.  Joseph v. \nCoyle, 469 F.3d 441, 459 (6th Cir. 2006).  Under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), \nineffective assistance \u201cis deficient performance by counsel resulting in prejudice, with \nperformance being measured against an objective standard of reasonableness of under prevailing \nprofessional norms.\u201d  Moore v. Mitchell, 708 F.3d 760, 776 (6th Cir. 2013) (quotation marks \nomitted).  Because the Ohio Court of Appeals addressed a claim of ineffective assistance of \nappellate counsel on this very issue when it denied Rock\u2019s Ohio App. R. 26(B) application to \nreopen, we must afford that decision deference under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \nPenalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d).  Id. at 777-78; ECF Doc. 12-1 at 210-11.  Thus, Rock can only \nestablish cause if the state court\u2019s decision finding no ineffective assistance of counsel: (1) was \ncontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as \ndetermined by the Supreme Court; or (2) was based on an unreasonable determination of the \nfacts in light of the record before the state court.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).  The relevant question \nisn\u2019t whether the state court got it right or wrong, but whether the state court\u2019s determination was \n\u201cunreasonable\u2014a substantially higher threshold.\u201d Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 473 \n(2007).  The petitioner must show that the state court\u2019s \u201cdecision was so lacking in justification \nthat there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility \nfor fairminded disagreement.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 102-03 (2011). \nThe Ohio Court of Appeals determined that appellate counsel was not ineffective for not \nraising Rock\u2019s Ground One claim because the issue would have been barred by res judicata.  \nRock could have \u2013 but did not \u2013 assert constitutional challenges to his prior convictions on \nappeal of those prior convictions.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 210-11.  Rock\u2019s failure to challenge his \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  20 of 28.  PageID #: 142621 \n \nprior convictions on the ground he was denied effective assistance of counsel doomed his ability \nto do so later.  And the applicability of res judicata in such circumstances is an issue of state law; \nand we are required to defer to the state court\u2019s determination of such issues. Van Tielen v. \nRobinson, No. 1:13-cv-642, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127384, at *24 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 10, 2014); \nEstelle, 502 U.S. at 67-68 (\u201cIt is not the province of a federal court to reexamine state-court \ndeterminations on state-law questions.\u201d).  Thus, because Rock\u2019s proposed Ground One claim \nwould have been barred by res judicata, the state court\u2019s conclusion that counsel was not \nineffective for not raising Rock\u2019s proposed Ground One claim was not so lacking in justification \nthat it was beyond any possibility for fair-minded disagreement.  Harrington, 562 U.S. at 102-\n03.  Rock has therefore failed to establish cause to overcome his procedural default.  And failure \nto establish cause makes it unnecessary to consider prejudice.  Matthews v. Ishee, 486 F.3d 883, \n891 (6th Cir. 2007). \nRock could attempt to overcome his procedural default under the fundamental \nmiscarriage-of-justice exception.  Coleman, 501 U.S. at 750.  But he would have to produce new, \nreliable evidence establishing that he was actually innocent of the offense.  Schlup v. Delo, 513 \nU.S. 298, 324 (1995); Lundgren v. Mitchell, 440 F.3d 754, 764 (6th Cir. 2006).  Actual \ninnocence means \u201cfactual innocence,\u201d i.e., that the petitioner \u201cdid not commit the acts forming \nthe basis for his conviction.\u201d  Ross v. Berghuis, 417 F.3d 552, 555-56 (6th Cir. 2005).  Rock\u2019s \nlegal challenge to the use of his prior predicate OVI convictions does not qualify as a claim of \nfactual innocence.  E.g., United States v. Pettiford, 612 F.3d 270, 283-84 (4th Cir. 2010); Pope v. \nButler, No. 6:12-cv-2623, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136064, at *11 (N.D. Ala. Aug. 8, 2012); \nWebb v. Dir., Va. Dep\u2019t of corr., No. 7:05CV00654, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24075, at *7 (W.D. \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  21 of 28.  PageID #: 142722 \n \nVa. Mar. 20, 2006).  And Rock has not otherwise adduced any new, reliable evidence of his \nactual innocence.   \nI recommend that Rock\u2019s Ground One claim be DISMISSED as procedurally defaulted. \nB. Ground Two Claim: Trial Counsel\u2019s Failure to Investigate or Suppress \nUncounseled Predicate OVI Convictions \n \n1. Parties\u2019 Arguments \nIn his Ground Two claim, Rock argues that trial counsel was ineffective for not \ninvestigating and moving to suppress his uncounseled predicate OVI convictions.  ECF Doc. 1 at \n7.  In his supporting memorandum of law, he adds that counsel misrepresented his prior no \ncontest pleas to the trial court in this case when counsel said that the courts in the questioned \nOVI cases failed to advise Rock that he had voluntarily waived his right to counsel.  Rock asserts \nthat he did not voluntarily or intelligently waive his right to counsel in the 1995 or 1997 caser.  \nECF Doc. 1-2 at 11-12. \nWarden Eppinger responds that Rock\u2019s Ground Two claim is procedurally defaulted \nbecause Rock failed to properly exhaust the issue in state court, as he did not raise the issue \nthrough the direct review process, and the state courts on collateral review determined the claim \nwas barred by res judicata.  ECF Doc. 12 at 42-43.  Warden Eppinger argues that Rock cannot \nestablish cause trough a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because the Ohio \nCourt of Appeals reasonably determined that appellate counsel wasn\u2019t deficient for not raising \nthe issue in adjudicating his first application to reopen.  ECF Doc. 12 at 43.  Warden Eppinger \nargues further that Rock cannot establish cause through ineffective assistance of appellate \ncounsel because such a claim would be procedurally defaulted based on the Ohio Court of \nAppeals\u2019 denial as untimely of his second application to reopen.  Id.  Alternatively, Warden \nEppinger argues the claim is meritless.  ECF Doc. 12 at 44-48. \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  22 of 28.  PageID #: 142823 \n \n2. Procedural Default  \nRock\u2019s Ground Two claim is procedurally defaulted, because the Ohio Supreme Court \nenforced a state procedural rule to preclude merits review of the claim.  As discussed above, a \nclaim is procedurally defaulted if the state court declined to consider the merits of an issue \nbecause the petitioner failed to comply with a state procedural rule, or the claim was not fairly \npresented.  Williams, 460 F.3d at 806.  To briefly address fair presentment, Rock raised his \nGround Two claim initially in his state petition for post-conviction relief, but he did not raise it \nagain on appeal from the denial of his post-conviction relief petition either to the Ohio Court of \nAppeals or the Ohio Supreme Court.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 301-02, 421-22, 520-24.  He attempted \nto raise the issue again in his second Ohio App. R. 26(B) application to reopen, but he did not \nappeal the denial of that application to the Ohio Supreme Court.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 266; see \nDocket for Ohio App. Ct., 11th Dist. Case Nos. 2015-L-047, 2016-L-011.  If that had been the \nend of the matter, then Rock\u2019s Ground Two claim would have been procedurally defaulted \nbecause in both instances Rock failed to raise his Ground Two claim at every stage of Ohio\u2019s \nreview process \u2013 all the way up to the Ohio Supreme Court.  Wagner v. Smith, 581 F.3d 410, 418 \n(6th Cir. 2009). \nBut that\u2019s not where Rock\u2019s efforts to raise his Ground Two claim ended.  He raised it \nagain in his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and pursued the claim all the way through the \nOhio Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court.  ECF Doc. 12-2 at 13-14, 150-51, 214-16.  \nThat was enough to meet his obligation to fairly present the claim at every state of Ohio\u2019s \nappellate process.  Wagner, 581 F.3d at 418.   \nThat being said, Rock\u2019s Ground Two claim is procedurally defaulted because the last \nstate court decision to address his claim \u2013 the Ohio Supreme Court on appeal from denial of his \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  23 of 28.  PageID #: 142924 \n \nstate habeas petition \u2013 applied a procedural rule to bar review of the claim on the merits.  See \nHaliym, 492 F.3d at 691 Dickson v. Sullivan, No. 2:17-cv-08290, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n192946, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017) (reviewing the state court\u2019s procedural ruling on the \n\u201cmost recent round of state collateral review\u201d).  The Ohio Supreme Court declined to review the \nclaim because \u201cclaims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel are not cognizable in habeas \ncorpus.\u201d  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 186.  The rule underlying that procedural ruling is that such claims \ncould have been or were unsuccessfully raised on direct and post-conviction review.  Cornell v. \nSchotten, 69 Ohio St. 3d 466, 467 (Ohio 1994).  The Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s determination on \nthat issue was an adequate and independent ground upon which to preclude merits-based review \nin a federal habeas case.  Gibson, No. 5:17-cv-00008, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216407, at *41-42.   \nRock cannot establish cause to overcome his procedural default.  As with his Ground One \nclaim, Rock faults his appellate counsel for not raising the issue on direct appeal.  ECF Doc. 1 at \n7.  But the Ohio Court of Appeals determined that appellate counsel was not ineffective for not \nraising Rock\u2019s Ground Two claim because the issue would have been barred by res judicata; the \npropriety of his prior OVI convictions could have been raised in direct or collateral review from \nthose convictions.  ECF Doc. 12-1 at 210-11.  Giving deference to the state court\u2019s determination \non the applicability of res judicata in reviewing appellate counsel\u2019s performance, the state court\u2019s \nconclusion that counsel was not ineffective for not raising Rock\u2019s proposed Ground Two claim \nwas not so lacking in justification that it was beyond any possibility for fair-minded \ndisagreement.  Harrington, 562 U.S. at 102-03.  Rock has therefore failed to established cause to \novercome his procedural default, and failure to establish cause makes it unnecessary to consider \nprejudice.  Matthews, 486 F.3d at 891.  And Rock cannot overcome his procedural default under \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  24 of 28.  PageID #: 143025 \n \nthe fundamental miscarriage-of-justice exception because, as discussed above, a mere challenge \nto the use of his predicate OVI convictions does not qualify as a claim of factual innocence.   \nI recommend that Rock\u2019s Ground Two claim be DISMISSED as procedurally defaulted.   \nC. Ground Three Claim: Prosecutorial Misconduct \n1. Parties\u2019 Arguments \nIn his Ground Three claim, Rock contends that the state committed prosecutorial \nmisconduct by withholding, in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), evidence \nshowing the constitutionally infirm nature of his prior convictions.  ECF Doc. 1 at 8; ECF Doc. \n1-2 at 13-15. \nWarden Eppinger responds that Rock\u2019s Ground Three claim is not cognizable to the \nextent that he alleges violations of state law and ethics rules, and any underlying due process \nchallenge to the admission of evidence in state court would be procedurally defaulted as \nunexhausted.  ECF Doc. 12 at 49-53.  Warden Eppinger argues that any constitutional claim was \nwaived by the guilty plea.  ECF Doc. 12 at 49-50.  Alternatively, Warden Eppinger argues that \nthe Ohio Court of Appeals reasonably determined that the Ground Three claim was barred by res \njudicata, and that Rock failed to establish that his predicate OVI convictions were \nconstitutionally infirm or that the state suppressed evidence.  ECF Doc. 12 at 53-57 \n2. Cognizability \nI disagree with Warden Eppinger\u2019s reading of Rock\u2019s Ground Three claim.  It asserts \u2013 \nexplicitly \u2013 a Brady claim.  The Supreme Court held in Brady that the suppression of material, \nexculpatory evidence violates a criminal defendant\u2019s due process rights.  Brady, 373 U.S. at 87.  \nBy asserting a Brady claim, Rock is asserting that he is being held in violation of his due process \nrights, because the state withheld exculpatory evidence concerning his prior OVI convictions.  \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  25 of 28.  PageID #: 143126 \n \nSuch a claim, if not procedurally defaulted, is cognizable in a federal habeas case.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2254(a).  Warden Eppinger is correct, however, that a properly entered guilty plea can waive a \nBrady claim.  Carley v. Hudson, 563 F. Supp. 2d 760, 774 (N.D. Ohio 2008).  As discussed \nabove, however, such a finding would change \u2013 but not eliminate \u2013 our merits review.  Tollett, \n411 U.S. at 267; Hunter, 172 F.3d at 1022.   \n3. Procedural Default \nAlthough cognizable, Rock\u2019s Ground Three claim is procedurally defaulted, because the \nOhio Supreme Court \u2013 the last state court to address his Brady claim \u2013 declined to review it on \nthe merits after applying a state procedural to find the claim barred.  See Haliym, 492 F.3d at \n691; Dickson, No. 2:17-cv-08290, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 192946, at *2.  The Ohio Supreme \nCourt ruled that Rock\u2019s Brady claim was not cognizable in a state habeas corpus case because \nthe  claim could have been raised on direct appeal or in a post-conviction proceeding.  ECF Doc. \n12-4 at 186.  See Williamson v. Williams, 103 Ohio St.3d 25, 25 (Ohio 2004); Hayden v. Morris, \nNo. 93 CA 1974, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 1131, at *8 (Ohio Ct. App. Mar. 16, 1994).  That was \nan adequate and independent ground upon which to preclude merits-based review in our court.  \nGibson, No. 5:17-cv-00008, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216407, at *41-42.   \nRock cannot establish cause to overcome the procedural default of his Ground Three \nclaim.  As with his Ground One and Ground Two claims, he faults appellate counsel for not \nraising the issue.  ECF Doc. 12-4 at 9.  But that contention is itself procedurally defaulted \nbecause, although Rock raised the issue in his second application to reopen, he did not appeal the \ndenial of that application to the Ohio Supreme Court, and he has not shown cause for failing to \ndo so.  Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451 (2000); Wagner, 581 F.3d at 418; ECF Doc. \n12-1 at 265; Docket for Ohio App. Ct., 11th Dist. Case Nos. 2015-L-047, 2016-L-011.  Failure to \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  26 of 28.  PageID #: 143227 \n \nestablish cause makes it unnecessary to consider prejudice.  Matthews, 486 F.3d at 891.  Thus, \nRock\u2019s Ground Three claim is procedurally defaulted.  Coleman, 268 F.3d 427.  And as \ndiscussed above, the legality of his prior convictions does not pertain to his factual innocence.   \nI recommend that Rock\u2019s Ground Three claim be DISMISSED as procedurally defaulted.  \nIII. Certificate of Appealability \nA. Legal Standard \nRule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts \nprovides that \u201c[t]he district court must issue or deny a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) when \nit enters a final order adverse to the applicant.\u201d  Rule 11(a), 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254.  The rule \ntracks the requirement of \u00a7 2253(c)(3) that any grant of a certificate of appealability \u201cstate the \nspecific issue or issues that satisfy the showing required by \u00a7 2253 (c)(2),\u201d Rule 11(a).  In light \nof the Rule 11 requirement that the Court either grant or deny the certificate of appealability at \nthe time of its final adverse order, a recommendation regarding the COA issue is included here. \nUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A), this court will grant a COA for an issue raised in a \n\u00a72254 habeas petition only if the petitioner has made a substantial showing of the denial of a \nfederal constitutional right.  Cunningham v. Shoop, 817 F. App\u2019x 223, 224 (6th Cir. 2020).  A \npetitioner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists \u201ccould disagree with the \ndistrict court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues \npresented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d  Buck v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. \n759, 773 (2017) (quotation marks omitted); see also Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 \n(2000).  When a claim is denied on procedural grounds, the petitioner must show \u201cthat jurists of \nreason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  27 of 28.  PageID #: 143328 \n \nconstitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court \nwas correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d  Slack,  529 U.S. at 484. \nB. Analysis \nIf the Court accepts my recommendations, Rock will not be able to show that the Court\u2019s \nrulings on his claims are debatable among jurists of reason.  Rock\u2019s Ground One, Ground Two, \nand Ground Three claims are procedurally defaulted.  Because jurists of reason would not find \ndebatable that habeas relief is not available for any of the claims raised in Rock\u2019s petition, I \nrecommend that no certificate of appealability issue in this case. \nIV. Recommendation \nBecause all of Rock\u2019s claims are procedurally defaulted, I recommend that Rock\u2019s claims \nbe DISMISSED and that his petition for writ of habeas corpus be DENIED.  I further \nrecommend that Rock not be granted a certificate of appealability.  \n \nDated: September 8, 2021  \nThomas M. Parker \nUnited States Magistrate Judge \n \n     \n \nOBJECTIONS \nAny objections to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of Courts \nwithin fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this document.  Failure to file \nobjections within the specified time may waive the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s order.  See \nU.S. v. Walters, 638 F.2d 947 (6th Cir. 1981).  See also Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140 (1985), \nreh\u2019g denied, 474 U.S. 1111 (1986). \nCase: 1:20-cv-00255-SO  Doc #: 20-1  Filed:  09/08/21  28 of 28.

When police caught up to him, he admitted taking Oxycontin and Prozac, and a breathalyzer test showed a blood alcohol content of .177. Rock pleaded guilty to operating a vehicle under the influence (\u201cOVI\u201d) and to an Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2941.1413 specification for previously having been convicted of 5 OVI offenses in 20 years (\u201c5 in 20 specification\u201d). And he was sentenced to an aggregate seven-year sentence. Rock now seeks a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (ECF Doc. 1), raising three claims:\n\n**Ground One:** Rock\u2019s conviction on the 5 in 20 specification was unconstitutional because two of the underlying OVI convictions were the result of uncounseled pleas (ECF Doc. 1 at 5; ECF Doc. 1-2 at 9-11);\n\n---\n\n1 This matter is before me by an automatic order of reference under Local Rule 72.2 for preparation of a report and recommendation pursuant to Local Rule 72.1, as well as by an express order of referral. ECF Doc. 6.\n\n2 Rock was originally sentenced to serve his prison terms consecutive to a sentence imposed in a different case by the Ashland County, Ohio Court of Common Pleas. After the Ohio Court of Appeals reversed the sentence because the trial court failed to make the requisite statutory findings for imposing a consecutive sentence, the case was remanded for resentencing. Upon further consideration, the trial court elected not to order Rock\u2019s prison terms to be served consecutive to his Ashland County sentence. Nothing about that turn of events is raised as an issue in this action.\nGround Two: Trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate his prior OVI convictions and challenge them as unconstitutional for lack of counsel (ECF Doc. 1 at 7; ECF Doc. 1-2 at 11-13); and\n\nGround Three: The state withheld, in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), evidence that two of Rock\u2019s prior OVI convictions were uncounseled (ECF Doc. 1 at 8; ECF Doc. 1-2 at 13-15).\n\nRespondent Warden LaShann Eppinger filed a return of writ on June 1, 2020. (ECF Doc. 12). And Rock filed a traverse on October 20, 2020 (ECF Doc. 18), to which Warden Eppinger has filed a reply (ECF Doc. 19).\n\nBecause all of Rock\u2019s claims are procedurally defaulted, I recommend that all of Rock\u2019s claims be DISMISSED and that his petition for writ of habeas corpus be DENIED. I further recommend that Rock not be granted a certificate of appealability.\n\nI. Relevant State Court Proceedings\n\nA. Trial Court\n\nOn November 12, 2014, a Lake County, Ohio, grand jury charged Rock with two counts of OVI and one count of leaving the scene of an accident. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 13-15. The OVI offenses each had a 5 in 20 specification attached, based on Rock\u2019s five prior OVI convictions, including his: (1) November 6, 1995 conviction in Willoughby Municipal Court Case No. 95C09727; and (2) May 22, 1997 conviction in Willoughby Municipal Court Case No. 97C03446. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 13-14. Rock pleaded not guilty. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 16.\n\nOn February 23, 2015, Rock changed his plea. ECF Doc. 12-5 at 4-5. After a plea colloquy, Rock pleaded guilty to one count of OVI and a 5 in 20 specification. ECF Doc. 12-5 at 7-38. The trial court accepted Rock\u2019s plea, found him guilty and dismissed the remaining charges. ECF Doc. 12-5 at 38-39; ECF Doc. 12-1 at 32.\nRock expressed some doubt about the number of prior OVI convictions at his March 26, 2015 sentencing hearing. ECF Doc. 12-5 at 60-62, 70. He confirmed his intention to plead guilty to the 5 in 20 specification but said counsel had advised him that \u2013 had they spoken sooner \u2013 counsel could have looked into his predicate OVI convictions. ECF Doc. 12-5 at 72-73. Counsel interjected to say:\n\nYour Honor, I think what he\u2019s trying to explain to you is that when he entered the pleas on the priors, he\u2019s telling me after he entered the plea on this case that he didn\u2019t have an attorney and that the Court didn\u2019t advise him that he had voluntarily waived that right. And that\u2019s why I told him not to pursue that one.\n\nECF Doc. 12-5 at 73-74. The court sentenced Rock to a 4-year mandatory prison term on the 5 in 20 specification and a consecutive 3-year prison term on the OVI charge. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 32-33; ECF Doc. 12-5 at 82.\n\nB. Direct Appeal\n\nOn April 29, 2015, Rock timely appealed his convictions to the Ohio Court of Appeals. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 46. Through new counsel, Rock filed a merits brief, arguing that: (1) the trial court failed to make the requisite statutory findings before imposing a sentence consecutive to another county\u2019s sentence; and (2) the court failed to consider the statutory factors in fashioning its sentence. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 55-70. The state filed an appellee brief. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 71-82. On November 9, 2015, the Ohio Court of Appeals sustained Rock\u2019s first assignment of error and reversed and remanded so that the trial court could make the findings needed to justify a consecutive sentence. ECF Doc. 12 at 83-87; State v. Rock, 2015-Ohio-4639 (Ohio Ct. App. 2015).\n\nOn December 8, 2015, the trial court ordered that Rock\u2019s sentence be served concurrent to his Ashland County sentence. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 91. On February 19, 2016, the Ohio Court of Appeals granted Rock leave to file a delayed appeal. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 101-05, 112-13.\nThrough new counsel, Rock filed a merits brief, asserting three assignments of error, none of which is relevant to Rock\u2019s current petition. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 118-35. The state filed an appellee brief. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 136-45. On December 30, 2016, the Ohio Court of Appeals overruled Rock\u2019s assignments of error and affirmed Rock\u2019s convictions and sentences. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 146-152; State v. Rock, 2016-Ohio-8516 (Ohio Ct. App. 2016). On May 14, 2017, Rock filed an untimely notice of appeal with the Ohio Supreme Court and a motion for leave to file a delayed appeal. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 154-61. On May 17, 2017, the Ohio Supreme Court denied the motion. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 171.\n\nC. First App. R. 26(B) Application to Reopen\n\nMeanwhile, on February 8, 2016, Rock filed a pro se application to reopen his direct appeal pursuant to Ohio App. R. 26(B), alleging \u2013 as relevant here \u2013 that appellate counsel was ineffective for: (1) not investigating the predicate convictions that the state offered to support Rock\u2019s 5 in 20 specification; and (2) not raising trial counsel\u2019s failure to challenge his 5 in 20 specification. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 172-75. In support of his first proposed issue, Rock argued that appellate counsel had failed to collaterally attack his November 16, 1995 OVI conviction as unconstitutional for lack of a waiver of counsel and his May 22, 1997 OVI conviction for non-compliance with Ohio Crim. R. 22 and 44. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 174. He further argued that appellate counsel had mailed him evidence showing that his 5 in 20 specification was unconstitutional. Id. In support of his second proposed issue, Rock argued \u2013 without elaboration \u2013 that trial counsel erroneously informed the trial court at sentencing about his uncounseled OVI convictions. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 175.\n\nRock attached to his application to reopen a September 29, 2010 affidavit, stating that his November 16, 1995 OVI conviction was the result of a no contest plea made without counsel or\nan explanation of his rights and consequences of entering a plea. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 178. He stated his May 22, 1997 OVI conviction also was the result of a no contest plea without counsel and an explanation of his rights and consequences of his plea, but he had signed a \u201cboilerplate waiver of counsel form.\u201d Id. Rock also attached the judgment entry from his November 16, 1995 OVI conviction, adjudicating him guilty after a no contest plea. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 179. At the top, the judgment stated, \u201cDefendant appeared. Constitutional rights and pleas explained.\u201d ECF Doc. 12-1 at 179, 181. A separate, undated judgment entry stated that Rock pleaded not guilty and waived an attorney on November 2, 1995. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 181.\n\nAnd Rock attached the affidavit of Kenneth Sutherland (Chief Bailiff of the Willoughby Municipal Court) dated September 3, 2010. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 180. An attorney had requested that Sutherland locate and produce any and all audio documentation related to Rock\u2019s criminal proceeding in Case Nos. 95C09727 and 97C03446. Id. But the audio recordings of the proceedings were destroyed in the normal course of the court\u2019s business and no longer existed. Id. Thus, Sutherland stated, the court could not establish that a plea colloquy occurred or that Rock voluntarily waived his right to counsel in either case. Id.\n\nThe state filed an opposition to Rock\u2019s application to reopen. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 186-95. On June 30, 2016, the Ohio Court of Appeals denied Rock\u2019s application to reopen. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 208-12. The court reasoned:\n\n[Rock] had the opportunity to raise the issue of his prior uncounseled misdemeanor convictions on appeal in both Lake County Common Pleas Case No. 97CR000363 and \u2026 Case No. 02CR000085. [Rock] did not file a direct appeal in Case No. 97CR000363. He filed a direct appeal in Case No. 02CR000085, but it was dismissed for failure to prosecute. In both cases [Rock] filed motions for postconviction relief, claiming that his misdemeanor convictions were uncounseled. Both motions were denied, with both decisions citing that his claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. [Rock] never raised the issue of his uncounseled prior convictions on direct appeal of his motions for postconviction relief, and those issues were barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\nfrom being raised at trial or on appeal in the present case. Therefore, appellate\ncounsel was not ineffective for not investigating the allegedly uncounseled priors\nand for not raising the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\n\nECF Doc. 12-1 at 210-11.\n\nOn July 25, 2016, Rock moved for reconsideration of the denial of his application to\nreopen his direct appeal. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 213-18. The state filed a response in opposition.\nECF Doc. 12-1 at 219-222. On August 15, 2016, the Ohio Court of Appeals denied Rock\u2019s\nmotion for reconsideration as untimely and, alternatively, for failure to establish obvious error or\noversight. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 223-24.\n\nOn September 26, 2016, Rock filed a notice of appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. ECF\nDoc. 12-1 at 224-27. In his memorandum in support of jurisdiction, Rock largely reiterates the\narguments he raised in his application to reopen. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 228-39. On January 25,\n2017, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to accept jurisdiction over the case. ECF Doc. 12-1 at\n263.\n\nD. Petition for Postconviction Relief\n\nWhile his first application to reopen was still pending with the Ohio Court of Appeals,\nRock filed on June 10, 2016, a pro se petition for postconviction relief in the trial court, raising\nfour grounds for relief, two of which are relevant to his current petition. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 299-\n312. First, Rock argued that trial counsel was ineffective when he told the trial court at\nsentencing that he had voluntarily waived his right to counsel. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 301-02. He\nargued that counsel failed to investigate evidence showing that he had no counsel and that there\nwere no audio recordings of his plea colloquies in Case Nos. 95C09727 and 97C03446. Id. Had\ncounsel investigated Rock\u2019s prior OVI convictions and withdrawn his guilty plea before\nsentencing, Rock argued that the state likely would have dismissed the 5 in 20 specification. Id.\nSecond, Rock claimed that the prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct when he signed an indictment charging Rock with a 5 in 20 specification while knowing that two of the five predicate convictions were uncounseled. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 303-04. He argued that this information was not made available to the trial court; and, if it had it been, the specification would have been dismissed. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 304.\n\nThe state filed a response in opposition. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 341-49. On July 26, 2016, the trial court denied Rock\u2019s petition as untimely because the transcript was filed in the Ohio Court of Appeals on June 8, 2015, making the deadline for filing a petition for postconviction relief June 7, 2016. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 350. Alternatively, the court found that the claims Rock raised therein would be barred by res judicata. Id.\n\nOn December 7, 2016, Rock filed an Ohio Civ. R. 60(B) motion for relief from the trial court\u2019s July 26, 2016 judgment. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 400. He argued that he timely delivered his postconviction motion for mailing on June 3, 2016, but due to delays in the prison mail system, it was not mailed until June 6, 2016 and \u2013 consequently \u2013 not received by the court until June 10, 2016. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 401. And a three-day extension to the due date, he argued, should be afforded under Ohio App. R. 14(C). Id. He also argued that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not always barred by res judicata. Id.\n\nThe state filed a response. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 404-07. On December 28, 2016, the trial court summarily denied Rock\u2019s motion. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 408. On January 17, 2017, Rock filed a notice of appeal. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 411. He filed a merits brief, arguing that the trial court should have applied Ohio Civ. R. 6(E) and add three days to the filing deadline for service effected by mail. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 421-22. The state filed an appellee brief. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 425-32.\nOn August 2, 2017, the Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed, determining that Rock could not use a Rule 60(B) motion as a substitute for a timely appeal and he failed to demonstrate that the trial court would have granted his petition for postconviction relief had the Rule 60(B) motion been granted. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 433-37.\n\nOn September 18, 2017, Rock appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 505-06. In his memorandum in support of jurisdiction and amended memorandum, he largely reiterated the arguments raised in his court of appeals merits brief. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 508-10, 520-24. On January 31, 2018, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to exercise jurisdiction. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 532.\n\nE. Second App. R. 26(B) Application to Reopen\n\nWhile his appeal from the denial of his Rule 60(B) motion was pending, Rock filed pro se on June 22, 2017 a second Ohio App. R. 26(B) application to reopen his direct criminal appeal and his appeal after remand. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 264. Rock alleged that the prosecutor withheld exculpatory mitigating sentence, in violation of Brady: that 2 of the 5 in 20 specification OVI predicates were uncounseled misdemeanor convictions and therefore could not be used for enhancement purposes. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 265. Rock argued that: (i) had the uncounseled nature of his prior convictions been brought to light, (ii) the prosecutor not misled the grand jury and the trial court, and (iii) the prosecutor not violated Ohio Evid. R. 16.1, his counsel would have moved to strike the 5 in 20 specification. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 266. In passing, Rock added that trial counsel should have investigated his prior OVI convictions. Id. Rock attached to his application the same judgment entries and affidavits he had attached to his first Rule 26(B) application. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 267-70.\nThe state filed a response in opposition. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 275-79. Rock filed a reply with new supporting evidence. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 282-84. Among them was an August 2, 2016 letter from his appellate attorney in his post-remand appeal responding to Rock\u2019s request that she raise the issue of his uncounseled prior OVI convictions. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 285-88. Counsel wrote that she could not raise the issue because it was not raised in the trial court. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 285-86.\n\nOn July 21, 2017, the Ohio Court of Appeals denied Rock\u2019s second application to reopen as untimely and because he failed to demonstrate good cause for the late filing. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 295-96. Rock did not further appeal the decision to the Ohio Supreme Court. Docket for Ohio App. Ct., 11th Dist. Case Nos. 2015-L-047, 2016-L-011.\n\nF. Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea\n\nWhile his second application to reopen was pending, Rock filed on June 22, 2017 a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Ohio Crim. R. 32.1, arguing that the prosecutor withheld evidence that two of his predicate OVI convictions were uncounseled and could not be used to enhance his sentence and that trial counsel was ineffective for not investigating the matter. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 13-15. The state filed a response. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 24-28.\n\nOn July 19, 2017, the trial court denied Rock\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, reasoning:\n\nHere, [Rock\u2019s] exhibits include his own affidavit, dated September 29, 2010, averring that the two complained of prior convictions were uncounseled and that he was not properly advised of his rights. Thus, assuming arguendo that these prior convictions were uncounseled, the defendant was aware of that at least by September 29, 2010. Therefore, the defendant was aware of the information that forms the basis of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and could have raised this issue in a motion to dismiss before this court, at trial, had he elected to try this case rather than plea, or on either of his two appeals. Thus, this issue is barred by res judicata.\nOn July 31, 2017, Rock moved for reconsideration, reiterating the merits of his claims. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 31-32. On August 30, 2017, the trial court summarily denied the motion. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 50-51. Rock appealed. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 74-81. The state filed an appellee brief. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 86-94. On December 29, 2017, the Ohio Court of Appeals dismissed Rock\u2019s appeal, ruling that he could not appeal the denial of his motion for reconsideration because a motion for reconsideration of a final, appealable order (a motion to withdraw a guilty plea) is a nullity. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 95-97.\n\nOn January 31, 2018, Rock filed a motion for a delayed appeal of the order denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 111-13, 117-22. On March 14, 2018, the Ohio Court of Appeals granted Rock\u2019s motion. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 123-24.\n\nRock then filed a merits brief, raising three assignments of error, two of which are relevant to his current petition: (1) trial counsel was ineffective for not investigating his prior OVI convictions; and (2) the state committed prosecutorial misconduct by concealing from the grand jury, the trial court, and trial counsel the constitutionally infirm nature of his prior OVI convictions. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 141. In support, Rock largely reiterated his arguments that trial counsel should have investigated his prior OVI convictions and trial counsel\u2019s statements at sentencing were false. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 147, 148-49, 151. He added that trial counsel should also have objected, moved to suppress, moved to dismiss the indictment. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 151-52.\n\nIn support of his second argument, Rock contended that the state failed to properly present and explain the judgment entries of his 5 in 20 specification OVI predicates. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 153. He argued that when proof of a prior conviction was an element to an offense, Ohio\nRev. Code \u00a7 2945.75(B)(1) required a certified copy of the entry of judgment of the prior conviction and other evidence to identify the defendant in the prior case. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 149. But under \u00a7 2945.75(B)(2) and the best evidence rule, he argued, the state provided incomplete records that lacked sufficient information to the grand jury for them to determine whether his prior OVI convictions could be used in his current OVI charge. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 148-49.\n\nThe state filed an appellee brief. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 169-78. On October 15, 2018, the Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of Rock\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 179-83. The court reasoned:\n\n{\u00b613} Attached to [Rock\u2019s] Crim. R. 32.1 motion was his own affidavit dated September 29, 2010. [Rock] averred that when he entered a plea of no contest in the 1995 case, he appeared without counsel, did not waive his right to counsel, and was not informed of the consequences of entering a plea of no contest. He further averred that when he entered a plea of no contest in the 1997 case, he appeared without counsel and signed a \u201cboilerplate waiver of counsel form\u201d but was not informed of his rights or of the consequences of entering a plea of no contest. [Rock] was therefore aware of the alleged uncounseled convictions since September 29, 2010. Further, the record reflects defense counsel raised in the trial court the issue of [Rock\u2019s] previous pleas. During [Rock\u2019s] sentencing hearing, defense counsel stated: \u201cYour honor, I think what he\u2019s trying to explain to you is that when he entered the pleas on the priors, he\u2019s telling me after he entered the plea on this case that he didn\u2019t have an attorney and that the Court didn\u2019t advise him that he had voluntarily waived that right. And that\u2019s why I told him not to pursue that one.\u201d Thus, [Rock] could have raised the issues pertaining to ineffective assistance of counsel and the state\u2019s withholding exculpatory evidence in his direct appeal. He did not. *** Consequently, the issues are barred by res judicata.\n\nECF Doc. 12-2 at 182-83.\n\nOn October 26, 2018, Rock filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the Ohio Court of Appeals misapplied res judicata to preclude review of his claims because appellate counsel had been Rock\u2019s attorney in Case No. 97CR363, and she had a conflict of interest in raising her own deficient performance in that prior case. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 188. He also argued that a Brady claim could not be barred by res judicata. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 189.\nThe state filed an opposition to Rock\u2019s motion for reconsideration. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 191-93. Rock filed a reply, reiterating the merits of his claims. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 194-97. On December 10, 2018, the Ohio Court of Appeals denied Rock\u2019s motion, reaffirming its prior determination that res judicata barred consideration of Rock\u2019s claims. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 199-200.\n\nMeanwhile, on October 29, 2018, Rock filed a notice of appeal in the Ohio Supreme Court, seeking to appeal the Ohio Court of Appeals\u2019 October 15, 2018 decision. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 201-02. In his memorandum in support of jurisdiction, he largely reiterated the same issues and supporting arguments he raised in his merits brief. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 203-21.\n\nOn December 26, 2018, the Ohio Supreme Court declined to exercise jurisdiction. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 232.\n\nG. Motion to Vacate\n\nWhile his motion to withdraw his guilty plea pending, Rock filed on December 6, 2017, a motion to vacate the trial court\u2019s judgment, under Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B)(5) on the basis that his indictment was defective because two of his predicate OVI convictions were constitutionally infirm. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 233-34. The state filed a response, and Rock filed a reply. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 243-48. On December 28, 2017, the trial court summarily denied Rock\u2019s motion. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 249. Rock filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied in a February 7, 2018 decision. ECF Doc. 12-2 at 252-54, 256. Rock did not appeal. Docket for Lake Cnty. Ct. of Comm. Pl. Case No. 14CR525.\n\nH. State Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus\n\nOn March 21, 2018, Rock filed a pro se state petition for writ of habeas corpus, which was later dismissed pursuant to his notice of voluntary dismissal on April 23, 2018. ECF Doc.\nOn May 4, 2018, Rock filed a second pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus. ECF Doc. 12-3 at 43. He argued that the grand jury that issued the indictment in his May 22, 1997 case lacked probable cause to enhance his misdemeanor offense into a felony. ECF Doc. 12-3 at 44. He also argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to indict him on a 5 in 20 specification because two of his predicate OVI convictions were uncounseled and the result of improper plea colloquies. ECF Doc. 12-3 at 44-48. The state moved to dismiss. ECF Doc. 12-3 at 62-69. And Rock filed a reply. ECF Doc. 12-3 at 71-73.\n\nOn July 23, 2018, the Ohio Court of Appeals granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, because Rock previously could have challenged the validity of the indictment on direct or collateral review. ECF Doc. 12-3 at 80-82. On August 10, 2018, Rock filed a notice of appeal with the Ohio Supreme Court. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 13-14. In his supporting memorandum of law, Rock raised two propositions of law:\n\n1st Proposition of Law: Was it an abuse of discretion and fraud upon the Court for [the] prosecutor to withhold documents and negate R.C.2945.75(B)(1) and R.C.2945.75(B)(3)?\n\n2nd Proposition of Law: Did the 11th Dist. abuse its discretion by dismissing [Rock\u2019s] petition where relief can be granted? And just as important did the judges dismiss their judicial duty of petitions Great Writ?\n\nECF Doc. 12-4 at 44. In support, he reiterated his jurisdictional challenge to the grand jury indictment, adding that the prosecutor withheld documents showing that his OVI predicate convictions were unconstitutional. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 50-51.\n\nOn October 19, 2018, the Ohio Supreme Court determined that the appeal should proceed as an appeal of right. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 71. Rock thereafter filed a merits brief, raising four propositions of law, three of which are relevant to his current petition:\n\n1st Proposition of Law: \u201cConstitutionally infirm\u201d conviction(s) cannot be used for enhancement, as they are void from the start ***.\n2nd Proposition of Law: Prosecutorial misconduct; *Brady* violation(s) as prosecutor used \u201c*Constitutionally Infirm*\u201d convictions to mislead the grand jury, commit Fraud Upon the Court and deceived the defense, all ethical violations and violation of criminal procedure(s).\n\n3rd Proposition of Law: Ineffective assistance of counsel resulted from the failure to investigate and failure to suppress uncounseled convictions, thus violating [Rock\u2019s] constitutional rights.\n\nECF Doc. 12-4 at 73. In support of his first proposition of law, Rock argued that his conviction on the 5 in 20 specification was void and unlawful because his predicate November 16, 1995 and May 22, 1997 OVI convictions were unconstitutional. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 81-84. The November 16, 1995 conviction, he argued, was unconstitutional because it was the result of an uncounseled no contest plea for which he never waived the right to counsel. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 81. The May 22, 1997 conviction, he argued, was unconstitutional because counsel was appointed and then vacated and then he entered a plea without a proper explanation of his rights and the consequences of a plea. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 82. The rights waiver he did sign, he argued, was invalidated by the lack of adequate explanation of his rights and the consequences of a plea. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 82-83.\n\nIn support of his second proposition of law, Rock argued that the state engaged in prosecutorial misconduct because the prosecutor knew two of his predicate OVI convictions were unconstitutional and yet brought the charge to the grand jury without providing them evidence of the deficiencies in his prior convictions. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 84-85. He also faulted the prosecutor for continuing to withhold information of the deficient prior OVI convictions through discovery, the plea hearing, and at sentencing. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 85-86.\nIn support of his third proposition of law, Rock argued that trial counsel was ineffective for not investigating his predicate OVI convictions and not moving to suppress them after he told counsel before sentencing of the deficiencies in those convictions. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 86-89. He further stated that his attorney on direct appeal told him the issue was res judicata barred and refused to argue the issue. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 89.\n\nThe state filed an appellee brief. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 155-66. And Rock filed a reply. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 167-83. On May 16, 2019, the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals\u2019 denial of Rock\u2019s state petition for writ of habeas corpus. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 184-88; Rock v. Harris, 157 Ohio St.3d 6 (Ohio 2019). The Ohio Supreme Court reasoned:\n\n{\u00b68} First, Rock makes three arguments challenging his OVI convictions: (1) a 1997 grand jury did not have probable cause to enhance a misdemeanor OVI charge to a felony, (2) he did not validly waive counsel in his 1995 and 1997 cases, thereby rendering those OVI convictions void, and (3) the prosecutor committed misconduct in the 2014 case. None of these claims are cognizable in habeas corpus. ***\n\n{\u00b69} Rock also argues that his repeat-offender specification was improper because of the alleged deficiencies of his 1995 and 1997 convictions and also that his counsel in the 2014 case was ineffective for failing to argue that the prior convictions were void. Neither claim is cognizable in habeas. Rock could have challenged the specification on appeal from his 2014 conviction, especially given the fact that he challenged it in the trial court prior to pleading guilty in his 2014 case. And claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel are not cognizable in habeas corpus.\n\nECF Doc. 12-4 at 186.\n\nII. Discussion\n\nA. Ground One: Unconstitutional 5 in 20 specification\n\nIn his Ground One claim, Rock contends that the use of uncounseled OVI convictions renders his conviction and sentence on the 5 in 20 specification unlawful. ECF Doc. 1 at 5. In his supporting memorandum of law, he asserts that his supporting exhibits show that two of his\nprior OVI convictions are invalid for lack of counsel and lack of a voluntary waiver of his right to counsel. ECF Doc. 1-2 at 9-11. These exhibits included the docket and judgment entries for Case Nos. 95C09727 and 97C03446, Sutherland\u2019s September 3, 2010 affidavit, and Rock\u2019s September 29, 2010 affidavit. ECF Doc. 1-3 at 8-19.\n\nWarden Eppinger responds that Rock\u2019s Ground One claim is not cognizable to the extent it alleges a violation of Ohio\u2019s Criminal Rules and Ohio\u2019s Rules of Evidence. ECF Doc. 12 at 33-34. Warden Eppinger argues that Rock\u2019s Ground One claim is also noncognizable because his conviction is the result of a guilty plea that he has not established was involuntary. ECF Doc. 12 at 34. Warden Eppinger alternatively argues that Rock\u2019s Ground One claim is procedurally defaulted because he failed to fairly present and properly exhaust a federal constitutional claim concerning the use of his prior OVI convictions in state court. ECF Doc. 12 at 35-36. And, Warden Eppinger argues, Rock has not established cause, prejudice, or actual innocence to excuse his default. ECF Doc. 12 at 36-37. Last, Warden Eppinger argues that Rock\u2019s Ground One claim is meritless. ECF Doc. 12 at 37-41.\n\nIn his traverse, Rock maintains that he has exhausted all available state court remedies, noting his state petition for writ of habeas corpus. ECF Doc. 18 at 2. Rock otherwise issues a blanket statement disputing Warden Eppinger\u2019s arguments. Id.\n\n1. Cognizability\n\nI disagree with Warden Eppinger\u2019s reading of Rock\u2019s Ground One claim. Warden Eppinger reads the claim as alleging violations of the Ohio Rules of Evidence during Rock\u2019s grand jury proceedings and underlying violations of Ohio Crim R. 44 in two of his predicate OVI pleas. If that were the true extent of Rock\u2019s Ground One claim, the claim would not be cognizable because it would seek federal habeas relief for an alleged violation of state law.\nEstelle v. McGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67 (1991) (\u201c[F]ederal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).\n\nAs I read it, however, Rock\u2019s Ground One claim, as stated in his \u00a7 2254 petition and elaborated on in his supporting memorandum, challenges instead the use of constitutionally defective guilty plea convictions to support to impose a punishment under a state recidivist statute. See ECF Doc. 1 at 5; ECF Doc. 1-2 at 9-11. Indeed, Rock cites and discusses Supreme Court precedent on that very issue. ECF Doc. 1-2 at 9-10 (citing Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25 (1972); Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109 (1967)). The Supreme Court has long held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel was a fundamental right incorporated against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 343-45 (1963). In Burgett, the Court held that a conviction obtained in violation of Gideon could not be used in a later case \u201cto support guilt or enhance punishment.\u201d 389 U.S. at 115. And in Argersinger, the Court extended the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to misdemeanor prosecutions that result in imprisonment. 407 U.S. at 36-37; see Scott v. Illinois, 440 U.S. 367, 369, 373-74 (1979) (limiting Argersinger to misdemeanor convictions that actually result in prison sentences). Taken in context with his cited precedent, Rock\u2019s Ground One claim is best read as raising Sixth Amendment challenge to the use of his prior convictions, under Burgett, to support a later charge of violating Ohio\u2019s recidivist statute (Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 2941.1413). Such a claim is cognizable in federal habeas.\n\nNext, as Warden Eppinger correctly observes, a guilty plea waives all non-jurisdictional constitutional claims based on pre-plea events. Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973). That includes a challenge to the propriety of the indictment or sufficiency of the evidence to convict the habeas petitioner, under which Rock\u2019s challenge to the use of his prior convictions\nwould fall. *Broadway v. Stewart*, No. 2:15-CV-11917, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 53981, at *8 (E.D. Mich. Apr. 22, 2016); *Brooks v. Warden, S. Ohio Corr. Facility*, No. 1:10-cv-953, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 150608, at *11-12 (S.D. Ohio Dec. 8, 2011); see also *McMann v. Richardson*, 397 U.S. 759, 766 (1970) (stating that a guilty plea waives \u201cthe right to contest the admissibility of any evidence the State might have offered against the defendant\u201d). A habeas petitioner in such an instance is limited only to attacking the voluntary and intelligent nature of his guilty plea. *Tollett*, 411 U.S. at 267. Although that would not render Rock\u2019s Ground One claim noncognizable; it would limit the scope of our merits review. *Hunter v. Bowersox*, 172 F.3d 1016, 1022 (8th Cir. 1999) (\u201cWhether a plea of guilty was constitutionally voluntary is a question of federal law.\u201d (citation omitted)).\n\n2. **Procedural Default**\n\nAlthough Rock\u2019s Ground One claim is cognizable to the extent it challenges the voluntary nature of his plea, it is, nevertheless, procedurally defaulted.\n\nProcedural default is \u201ca critical failure to comply with state procedural law,\u201d *Trest v. Cain*, 522 U.S. 87, 89 (1997), resulting in a bar to federal habeas review unless the petitioner makes the requisite showing, *Coleman v. Thompson*, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991). Procedural default occurs when: (1) the state courts didn\u2019t review the petitioner\u2019s claim on the merits because he didn\u2019t comply with some state procedural rule; or (2) he failed to fairly present the claim to the state courts while state court remedies were still available. *Williams v. Anderson*, 460 F.3d 789, 806 (6th Cir. 2006). The former occurs when: (1) the petitioner failed to comply with an applicable state procedural rule; (2) the state court actually enforced the rule; (3) the rule constituted an \u201cadequate an independent state ground;\u201d and (4) the petitioner cannot overcome\nhis procedural default through cause and prejudice. *Coleman v. Mitchell*, 268 F.3d 417, 427 (6th Cir. 2001).\n\nRock\u2019s Ground One claim is procedurally defaulted because the Ohio Supreme Court applied a state procedural rule to preclude merits review of the claim. *Williams*, 460 F.3d at 806; ECF Doc. 12-4 at 186. Rock raised his Ground One claim in his state petition for writ of habeas corpus, both initially to the Ohio Court of Appeals and on appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. ECF Doc. 12-3 at 44-48; ECF Doc. 12-4 at 81-83. But \u201c[t]he availability of adequate remedies at law, even if those remedies were not sought or were unsuccessful, preclude a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d *Perry v. Sloan*, 149 Ohio St.3d 690, 690 (Ohio 2017). Rock could have challenged the use of the use of his prior convictions on direct appeal. *State v. Wood*, 2018-Ohio-875, \u00b628 (Ohio Ct. App. 2018). He likewise could have challenged the validity/sufficiency of the indictment on direct appeal. *Luna v. Russell*, 70 Ohio St.3d 561, 562 (Ohio 1994).\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court \u2013 the relevant decision for purposes of our procedural default analysis \u2013 denied the claim as noncognizable because it could have been raised on direct appeal, thereby actually enforcing the bar on claims raised in state habeas for which adequate remedies at law existed. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 186; *Coleman*, 268 F.3d at 427; see also *Haliym v. Mitchell*, 492 F.3d 680, 691 (6th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[I]n determining whether a claim is procedurally defaulted, this Court must look to the last explained state court judgment.\u201d (emphasis in original)). And the bar against claims in a state habeas petition that could have been raised on direct review is an adequate and independent state ground for barring federal habeas review. *Gibson v. Haviland*, No. 5:17-cv-00008, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216407, at *41-42 (N.D. Ohio Aug. 14, 2017).\n\nLast, Rock cannot establish cause to overcome his procedural default. As the Ohio Supreme Court stated, Rock could have raised his Ground One claim on direct appeal but didn\u2019t.\nRock faults his appointed counsel for not arguing the issue on direct appeal. ECF Doc. 1 at 6. Ineffective assistance of counsel can establish cause to excuse procedural default. Joseph v. Coyle, 469 F.3d 441, 459 (6th Cir. 2006). Under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), ineffective assistance \u201cis deficient performance by counsel resulting in prejudice, with performance being measured against an objective standard of reasonableness of under prevailing professional norms.\u201d Moore v. Mitchell, 708 F.3d 760, 776 (6th Cir. 2013) (quotation marks omitted). Because the Ohio Court of Appeals addressed a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel on this very issue when it denied Rock\u2019s Ohio App. R. 26(B) application to reopen, we must afford that decision deference under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Id. at 777-78; ECF Doc. 12-1 at 210-11. Thus, Rock can only establish cause if the state court\u2019s decision finding no ineffective assistance of counsel: (1) was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court; or (2) was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the record before the state court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The relevant question isn\u2019t whether the state court got it right or wrong, but whether the state court\u2019s determination was \u201cunreasonable\u2014a substantially higher threshold.\u201d Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465, 473 (2007). The petitioner must show that the state court\u2019s \u201cdecision was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 102-03 (2011).\n\nThe Ohio Court of Appeals determined that appellate counsel was not ineffective for not raising Rock\u2019s Ground One claim because the issue would have been barred by res judicata. Rock could have \u2013 but did not \u2013 assert constitutional challenges to his prior convictions on appeal of those prior convictions. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 210-11. Rock\u2019s failure to challenge his\nprior convictions on the ground he was denied effective assistance of counsel doomed his ability to do so later. And the applicability of res judicata in such circumstances is an issue of state law; and we are required to defer to the state court\u2019s determination of such issues. *Van Tielen v. Robinson*, No. 1:13-cv-642, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 127384, at *24 (S.D. Ohio Sept. 10, 2014); *Estelle*, 502 U.S. at 67-68 (\u201cIt is not the province of a federal court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions.\u201d). Thus, because Rock\u2019s proposed Ground One claim would have been barred by res judicata, the state court\u2019s conclusion that counsel was not ineffective for not raising Rock\u2019s proposed Ground One claim was not so lacking in justification that it was beyond any possibility for fair-minded disagreement. *Harrington*, 562 U.S. at 102-03. Rock has therefore failed to establish cause to overcome his procedural default. And failure to establish cause makes it unnecessary to consider prejudice. *Matthews v. Ishee*, 486 F.3d 883, 891 (6th Cir. 2007).\n\nRock could attempt to overcome his procedural default under the fundamental miscarriage-of-justice exception. *Coleman*, 501 U.S. at 750. But he would have to produce new, reliable evidence establishing that he was actually innocent of the offense. *Schlup v. Delo*, 513 U.S. 298, 324 (1995); *Lundgren v. Mitchell*, 440 F.3d 754, 764 (6th Cir. 2006). Actual innocence means \u201cfactual innocence,\u201d i.e., that the petitioner \u201cdid not commit the acts forming the basis for his conviction.\u201d *Ross v. Berghuis*, 417 F.3d 552, 555-56 (6th Cir. 2005). Rock\u2019s legal challenge to the use of his prior predicate OVI convictions does not qualify as a claim of factual innocence. *E.g.*, *United States v. Pettiford*, 612 F.3d 270, 283-84 (4th Cir. 2010); *Pope v. Butler*, No. 6:12-cv-2623, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136064, at *11 (N.D. Ala. Aug. 8, 2012); *Webb v. Dir., Va. Dep\u2019t of corr.*, No. 7:05CV00654, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24075, at *7 (W.D.\nVa. Mar. 20, 2006). And Rock has not otherwise adduced any new, reliable evidence of his actual innocence.\n\nI recommend that Rock\u2019s Ground One claim be DISMISSED as procedurally defaulted.\n\nB. Ground Two Claim: Trial Counsel\u2019s Failure to Investigate or Suppress Uncounseled Predicate OVI Convictions\n\n1. Parties\u2019 Arguments\n\nIn his Ground Two claim, Rock argues that trial counsel was ineffective for not investigating and moving to suppress his uncounseled predicate OVI convictions. ECF Doc. 1 at 7. In his supporting memorandum of law, he adds that counsel misrepresented his prior no contest pleas to the trial court in this case when counsel said that the courts in the questioned OVI cases failed to advise Rock that he had voluntarily waived his right to counsel. Rock asserts that he did not voluntarily or intelligently waive his right to counsel in the 1995 or 1997 case. ECF Doc. 1-2 at 11-12.\n\nWarden Eppinger responds that Rock\u2019s Ground Two claim is procedurally defaulted because Rock failed to properly exhaust the issue in state court, as he did not raise the issue through the direct review process, and the state courts on collateral review determined the claim was barred by res judicata. ECF Doc. 12 at 42-43. Warden Eppinger argues that Rock cannot establish cause through a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because the Ohio Court of Appeals reasonably determined that appellate counsel wasn\u2019t deficient for not raising the issue in adjudicating his first application to reopen. ECF Doc. 12 at 43. Warden Eppinger argues further that Rock cannot establish cause through ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because such a claim would be procedurally defaulted based on the Ohio Court of Appeals\u2019 denial as untimely of his second application to reopen. Id. Alternatively, Warden Eppinger argues the claim is meritless. ECF Doc. 12 at 44-48.\n2. Procedural Default\n\nRock\u2019s Ground Two claim is procedurally defaulted, because the Ohio Supreme Court enforced a state procedural rule to preclude merits review of the claim. As discussed above, a claim is procedurally defaulted if the state court declined to consider the merits of an issue because the petitioner failed to comply with a state procedural rule, or the claim was not fairly presented. *Williams*, 460 F.3d at 806. To briefly address fair presentment, Rock raised his Ground Two claim initially in his state petition for post-conviction relief, but he did not raise it again on appeal from the denial of his post-conviction relief petition either to the Ohio Court of Appeals or the Ohio Supreme Court. *ECF Doc. 12-1 at 301-02, 421-22, 520-24*. He attempted to raise the issue again in his second *Ohio App. R. 26(B)* application to reopen, but he did not appeal the denial of *that* application to the Ohio Supreme Court. *ECF Doc. 12-1 at 266; see Docket for Ohio App. Ct., 11th Dist. Case Nos. 2015-L-047, 2016-L-011*. If that had been the end of the matter, then Rock\u2019s Ground Two claim would have been procedurally defaulted because in both instances Rock failed to raise his Ground Two claim at every stage of Ohio\u2019s review process \u2013 all the way up to the Ohio Supreme Court. *Wagner v. Smith*, 581 F.3d 410, 418 (6th Cir. 2009).\n\nBut that\u2019s not where Rock\u2019s efforts to raise his Ground Two claim ended. He raised it again in his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, and pursued the claim all the way through the Ohio Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court. *ECF Doc. 12-2 at 13-14, 150-51, 214-16*. That was enough to meet his obligation to fairly present the claim at every state of Ohio\u2019s appellate process. *Wagner*, 581 F.3d at 418.\n\nThat being said, Rock\u2019s Ground Two claim is procedurally defaulted because the last state court decision to address his claim \u2013 the Ohio Supreme Court on appeal from denial of his\nstate habeas petition \u2013 applied a procedural rule to bar review of the claim on the merits. See Haliym, 492 F.3d at 691 Dickson v. Sullivan, No. 2:17-cv-08290, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 192946, at *2 (C.D. Cal. Nov. 20, 2017) (reviewing the state court\u2019s procedural ruling on the \u201cmost recent round of state collateral review\u201d). The Ohio Supreme Court declined to review the claim because \u201cclaims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel are not cognizable in habeas corpus.\u201d ECF Doc. 12-4 at 186. The rule underlying that procedural ruling is that such claims could have been or were unsuccessfully raised on direct and post-conviction review. Cornell v. Schotten, 69 Ohio St. 3d 466, 467 (Ohio 1994). The Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s determination on that issue was an adequate and independent ground upon which to preclude merits-based review in a federal habeas case. Gibson, No. 5:17-cv-00008, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216407, at *41-42.\n\nRock cannot establish cause to overcome his procedural default. As with his Ground One claim, Rock faults his appellate counsel for not raising the issue on direct appeal. ECF Doc. 1 at 7. But the Ohio Court of Appeals determined that appellate counsel was not ineffective for not raising Rock\u2019s Ground Two claim because the issue would have been barred by res judicata; the propriety of his prior OVI convictions could have been raised in direct or collateral review from those convictions. ECF Doc. 12-1 at 210-11. Giving deference to the state court\u2019s determination on the applicability of res judicata in reviewing appellate counsel\u2019s performance, the state court\u2019s conclusion that counsel was not ineffective for not raising Rock\u2019s proposed Ground Two claim was not so lacking in justification that it was beyond any possibility for fair-minded disagreement. Harrington, 562 U.S. at 102-03. Rock has therefore failed to established cause to overcome his procedural default, and failure to establish cause makes it unnecessary to consider prejudice. Matthews, 486 F.3d at 891. And Rock cannot overcome his procedural default under\nthe fundamental miscarriage-of-justice exception because, as discussed above, a mere challenge to the use of his predicate OVI convictions does not qualify as a claim of factual innocence.\n\nI recommend that Rock\u2019s Ground Two claim be DISMISSED as procedurally defaulted.\n\nC. Ground Three Claim: Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n1. Parties\u2019 Arguments\n\nIn his Ground Three claim, Rock contends that the state committed prosecutorial misconduct by withholding, in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), evidence showing the constitutionally infirm nature of his prior convictions. ECF Doc. 1 at 8; ECF Doc. 1-2 at 13-15.\n\nWarden Eppinger responds that Rock\u2019s Ground Three claim is not cognizable to the extent that he alleges violations of state law and ethics rules, and any underlying due process challenge to the admission of evidence in state court would be procedurally defaulted as unexhausted. ECF Doc. 12 at 49-53. Warden Eppinger argues that any constitutional claim was waived by the guilty plea. ECF Doc. 12 at 49-50. Alternatively, Warden Eppinger argues that the Ohio Court of Appeals reasonably determined that the Ground Three claim was barred by res judicata, and that Rock failed to establish that his predicate OVI convictions were constitutionally infirm or that the state suppressed evidence. ECF Doc. 12 at 53-57\n\n2. Cognizability\n\nI disagree with Warden Eppinger\u2019s reading of Rock\u2019s Ground Three claim. It asserts \u2013 explicitly \u2013 a Brady claim. The Supreme Court held in Brady that the suppression of material, exculpatory evidence violates a criminal defendant\u2019s due process rights. Brady, 373 U.S. at 87. By asserting a Brady claim, Rock is asserting that he is being held in violation of his due process rights, because the state withheld exculpatory evidence concerning his prior OVI convictions.\nSuch a claim, if not procedurally defaulted, is cognizable in a federal habeas case. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). Warden Eppinger is correct, however, that a properly entered guilty plea can waive a Brady claim. Carley v. Hudson, 563 F. Supp. 2d 760, 774 (N.D. Ohio 2008). As discussed above, however, such a finding would change \u2013 but not eliminate \u2013 our merits review. Tollett, 411 U.S. at 267; Hunter, 172 F.3d at 1022.\n\n3. Procedural Default\n\nAlthough cognizable, Rock\u2019s Ground Three claim is procedurally defaulted, because the Ohio Supreme Court \u2013 the last state court to address his Brady claim \u2013 declined to review it on the merits after applying a state procedural to find the claim barred. See Haliym, 492 F.3d at 691; Dickson, No. 2:17-cv-08290, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 192946, at *2. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled that Rock\u2019s Brady claim was not cognizable in a state habeas corpus case because the claim could have been raised on direct appeal or in a post-conviction proceeding. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 186. See Williamson v. Williams, 103 Ohio St.3d 25, 25 (Ohio 2004); Hayden v. Morris, No. 93 CA 1974, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 1131, at *8 (Ohio Ct. App. Mar. 16, 1994). That was an adequate and independent ground upon which to preclude merits-based review in our court. Gibson, No. 5:17-cv-00008, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 216407, at *41-42.\n\nRock cannot establish cause to overcome the procedural default of his Ground Three claim. As with his Ground One and Ground Two claims, he faults appellate counsel for not raising the issue. ECF Doc. 12-4 at 9. But that contention is itself procedurally defaulted because, although Rock raised the issue in his second application to reopen, he did not appeal the denial of that application to the Ohio Supreme Court, and he has not shown cause for failing to do so. Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 451 (2000); Wagner, 581 F.3d at 418; ECF Doc. 12-1 at 265; Docket for Ohio App. Ct., 11th Dist. Case Nos. 2015-L-047, 2016-L-011. Failure to\nestablish cause makes it unnecessary to consider prejudice. *Matthews*, 486 F.3d at 891. Thus, Rock\u2019s Ground Three claim is procedurally defaulted. *Coleman*, 268 F.3d 427. And as discussed above, the legality of his prior convictions does not pertain to his factual innocence.\n\nI recommend that Rock\u2019s Ground Three claim be DISMISSED as procedurally defaulted.\n\nIII. Certificate of Appealability\n\nA. Legal Standard\n\nRule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts provides that \u201c[t]he district court must issue or deny a certificate of appealability (\u2018COA\u2019) when it enters a final order adverse to the applicant.\u201d Rule 11(a), 28 U.S.C. foll. \u00a7 2254. The rule tracks the requirement of \u00a7 2253(c)(3) that any grant of a certificate of appealability \u201cstate the specific issue or issues that satisfy the showing required by \u00a7 2253 (c)(2),\u201d Rule 11(a). In light of the Rule 11 requirement that the Court either grant or deny the certificate of appealability at the time of its final adverse order, a recommendation regarding the COA issue is included here.\n\nUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A), this court will grant a COA for an issue raised in a \u00a72254 habeas petition only if the petitioner has made a substantial showing of the denial of a federal constitutional right. *Cunningham v. Shoop*, 817 F. App\u2019x 223, 224 (6th Cir. 2020). A petitioner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists \u201ccould disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d *Buck v. Davis*, 137 S. Ct. 759, 773 (2017) (quotation marks omitted); *see also Slack v. McDaniel*, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000). When a claim is denied on procedural grounds, the petitioner must show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a\nconstitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d *Slack*, 529 U.S. at 484.\n\n**B. Analysis**\n\nIf the Court accepts my recommendations, Rock will not be able to show that the Court\u2019s rulings on his claims are debatable among jurists of reason. Rock\u2019s Ground One, Ground Two, and Ground Three claims are procedurally defaulted. Because jurists of reason would not find debatable that habeas relief is not available for any of the claims raised in Rock\u2019s petition, I recommend that no certificate of appealability issue in this case.\n\n**IV. Recommendation**\n\nBecause all of Rock\u2019s claims are procedurally defaulted, I recommend that Rock\u2019s claims be DISMISSED and that his petition for writ of habeas corpus be DENIED. I further recommend that Rock not be granted a certificate of appealability.\n\nDated: September 8, 2021\n\nThomas M. Parker\nUnited States Magistrate Judge\n\n---\n\n**OBJECTIONS**\n\nAny objections to this Report and Recommendation must be filed with the Clerk of Courts within fourteen (14) days after being served with a copy of this document. Failure to file objections within the specified time may waive the right to appeal the District Court\u2019s order. *See U.S. v. Walters*, 638 F.2d 947 (6th Cir. 1981). *See also Thomas v. Arn*, 474 U.S. 140 (1985), *reh\u2019g denied*, 474 U.S. 1111 (1986)."}

Johnson advances two \nproposed assignments of error argu ing that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue \nthat trial counsel was in effective and that his sentence is voi d.  Johnson\u2019s application is denied \nbecause it is untimely without a sufficient showing of good cause for the later filing. \nFacts and Procedural Background \n{\u00b62} Johnson was convicted of one count of ra pe of a child under the age of ten and \nsentenced to a prison term of 25 years to life.  He  appealed that conviction to this court claiming \nthat it was against the manifest weight of the evidence, the court erred in failing to provide him \nwith two attorneys at trial, prosecutorial misconduct occurred at trial when the state commented \non his post-arrest silence, and trial counsel was cons titutionally ineffective.  Id. at \uf05f 1.  This court overruled Johnson\u2019s assigned errors and affirmed his c onviction and sentence on April 21, \n2016.  Id. at \uf05f 38.    \n{\u00b63} On December 18, 2018, Johnson filed the inst ant application for reopening.  The \nstate timely filed a brief in opposition, pointing out that the application is untimely without good \ncause and arguing the application fails on the merits.  \n \nLaw and Analysis \nI.  Timeliness  \n{\u00b64} App.R. 26(B) provides a means of redress for claims that appointed appellate \ncounsel provided ineffective assistance during an  appeal.  However, th e rule has a strict \ndeadline that must be rigorously enforced.  App.R. 26(B)(2)(b); State v. Gumm, 103 Ohio St.3d \n162, 2004-Ohio-4755, 814 N.E.2d 861, \u00b6 7-8,10; State v. LaMar , 102 Ohio St.3d 467, \n2004-Ohio-3976, 812 N.E.2d 970.  App.R. 26(B)(1) provide s that an application must be filed \nwithin 90 days of the date of journalization of the appellate decision.  Appli cations filed outside \nthat time must show good cause for the untimely filing.  App.R. 26(B)(2)(b).   \n{\u00b65} Approximately 971 days elapsed between the journalization of the appellate decision \nand the filing of the instant application.  Theref ore, Johnson is required to establish good cause \nfor the untimely application before this court addresses the merits.   \n{\u00b66} In an effort to establish good cause, Johnson first argues that he was denied access to \na transcript of proceedings that was required for him to file his application.  \n{\u00b67} This court has rejected similar arguments.  State v. Gaston, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. \n79626, 2007-Ohio-155, \uf05f 8, citing State v. Houston , 73 Ohio St.3d 346, 1995-Ohio-317, 652 \nN.E.2d 1018.  In Gaston, we held that lack of access to lega l materials, transcripts or similar materials did not constitute g ood cause for untimely filing.  Id.  Similar to Houston, Johnson \nargues that a transcript was required in order to file his application.  Houston at 346.  Also \nsimilar to Houston, part of Johnson\u2019s claim is that trial counsel failed to call certain witnesses or \nobtain certain evidence.  Id. The Houston court found these assertions  did not rely on a trial \ntranscript in order to be advanced  in an application for reopening.  Id.  The same is true here \nfor many of the issues raised in Johnson\u2019s propos ed assignment of error.  Therefore, Johnson\u2019s \nlack of access to transcripts is not grounds for untimely filing.  \n{\u00b68} Next, Johnson asserts that his sentence is void and this should excuse the untimely \nfiling of his application.  Whether Johnson\u2019s sentence is void does not impact his ability to \ntimely file an application for reopening.  Johnson filed a direct  appeal, this court heard and \ndetermined the matter and Johnson filed an application for reope ning from that determination. \nAn alleged sentencing error does not impact Johns on\u2019s ability to timely file  an application for \nreopening.  \n{\u00b69} Johnson\u2019s application for reopening is un timely without a showing of good cause.  \nThis is sufficient grounds to deny the application.

THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN NOT HOLDING AN \nEVIDENTIARY HEARING2. \nLaw and Analysis \n{\u00b67} In his assignments of error, Shuster maintains that the trial court erred in \noverruling his most recent motion for a new trial without conducting an evidentiary \nhearing. \nStandard of Appellate Review. \n{\u00b68} Crim.R. 33(B) provides that if a defendant fails to file a motion for a new trial \nwithin 120 days of the jury\u2019s verdict, he or she must seek leave from the trial court to file \na delayed motion.  To obtain leave, the defendant must show by clear and convincing \nproof that he or she was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence within the \n120 days.  State v.

Whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Shuster\u2019s motion for a \nnew trial without a hearing. \n                                            \n2 Appellant\u2019s Brief, filed Apr. 22, 2109 at 1.  We note that Shuster does not separately argue the \ntwo assignments of error in his brief.  See, App.R. 16(A)(7).  \n{\u00b610} This was not Shuster\u2019s first motion for a new trial.  He has filed previous \nmotions in 2013 and 2016.  See, State v. Shuster, 5th Dist. Morgan No. 18 AP 003, 2018-\nOhio-2901, \u00b64; \u00b65.  The motion was not filed within 120 days of the 2013 jury verdict in \nthe case at bar.  Shuster did not request leave to file a motion for a new trial in accordance \nwith Crim.R.  33(B). \n{\u00b611} Trial courts should subject Crim.R. 33(A)(6) new trial motions to the closest \nscrutiny: \n Applications for new trials on the ground of newly discovered \nevidence are not, however, favored by the courts, for the reason that the \nmoving party has generally had ample opportunity to prepare his case \ncarefully and to secure all of the evidence before the trial.  Such \napplications, whether in a court of law or in a court of equity, are entertained \nwith reluctance and granted with caution, not only because of the danger of \nperjury, but also because of the manifest injustice in allowing a party to \nallege that which may be the consequence of his own neglect in order to \ndefeat an adverse verdict.  In order to prevent, as far as possible, the fraud \nand imposition which defeated parties may be tempted to practice as a last \nresort to escape the consequence of an adverse verdict, an application \nsetting up the discovery of new evidence should always be subjected to the \nclosest scrutiny by the court.  The applicant is required to rebut the \npresumption that the verdict is correct and that there has been a lack of due \ndiligence and to establish other facts essential to warrant the granting of a \nnew trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence.  The rule to be  \ndeduced from the cases is that where newly discovered evidence is of such \nconclusive nature, or of such decisive or preponderating character, that it \nwould with reasonable certainty have changed the verdict or materially \nreduced the recovery, a new trial should be granted if it is satisfactorily \nshown why the evidence was not discovered and produced at the time of \nthe trial. \nTaylor v. Ross , 150 Ohio St. 448, 450\u201351, 83 N.E.2d 222, 224 (1948), quoting 39 \nAmerican Jurisprudence, 163, Section 156; accord Domanski v. Woda, 132 Ohio St. 208, \n6 N.E.2d 601 (1937). \n{\u00b612} Shuster raises two grounds in support of his motion for a new trial.  First, \nShuster contends that the prosecutor commi tted misconduct by placing victim impact \nevidence before the jury.  Second, Shuster argues that his rights to due process and a \nfair trial were infringed when the trial court denied his motion for a new trial after he had \nlearned that some of the jurors had wrongly believed that he had confessed to the crime. \nVictim Impact Testimony.  \n{\u00b613} In the case at bar, the so-called victim impact alluded to by Shuster is readily \napparent from the record.  His only argument on appeal is that the minor victim in this \ncase, Shuster\u2019s stepdaughter, \u201cbroke down on the stand.\u201d [Appellant\u2019s Brief filed Apr. 22, \n2019 at 4]. Shuster\u2019s trial attorneys and Shuster himself was aware of this, as they were \npresent at the jury trial in 2013.  \n{\u00b614} Accordingly, Shuster has not demonstrated he was unavoidably prevented \nfrom discovering the alleged newly discovered evidence.   \n  \nConfession Testimony. \n{\u00b615} The second ground alleged by Shuster in his motion for a new trial was \ncontention that the jurors believed that Shuster had confessed and this belief influenced \nthe jury\u2019s decision to convict Shuster.  [Appellant\u2019s Brief, filed Apr. 22, 2019 at 5]. \n{\u00b616} Shuster previously raised the argument that the prosecutor committed \nmisconduct by referencing a \u201cnon-existent confession\u201d in closing arguments.  Shuster v. \nWarden, 6th Cir. No. 19-3184, 2019 WL 4267748 (June 10, 2019); State v. Shuster, 5th \nDist. Morgan No. 15AP0017, 2016-Ohio-5030, \u00b616.  The United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Sixth Circuit noted, \nAlthough Shuster claims to have raised this claim in his motion for a \nnew trial, Shuster did not raise a claim of prosecutorial misconduct based \non the prosecutor\u2019s reference to a confession in closing argument until his \nmemorandum in support of jurisdiction to the Ohio Supreme Court in the \nappeal of that motion.  \nShuster v. Warden, 6th Cir. No. 19-3184, 2019 WL 4267748 (June 10, 2019) at *2. \nUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted \ndefendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding, \nexcept an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process \nthat was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in \nthat judgment of conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.  State v. Szefcyk , 77 \nOhio St.3d 93, 671 N.E.2d 233(1996), syllabus, approving and following State v. Perry, \n10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104(1967), paragraph nine of the syllabus.  It is well settled \nthat, \"pursuant to res judicata, a defendant cannot raise an issue in a [petition] for post- \nconviction relief if he or she could have raised the issue on direct appeal.\u201d  State v. \nReynolds, 79 Ohio St.3d 158, 161, 679 N.E.2d 1131(1997).  Accordingly, \"[t]o survive \npreclusion by res judicata, a petitioner must produce new evidence that would render the \njudgment void or voidable and must also show that he could not have appealed the claim \nbased upon information contained in the original record.\u201d  State v. Nemchik, 9th Dist. \nLorain No. 98CA007279, 2000 WL 254908, *1 (Mar. 8, 2000); State v. Elmore, 5th Dist. \nLicking No. 2005-CA-32, 2005-Ohio-5940, \u00b618. \n{\u00b617} Thus, to the extent that the Courts have already addressed this issue the \ndoctrine of res judicata bars any further consideration.  See State v. Szefcyk,  77 Ohio \nSt.3d 93, 671 N.E.2d 233, 1996-Ohio-337; State v. Perry (1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 \nN.E.2d 104. \n{\u00b618} Shuster\u2019s claim that he could not discover this evidence until his investigator \ninterviewed several of the jurors is unpersuasive.  [Appellant\u2019s Brief filed Apr. 22, 2019 at \n5]. \na. Evid. R. 606, the Aliunde Rule.   \n{\u00b619} Evid.R. 606(B) governs the competency of a juror to testify, \n(B) Inquiry Into Validity of Verdict or Indictment.  Upon an inquiry into \nthe validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter \nor statement occurring during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations or to the \neffect of anything upon that or any other juror\u2019s mind or emotions as \ninfluencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or \nconcerning the juror\u2019s mental processes in connection therewith.  A juror \nmay testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was  \nimproperly brought to the jury\u2019s attention or whether any outside influence \nwas improperly brought to bear on any juror, only after some outside \nevidence of that act or event has been presented.  However a juror may \ntestify without the presentation of any outside evidence concerning any \nthreat, any bribe, any attempted threat or bribe, or any improprieties of any \nofficer of the court.  A juror\u2019s affidavit or evidence of any statement by the \njuror concerning a matter about which the juror would be precluded from \ntestifying will not be received for these purposes.  Upon an inquiry into the \nvalidity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or \nstatement occurring during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations or to the \neffect of anything upon his or any other juror\u2019s mind or emotions as \ninfluencing him to assent to or dissent from the verdict * * * or concerning \nhis mental processes in connection therewith. * * * His affidavit or evidence \nof any statement by him concerning a matter about which he would be \nprecluded from testifying will not be received for these purposes.   \n{\u00b620} Evid.R. 606(B) is subject to the exception embodied in the aliunde rule, \nwhich permits a juror to offer testimony impeaching his verdict upon the presentation of \nimpeachment evidence from a competent source other than a juror.  See State v. Kehn, \n50 Ohio St.2d 11, 18, 361 N.E.2d 1330(1977), certiorari denied, 434 U.S. 858, 98 S.Ct. \n180, 54 L.Ed.2d 130(1977). \n{\u00b621} The purpose of the aliunde rule is to maintain the sanctity of the jury room \nand the deliberations therein.  State v. Rudge, 89 Ohio App.3d 429, 438\u2013439, 624 N.E.2d \n1069, 1075\u20131076(1993).  The rule is designed to ensure the finality of jury verdicts and  \nto protect jurors from being harassed by defeated parties.  The rule requires a foundation \nfrom non-juror sources.  Thus, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe information \n[alleging misconduct] must be from a source which possesses firsthand knowledge of the \nimproper conduct.  One juror\u2019s affidavit alleging misconduct of another juror may not be \nconsidered without evidence aliunde being introduced first.\u201d  State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio \nSt.3d 71, 75, 564 N.E.2d 54, 61 (1990).  \n{\u00b622} The only exception that the Supreme Court has made to Rule 606(b)(1)\u2019s \nprohibitions is \u201cwhen, after the jury is discharged, a juror comes forward with compelling \nevidence that another juror made clear and explicit statements indicating that racial \nanimus was a significant motivating factor in his or her vote to convict.\u201d  Pena-Rodriguez \nv. Colorado, __ U.S. __, 137 S.Ct. 855, 869, 197 L.Ed.2d 107 (Mar. 6, 2017).   \n{\u00b623} The affidavit of Shuster and any affidavit of the investigator or a juror would \nmerely relay the jurors\u2019 statements.  This evidence is also barred by Evid.R. 606. \u201cIn order \nto permit juror testimony to impeach the verdict, a foundation of extraneous, independent \nevidence must first be established.  This foundation must consist of information from \nsources other than the jurors themselves, Wicker v. Cleveland, 150 Ohio St. 434, 38 O.O. \n299, 83 N.E.2d 56(1948), and the information must be from a source which possesses \nfirsthand knowledge of the improper conduct ... Similarly, where an attorney is told by a \njuror about another juror\u2019s possible misconduct, the attorney\u2019s testimony is incompetent \nand may not be received for the purposes of impeaching the verdict or for laying a \nfoundation of evidence aliunde. See Tasin v. SIFCO Industries, Inc. (1990), 50 Ohio St.3d \n102, 553 N.E.2d 257; Dodd v. McCammon (1920), 14 Ohio App. 160, 32 Ohio C.C. (N.S.) \n68\u201d.  State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 75-76, 564 N.E.2d 54, 61(1990).  \n{\u00b624} As this Court has already stated, \nAs a juror in the case, Mr. Cooper cannot now impeach his own \nverdict with his own statement alone.  Evid.R. 606 has been consistently \nupheld as the law relative to the impeachment of jury verdicts.  \u201cThe rule is \ndesigned to protect the finality of verdicts and to ensure that jurors are \ninsulated from harassment by defeated parties.\u201d  Schiebel, supra, at 75.  \nSee also State v. Adams, 141 Ohio St. 423 (1943). \nState v. Shuster, 5th Dist. Morgan No. 15AP0017, 2016-Ohio-5030, \u00b616.  In that case, \nShuster had filed a motion for a new trial on June 5, 2013, arguing juror misconduct3.  In \nsupport of his motion, Shuster filed an affidavit from Richard Cooper, a juror from his trial, \nstating, in part, \n4. That we jurors had heard, prior to trial and since the time of the \narrest of Michael Shane Shuster, that he had confessed to the charges filed \nagainst him and for those charges which were the subject of the trial. \n5. That the Prosecuting Attorney, during his closing argument, told \nthe jury that Michael Shane Shuster had confessed to the charges. \n6. That we thought our deliberations were just a formality since we \nwere told that Michael Shane Shuster had confessed.  \nShuster, \u00b612. \n                                            \n3 Shuster filed in the trial court a sworn affidavit of Richard Cooper on November 17, 2014, claiming it to \nbe a substitute for a previously filed handwritten statement.  On June 22, September 4, and October 5, \n2015, Shuster filed motions to amend and supplement his motion for new trial.  By journal entry filed October \n30, 2015, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for new trial.  Shuster, \u00b63. \n  \n{\u00b625} Accordingly, Shuster has not demonstrated he was unavoidably prevented \nfrom discovering the alleged newly discovered evidence.  In addition, because we have \nalready addressed this issue, the doctrine of res judicata bars any further consideration.  \nSee State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 671 N.E.2d 233, 1996-Ohio-337; State v. Perry \n(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104. \n{\u00b626} The trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling Shuster\u2019s motion for \na new trial without conducting an evidentiary hearing. \n{\u00b627} Shuster First and Second Assignments of Error are overruled. \n{\u00b628} The judgment of the Morgan County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. \nBy Gwin, P.J., \nWise, J., and \nDelaney, J., concur \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  ", "case_juv": "0", "case_crim": "0", "case_2001": "0", "case_app": "0", "case_pros": "0", "aoe_none": "1", "aoe_grandjury": "0", "aoe_court": "1", "aoe_defense": "0", "aoe_procbar": "1", "aoe_prochist": "0", "case_timeframe": "0", "other": "295    0\nName: other, dtype: int64", "olmocr_text": "COURT OF APPEALS\nMORGAN COUNTY, OHIO\nFIFTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\n\nSTATE OF OHIO : Hon.

Whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying Shuster's motion for a new trial without a hearing.\n\n---\n\n2 Appellant\u2019s Brief, filed Apr. 22, 2109 at 1. We note that Shuster does not separately argue the two assignments of error in his brief. See, App.R. 16(A)(7).\nThis was not Shuster\u2019s first motion for a new trial. He has filed previous motions in 2013 and 2016. See, State v. Shuster, 5th Dist. Morgan No. 18 AP 003, 2018-Ohio-2901, \u00b64; \u00b65. The motion was not filed within 120 days of the 2013 jury verdict in the case at bar. Shuster did not request leave to file a motion for a new trial in accordance with Crim.R. 33(B).\n\nTrial courts should subject Crim.R. 33(A)(6) new trial motions to the closest scrutiny:\n\nApplications for new trials on the ground of newly discovered evidence are not, however, favored by the courts, for the reason that the moving party has generally had ample opportunity to prepare his case carefully and to secure all of the evidence before the trial. Such applications, whether in a court of law or in a court of equity, are entertained with reluctance and granted with caution, not only because of the danger of perjury, but also because of the manifest injustice in allowing a party to allege that which may be the consequence of his own neglect in order to defeat an adverse verdict. In order to prevent, as far as possible, the fraud and imposition which defeated parties may be tempted to practice as a last resort to escape the consequence of an adverse verdict, an application setting up the discovery of new evidence should always be subjected to the closest scrutiny by the court. The applicant is required to rebut the presumption that the verdict is correct and that there has been a lack of due diligence and to establish other facts essential to warrant the granting of a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence. The rule to be\ndeduced from the cases is that where newly discovered evidence is of such conclusive nature, or of such decisive or preponderating character, that it would with reasonable certainty have changed the verdict or materially reduced the recovery, a new trial should be granted if it is satisfactorily shown why the evidence was not discovered and produced at the time of the trial.\n\n*Taylor v. Ross*, 150 Ohio St. 448, 450\u201351, 83 N.E.2d 222, 224 (1948), *quoting* 39 American Jurisprudence, 163, Section 156; *accord Domanski v. Woda*, 132 Ohio St. 208, 6 N.E.2d 601 (1937).\n\n{\u00b612} Shuster raises two grounds in support of his motion for a new trial. First, Shuster contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by placing victim impact evidence before the jury. Second, Shuster argues that his rights to due process and a fair trial were infringed when the trial court denied his motion for a new trial after he had learned that some of the jurors had wrongly believed that he had confessed to the crime.\n\n*Victim Impact Testimony.*\n\n{\u00b613} In the case at bar, the so-called victim impact alluded to by Shuster is readily apparent from the record. His only argument on appeal is that the minor victim in this case, Shuster\u2019s stepdaughter, \u201cbroke down on the stand.\u201d [Appellant\u2019s Brief filed Apr. 22, 2019 at 4]. Shuster\u2019s trial attorneys and Shuster himself was aware of this, as they were present at the jury trial in 2013.\n\n{\u00b614} Accordingly, Shuster has not demonstrated he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the alleged newly discovered evidence.\nConfession Testimony.\n\n{\u00b615} The second ground alleged by Shuster in his motion for a new trial was contention that the jurors believed that Shuster had confessed and this belief influenced the jury's decision to convict Shuster. [Appellant's Brief, filed Apr. 22, 2019 at 5].\n\n{\u00b616} Shuster previously raised the argument that the prosecutor committed misconduct by referencing a \u201cnon-existent confession\u201d in closing arguments. Shuster v. Warden, 6th Cir. No. 19-3184, 2019 WL 4267748 (June 10, 2019); State v. Shuster, 5th Dist. Morgan No. 15AP0017, 2016-Ohio-5030, \u00b616. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit noted,\n\nAlthough Shuster claims to have raised this claim in his motion for a new trial, Shuster did not raise a claim of prosecutorial misconduct based on the prosecutor's reference to a confession in closing argument until his memorandum in support of jurisdiction to the Ohio Supreme Court in the appeal of that motion.\n\nShuster v. Warden, 6th Cir. No. 19-3184, 2019 WL 4267748 (June 10, 2019) at *2.\n\nUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding, except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.

It is well settled that, \"pursuant to res judicata, a defendant cannot raise an issue in a [petition] for post-\nconviction relief if he or she could have raised the issue on direct appeal.\u201d State v. Reynolds, 79 Ohio St.3d 158, 161, 679 N.E.2d 1131(1997). Accordingly, \"[t]o survive preclusion by res judicata, a petitioner must produce new evidence that would render the judgment void or voidable and must also show that he could not have appealed the claim based upon information contained in the original record.\u201d State v. Nemchik, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 98CA007279, 2000 WL 254908, *1 (Mar. 8, 2000); State v. Elmore, 5th Dist. Licking No. 2005-CA-32, 2005-Ohio-5940, \u00b618.\n\n{\u00b617} Thus, to the extent that the Courts have already addressed this issue the doctrine of res judicata bars any further consideration. See State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 671 N.E.2d 233, 1996-Ohio-337; State v. Perry (1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104.\n\n{\u00b618} Shuster\u2019s claim that he could not discover this evidence until his investigator interviewed several of the jurors is unpersuasive. [Appellant\u2019s Brief filed Apr. 22, 2019 at 5].\n\na. Evid. R. 606, the Aliunde Rule.\n\n{\u00b619} Evid.R. 606(B) governs the competency of a juror to testify,\n\n(B) Inquiry Into Validity of Verdict or Indictment. Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury's deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other juror's mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the juror's mental processes in connection therewith. A juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was\nimproperly brought to the jury\u2019s attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror, only after some outside evidence of that act or event has been presented. However a juror may testify without the presentation of any outside evidence concerning any threat, any bribe, any attempted threat or bribe, or any improprieties of any officer of the court. A juror\u2019s affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror concerning a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying will not be received for these purposes. Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations or to the effect of anything upon his or any other juror\u2019s mind or emotions as influencing him to assent to or dissent from the verdict * * * or concerning his mental processes in connection therewith. * * * His affidavit or evidence of any statement by him concerning a matter about which he would be precluded from testifying will not be received for these purposes.\n\n{\u00b620} Evid.R. 606(B) is subject to the exception embodied in the aliunde rule, which permits a juror to offer testimony impeaching his verdict upon the presentation of impeachment evidence from a competent source other than a juror. See State v. Kehn, 50 Ohio St.2d 11, 18, 361 N.E.2d 1330(1977), certiorari denied, 434 U.S. 858, 98 S.Ct. 180, 54 L.Ed.2d 130(1977).\n\n{\u00b621} The purpose of the aliunde rule is to maintain the sanctity of the jury room and the deliberations therein. State v. Rudge, 89 Ohio App.3d 429, 438\u2013439, 624 N.E.2d 1069, 1075\u20131076(1993). The rule is designed to ensure the finality of jury verdicts and\nto protect jurors from being harassed by defeated parties. The rule requires a foundation from non-juror sources. Thus, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that \u201cthe information [alleging misconduct] must be from a source which possesses firsthand knowledge of the improper conduct. One juror\u2019s affidavit alleging misconduct of another juror may not be considered without evidence aliunde being introduced first.\u201d State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 75, 564 N.E.2d 54, 61 (1990).\n\n{\u00b622} The only exception that the Supreme Court has made to Rule 606(b)(1)'s prohibitions is \u201cwhen, after the jury is discharged, a juror comes forward with compelling evidence that another juror made clear and explicit statements indicating that racial animus was a significant motivating factor in his or her vote to convict.\u201d Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, __ U.S. __, 137 S.Ct. 855, 869, 197 L.Ed.2d 107 (Mar. 6, 2017).\n\n{\u00b623} The affidavit of Shuster and any affidavit of the investigator or a juror would merely relay the jurors\u2019 statements. This evidence is also barred by Evid.R. 606. \u201cIn order to permit juror testimony to impeach the verdict, a foundation of extraneous, independent evidence must first be established. This foundation must consist of information from sources other than the jurors themselves, Wicker v. Cleveland, 150 Ohio St. 434, 38 O.O. 299, 83 N.E.2d 56(1948), and the information must be from a source which possesses firsthand knowledge of the improper conduct ... Similarly, where an attorney is told by a juror about another juror\u2019s possible misconduct, the attorney's testimony is incompetent and may not be received for the purposes of impeaching the verdict or for laying a foundation of evidence aliunde. See Tasin v. SIFCO Industries, Inc. (1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 102, 553 N.E.2d 257; Dodd v. McCammon (1920), 14 Ohio App. 160, 32 Ohio C.C. (N.S.) 68\u201d. State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 75-76, 564 N.E.2d 54, 61(1990).\nAs this Court has already stated,\n\nAs a juror in the case, Mr. Cooper cannot now impeach his own verdict with his own statement alone. Evid.R. 606 has been consistently upheld as the law relative to the impeachment of jury verdicts. \u201cThe rule is designed to protect the finality of verdicts and to ensure that jurors are insulated from harassment by defeated parties.\u201d Schiebel, supra, at 75.\n\nSee also State v. Adams, 141 Ohio St. 423 (1943).\n\nState v. Shuster, 5th Dist. Morgan No. 15AP0017, 2016-Ohio-5030, \u00b616. In that case, Shuster had filed a motion for a new trial on June 5, 2013, arguing juror misconduct. In support of his motion, Shuster filed an affidavit from Richard Cooper, a juror from his trial, stating, in part,\n\n4. That we jurors had heard, prior to trial and since the time of the arrest of Michael Shane Shuster, that he had confessed to the charges filed against him and for those charges which were the subject of the trial.\n\n5. That the Prosecuting Attorney, during his closing argument, told the jury that Michael Shane Shuster had confessed to the charges.\n\n6. That we thought our deliberations were just a formality since we were told that Michael Shane Shuster had confessed.\n\nShuster, \u00b612.\n\n---\n\n3 Shuster filed in the trial court a sworn affidavit of Richard Cooper on November 17, 2014, claiming it to be a substitute for a previously filed handwritten statement. On June 22, September 4, and October 5, 2015, Shuster filed motions to amend and supplement his motion for new trial. By journal entry filed October 30, 2015, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion for new trial. Shuster, \u00b63.\nAccordingly, Shuster has not demonstrated he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the alleged newly discovered evidence. In addition, because we have already addressed this issue, the doctrine of res judicata bars any further consideration. See State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 671 N.E.2d 233, 1996-Ohio-337; State v. Perry (1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104.\n\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling Shuster\u2019s motion for a new trial without conducting an evidentiary hearing.\n\nShuster First and Second Assignments of Error are overruled.\n\nThe judgment of the Morgan County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n\nBy Gwin, P.J.,\n\nWise, J., and\n\nDelaney, J., concur"}

Defendant-Appellee is the state of Ohio. \nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n{\u00b6 2} On July 29, 2014, appellant pled guilty to one count of having weapons \nwhile under disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13, one count of domestic violence in \nviolation of R.C. 2919.25, and one count of intimidation of an attorney, victim, or witness \nin a criminal case in violation of R.C. 2921.04.  The plea was made pursuant to a plea \ndeal wherein the state agreed to drop a felonious assault charge with a repeat violent \noffender specification.  By judgment entry filed August 14, 2014, the trial court sentenced \nappellant to an aggregate term of twenty-four months in prison. \n{\u00b6 3} On August 27, 2014, appellant filed a pro se direct appeal to this court which \nwas dismissed for failure to prosecute.  A subsequent motion for leave to file delayed \nappeal was denied. \n{\u00b6 4} On September 15, 2014, appellant filed a petition to vacate or set aside \njudgment of conviction or sentence.  Appellant claimed he did not use a gun to threaten \nthe victim, and he was denied effective assistance of trial counsel.  Appellant attached an \naffidavit of the victim wherein she averred she could not recall the incident with appellant \nas she was intoxicated at the time, and he did not put a gun to her face.  By judgment \nentry filed February 24, 2015, the trial court denied the petition on the basis of res judicata.  \nThe decision was affirmed on appeal for reasons other than res judicata.  State v. Hill, 5th \nDist. Stark No. 2015 CA 00041, 2015-Ohio-3311. Stark County, Case No. 2017CA00235  3 \n{\u00b6 5} On July 18, 2016, appellant filed a second petition to vacate or set aside \njudgment of conviction or sentence.  Appellant again claimed ineffective assistance of \ncounsel, and claimed he had newly discovered evidence in the form of a crime lab report \nindicating the gun in question did not contain his fingerprints, and an audio recording of \nthe victim's statement to police wherein she allegedly gave conflicting versions of the \nincident.  Also, appellant attached another affidavit from the victim wherein she averred \nshe made up the entire story because she was angry with appellant.  By judgment entry \nfiled November 8, 2016, the trial court denied the petition as untimely and the petition \nfailed to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish grounds for relief.  Appellant's \nappeal to this court was dismissed at his request. \n{\u00b6 6} On January 9, 2017, appellant filed a third petition to vacate or set aside \njudgment of conviction or sentence based upon newly discovered evidence and actual \ninnocence, essentially reasserting the same arguments contained in the previous two \npetitions, and further arguing the previously submitted crime lab report proved his actual \ninnocence because his DNA/fingerprints were not found on the gun.  Appellant included \nthe \"newly discovered\" investigative report and the arrest report to his same arguments.  \nBy judgment entry filed March 13, 2017, the trial court denied the petition as untimely and \nthe petition failed to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish grounds for relief.  No \nappeal was taken. \n{\u00b6 7} On May 2, 2017, appellant filed a fourth petition to vacate or set aside \njudgment of conviction or sentence based upon new evidence and actual innocence, \nagain reasserting the same arguments contained in the previous three petitions.  By \njudgment entry filed June 22, 2017, the trial court denied the petition as untimely and the Stark County, Case No. 2017CA00235  4 \npetition failed to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish grounds for relief.  The \ndecision was affirmed on appeal.  State v. Hill, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2017CA00118, 2017-\nOhio-7671. \n{\u00b6 8} On November 20, 2017, appellant filed a fifth petition to vacate and set \naside judgment of conviction and sentence based upon new evidence and actual \ninnocence, specifically challenging his conviction for weapons under disability.  Appellant \nclaimed he had newly discover ed evidence in the form of the state's Ju ly 26, 2017 \nresponse to his motion for leave to file delayed appeal and motion to dismiss filed with \nthis court, wherein the state mentioned in committing the felonious assault on the victim, \nappellant used a hammer and not a gun.  Because he did not use a gun, appellant argued \nhe should not have been encouraged to plead guilty to the weapons under disability \noffense.  As a result, appellant argued he was denied the effective assistance of counsel \nand his plea was not voluntarily and intelligently made.  Also, appellant again argued the \nDNA evidence.  By judgment entry filed November 28, 2017, the trial court denied the \npetition, expressly incorporating its findings of fact and conclusions of law from its \nprevious entry filed June 22, 2017, which this court affirmed on appeal.  The trial court \nalso found it was not required to issue new findings of fact and conclusions of law on a \nsuccessive petition for postconviction relief. \n{\u00b6 9} Appellant filed an appeal and this matter is now before this court for \nconsideration.  Assignments of error are as follows: \nI \n{\u00b6 10} \"TRIAL/PLEA COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE FOR INADEQUATELY \nADVISING APPELLANT TO PLEAD GUILTY, RENDERING HIS GUILTY PLEAS VOID, Stark County, Case No. 2017CA00235  5 \nAND PCRA COURT ERRED/ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY DENYING APPELLANT'S \nPETITION W/OUT HEARING AND W/OUT ISSUING FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING \nNEW EVIDENCE RECENTLY OBTAINED WHICH PROVES HIS ACTUAL \nINNOCENCE.\" \nII \n{\u00b6 11} \"A PLEA NOT VOLUNTARILY AND INTELLIGENTLY MADE HAS BEEN \nOBTAINED IN VIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS AND IS VOID, AND PCRA COURT \nERRED/ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY DENYING APPELLANT'S PETITION W/OUT \nHEARING AND W/OUT ISSUING FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING NEW EVIDENCE \nRECENTLY OBTAINED WHICH PROVES HIS ACTUAL INNOCENCE.\" \nIII \n{\u00b6 12} \"APPELLANT WAS CONVICTED OF A FELONY AND DNA TESTING \nESTABLISHED BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE, ACTUAL INNOCENCE, \nAND HE WAS DENIED EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL RENDERING HIS \nGUILTY PLEAS VOID, AND PCRA COURT ERRED/ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY \nDENYING HIS PETITION W/OUT HEARING AND W/OUT ISSUING FINDINGS OF \nFACT REGARDING NEW EVIDENCE RECENTLY OBTAINED AND DNA EVIDENCE \nWHICH PROVES HIS ACTUAL INNOCENCE.\" \nIV \n{\u00b6 13} \"APPELLANT WAS CONVICTED OF A FELONY AND DNA TESTING \nESTABLISHED BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE, ACTUAL INNOCENCE, \nAND HE WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS OF LAW BY WAY OF PROSECUTORIAL \nMISCONDUCT RENDERING HIS GUILTY PLEAS VOID, AND PCRA COURT Stark County, Case No. 2017CA00235  6 \nERRED/ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY DENYING HIS PETITION W/OUT HEARING \nAND W/OUT ISSUING FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING NEW EVIDENCE \nRECENTLY OBTAINED AND DNA EVIDENCE WHICH PROVES HIS ACTUAL \nINNOCENCE.\" \nI, II, III, IV \n{\u00b6 14} In all of his assignments of error, appellant claims the trial court erred in \ndenying his petition for postconviction relief without holding a hearing and without issuing \nfindings of fact on the new evidence, i.e., the state's July 26, 2017 response.  Appellant \nclaims ineffective assistance of counsel, his plea was not voluntarily and intelligently \nmade, and prosecutorial misconduct, all pertaining to his weapons  under disability \nconviction which he pled guilty to.  Appellant also rehashes his arguments of actual \ninnocence because of the DNA evidence.  We disagree with appellant's claims. \n{\u00b6 15} In its November 28, 2017 judgment entry denying appellant's fifth petition \nfor postconviction relief, the trial court expressly incorporated its findings of fact and \nconclusions of law from its previous judgment entry filed June 22, 2017, which this court \naffirmed on appeal.  The trial court also found it was not required to issue new findings of \nfact and conclusions of law on a successive petition for postconviction relief. \n{\u00b6 16} In the June judgment entry denying appellant's fourth petition for \npostconviction relief, the trial court found the petition was untimely and the petition failed \nto set forth sufficient operative facts to establish grounds for relief. \n{\u00b6 17} As determined by the trial court, appellant's fifth petition for postconviction \nrelief was clearly untimely pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(A)(2).  Based upon appellant's past Stark County, Case No. 2017CA00235  7 \nfilings, the subject petition was a successive petition for postconviction relief.  R.C. \n2953.23 states the following: \n \n(A) Whether a hearing is or is not held on a petition filed pursuant to \nsection 2953.21 of the Revised Code, a court may not entertain a petition \nfiled after the expiration of the period prescribed in division (A) of that \nsection or a second petition or successive petitions for similar relief on \nbehalf of a petitioner unless division (A)(1) or (2) of this section applies: \n(1) Both of the following apply: \n(a) Either the petitioner shows that the petitioner was unavoidably \nprevented from discovery of the facts upon which the petitioner must rely to \npresent the claim for relief, or, subsequent to the period prescribed in \ndivision (A)(2) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code or to the filing of an \nearlier petition, the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal \nor state right that applies retroactively to persons in the petitioner's situation, \nand the petition asserts a claim based on that right. \n(b) The petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that, but \nfor constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfin der would have found \nthe petitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted or, \nif the claim challenges a sentence of death that, but for constitutional error \nat the sentencing hearing, no reasonable factfinder would have found the \npetitioner eligible for the death sentence. Stark County, Case No. 2017CA00235  8 \n(2) The petitioner was convicted of a felony, the petitioner is an \noffender for whom DNA testing was performed under sections 2953.71 to \n2953.81 of the Revised Code or under former section 2953.82 of the \nRevised Code and analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all \navailable admissible evidence related to the inmate's case as described in \ndivision (D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, and the results of the \nDNA testing establish, by clear and convincing evidence, actual innocence \nof that felony offense or, if the person was sentenced to death, establish, by \nclear and convincing evidence, actual innocence of the aggravating \ncircumstance or circumstances the person was found guilty of committing \nand that is or are the basis of that sentence of death. \n \n{\u00b6 18} In reviewing appellant's fifth petition for postconviction relief, we find \nappellant did not satisfy the requirements of R.C. 2953.23.  Appellant pled guilty to the \ncharges, including the weapons u nder disability count.  T he state's Ju ly 26, 2017 \nresponse to a motion does not constitute \"evidence.\"  Even if accepted as evidence, the \nstate's arguments about the hammer were in relation to the felonious assault count which \nwas dropped.  Attachments to appellant's petition establish the gun for the weapons under \ndisability charge was found in the couch console in the home appellant shared with the \nvictim. \n{\u00b6 19} Any other arguments raised by appellant are barred under the doctrine of \nres judicata.  As stated by the Supreme Court of Ohio in State v. Perry,  10 Ohio St.2d \n175 (1967), paragraphs eight and nine of the syllabus, the doctrine of res judicata is Stark County, Case No. 2017CA00235  9 \napplicable to petitions for postconviction relief.  The Perry court explained the doctrine at \n180-181 as follows: \n \nUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars \na convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and \nlitigating in any proceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any \ndefense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have \nbeen raised by the defendant at trial, which resulted in that judgment of \nconviction, or on an appeal from that judgment. \n \n{\u00b6 20} Upon review, we find the trial court did not err in denying appellant's fifth \npetition for postconviction relief. \n{\u00b6 21} Assignments of Error I, II, III, and IV are denied. \n  Stark County, Case No. 2017CA00235  10 \n{\u00b6 22} The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County, Ohio is \nhereby affirmed. \nBy Wise, Earle, J. \n \nGwin, P.J. and \n \nDelaney, J. concur. \n \n \nEEW/db 3/16\n ", "case_juv": "0", "case_crim": "0", "case_2001": "0", "case_app": "0", "case_pros": "0", "aoe_none": "0", "aoe_grandjury": "0", "aoe_court": "0", "aoe_defense": "0", "aoe_procbar": "1", "aoe_prochist": "0", "case_timeframe": "0", "other": "517    0\nName: other, dtype: int64", "olmocr_text": "STATE OF OHIO : JUDGES:\n\nPlaintiff-Appellee : Hon.

Defendant-Appellee is the state of Ohio.\n\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nOn July 29, 2014, appellant pled guilty to one count of having weapons while under disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13, one count of domestic violence in violation of R.C. 2919.25, and one count of intimidation of an attorney, victim, or witness in a criminal case in violation of R.C. 2921.04.

Because he did not use a gun, appellant argued he should not have been encouraged to plead guilty to the weapons under disability offense. As a result, appellant argued he was denied the effective assistance of counsel and his plea was not voluntarily and intelligently made. Also, appellant again argued the DNA evidence. By judgment entry filed November 28, 2017, the trial court denied the petition, expressly incorporating its findings of fact and conclusions of law from its previous entry filed June 22, 2017, which this court affirmed on appeal. The trial court also found it was not required to issue new findings of fact and conclusions of law on a successive petition for postconviction relief.\n\n\u00b69 Appellant filed an appeal and this matter is now before this court for consideration. Assignments of error are as follows:\n\n\u00b610 \"TRIAL/PLEA COUNSEL WAS INEFFECTIVE FOR INADEQUATELY ADVISING APPELLANT TO PLEAD GUILTY, RENDERING HIS GUILTY PLEAS VOID,\nAND PCRA COURT ERRED/ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY DENYING APPELLANT'S PETITION W/OUT HEARING AND W/OUT ISSUING FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING NEW EVIDENCE RECENTLY OBTAINED WHICH PROVES HIS ACTUAL INNOCENCE.\"\n\nII\n\n\u00b6 11 \"A PLEA NOT VOLUNTARILY AND INTELLIGENTLY MADE HAS BEEN OBTAINED IN VIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS AND IS VOID, AND PCRA COURT ERRED/ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY DENYING APPELLANT'S PETITION W/OUT HEARING AND W/OUT ISSUING FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING NEW EVIDENCE RECENTLY OBTAINED WHICH PROVES HIS ACTUAL INNOCENCE.\"\n\nIII\n\n\u00b6 12 \"APPELLANT WAS CONVICTED OF A FELONY AND DNA TESTING ESTABLISHED BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE, ACTUAL INNOCENCE, AND HE WAS DENIED EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL RENDERING HIS GUILTY PLEAS VOID, AND PCRA COURT ERRED/ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY DENYING HIS PETITION W/OUT HEARING AND W/OUT ISSUING FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING NEW EVIDENCE RECENTLY OBTAINED AND DNA EVIDENCE WHICH PROVES HIS ACTUAL INNOCENCE.\"\n\nIV\n\n\u00b6 13 \"APPELLANT WAS CONVICTED OF A FELONY AND DNA TESTING ESTABLISHED BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE, ACTUAL INNOCENCE, AND HE WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS OF LAW BY WAY OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT RENDERING HIS GUILTY PLEAS VOID, AND PCRA COURT\nERRED/ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY DENYING HIS PETITION W/OUT HEARING AND W/OUT ISSUING FINDINGS OF FACT REGARDING NEW EVIDENCE RECENTLY OBTAINED AND DNA EVIDENCE WHICH PROVES HIS ACTUAL INNOCENCE.\"\n\nI, II, III, IV\n\n\u00b6 14 In all of his assignments of error, appellant claims the trial court erred in denying his petition for postconviction relief without holding a hearing and without issuing findings of fact on the new evidence, i.e., the state's July 26, 2017 response. Appellant claims ineffective assistance of counsel, his plea was not voluntarily and intelligently made, and prosecutorial misconduct, all pertaining to his weapons under disability conviction which he pled guilty to. Appellant also rehashes his arguments of actual innocence because of the DNA evidence. We disagree with appellant's claims.\n\n\u00b6 15 In its November 28, 2017 judgment entry denying appellant's fifth petition for postconviction relief, the trial court expressly incorporated its findings of fact and conclusions of law from its previous judgment entry filed June 22, 2017, which this court affirmed on appeal. The trial court also found it was not required to issue new findings of fact and conclusions of law on a successive petition for postconviction relief.\n\n\u00b6 16 In the June judgment entry denying appellant's fourth petition for postconviction relief, the trial court found the petition was untimely and the petition failed to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish grounds for relief.\n\n\u00b6 17 As determined by the trial court, appellant's fifth petition for postconviction relief was clearly untimely pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(A)(2). Based upon appellant's past\nfilings, the subject petition was a successive petition for postconviction relief. R.C. 2953.23 states the following:\n\n(A) Whether a hearing is or is not held on a petition filed pursuant to section 2953.21 of the Revised Code, a court may not entertain a petition filed after the expiration of the period prescribed in division (A) of that section or a second petition or successive petitions for similar relief on behalf of a petitioner unless division (A)(1) or (2) of this section applies:\n\n(1) Both of the following apply:\n\n(a) Either the petitioner shows that the petitioner was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which the petitioner must rely to present the claim for relief, or, subsequent to the period prescribed in division (A)(2) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code or to the filing of an earlier petition, the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons in the petitioner's situation, and the petition asserts a claim based on that right.\n\n(b) The petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted or, if the claim challenges a sentence of death that, but for constitutional error at the sentencing hearing, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner eligible for the death sentence.\n(2) The petitioner was convicted of a felony, the petitioner is an offender for whom DNA testing was performed under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code or under former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code and analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence related to the inmate's case as described in division (D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, and the results of the DNA testing establish, by clear and convincing evidence, actual innocence of that felony offense or, if the person was sentenced to death, establish, by clear and convincing evidence, actual innocence of the aggravating circumstance or circumstances the person was found guilty of committing and that is or are the basis of that sentence of death.\n\n\u00b6 18 In reviewing appellant's fifth petition for postconviction relief, we find appellant did not satisfy the requirements of R.C. 2953.23. Appellant pled guilty to the charges, including the weapons under disability count. The state's July 26, 2017 response to a motion does not constitute \"evidence.\" Even if accepted as evidence, the state's arguments about the hammer were in relation to the felonious assault count which was dropped. Attachments to appellant's petition establish the gun for the weapons under disability charge was found in the couch console in the home appellant shared with the victim.\n\n\u00b6 19 Any other arguments raised by appellant are barred under the doctrine of res judicata. As stated by the Supreme Court of Ohio in State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175 (1967), paragraphs eight and nine of the syllabus, the doctrine of res judicata is\napplicable to petitions for postconviction relief. The *Perry* court explained the doctrine at 180-181 as follows:\n\nUnder the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.\n\n\u00b6 20 Upon review, we find the trial court did not err in denying appellant's fifth petition for postconviction relief.\n\n\u00b6 21 Assignments of Error I, II, III, and IV are denied.\n\u00b6 22 The judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County, Ohio is hereby affirmed.\n\nBy Wise, Earle, J.\n\nGwin, P.J. and\n\nDelaney, J. concur.\n\nEEW/db 3/16"}
