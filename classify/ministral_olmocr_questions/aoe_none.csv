{¶ 28} The decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial pursuant to Crim.R. 33 is within the discretion of the trial court. State v. Brakeall, 12th Dist. Fayette Nos. CA2008-06-022 and CA2008-06-023, 2009-Ohio-3542, ¶ 9. An appellate court reviews the trial court's decision for an abuse of discretion. State v. Carroll, 12th Dist. Clermont Nos. CA2007-02-030 and CA2007-03-041, 2007-Ohio-7075, ¶ 64. A motion for new trial must be made within fourteen days of the jury's verdict. Crim.R. 33(B). Appellant's counsel filed a motion for new trial on June 25, 2018 which suggested prosecutorial misconduct, not juror misconduct. Appellant's motion was denied July 26, 2018. There was no formal motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct made within fourteen days of the jury's verdict and in any event, there were no supporting affidavits provided as required by Crim.R. 33(C). However, because the state does not assert these reasons for supporting the trial court's denial of a new trial, we will address the merits of appellant's argument.

direct appeal, Jordan argued that the prosecutors committed misconduct when they “failed to turn over to the defense information regarding Ladson’s gang and criminal activity.” *Jordan*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, ¶ 46. In his petition for postconviction relief, he argues that the state should have disclosed the photos of Ladson evidencing his tattoos and the gang report showing that Ladson was a member of the Heartless Felons. According to Jordan, the same prosecutor who tried his case also tried Ladson’s murder case and admitted these exhibits in Ladson’s criminal cases.

In his motion, appellant asserted that his conviction was void because he was lured into pleading guilty despite his innocence based upon the state’s pledge to seek the death penalty “with a 100% chance of acquiring it” based on “bogus” DNA evidence. In support of his argument, appellant stated that he had recently received documents the FBI sent to the Innocence Project on August 1, 2013, allegedly revealing that the federal government utilized misleading evidence to secure his convictions in federal court. Appellant insisted that, had he been aware of the use of such evidence, he would not have entered a guilty plea. Appellant
further indicated that the state threatened to use the same “bogus” evidence as the federal authorities used to secure the convictions.

The jury also found appellant not guilty of: (1) Count 6 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), (2) Count 7 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), (3) Count 8 attempted rape R.C. 2923.02(A)/2907.02(A)(2), (4) Count 10 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), and (5) Count 11 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(B)(2). The trial court sentenced appellant to serve life in prison without parole on count one (aggravated murder), and thirty-six months on count 9 (tampering with evidence). The court further ordered that the sentences be served consecutively to one another. At that point, appellant filed a pro se Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial and argued that (1) irregularities existed in the court proceedings, including jury and prosecutorial misconduct, and (2) new evidence supported his self-defense claim. Appellant also filed a Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. On direct appeal, this court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the cause to the trial court to include findings, if appropriate, to support consecutive sentences.\(^1\) While his appeal was pending, appellant also filed various pro se motions, including his March 18, 2017 pro se petition for postconviction relief and his June 30, 2017 pro se petition to vacate or set aside the judgment of conviction and motion for expert assistance (a forensic scientist). The trial court denied the postconviction relief petition and indicated that appellant did not attach materials to support his petition and that no substantive grounds for relief exists. In addition, on November 1, 2017, the trial court issued an entry that chronicled and denied all 21 of appellant’s motions. The court determined that it either lacked jurisdiction to consider certain motions, certain motions did not set forth a request that the court could grant, or certain motions are nonsensical. Thus, the trial court denied the postconviction relief request and concluded that appellant is not entitled to relief as

{¶3} In 2015, Long again filed with the common pleas court a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 et seq., seeking relief from his conviction on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In his 2015 postconviction petition, Long asserted that evidence outside the trial record, in the form of a stranger’s unsolicited letter to him and a written report submitted to his trial counsel by an investigator assigned to his case, revealed the existence of statements made by eyewitnesses to law enforcement that exonerated him in the murder. He sought relief from his conviction on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct, in failing to disclose that exculpatory evidence in discovery, and ineffective assistance of counsel, in failing to discover the evidence and present it in his defense.
Then, in 2016, in an effort to gain access to information contained in public records to support his pending postconviction claims, he filed with the common pleas court his “Request for Leave to Request Public Records.” The court denied the request upon its determination that Long “failed to demonstrate under R.C. 149.43(B)(8) that he is entitled to the records.”

¶ 8 At the plea hearing, appellant was informed by the trial court of the consequences of his plea in compliance with Crim.R. 11. The trial court reviewed the plea agreement with appellant, which in this case involved the standard plea form as well as two additional typed pages. The additional typed pages were signed and acknowledged on each page by appellant. These pages state that appellant will change his plea as to the second count and in return he would receive a specified sentence and appellee would nolle the other counts and specifications.
There is also a paragraph which states “Nothing in this agreement shall act as a bar to the defendant perfecting any legal remedies he may otherwise have on appeal or collateral attack respecting claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial misconduct.” At the plea hearing, there appeared to be some confusion as to the purpose of the paragraph regarding appellant’s appellate rights. Upon discussion, it was explained to appellant that he was giving up certain appellate rights by entering an Alford plea and that the plea agreement did not limit the remaining appellate rights in any way. Appellant had an opportunity to speak with attorney to understand these aspects and indicated that he understood those rights.

Newman now argues that his appellate counsel should have raised the following issues: (1) The trial court erred in proceeding to trial without holding a hearing or obtaining an evaluation as to Newman’s competency to represent himself. (2) There was insufficient evidence to convict Newman of attempted murder; the evidence could only allow simple assault and vehicular assault. (3) The kidnapping convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. (4) His convictions generally were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. (5) His convictions were the result of police and prosecutorial misconduct. (6) The trial judge had predetermined Newman’s guilt. (7) The photo lineup was unduly suggestive.

¶ 52 Appellant moved for a new trial under Crim.R. 33(A)(2): ""A new trial may be granted on motion of the defendant for any of the following causes affecting materially his substantial rights: * * * (2) Misconduct of the jury, prosecuting attorney, or the witnesses for the state."" A new trial shall not be granted on this or any other of the allowed grounds of Crim.R. 33 ""unless it affirmatively appears from the record that the defendant was prejudiced thereby or was prevented from having a fair trial."" Crim.R. 33(E)(5). In addressing claims of juror misconduct, the court therefore must employ a two-step analysis. First, the court will determine whether juror misconduct occurred, and second, if juror misconduct is found, the court will determine whether the misconduct materially affected the defendant's substantial rights. State v. Taylor, 73 Ohio App.3d 827, 833 (4th Dist.1991); State v. Samatar, 152 Ohio App.3d 311, 2003-Ohio-1639, ¶ 35 (10th Dist.) The party complaining of alleged juror misconduct must establish prejudice. State v. Adams, 103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, ¶ 42. Crim.R. 33(A)(2) motions must be supported by affidavit as required by Crim.R. 33(C). State v. Gibson, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-1047, 2011-Ohio-5614, ¶ 39.

Initially, we note that, although Crim.R. 33(A)(2) motions should be supported with an affidavit, the trial court expressly noted the absence of such an affidavit in the present case but, nonetheless, proceeded with the hearing, apparently accepting that Sergeant Duffer's sworn testimony provided the requisite evidentiary basis to examine the issues raised.

1 The petition also claimed counsel did not adequately cross-examine Cool about his criminal record or his deal with the prosecution. It also set forth a brief, potential argument on prosecutorial misconduct if the state failed to produce unnamed evidence bearing on Cool’s credibility. The state responded by pointing out this witness was asked about his guilty plea arising out of this incident and about his criminal record. (Tr. 117, 123-127, 131). A June 29, 2016 judgment entry shows the parties agreed the state divulged any consideration and promises to prosecute witnesses in exchange to aid or testimony. In any event, these arguments are not maintained on appeal.

He stated that he graduated from Capital Law School in 1998 as an older, non-traditional student with a growing family. He clerked with an experienced criminal defense attorney in Marion, Ohio, during law school, and shared space in that office for one year after passing the bar. He then secured his own space and began his own practice in Marion and, eventually, in Columbus, Mansfield, and Cleveland. His practice, general at first, eventually focused on criminal defense with a smaller proportion of domestic and civil litigation. He testified that he believed the accusations against him were the result of a coordinated campaign by the Franklin County Prosecutor's Office, the Attorney General, and the Columbus police to remove him from the practice of law because of his effective advocacy in criminal cases.

App.R. 26(B) and State v. Murnahan, 62 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204 (1992),
applied to reopen this court’s judgment in State v. Newman, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.
109182, 2020-Ohio-5087, in which this court affirmed Newman’s convictions for attempted murder, kidnapping, aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, grand theft, aggravated menacing, having weapons while under disability, and criminal damaging. Newman now argues that his appellate counsel should have raised the following issues. (1) The trial court erred in proceeding to trial without holding a hearing or obtaining an evaluation as to Newman’s competency to represent himself. (2) There was insufficient evidence to convict Newman of attempted murder; the evidence could only allow simple assault and vehicular assault. (3) The kidnapping convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. (4) His convictions generally were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. (5) His convictions were the result of police and prosecutorial misconduct. (6) The trial judge had predetermined Newman’s guilt. (7) The photo lineup was unduly suggestive. For the following reasons, this court denies the application to reopen.

Rasheka Smith averred in her affidavit that she had been “coerced by the Detectives and the State to testify,” that her testimony was “the product of coercion by the prosecution,” that the state and police “threatened [her] both directly and indirectly,” and that the police “continued to come to [her] job and harass [her] concerning appearing at court and testifying for their cause.” She also asserted that she had not seen “the disturbance” between defendant and Gorley, because of “the
darkness,” and because the porch light had not been on and she had been “drinking.” She further asserted that she had been “[un]aware of what was transpiring [but] just knew there was a disturbance” because she could hear it.

Apparently, the parties and the court planned to address the issue when Muntz testified. However, after the court empaneled the jury and during opening statement, the prosecutor mentioned Muntz’s anticipated testimony and explicitly stated “Mr. Muntz tells the Trooper that the woman tells him not to call the police because she cannot afford another DUI.” Appellee thereupon requested a mistrial.

{¶ 3} Additionally, Desmond moved to disqualify attorney Matthew Meyer, an assistant Cuyahoga County prosecuting attorney who was appointed by Gains to represent the state in this matter. Desmond maintained that because he alleged misconduct by the attorneys in Gains’s office, Gains had a conflict of interest that was not cured by appointing Meyer as an assistant. The trial court concluded that because Meyer was subject to discharge by Gains, there existed an arguable appearance of impropriety, and it voided Gains’s appointment. However, because it found that Meyer’s involvement posed no actual prejudice to Desmond, it appointed Meyer itself to act as an independent special prosecutor on behalf of the state. Because we find no error in the trial court’s appointment of Meyer, we affirm the trial court judgment.

¶ 6 The criminal trial judge then noted that the state never disclosed to Lemons that several days after Adamcik identified him in an April 1995 physical lineup, Adamcik stated to one of the detectives that she was positive she identified the correct person because after she chose him in the lineup, she noticed his shoes, and they were the same shoes that he had been wearing on the night of the murder. The state also did not tell Lemons that the detectives seized Lemons’s shoes after Adamcik’s claim, and subsequently discovered from a Nike representative that the shoes Lemons had been wearing in the lineup could not have been the same shoes that he was wearing at the time of the murder because the shoes had not been manufactured until at least January 1995. The criminal trial judge further noted that although Adamcik testified at trial that the shooter was wearing certain tennis shoes, no testimony was elicited from her about her claim of recognizing those shoes at the lineup over a year later.
Adamcik passed away of natural causes in November 1996. Because she was the state’s only evidence at Lemons’s trial that linked him to the crimes, the state filed a notice of dismissal without prejudice on January 24, 2014. On that same date, the state moved for leave to dismiss the indictment without prejudice. The state informed the court that it wished to continue its investigation into Sims’s murder to look for discoverable evidence that could lead to reprosecution. Lemons also moved to dismiss his criminal case with prejudice.

Less than five minutes into the interview, after Jones told Tellis that his DNA had been found “on the sticky part” of some of the duct tape used to tie up L.H. and that he knew that Tellis was at the scene, but wanted to know what Tate’s 11.

In Thomas, the defendant was found guilty of stabbing to death a woman outside of the bar where she had been employed and disposing of her body in the woods behind the bar. The Ohio Supreme Court held that the admission of the set of knives that had been found in the defendant’s home contravened Evid.R. 404(B) and amounted to plain error where the state knew that the knives had not been used in connection with the murder and where the prosecutor had relied on the knives to “describe Thomas as an owner of ‘full Rambo combat knives’ with the intent to have the jury infer that Thomas is a dangerous person of violent character.” Id. at ¶ 45.

Appellant also filed his motion after the trial court had sentenced appellant and rendered its final judgment. Appellant alleged four claims in his motion for new trial: (1) trial counsel's lack of attentiveness, (2) the state's use of 9-1-1 call and trial court not permitting recross-examination, (3) prosecutorial misconduct, and (4) being shackled during trial. In support of his first claim, appellant asserted new trial was warranted on grounds of an irregularity in the proceeding; however, appellant did not assert any specific grounds for new trial in support of his remaining claims. He did not allege unavoidable prevention or newly discovered evidence. The record does not reflect that the trial court ruled on the motion.

¶ 7 In October 2014, Reed filed another motion for leave to file a new-trial motion. He alleged misconduct by the prosecutor and two prosecution witnesses, Shoemaker and Holloway. Reed claimed the two witnesses falsely had testified that they did not receive leniency or concessions in exchange for their testimony. Reed further claimed he had been prejudiced by this “false and perjured” testimony and that he had been unavoidably prevented from filing a timely motion due to ineffective assistance of counsel and the prohibition on hybrid representation. In November 2014, the trial court overruled the motion for leave. It rejected Reed’s “unavoidably prevented” argument, reasoning that his counsel did not seek a new trial because there was “no good ground for it.” The trial court found no evidence that Holloway and Shoemaker had given false testimony. The trial court also applied res judicata. It reasoned that Reed could have raised on direct appeal or in a post-conviction relief petition any issue he had concerning the trial court’s ruling with respect to the prosecutor’s agreements with Holloway and Shoemaker. The trial court thus held that res judicata barred Reed’s successive motion for a new trial. The trial court also found no ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to file a timely new-trial motion. This court affirmed that ruling on direct appeal. State v. Reed, 2d Dist.

California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel stated that she could “find no error by the trial court prejudicial to the rights of [Hazel] which may be argued to this court on this particular appeal.” Counsel further noted that a number of errors suggested to her by Hazel have no potential merit based upon the doctrine of res judicata. Counsel, specifically, stated that the pending appeal is not a direct appeal, and, thus, “[m]any potential Assignments of Error proposed by [Hazel] are not available on this appeal including but not limited to: adverse pretrial rulings; adverse rulings during trial on objections or motions; jury selection and instructions; plea issues; sufficiency of the evidence; etc.” Counsel, consistent with her duty under Anders and based upon her receipt of a brief Hazel prepared and sent to her, set forth the following potential errors: the trial court abused its discretion and committed prejudicial error by its failure to “conduct an evidentiary hearing and a Basurto test based upon newly discovered evidence”; Hazel's due process and equal rights were violated based upon “prosecutorial misconduct of a witness of the State and misconduct of the jury”; Hazel was denied
effective assistance of counsel based upon trial counsel's “mishandling of evidence” in the 2003 case; the evidence used to enhance Hazel's domestic violence convictions in the 2010 cases was “insufficient because the... enhancement tool was based upon a prior conviction that was not committed against a family or household member”; and Hazel's domestic violence convictions in the 2010 cases should have remained fourth degree felonies.

281-DeVaughns,Yes.,0,"Context information is below.
---------------------
In April 2015, DeVaughns filed a petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 and R.C. 2953.23, along with several other motions to supplement his petition. The petition and motions included claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. Specifically, DeVaughns argued that his trial counsel failed to properly object to the admissibility of certain blood evidence and that the prosecutor offered into evidence and discussed during closing argument inadmissible blood evidence. The trial court denied DeVaughns' petition on grounds that it was untimely and that his allegations “do not address complaints outside the record that could not be attacked on direct appeal.” On June 30, 2015, DeVaughns appealed that ruling, but then voluntarily dismissed the appeal.

¶ 150 Grate argues that defense counsel were ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor’s mitigation-phase argument that there were four aggravating circumstances. Although the prosecutor made a misstatement, the trial court informed the prosecutor of his misstatement. The prosecutor then correctly told the jury that there are “two counts and two specifications of each count.” Under these circumstances, Grate suffered no prejudice from defense counsel’s failure to make a timely objection.
