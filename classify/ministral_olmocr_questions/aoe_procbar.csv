{¶ 16} ""It is well established that a trial court may dismiss a postconviction relief petition on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata."" State v. Davis, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-12-258, 2013-Ohio-3878, ¶ 30. Under res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment or conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment. State v. Wagers, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2011-08-007, 2012-Ohio-2258, ¶ 10, citing State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 1996-Ohio-337, syllabus.

Property at 215 Mitchell Avenue was owned by Ruby Red Services, LLC, a business incorporated by Melissa Meade. Meade later died in a car accident, and the house was vacant. Visio Mortgage Services held a mortgage on the property and began foreclosure proceedings. Claiming the property was abandoned, Jelani occupied the property. Subsequently, he and Kimberly filed multiple documents asserting an interest in the property, including a quit-claim deed. Several of the documents were filed after a court had refused to let them intervene in the foreclosure proceedings.

¶ 4 Thereafter, appellant filed numerous motions for new trial and other collateral challenges to his convictions; all were denied. Relevant to the instant appeal, on December 1, 2015, appellant filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the underlying criminal judgment was void because Franklin County was not the proper venue to try the case; thus, the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. Appellant’s improper venue argument was based on Williams’ death certificate being issued in Fairfield County. The trial court dismissed the action pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). This court affirmed, finding that a declaratory judgment action was an improper procedural vehicle to collaterally attack a prior criminal conviction. Norman v. Franklin Cty.

Nevertheless, the Second District Court of Appeals has already determined that the trial court did not err by sentencing the Defendant to more than a minimum concurrent prison term in the direct appeal of this case. See State v. Smith, Montgomery Nos. 21463 and 22334, [2008-
Ohio-6330]. The Court found that the Defendant was sentenced pursuant to Blakely v. Washington, [542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004)]. And since the Defendant failed to make an objection to his sentence on the basis of Blakely, the Defendant has forfeited all but plain error for the purposes of appeal. Id. Furthermore, the Court of Appeals has already determined that there is no plain error when the Defendant was originally sentenced. This Court should follow the determinations already made by the Court of Appeals and reject the Defendant’s contention that consecutive sentences are contrary to law.

In his third assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred when it “did not appoint effective trial counsel or counsel for his postconviction to properly defend” appellant “in
proceedings of the court to support his self-defense within the home and property in trial court.” As we held above, however, appellant is not, at this juncture, entitled to the appointment of counsel for his postconviction proceedings. With regard to his claim that he did not receive effective assistance of trial counsel, the doctrine of res judicata bars this issue from consideration. Res judicata applies to proceedings involving postconviction relief. Black at ¶ 10, citing State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 95, 671 N.E.2d 233 (1996). “Under the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.” State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967). “Therefore, ‘any issue that could have been raised on direct appeal and was not is res judicata and not subject to review in subsequent proceedings.’” Black at ¶ 10, citing State v. Segines, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99789, 2013-Ohio-5259, ¶ 8, quoting State v. Saxon, 109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, 846 N.E.2d 824, ¶ 16.

---------------------
We emphasize that both this court and the United States Supreme Court have cautioned against applying a structural-error analysis
where, as here, the case would be otherwise governed by Crim.R. 52(B) because the defendant did not raise the error in the trial court. See *Hill*, 92 Ohio St.3d at 199, 749 N.E.2d 274; *Johnson*, 520 U.S. at 466, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718. This caution is born of sound policy. For to hold that an error is structural even when the defendant does not bring the error to the attention of the trial court would be to encourage defendants to remain silent at trial only later to raise the error on appeal where the conviction would be automatically reversed. We believe that our holdings should foster rather than thwart judicial economy by providing incentives (and not disincentives) for the defendant to raise all errors in the trial court—where, in many cases, such errors can be easily corrected.

Additionally, the general rule is that an appellate court will not consider any error which counsel for a party complaining of the trial court's judgment could have called but did not call to the trial court's attention at a time when such error could have been avoided or corrected by the trial court. See State v. Baxla, 4th Dist. Highland No. 656, 1988 WL 65644, *3 (June 13, 1988); State v. Awan, 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 122 (1986); State v. Childs, 14 Ohio St.2d 56, (1968), paragraph three of the syllabus; State v. Williams, 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 117 (1977). In this case, because Appellant did not assert

In order to preserve the issue of sufficiency on appeal, this court has held that “[w]hen a defendant moves for acquittal at the close of the state’s evidence and that motion is denied, the defendant waives any error which might have occurred in overruling the motion by proceeding to introduce evidence in his or her defense. In order to preserve a sufficiency of the evidence challenge on appeal once a defendant elects to present evidence on his behalf, the defendant must renew his Crim.R. 29 motion at the close of all the evidence.” State v.

After careful consideration, we conclude that the trial court’s judgment entry was not the functional equivalent of granting a motion to suppress, which the State could have appealed as a matter of right, pursuant to R.C. 2945.67(A). While a motion in limine can, in certain circumstances, be considered functionally equivalent to a motion to suppress, Ms. Heil’s motion only sought reconsideration of the trial court’s continuance of the trial date and broadly urged the court to “consider the admissibility” of “test evidence.” The court denied her request to reconsider the continuance, but requested additional briefing. Although, after considering the parties’ response briefs, the court entered a separate judgment entry precluding the State from introducing expert testimony at trial, the court clearly did so as a sanction for the State’s violation of the rules of discovery, not in response to a motion in limine requesting the suppression of evidence. As such, the court’s judgment entry appears to be a “simple evidentiary ruling” fitting more appropriately within the “any other decision” category of R.C. 2945.67(A). See Thompson at ¶ 19. Thus, the State could only appeal the court’s judgment entry by leave of this Court.
“A motion for leave to appeal by the [S]tate in a criminal case shall be governed by the procedural requirements of App.R. 5 and the time requirements of App.R. 4(B).” Steffen, 126 Ohio St.3d 405, 2010-Ohio-2430, at ¶ 27, quoting State v. Wallace, 43 Ohio St.2d 1 (1975), syllabus. It must be filed concurrently with the notice of appeal. See App.R. 5(C). Accordingly, the State needed to file its motion for leave to appeal with this Court “within thirty days from the entry of the judgment and order sought to be appealed * * *.” App.R. 5(C). The record is clear that the State neither sought nor obtained leave to appeal from this Court in this matter. When the State fails to comply with the statutory requirement to seek leave to appeal, the attempted appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. See In re M.M., 135 Ohio St.3d 375, 2013-Ohio-1495, ¶ 32.

(2) There was insufficient evidence to convict Newman of attempted murder; the evidence could only allow simple assault and vehicular assault. (3) The kidnapping convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. (4) His convictions generally were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. (5) His convictions were the result of police and prosecutorial misconduct. (6) The trial judge had predetermined Newman’s guilt. (7) The photo lineup was unduly suggestive.

{¶59} As an initial matter, we note that Harris filed a pro se motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds. The record reflects that Harris was represented by counsel when he filed his pro se motion. Hybrid representation is not allowed; therefore, the trial court was unable to consider his motion. State v. Davis, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105129, 2017-Ohio-8479, ¶ 18 (a defendant has the right to counsel or the right to act pro se; however, a defendant does not have the right to both, simultaneously). Thus, Harris’s failure to properly file a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds prior to trial and pursuant to R.C. 2945.73(B) prevents him from raising the issue on appeal. State v.

A no contest plea to an indictment forecloses an appellant from challenging the factual merits of the underlying charge. State v. Bird, 81 Ohio St.3d 582, 584, 692 N.E.2d 1013 (1998). A no contest plea is “not an admission of defendant's guilt, but is an admission of the truth of the facts alleged in the indictment[.]” Crim.R. 11(B)(2). An accused that pleads no contest “waives all nonjurisdictional defects to a felony conviction and leaves open for review only the sufficiency of the indictment.” State v. Watson, 12th Dist. Clinton No. CA2007-04-020, 2008-Ohio-629, ¶ 11, quoting State v. Palm, 9th Dist. Summit No. 22298, 2005-Ohio-1637, ¶ 13. A trial court must find a defendant guilty of

ascertain whether Ware wanted a jury trial (an issue that has not been raised), the test is whether “prejudice arises from counsel's performance.” State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 137, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), paragraph two of the syllabus. “The defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.

057-Hill,Yes,0,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶13} With respect to the State’s Motion to Strike, the trial court found that, in his June 13, 2016 Motion for New Trial, Hill “included issues that were never raised in his prior motion for leave to file a new trial motion.” These issues included “the voluntariness of Hill’s statements given to the Warren Police Department after the murder of Raymond Fife in 1985” and Dr. Adelman’s testimony regarding “the stick or broomstick handle that was introduced by the State at Hill’s trial.” The court found these additional claims, “unilaterally added by Petitioner in his motion for new trial,” to be redundant, impertinent, and immaterial under Civil Rule 12(F). Moreover, the court found “any further discussion of these claims * * * barred by the ‘law of the case’ doctrine and ‘res judicata.’” The court ordered these claims stricken.
The trial court then considered whether Hill's newly discovered bite mark evidence, even if contradicting or impeaching prior trial testimony, “can serve as the basis for a new trial in this case,” which question turned on “whether the bite mark evidence creates a ‘strong probability’ that there would be a different outcome in a future trial.” Without conducting an evidentiary hearing on the issue, the court concluded that, “even if the bite mark evidence is excluded, considering the totality of the evidence against the Petitioner, particularly on the Kidnapping specification, Petitioner has failed to demonstrate a ‘strong probability’ that there would be a different outcome if a new trial were granted in this case.” In reaching its conclusion, the court noted that the “Ohio Supreme Court thoroughly reviewed the sufficiency of the evidence in this case when it affirmed the Petitioner's convictions,” and the “majority of the Court's findings on sufficiency had nothing to do with the bite mark evidence.”

Newman now argues that his appellate counsel should have raised the following issues. (1) The trial court erred in proceeding to trial without holding a hearing or obtaining an evaluation as to Newman’s competency to represent himself. (2) There was insufficient evidence to convict Newman of attempted murder; the evidence could only allow simple assault and vehicular assault. (3) The kidnapping convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. (4) His convictions generally were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. (5) His convictions were the result of police and prosecutorial misconduct. (6) The trial judge had predetermined Newman’s guilt. (7) The photo lineup was unduly suggestive. For the following reasons, this court denies the application to reopen.

---------------------
{¶16} In his reply brief, Mr. Pitts urges this Court to apply the harmless error standard that is applicable to a confrontation clause violation. That standard is “‘not simply an inquiry into the sufficiency of the remaining evidence. Instead, the question is whether there is a reasonable
possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.”” Ricks at ¶ 46, quoting State v. Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, ¶ 78. Mr. Pitts, however, did not claim that his confrontation rights were violated to the trial court. See JPMorgan Chase Bank, Natl. Assn. v. Burden, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27104, 2014-Ohio-2746, ¶ 12 (“Arguments that were not raised at the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.”). Moreover, even on appeal, Mr. Pitts has not developed any argument concerning whether the statements at issue were testimonial. See State v. Person, 9th Dist. Summit No. 27600, 2016-Ohio-681, ¶ 21 (explaining the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial hearsay and the distinction between questions concerning an ongoing emergency and questions concerning past criminal events).

308-Rich,Yes,0,"Context information is below.
---------------------
9 Although R.C. 2923.31(I)(2)(c) is not a model of clarity, it appears that the only limitation on receiving stolen property qualifying as “corrupt activity” is that the value of the property at issue in any violation or combination of violations must exceed $1,000. In neither his Crim.R. 29 motion nor his objections to the jury instructions, however, did Rich raise the $1,000 threshold as an issue or argue that it had not been met. While the trial court’s jury instructions did not specify that receiving stolen property qualifies as “corrupt activity” only if the value of the property exceeds $1,000, that omission is not the basis of Rich’s assignment of error either. In any event, because he failed to raise that particular objection below, we would be limited to plain-error review. We would not find plain error here because the stolen merchandise unquestionably was worth much more than $1,000. Therefore, but for the trial court’s omission the outcome would not have been otherwise. To the contrary, if Rich had objected, the trial court simply could have added language addressing the value of the property, and the result would have been the same.

¶ 6 The trial court found that res judicata barred appellant from raising the merger argument underlying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because that argument could have been raised in a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence. In
the alternative, the trial court determined that appellant did not allege facts in his motion which would support a finding of manifest injustice, prosecutorial misconduct, or ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Accordingly, the trial court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing.

The court treated the motions as seeking postconviction relief and concluded that such relief was barred by res judicata. (The trial court’s judgment on these matters is on appeal in a separate case, Montgomery App. No. 29001.)

Thompson argues an abuse of discretion by the lower court for failure to enforce the requirements of R.C. 2933.241, however, at most, the applicable standard would be plain error since Thompson did not object to the alleged failure to supply her with a copy of the inventory. “Plain error exists when it can be said that but for the error, the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise.” State v.

113-Jones,Yes,0,"Context information is below.
---------------------
We emphasize that both this court and the United States Supreme Court have cautioned against applying a structural-error analysis
where, as here, the case would be otherwise governed by Crim.R. 52(B) because the defendant did not raise the error in the trial court. See *Hill*, 92 Ohio St.3d at 199, 749 N.E.2d 274; *Johnson*, 520 U.S. at 466, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718. This caution is born of sound policy. For to hold that an error is structural even when the defendant does not bring the error to the attention of the trial court would be to encourage defendants to remain silent at trial only later to raise the error on appeal where the conviction would be automatically reversed. We believe that our holdings should foster rather than thwart judicial economy by providing incentives (and not disincentives) for the defendant to raise all errors in the trial court—where, in many cases, such errors can be easily corrected.

201-Pelfrey,Yes,0,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 72} In his fourth assignment of error, Pelfrey claims that the trial court violated his right to a speedy trial. We note that Pelfrey’s argument apparently relies on R.C. 2945.71, Ohio’s speedy trial statute. Pelfrey does not mention the IAD or discuss its requirements in this assignment of error. Accordingly, we will confine ourselves to Pelfrey’s statutory rights under R.C. 2945.71.
At the outset, Pelfrey's motions to dismiss on speedy trial grounds were based on an alleged violation of the IAD. Pelfrey did not seek dismissal of any of the charges based on R.C. 2945.71. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error. In order to constitute plain error, the error must be an obvious defect in the trial proceedings, and the error must have affected substantial rights. State v. Norris, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26147, 2015-Ohio-624, ¶ 22; Crim.R. 52(B). Plain error should be noticed “with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” State v.

{¶5} But the motion was not reviewable under the standards provided by R.C. 2953.21 et seq., governing the proceedings upon a petition for postconviction relief, because the motion alleged statutory, rather than constitutional, violations. See R.C.
2953.21(A)(1) (requiring a postconviction petitioner to demonstrate a constitutional violation in the proceedings resulting in his conviction); State v. Hodge, 128 Ohio St.3d 1, 2010-Ohio-6320, 941 N.E.2d 768, ¶ 26 (holding that sentencing findings are not constitutionally mandated). The motion was also not reviewable as a motion for a new trial under Crim.R. 33 or as a motion to withdraw his guilty plea under Crim.R. 32.1, because Littlepage was not convicted following a trial, but upon a plea of guilty, and his motion did not seek withdrawal of that plea. The motion was not reviewable under R.C. Chapter 2731 as a petition for a writ of mandamus, under R.C. Chapter 2721 as a declaratory judgment action, or under R.C. Chapter 2725 as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, because the motion did not satisfy those statutes’ procedural requirements. See R.C. 2731.04, 2721.12(A), and 2725.04.

---------------------
¶11 Because Diestler did not raise a conflict of interest objection at trial, he now must show “that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer’s performance.” Gillard at 552. Yet, his argument only consists of general criticisms of his counsel’s performance. He has not pointed to any specific instances that would suggest an actual conflict. See Jackson at ¶ 13, quoting Hall at 965-966. Nor has he offered any alternative defense strategy that, but for the alleged conflict, his counsel might have pursued on his behalf. Compare State v. Mohrman, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 02CA008053, 2002-Ohio-6610, ¶ 15-16. The evidence against Diestler was compelling, given that he arranged a meeting with M.S., had possession of the guns used to kill him, had his blood on his shoes, and had shell casings that were fired from one of the murder
weapons in his pocket. Even so, retained counsel argued zealously on Diestler’s behalf and, over the State’s objection, secured lesser-included offense instructions on voluntary manslaughter and aggravated assault. This Court will not overturn Diestler’s convictions due to the mere possibility that his counsel’s attorney-client relationship with M.S. might have affected his performance. See Cuyler at 350. Because Diestler has not shown that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his counsel’s performance, we reject his argument. See State v. Spaulding, 9th Dist.

The jury trial did not include that complaint; the parties agreed it was subject to a bench trial.

[¶23] None of appellant’s 14 assignments of error makes any argument why this court should reverse the trial court’s denial of the two motions appealed.

Crenshaw, 145 Ohio App.3d 86 (8th Dist.2001), appellant makes no argument as to why these authorities are relevant to the denial of his motions. It is not this court’s duty to make appellant’s arguments for him. “An appellant ‘bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating error on appeal.’” Tally v. Patrick, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2008-T-0072, 2009-Ohio-1831, ¶22, citing S. Russell v. Upchurch, 11th Dist. Geauga Nos. 2001-G-2395 and 2001-G-2396, 2003-Ohio-2099, at ¶10 and App.R. 16(A)(7). “[I]f an argument exists that can support appellant’s assignments of error, ‘it is not this court’s duty to root it out.’ * * * Accordingly, we may disregard an assignment of error that fails to comply with App.R. 16(A)(7).” Tally, supra, citing Harris v. Nome, 9th Dist. Summit No. 21071, 2002-Ohio-6994.
The arguments appellant does raise in these 14 assignments of error are related to his 2014 conviction and are barred by res judicata. “Res judicata bars the assertion of claims against a valid, final judgment of conviction that have been raised or could have been raised on appeal.” State v. Ketterer, 126 Ohio St.3d 448, 2010-Ohio-3831, ¶59, citing State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175 (1967), paragraph nine of the syllabus. “[A]ny issue that could have been raised on direct appeal and was not[,] is res judicata and not subject to review in subsequent proceedings.” State v.

Regarding the proposed Brady violation, the trial court found res judicata applied because ""even assuming the State failed to produce certain lab reports, the defense did not raise any issue about the lab reports and DNA evidence before, during, or even in the direct appeal following the trial and sentence."" (Jgmt. Entry at 9.) As an alternative on the merits, the trial court found that ""even if the Court were to ignore res judicata, this argument nevertheless fails because the record does not support a finding that a Brady violation occurred as the State's final DNA report was disclosed to the defense prior to trial and State's BCI experts testified about the collection of the DNA swabs and results at trial and were subject to cross examination. See generally, State v. Payne, 10th Dist. No. 09AP-107, 2010-Ohio-1018, ¶ 32."" (Jgmt. Entry at 9-10.)

No. 13AP-563, 2014-Ohio-520, and will only be repeated here as relevant to our discussion. In Robinson, appellant asserted that: (1) the jury verdicts in the case were not supported by the manifest weight of the evidence, and (2) the trial court erred in imposing consecutive sentences without making the necessary findings mandated by R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). We overruled both assignments of error and affirmed the trial court judgment.
Subsequently, appellant filed with this court an application for delayed reopening of the appeal. We denied appellant’s application noting that appellate counsel had provided appellant with copies of the appellate briefs in a timely fashion and, therefore, appellant had the opportunity to notify counsel or this court of any additional issues before the case was submitted to a panel of the court for a decision. We also noted appellant was convicted of aggravated burglary and sexual battery based on eye witness testimony supported by DNA evidence, and nothing before us indicated that any of his lawyers rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v.

---------------------
{¶24} Second, Hill appears to challenge whether he effectively waived his probable-cause hearing and whether his admission to the alleged prior-community-
control violation was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. However, that issue is not properly before this court. The trial court filed its judgment entry of sentence for the prior-community-control violation on November 1, 2017 and Hill did not directly appeal that order as he is required to do under App.R. 4(A), or request a delayed appeal. See State v. Vanelli, 9th Dist. Wayne No. 02CA0066, 2003-Ohio-2717, ¶ 9 (noting that an entry imposing sanctions for community-control violations is a final, appealable order); State v. Rogers, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2007-05-068, 2007-Ohio-7076, ¶ 5-6 (refusing to address Rogers’s challenge to matters pertaining to a prior sentencing entry in a direct appeal from a sentencing entry following the revocation of Rogers’s community control), citing State v. Seeley, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-06-38, 2007-Ohio-1538, ¶ 17 (“Any questions concerning the validity of [a prior] entry or matters pertaining [to that entry] should have been raised by direct appeal.”), citing State v. Crutchfield, 3d Dist. Paulding Nos. 11-01-09 and 11-01-10, 2002 WL 206008, *2 (Feb. 8, 2002). As such, we are without jurisdiction to determine the merits of Hill’s arguments regarding whether he effectively waived his probable-cause hearing or whether his admission to the prior-community-control violation was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. See Seeley at ¶ 18, citing App.R. 3, State v. Pringle, 3d Dist. Auglaize No. 2-03-12, 2003-Ohio-4235, ¶ 11, and State v. Gordon, 5th Dist. Fairfield No. 2-CA-92, 2003-Ohio-1900, ¶ 9.
For these reasons, we reject Hill’s arguments that the trial court abused its discretion by revoking his community control and overrule this assignment of error.

The trial court explained that the criminal trial judge who vacated Lemons’s convictions in 2013 had found that the state committed a Brady violation when it withheld material, exculpatory evidence.

Because Young failed to comply with the necessary procedural steps set forth in Crim.R. 33(B), the trial court properly overruled his motion for a new trial. See State v. Norman, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 04AP–1312, 2005–Ohio–5087, ¶ 8 (Defendant’s failure to obtain leave of court was a sufficient basis for overruling the motion); State v. Mir, 7th Dist.

044-Glass,Yes,1,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶4 In the first assignment of error, Glass claims that the trial court erred by failing to dismiss the case due to the State’s filing both an inadequate bill of particulars and then filing a subsequent bill of particulars without leave of the trial court. The assignment of error raises the question of what the appropriate remedy is if an inadequate bill of particulars is filed. Initially, this Court notes that Glass did not raise this issue before the trial court by complaining about the adequacy of the initial bill of particulars. No motion to dismiss was ever filed with the trial court. Instead, Glass merely raised the issue of the filing of the amended bill of particulars without permission of the court at the beginning of the trial. Although Glass argued
that this might be inappropriate, he did not request that the matter be dismissed or that a continuance be granted when he addressed the trial court. Tr. 31-33.

250-Mobley,Yes,0,"Context information is below.
---------------------
On April 15, 2016, appellant was charged in a six-count indictment, including one count of aggravated arson in violation of R.C. 2909.02, and one count of criminal use of an explosive device in violation of R.C. 2909.27; each count also carried a firearm specification. On May 1, 2017, appellant entered a counseled guilty plea to one count of aggravated arson, with a firearm specification, and one count of criminal use of an explosive device. On the same day, the trial court sentenced appellant to an aggregate prison term of 14 years. Appellant did not appeal the May 1, 2017 judgment of conviction.
On October 25, 2017, appellant filed a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1, essentially arguing that the plea was involuntary because the aggravated arson and criminal use of explosives should have merged pursuant to R.C. 2941.145. The trial court overruled the motion on December 15, 2017, finding that res judicata barred appellant from raising the merger argument, as it could have been raised in a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction and sentence. Alternatively, the trial court determined that appellant did not allege facts in his motion to support a finding of manifest injustice, prosecutorial misconduct, or ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Consequently, the trial court denied the motion without an evidentiary hearing. Appellant timely appealed to this court. In a decision rendered on September 25, 2018, we affirmed. State v.

9 Although R.C. 2923.31(l)(2)(c) is not a model of clarity, it appears that the only limitation on receiving stolen property qualifying as “corrupt activity” is that the value of the property at issue in any violation or combination of violations must exceed $1,000. In neither her Crim.R. 29 motion nor her objections to the jury instructions, however, did Rich raise the $1,000 threshold as an issue or argue that it had not been met. While the trial court’s jury instructions did not specify that receiving stolen property qualifies as “corrupt activity” only if the value of the property exceeds $1,000, that omission is not the basis of Rich’s assignment of error either. In any event, because she failed to raise that particular objection below, we would be limited to plain-error review. We would not find plain error here because the stolen merchandise unquestionably was worth much more than $1,000. Therefore, but for the trial court’s omission the outcome would not have been otherwise. To the contrary, if Rich had objected, the trial court simply could have added language addressing the value of the property, and the result would have been the same.
In determining whether the Defendant Jeffrey Rich had reasonable cause to believe that the property had been obtained though the commission of a theft offense, you must put yourself in the position of the Defendant with his knowledge or lack of knowledge and under the circumstances and conditions that surrounded him at that time.

{¶29} Here, the record reveals and Appellant concedes his trial counsel did not object to the complained-of portion of Detective Conkel's testimony until well after it was given and heard by the jury. The record further reveals that trial counsel did not request the trial court provide a curative instruction to the jury. Thus, these alleged errors may only be reviewed for plain error. Therefore, we are further governed by Crim.R.
52(B). “To constitute plain error, a reviewing court must find (1) an error in the proceedings, (2) the error must be a plain, obvious or clear defect in the trial proceedings, and (3) the error must have affected ‘substantial rights' (i.e., the trial court's error must have affected the trial's outcome).” State v. Lewis, supra, at ¶ 9; quoting State v. Dickess, 174 Ohio App.3d 658, 2008-Ohio-39, 884 N.E.2d 92, ¶ 31 (4th Dist.); citing State v. Hill, 92 Ohio St.3d 191, 749 N.E.2d 274 (2001), and State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002). “Furthermore, notice of plain error must be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances, and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” Lewis, supra; citing State v. Landrum, 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 111, 559 N.E.2d 710 (1990), and State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978), paragraph three of the syllabus. “A reviewing court should notice plain error only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.” Id.

---------------------
{¶33} We recognize that defense counsel actively raised concerns with the trial court’s declaration of a mistrial during the July 25, 2017, and August 20, 2017 hearings. However, we do not find Bogan’s subsequent objections to the trial court’s judgment served to rescind the implicit consent given during the July 24, 2017 hearing. In this case, it is evident that the July 25, 2017 hearing was only held to assess defense counsel’s belief that a final verdict had been rendered on Count 1 of Bogan’s indictment. It did not morph into a debate on the substantive merits of the trial court’s mistrial declaration until the court rejected defense counsel’s final verdict argument, and after counsel became aware of the jury’s preliminary not guilty verdict on Count 1. Thus, defense counsel’s objections were predicated on the discovery of favorable information that was not known at the time implied consent was given. In addition, the timing of counsel’s objections precluded practical consideration, as they were not raised until after the court had discharged the jury. Accordingly, the arguments posed by counsel during the July 25, 2017, and August 20, 2017 hearings have no bearing on our analysis.

---------------------
{¶ 10} On October 11, 2018, the trial court issued a decision ruling on those and other post-judgment pro se motions filed by Carr. The court denied Carr’s motion to reconsider the July 12, 2018 nunc pro tunc order, finding that such order properly corrected a clerical mistake, and further finding that the court lacked jurisdiction to reconsider that order given Carr’s pending appeal in Case No. 28080. As to the restitution order, the court found that it lacked statutory authority to stay the payment of restitution and further indicated that “it would decline to exercise” such authority in Carr’s case, even if such authority existed. With regard to Carr’s request for copies of the jury verdict forms, the court determined that verdict forms bearing the names of jurors “are not public records” subject to production under R.C. 149.43(B)(8), and that Carr also “ha[d] not shown that the information sought in the jury verdict forms is necessary to support a justiciable claim.” Finally, with respect to Carr’s motion for grand jury testimony, the court held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider that request because Carr had not filed a petition for postconviction relief and no other pending criminal matters in his case required additional discovery. The court further invoked its discretion to deny that request due to Carr’s failure “to show a particularized need for the grand jury testimony.”

094-Todd,Yes,0,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Among the reasons offered for denying Todd’s motion for a new trial, the trial court concluded that the “Motion for New Trial was untimely filed pursuant to Crim.R. 33.” (Doc. No. 148). We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Todd’s motion as untimely because Todd did not properly seek leave to file a delayed motion for a new trial or demonstrate that he was unavoidably prevented from filing his motion in a timely fashion. See State v. Herring, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105970, 2018-Ohio-1305, ¶ 15 (“A trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying an untimely motion for a new trial where the defendant fails to * * * seek[] leave from the trial court to file his motion or even allege that he was unavoidably prevented from filing his motion in a timely manner.”), citing State v. Green, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-260, 2013-Ohio-5327, ¶ 11. See also State v. Roberts, 141 Ohio App.3d 578, 582-583 (6th Dist.2001) (concluding that when a defendant does not seek leave to file a delayed motion for a new trial, the trial court abuses its discretion by entertaining the defendant’s untimely motion).
Todd premised his motion for a new trial on the grounds set forth in Crim.R. 33(A)(1)—namely, that his exclusion from the in camera voir dire was an irregularity in the trial proceedings that prevented him from having a fair trial. (Doc. No. 142). Todd did not base his motion for a new trial on the discovery of new evidence. (See id.). Consequently, the first paragraph of Crim.R. 33(B) governs the timing of Todd’s motion for a new trial, and under the first paragraph of Crim.R. 33(B), Todd was required to file his motion for a new trial within fourteen days after the jury rendered its guilty verdicts.

As provided in R.C. 2953.21(A)(1), a convicted defendant who claims there was such an infringement of his rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio or the United States Constitutions may file a petition for postconviction relief in the court that imposed sentence. There are time deadlines for filing this petition. Under the prior version of the statute, a petition had to be filed no later than 180 days after the date the trial transcripts were filed in the court of appeals in the direct appeal. See Former R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) (unless no direct appeal was filed, in which case the 180 days started from day the time expired for filing the appeal).

Initially, we note that Flagg did not object to the second trial or raise the issue of double jeopardy to the trial court. A reviewing court may, but is not required to, consider a constitutional issue raised for the first time on appeal where the rights and interests involved may warrant it. *In re M.D.*, 38 Ohio St.3d 149, 527 N.E.2d 286 (1988); see *State v.

Because this error cannot be corrected, we can grant no relief and the error is moot. We overrule Wilson's fourth assignment of error.

858-Salyers,Yes,0,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶45} Because the trial court anticipatorily excluded the evidence of Wireman’s previous violence toward her ex-husband, Salyers was required to seek a final determination on the admissibility of the disputed evidence at trial, when the court could review it in the context of the other evidence. See Lemmon at *2; Morales at ¶ 30. Salyers directs us to no evidence in the record that Salyers attempted to introduce the evidence during trial, and we see none. Therefore, Salyers waived this argument. Accord Lemmon at *2. See State v. Logsdon, 3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-05-29, 2007-Ohio-6715, ¶ 11; State v. Cutts, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2008CA000079, 2009-Ohio-3563, ¶ 192.
Next, Salyers argues that the trial court abused its discretion by denying him access to “records related to issues with [Wireman’s] prior care of her daughters.” (Appellant’s Brief at 27). Crim.R. 16 provides the discovery rules for criminal proceedings. *State v. Engle*, 166 Ohio App.3d 262, 2006-Ohio-1884, ¶ 7 (3d Dist.). That rule provides, in its relevant part, that a criminal defendant is entitled to discovery of any evidence which is “favorable to the defendant and material to either guilt or punishment.” Crim.R. 16(B)(5). *See State v.

1 Crim.R. 33(B) requires, with certain exceptions for being unavoidably prevented from filing and for newly discovered evidence, that a motion for new trial be filed within 14 days after the verdict was rendered. Here, the verdict was rendered on February 7, 2019. Fourteen days after the verdict was rendered was February 21, 2019. Appellant filed his motion well after this deadline. Appellant also filed his motion after the trial court had sentenced appellant and rendered its final judgment. Appellant alleged four claims in his motion for new trial: (1) trial counsel's lack of attentiveness, (2) the state's use of 9-1-1 call and trial court not permitting recross-examination, (3) prosecutorial misconduct, and (4) being shackled during trial. In support of his first claim, appellant asserted new trial was warranted on grounds of an irregularity in the proceeding; however, appellant did not assert any specific grounds for new trial in support of his remaining claims. He did not allege unavoidable prevention or newly discovered evidence. The record does not reflect that the trial court ruled on the motion. Nevertheless, as the motion was untimely filed and filed after the trial court rendered final judgment, we proceed with this appeal.

In order to challenge this allegedly illegal arrangement, the appellant had to challenge the sale contract that made the side-agreement a component of a “strawman” purchase.

Before his motion for leave was addressed, Appellant filed the motion for a new trial. The trial court found Appellant's motion untimely and also without merit. Appellant failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that he was unavoidably prevented from the discovery of the evidence upon which he relies. For instance, his attorney was provided with the two interviews of the child-victim in 2004. In addition, Appellant unreasonably delayed the filing of his 2017 motion for leave after admittedly obtaining copies of the evidence in 2008.

In his appeal, Leitwein did not allege that one or more of the conditions set forth in R.C. 4511.197 had not been met. (T. at 7-8). The trial court held an evidentiary hearing on Leitwein’s ALS appeal. Leitwein did not present argument or evidence to the trial court that one or more of the conditions set forth in R.C. 4511.197 had not been met.
Leitwein was given the opportunity to present evidence that the ALS was not authorized, and to challenge the officer’s sworn report, the BMV Form 2255, as failing to comply with statutory requirements. He did not. His sole ground for the ALS appeal was failure to hold his initial appearance on the underlying OVI charges within five days of the date of his summons, a result that is not supported by R.C. 4511.196 or R.C. 4511.197.

---------------------
¶ 2 In 2015, Boaston was convicted of murdering his ex-wife, Brandi Gonyer-Boaston. On appeal, he argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in (1) allowing the deputy coroner who conducted the autopsy, Dr. Diane Scala-Barnett, to testify regarding Brandi’s time of death based on her stomach contents (the “time-of-death opinion”) and that an abrasion on Brandi’s chin was consistent with the pattern, shape, and texture of a buckle and some Velcro on one of Boaston’s gloves (the “glove-buckle opinion”) because these opinions were not in Dr. Scala-Barnett’s written expert report, as required by Crim.R. 16(K), and (2) permitting a Toledo Police Department detective, Jay Gast, to testify regarding cellphone tower tracking without establishing the scientific validity of such evidence. See State v. Boaston, 2017-Ohio-8770, 100 N.E.3d 1002 (6th Dist.). We determined that (1) Boaston waived the Crim.R. 16(K) issue by failing to raise it before trial because defense counsel knew that Dr. Scala-Barnett planned to testify about Brandi’s time of death based on her stomach contents and to opine on the similarity of the abrasion and the glove buckle, but did not move to exclude Dr. Scala-Barnett’s testimony until after the jury was empaneled; (2) Boaston did not raise concerns about the validity of the cellphone tower tracking evidence at trial, so he waived all but plain error regarding that issue; and (3) it was not plain error for the trial court to accept testimony about cellphone tower tracking from a detective without conducting a hearing regarding the testimony’s scientific reliability. Id. at ¶ 49, 56, 62, 65-66.
Boaston appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio, which accepted his appeal on the Crim.R. 16(K) issue and affirmed his conviction, albeit on different grounds. *State v. Boaston*, 160 Ohio St.3d 46, 2020-Ohio-1061, 153 N.E.3d 44. The court determined that Crim.R. 16(K) *required* the exclusion of Dr. Scala-Barnett’s time-of-death opinion and glove-buckle opinion because they were not included in her written report, and that the trial court erred in allowing her to testify regarding these matters. *Id.* at ¶ 55-59. However, the court also concluded that the error was harmless because Dr. Scala-Barnett’s opinions were “not essential to the state’s prosecution of the charged crimes” and “did little more than connect dots that were all too readily apparent.” *Id.* at ¶ 64. Moreover, the court found that “even without the deputy coroner’s opinion testimony on Brandi’s time of death and the glove-buckle comparison, the remaining evidence overwhelmingly establishes Boaston’s guilt beyond any reasonable doubt.” *Id.* at ¶ 65. The court cataloged the record evidence of Boaston’s jealousy, controlling behavior, installation of spyware on Brandi’s phones, his “tumultuous” relationship with Brandi, his refusal to accept Brandi’s clear desire to leave the relationship and move out of their shared apartment, the steps he took in preparation of Brandi’s murder (including making ATM withdrawals, putting gas in her vehicle, asking a friend for “assistance ‘to take care of business,’” and calling Brandi the morning of the murder to make sure that she came to the apartment when she got off of work), and the lack of activity on Boaston’s cellphone during the timeframe when Brandi was likely murdered and transported to Fulton County. *Id.* at ¶ 66-68.
On the whole, the Supreme Court said that it strains credulity to think that in the span of 46 minutes, Brandi left [Boaston’s] residence, was abducted by an unidentified assailant who partially undressed and killed her, wrapped her in plastic, stashed her body along with her dry clothing and shoes in the rear of her vehicle, drove the SUV 20 miles away, abandoned it off the country road, and mysteriously disappeared without a trace. *Id.* at ¶ 69.

{¶11} Criminal Rule 32.1 provides that “to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.” “A defendant who seeks to withdraw a plea of guilty after the imposition of sentence has the burden of establishing the existence of manifest injustice.” State v. Smith, 49 Ohio St.2d 261, 361 N.E.2d 1324 (1977), paragraph one of the syllabus. “This term has been variously defined, but it is clear that under such standard, a postsentence withdrawal motion is allowable only in extraordinary cases.” Id. at 264. Appellate review of the present matter “is somewhat limited as a motion made pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1 is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.” State v. Carabello, 17 Ohio St.3d 66, 67, 477 N.E.2d 627 (1985).
“Res judicata bars the assertion of claims against a valid, final judgment of conviction that have been raised or could have been raised on appeal.” State v. Ketterer, 126 Ohio St.3d 448, 2010-Ohio-3831, 935 N.E.2d 9, ¶ 59, citing State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph nine of the syllabus. “[I]t is well-established that claims raised in a post-sentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea that were raised or could have been raised in a direct appeal may be barred by res judicata.” State v. Carnes, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2020-T-0004, 2020-Ohio-3566, ¶ 14; Ketterer at ¶ 59.

A § 2255 motion cannot be used to “to relitigate an issue that was raised and considered on direct appeal absent highly exceptional circumstances, such as an intervening change in the law.” This procedural default doctrine typically prohibits collateral attacks, such as § 2255 petitions, that raise claims the petitioner could have brought on direct appeal.

¶ 17 On December 13, 2017, prior to Young's sentencing but nearly two months after the court rendered its verdict, Young filed a motion for leave to file for a new trial based on an irregularity in the proceedings. Young, now represented by new counsel, indicated that after trial, on or about December 7 or 8, 2017, his original trial counsel was alerted to the existence of ""new"" photographic evidence consisting of a Snapchat photograph of K.K. The photograph contains a banner across it that reads ""More room to bend me over here"" and shows K.K. with her top lifted and her bare breasts exposed. Although this photograph is referred to as ""new photographic evidence,"" Young's original trial counsel acknowledged that the photograph had been provided to the defense during discovery.

---------------------
{¶13} The other-acts evidence was first introduced when Y.F. testified that she learned K.F. had given Mr. Lewis two hand jobs in the past. The trial court immediately interjected and explained to the jury that the “testimony regarding events leading up to the oral sex” was not being
admitted “to show conformity thereof or that he is guilty of this offense[,] but only to demonstrate motive on [his part.]” Defense counsel tried to then note an objection to the other-acts testimony for the record, but the trial court said it was too late and should have been done before the question was asked. The court nonetheless ordered the jury to disregard the evidence and asked the prosecutor to proceed examining the witness. As Y.F.’s testimony resumed, defense counsel twice tried to preemptively object to the other-acts evidence, but her objections were overruled. Y.F. eventually testified again that she learned her daughter had given hand jobs to Mr. Lewis on two prior occasions, but no further objections were made.

---------------------
“Generally, ‘[a] trial court is given broad discretion in admitting and excluding evidence, including “other bad acts” evidence.’” State v. Wendel, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-16-08, 2016-Ohio-7915, ¶ 23, quoting State v. Williams, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 11 JE 7, 2013-Ohio-2314, ¶ 7, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 265 (1984). However, we apply a plain-error standard of review to this assignment of error because Baskin failed to object at trial to the admission of his prior domestic-violence conviction. See Bagley, 2014-Ohio-1787, at ¶ 55 (applying
a plain-error standard of review because Bagley failed to object at the time the “other acts” evidence was admitted); State v. Hare, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2017-CA-4, 2018-Ohio-765, ¶ 41 (stating that Hare waived all but plain error on appeal because he “failed to object at the time that this ‘other acts’ evidence was admitted”). Accordingly, to be reversible, we must conclude that there was error—a deviation from a legal rule—and that the error was an obvious defect in the proceedings that affected the outcome of trial. See Hare at ¶ 41, citing State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27 (2002) and Crim.R. 52(B).

158-Sibole,Yes,0,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 9} Sibole first argues here that he was denied the right to cross-examine the witness against him in violation of his right to confront his accuser guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Confrontation Clause states that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” But Sibole did not raise any objections based on the Confrontation Clause at trial. It is on appeal that he for the first time challenges the admission of the testimony on this basis. The “failure to timely advise a trial court of possible error, by objection or otherwise, results in a waiver of the issue for purposes of appeal.” Goldfuss v. Davidson, 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 121, 679 N.E.2d 1099 (1997). Both the Tenth and First districts have determined that when an objection is made on hearsay grounds, a Confrontation Clause objection is not preserved. State v. Hairston, 2016-Ohio-8495, 79 N.E.3d 1193, ¶ 34 (10th Dist.); State v. Harris, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-130442, 2014-Ohio-4237, ¶ 14. On this record we are unable to conclude that the specific objection made on hearsay grounds, referencing the lack of an excited utterance, preserved a constitutional Confrontation Clause question for appeal. Consequently, we determine whether the admission of the testimony violated Sibole’s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation using a plain-error analysis. See Crim.R. 52(B). To prevail, Sibole “must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that but for the error, the
outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.” State v. Mammone, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942, 13 N.E.3d 1051, ¶ 69. Given our conclusion in paragraph 12, infra, that admission of the statement was not prejudicial, we see no plain error.

Crim.R. 33(B) provides that if a defendant fails to file a motion for a new trial within 120 days of the jury's verdict, he or she must seek leave from the trial court to file a delayed motion. To obtain leave, the defendant must show by clear and convincing proof that he or she was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence within the 120 days. State v. Lordi, 149 Ohio App.3d 627, 2002–Ohio–5517, 778 N.E.2d 605, ¶ 26–27. Clear and convincing proof is that which will produce in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.

¶ 111 To the extent Grate also argues that his conviction for kidnapping L.S. was not supported by sufficient evidence or that his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence, his argument fails because he pleaded guilty to this offense. A guilty plea “waives [a defendant’s] right to present manifest-weight-of-the-evidence or sufficiency-of-the-evidence attacks against his convictions.” State v. Dalton, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24953, 2012-Ohio-3386, ¶ 7, citing State v. Griggs, 103 Ohio St.3d 85, 2004-Ohio-4415, 814 N.E.2d 51. Moreover, no plain error occurred.
