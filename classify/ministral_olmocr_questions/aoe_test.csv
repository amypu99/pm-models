Attorney for Defendant-Appellant

HALL, J.
Brandon Beedy appeals from his conviction following a guilty plea to one count of attempted involuntary manslaughter, a second-degree felony.

In his sole assignment of error, Beedy contends the trial court erred by making generalized statements about drug use by defendants to support imposing a statutory maximum eight-year prison term in his case.

Answer:"
073-Beedy,No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It provides a detailed account of the events leading up to and including the plea and sentencing hearings in the case involving Beedy and Caitlyn Heinzen. There is no mention of an assignment of error or any allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
The record reflects that Beedy was indicted on one count of involuntary manslaughter and one count of child endangering in connection with the death of his 21-month-old child. He subsequently entered into a plea agreement that provided for him to plead guilty to an amended charge of attempted involuntary manslaughter. The agreement also provided for dismissal of the child-endangering charge and preparation of a presentence investigation report before sentencing. Finally, the agreement obligated Beedy to agree to testify against Caitlyn Heinzen, the child’s mother. During an August 14, 2019 plea hearing, the prosecutor read facts into the record establishing that Beedy and Heinzen left the child unattended in a crib for so long that the child died of dehydration. (Plea Tr. at 3-4.) At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court accepted Beedy’s plea and ordered a presentence investigation.

The case then proceeded to a September 5, 2019 sentencing hearing for Beedy and Heinzen, who separately also had pled guilty to attempted involuntary manslaughter. At the outset of the hearing, defense counsel argued among other things that Beedy was “battling a pretty bad drug addiction” and had been “battling it for years.” (Sentencing Tr. at 4.) Counsel noted that Beedy had been involved with a drug-treatment program. (Id.) Counsel requested community control so that Beedy could continue drug treatment. (Id. at 5.) When Beedy addressed the court, he acknowledged having a drug
problem and “working on it.” (Id. at 13.). He asked the trial court for a chance to prove himself. (Id. at 13-14.) After Heinzen and her attorney spoke, the prosecutor noted that the child had been left alone for an entire day and had died of dehydration. (Id. at 15.) The prosecutor noted that the child, whose skin was permanently stained with feces, had been dead for hours before being discovered. (Id. at 15-16.) The prosecutor then asserted that Beedy and Heinzen had been under the influence of drugs during the time that the child died of dehydration. (Id. at 16-17.) The prosecutor requested eight-year prison sentences for both defendants.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
073-Beedy,"No. The text is describing the trial court's reasoning and the defendants' arguments, not an assignment of error alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 5 The trial court then addressed both defendants and reasoned in part as follows:

Methamphetamine, THC, cocaine, Fentanyl: These are the substances that were found to be in the system of Mr. Beedy just two days after [the child] died.

Methamphetamine, THC, cocaine, opiates, Tramadol and Fentanyl: These are the substances found to be in the system of Miss Heinzen just two days after the death of her son.

Both defendants essentially blame their drug problems for this tragedy, and stood in this courtroom and assured the Court that they’re ready to capitalize on that one more chance and to do whatever it takes to overcome this problem; and the point was made that perhaps, finally, they will be able to overcome this drug problem if the Court puts some kind of hammer over their head, that being prison time.

That that’s what it will take to finally get them off drugs. The problem
with that argument is they have essentially had a hammer over their heads since January 12th, knowing that they were responsible for this tragedy.

Knowing they were being investigated, knowing they would eventually be charged, knowing we would eventually get to today.

So knowing all of that, Mr. Beedy went to McKinley Hall on March the 1st. He was placed in a program; and after March 20th, there was no contact with McKinley Hall until May 29th, over two months.

On July 10th, the case manager made the effort to contact Mr. Beedy to find out why he wasn’t coming to treatment. It’s not really important why he wasn’t going.

The fact of the matter is he wasn’t going. But he was told to go to a group meeting that night, which he did go to on July 10th; but that was the last time they heard from him until August 29th.

* * *

So they have had a hammer over their head. Surely they knew the Court was going to look at any progress they may have made in addressing their drug program. They knew today would come. That hammer was over their head, and yet they did not do everything they needed to do.

But today is different; they are going to do everything they need to do today because there would be, I suppose, two hammers over their head.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
073-Beedy,"No. The text describes an appeal by Beedy challenging the trial court's sentence, not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Both defendants have told the Court that they are going to have to live with this the rest of their lives, and that is true; but the key word there is live. They will be living, unlike [their child].
And not that this would be an excuse but if we were looking at 18- or 19-year-old parents who are virtually kids themselves, again, it certainly wouldn’t be an excuse; but it could be slightly more understandable. But we are dealing with a 28 and 34 year old.

*It always amazes me that defendants will come into the courtroom and tell the Court that they have a drug problem, that they need another chance, and yet we are all told that if we get involved with dangerous drugs like this, we will end up either in prison or dead.*

* * *

Incidentally, possessing and ingesting the drugs I mentioned earlier, those are all felony offenses. We seem to gloss over that when we talk about drug problems, but essentially, you were committing felony offenses and not taking care of your child. This is violating a duty of care, protection and support to the extreme.

The Court is going to follow the State’s recommendation and impose a sentence of eight (8) years in the Ohio State Penitentiary on each defendant. * * *

(Emphasis added.) (Id. at 19-22.)

{¶ 6} On appeal, Beedy challenges the trial court’s imposition of an eight-year prison sentence. His argument focuses exclusively on the trial court’s reference to the defendants’ entering the courtroom and claiming to have a drug problem. He reasons that the italicized paragraph quoted above near the end of the trial court’s remarks demonstrated judicial bias. His entire substantive argument is as follows: “This
generalizing statement about all defendants that have drug issues that come into the trial court showed that the court had a bias against his case prior to Mr. Beedy pleading guilty and regardless of the underlying facts, resulting in the imposition of the eight year sentence. Also, this case did not involve an act of violence, which the trial court noted. Consequently, the sentence is contrary to law under R.C. 2953.08(G)(2).” (Appellant’s brief at 7.)

Answer:"
073-Beedy,"No. The text describes an assignment of error by Beedy, not the prosecutor. Beedy is alleging that the trial court's remarks exhibited improper judicial bias against him, not that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 7} Upon review, we find Beedy’s assignment of error to be unpersuasive. Under R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), we may vacate or modify a felony sentence if we find by clear and convincing evidence that the record does not support the sentence or the sentence is otherwise contrary to law. State v. Damiano, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 2017-CA-31, 2018-Ohio-4761, ¶ 9 (citing additional cases). Beedy asserts that his eight-year sentence is contrary to law because the trial court’s remarks exhibited improper judicial bias against him.

{¶ 8} We recognize that “a judicial bias claim may be interpreted ‘as an argument that [the defendant’s] sentence is contrary to law based on a due process violation.’ ” State v. Johnson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107528, 2019-Ohio-4668, ¶ 26, quoting State v. Frazier, 2017-Ohio-8307, 98 N.E.3d 1291, ¶ 15 (8th Dist.). We also note, however, that a judge is presumed unbiased and that “the appearance of bias must be compelling in order to overcome the presumption.” Id., quoting State v. Filous, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104287, 2016-Ohio-8312, ¶ 14.

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
073-Beedy,"No. The text describes an assignment of error by Beedy, not the prosecutor. The error is related to the trial court's comment, not the prosecutor's conduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 9} Here the challenged comment fails to establish impermissible judicial bias. The trial court engaged in a lengthy explanation of why it was unpersuaded by Beedy’s claim that he would change his ways and get off of drugs if the trial court would allow him
to pursue drug treatment instead of sending him to prison. As set forth above, near the end of its remarks, the trial court added: “It always amazes me that defendants will come into the courtroom and tell the Court that they have a drug problem, that they need another chance, and yet we are all told that if we get involved with dangerous drugs like this, we will end up either in prison or dead.” (Sentencing Tr. at 22.).

¶ 10 We see absolutely nothing in this comment by the trial court that is indicative of impermissible judicial bias. Beedy characterizes the trial court’s comment as an improper generalized statement about all defendants who appear in court with drug problems. It is clear, however, that the trial court was including Beedy and Heinzen within that group of defendants. Although the trial court couched its comment broadly, the remark undeniably was directed at Beedy and his specific circumstances. Regardless, we simply are unpersuaded that there was anything improper about the remark, particularly when read in the context of the trial court’s full statements. Accordingly, we overrule Beedy’s assignment of error.

    Plaintiff-Appellee, : TRIAL NO. 17CRB-13232

vs. : OPINION.

ANNETTE POE, : 
    Defendant-Appellant.

Criminal Appeal From: Hamilton County Municipal Court
Judgment Appealed From Is: Affirmed in Part, Reversed in Part, and Cause Remanded for Resentencing
Date of Judgment Entry on Appeal: August 17, 2018

Paula Boggs Muething, City Solicitor, Natalia Harris, City Prosecutor, and Christopher Liu, Assistant Prosecutor, for Plaintiff-Appellee,

Raymond T. Faller, Hamilton County Public Defender, and Demetra Stamatakos, Assistant Public Defender, for Defendant-Appellant.
Cunningham, Presiding Judge.

{¶1} Defendant-appellant Annette Poe appeals her conviction for criminal damaging, asserting that the trial court denied her the right of allocution and that she was prejudiced by the denial. We agree and remand the cause for resentencing.

{¶2} After Poe was arrested for criminal damaging, she proceeded to a trial before the court. At trial, Elizabeth Valesquez testified that she had seen her neighbor scratch the side of her husband's car while it was located in the parking lot of their apartment building around noon on May 15, 2017. Valesquez identified Poe as the neighbor, and stated that Poe often addressed her with derogatory terms. Valesquez's husband, Jose Rodriguez Fernandez, testified that the car he had left in Poe's parking spot with her permission had no scratches when he checked it before leaving for work on the morning of May 15, but the car had significant scratches when he returned home from work later that day. Fernandez further testified that when he confronted Poe about the damage, she lashed out with “Mexicans [are] no good here.” The only other witness to testify was the officer who arrested Poe after his investigation.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
154-Poe,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error, and it does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The text is a transcript of a court proceeding where the judge is asking questions and the defense counsel is providing information about the defendant, Ms. Poe. There is no mention of an assignment of error or any allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶3} The trial court found Poe guilty of the charge and proceeded to sentencing. The following exchange then took place on the record:

The Court: Mitigation.

Defense counsel: Judge, mitigation. Ms. Poe is 53 years old. She has no record that I can see. Judge, she is working right now for Trade Global in West Chester.

[The Court]: Ms. Poe, I’m curious as to the portion that we heard[,] the exchange that may or may not have taken place, did you tell the Fernandez family, the victims[,] that they could park in your space?
Poe: No.

The Court: Okay, so that is not accurate in terms of the parking space?

Poe: It’s not accurate. They park on the street.

The Court: Okay.

Poe: In front of a store and it’s got cameras.

The Court: Mm-hmm.

Poe: And they carry phones all the time. They said they seen me scratch the car, why didn’t they take a picture or try to stop me?

The Court: Part of what I was curious about is whether or not you had, in fact, said that they could park there.

Poe: No, I never told them they could park there. They never did park in my spot.

The Court: Do you have a criminal record over there? I don’t see anything up here. You say your client has no record, okay.

The Prosecutor: I believe Mr. Rodriguez would request [a] restitution amount. Unfortunately I don’t have an estimate here today.

The Court: In order to provide a restitution amount I have to have an amount.

The Prosecutor: I understand.

The Court: This is charged as an M-2, is that correct?

The Prosecutor: It is. Ma’am, you did not spend any time in lockup, did you?
Defense counsel: She was arrested, taken down to the Justice Center, Judge.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
154-Poe,"No. The error is being alleged by the defendant, Poe, against the trial court, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
The Court: Okay. Ma’am, I’m going to place you on a period of Community Control for 11 months. In order to do that, I’m imposing 90 days, suspend 90 days. There’s going to be [a] $100 fine plus court costs. No contact with the family that’s alleged as the victim in this case, the Fernandez family. So, no contact with them. That’s no back and forth, nothing. I’m going to order you to complete the Corrective Thinking program.

{¶4} In her sole assignment of error, Poe asserts that the trial court erred by denying her the right of allocution as required by Crim.R. 32(A)(1), because the court failed to “address [her] personally” and ask if she “wish[ed] to make a statement in * * * her own behalf or present any information in mitigation of punishment.”

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
154-Poe,No. The error is not alleging that the prosecutor (or the state) committed misconduct. The error is alleging that the trial court failed to properly exercise its duty to invite the defendant to speak on the issue of mitigation of punishment before sentencing.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶5} The defendant’s right of allocution requires a trial court’s unambiguous, personal invitation to the defendant to speak on the issue of mitigation of punishment before sentencing. State v. Green, 90 Ohio St.3d 352, 359, 738 N.E.2d 1208 (2000), cited in State v. Thompson, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-120516, 2013-Ohio-1981, ¶ 6; State v. Saunders, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-160781, 2017-Ohio-8557, ¶ 13. “Trial courts must painstakingly adhere to Crim.R. 32, guaranteeing the right of allocution,” as the Crim.R. 32 inquiry “represents a defendant’s last opportunity to plead his case or express remorse.” Green at 359-360.
If a trial court imposes a sentence without first asking the defendant if he or she wishes to exercise the right of allocution, “resentencing is required unless the error is invited error or harmless error.” State v. Campbell, 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 738 N.E.2d 1178 (2000), paragraph three of the syllabus; Thompson at ¶8.

In this case, the trial court’s general statement of “mitigation” at the commencement of the sentencing hearing was not sufficient to satisfy the court’s duty to unambiguously address Poe personally when inquiring about mitigation. See Thompson at ¶7. The state argues, however, that the trial court’s subsequent direct questioning of Poe was sufficient to render the error harmless.


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
154-Poe,"No. The error is not alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is alleging that the trial court failed to adequately inform the defendant of her right to make a statement regarding her sentence, which is a procedural error.","Context information is below.
---------------------
In support of its harmless-error argument, the state cites State v. Reynolds, 80 Ohio St.3d 670, 687 N.E.2d 1358 (1998), and Thompson, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-120516, 2013-Ohio-1981. In Reynolds, the Supreme Court held that the trial court’s failure to ask the defendant if he wanted to make a statement before sentencing on an aggravated-murder count was harmless error because the defendant had made an unsworn statement in the penalty phase of the trial and had addressed the court in a previously sent letter, and his attorney had made a statement on his behalf. Reynolds at 684.

In Thompson, this court held that the trial court’s failure to personally ask the defendant if he wanted to exercise his right of allocution was harmless because the defendant requested and was granted an opportunity to personally address the court and “make his case in mitigation” before the court finally pronounced sentence. Thompson at ¶12.

This case is distinguishable from Reynolds and Thompson because nothing in the record demonstrates that Poe was ever adequately informed of or
afforded her right to make a statement to the court with respect to the sentence about to be imposed. The back and forth between the trial court and Poe during the sentencing hearing involved the court's narrow inquiry about a part of one victim's testimony. The court did not inquire as to whether Poe wished to present information in mitigation of punishment for the offense of criminal damaging, and Poe's responses to the court touched on guilt but not on punishment. The court then imposed a maximum sentence for a second-degree misdemeanor. Although the jail term was suspended, the sentence also included community control for 11 months, a fine, and the completion of a “Corrective Thinking” class.

{¶11} On this record, we conclude that the error was not harmless, as we cannot say that had the court asked Poe if she wished to personally address the court with respect to the sentence about to be imposed, as required by Crim.R. 32(A)(1), it would have had no positive effect on her sentence.

DORRIAN, J.

¶ 1 Defendant-appellant, Earnest L.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
936-Phillips,"No. The text describes a series of events involving Phillips's legal representation and his decision to represent himself, as well as the court's response to his medical claims. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 2 Phillips was indicted on one count of burglary on September 25, 2017. The charge arose from an incident in which Columbus police officers observed Phillips enter and walk around inside a fraternity house near The Ohio State University campus. The house manager for the fraternity would later testify that Phillips did not live in the house
and was not a guest of any of the residents. Attorney Michael Siewert was appointed to represent Phillips. A trial on the burglary indictment and two other criminal cases was scheduled for October 11, 2017, but on that date Phillips advised the court he was unhappy with Attorney Siewert. The court concluded Phillips's complaints about Siewert were not well-founded. The trial court commenced jury selection the following day. Before voir dire was completed on October 12, 2017, Phillips advised the court he wished to represent himself. The court granted Phillips's request and offered to appoint Attorney Siewert as standby counsel, which Phillips declined. Later that same day, Phillips reported to the court that he was experiencing medical issues. The Columbus Division of Fire emergency squad was summoned and concluded Phillips was not in genuine distress. However, Phillips persisted in telling the court he could not proceed with trial. The court then appointed Attorney Jeffrey Basnett to represent Phillips and scheduled a pretrial conference for October 25, 2017. In the entry appointing Attorney Basnett to serve as Phillips's counsel, the trial court advised that ""[s]hould Mr. Phillips decline to work with or be represented by attorney Basnett, the court will allow Phillips to self-represent on his cases, but under the circumstances the court deems it prudent to first offer Mr. Phillips attorney Basnett's services.""

Answer:"
936-Phillips,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it describes a series of events involving Phillips' mental health and his decision to represent himself, as well as the court's response to these events.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 3 Immediately before the pretrial conference on October 25, 2017, Phillips advised Attorney Basnett he wished to represent himself. Attorney Basnett notified the court of this at the beginning of the conference. Following extensive discussion with the court, including an assertion by Phillips that he was experiencing mental health issues, Phillips agreed to continue to work with Attorney Basnett in preparing his case for trial. The case was set for trial on November 6, 2017.

¶ 4 When Phillips and Attorney Basnett appeared before the court again on November 6, 2017, Attorney Basnett advised the court that Phillips had indicated prior to the hearing that he would represent himself and asked Attorney Basnett to assist him in getting additional information. Phillips had also told Attorney Basnett he suffered from bipolar disorder and was having problems with his medication. Attorney Basnett further advised the court that Phillips was due for further mental health evaluation by Southeast Mental Health. Attorney Basnett suggested a formal competency evaluation be conducted
and indicated that Phillips had previously agreed with that recommendation. When asked whether he wanted a competency evaluation, Phillips responded as follows:

Judge Frye, you got to excuse me, because I have been blinking out and on. I have a change of thought. I'm not further too well, and I will take your advice and keep him as my lawyer. I'm not actually going to be able to represent myself, you know. It's very complicated for me. My mind is not working like it used to, actually.

You know, I'm just asking, actually, for this Southeast to try to evaluate to see what's going on with me. They said it was something in the past that's tricking me off and on, and so on. And that's what I'm asking for.

(Nov. 6, 2017 Tr. at 4.) Following the hearing, the trial court ordered a competency evaluation for Phillips. The competency report was submitted to the court on December 13, 2017. Throughout December 2017, Phillips filed pro se motions for bond hearing, suppression of evidence, dismissal of Attorney Basnett as counsel, and dismissal of the indictments.

Answer:"
936-Phillips,"No. The text describes a series of events involving Phillips, his attorney, and the court, but it does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 5 On January 4, 2018, the trial court conducted a hearing and denied Phillips's pro se motions. At the hearing, Attorney Basnett indicated that when he spoke with Phillips earlier in the day, Phillips did not recognize him and stated he was still having issues with his medication. During the hearing, Phillips acted erratically, addressing the trial judge as ""Captain Hess"" and referring to having gone through military training. (Jan. 4, 2018 Tr. at 2-3.) Phillips told the court his medication had been changed and that he tried to explain this to Attorney Basnett:

I was trying to explain it to this recon, but he wouldn't listen to me. And I really don't need him around me. He's whatever you called me. He's not as of my soldier, and I feel that he's my enemy. And, actually, I really want to take some kind of military weapon and try to dismiss him out of my life, because I see it as a real conflict. And I hate to say it here in this court martial, but I hate for somebody to bullshit me. Sorry.

(Jan. 4, 2018 Tr. at 7.) Attorney Basnett requested a second competency evaluation at the hearing and subsequently filed a written motion for a second competency evaluation. The trial court ordered a second competency evaluation to be performed.
Phillips and Attorney Basnett next appeared before the court at a hearing on March 14, 2018. At that hearing, Attorney Basnett advised the court that Phillips wanted to represent himself. Phillips confirmed at the hearing that he wished to represent himself; the trial court granted Phillips’s request for self-representation and retained Attorney Basnett as standby counsel. The trial court issued an entry ordering Phillips to file a written waiver of the right to counsel and advising him that disruptive behavior could result in the court terminating his right to self-representation.

Answer:"
936-Phillips,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor (State of Ohio) committed misconduct. The text describes Phillips' complaints about his attorney and the trial court's decision regarding his representation, but it does not mention any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
The court held a competency hearing for Phillips on April 17, 2018. Dr. Allen McConnell, a forensic psychologist who conducted the first competency evaluation of Phillips in December 2017, testified he found Phillips to have a mental illness associated with bipolar disorder, but not an intellectual disability. Dr. McConnell stated Phillips was cooperative when interviewed about his mental health, but was uncooperative when asked questions related to his legal proceedings, referring to the doctor as ""captain"" and acting as though he was in a military environment. Dr. McConnell concluded Phillips was capable of understanding the nature and objective of the proceedings against him and assisting in his own defense. Dr. John Lewis Tilley, Jr., a clinical and forensic psychologist who conducted the second competency evaluation of Phillips, testified to his opinion that although Phillips had mental health problems he did not have a mental illness or intellectual disability that would hinder his ability to stand trial. Instead, Dr. Tilley opined that Phillips was malingering, intentionally fabricating, or grossly exaggerating mental health problems to manipulate his legal situation. Dr. Tilley testified he believed Phillips was capable in assisting in his own defense and was competent to stand trial. Following the hearing, the trial court found Phillips competent to stand trial.

The case proceeded to a jury trial, with jury selection commencing May 29, 2018. Prior to jury selection, Phillips reiterated his complaints about the assistance he previously received from Attorney Basnett and indicated he was not prepared to proceed with trial. Phillips suggested he wanted the court to appoint a public defender to represent him. Plaintiff-appellee, State of Ohio, opposed the appointment of a new attorney from the public defender’s office, arguing that Phillips was only seeking to delay proceedings. The trial court indicated Attorney Basnett could be reappointed to represent Phillips, but he rejected that offer. The trial court then declined to appoint a new attorney for Phillips and
proceeded with jury selection. After the jury had been selected and discharged for the day, Phillips told the trial court the proceedings were unfair and prejudiced and stated, ""I might as well not even be here, Your Honor."" (May 29, 2018 Tr. at 25.)

---------------------
¶ 9 The following day, May 30, 2018, Phillips refused to appear for trial. The trial court's deputy indicated Phillips had been ill the previous evening and that morning. The trial court indicated that if Phillips did not appear, he would revoke the right to self-representation based on disruptive behavior and reappoint Attorney Basnett to represent Phillips. The trial court's deputy was dispatched to advise Phillips that if he did not come to court, the trial would proceed in his absence and Attorney Basnett would represent him. The deputy returned to court and indicated that Phillips was lying in his cell with blankets over his head and refused to come to court, insisting he was ill. The deputy did not know if a doctor had examined Phillips. The trial court then confirmed that Attorney Basnett was willing to proceed on behalf of Phillips and convened the jury. The court advised the jury that Phillips was voluntarily absent from court, but that his absence should not be held against him. The prosecutor and Attorney Basnett delivered opening statements and the prosecution presented five witnesses, with Attorney Basnett cross-examining each of the prosecution's witnesses. At the close of the state's evidence, Attorney Basnett moved for dismissal of the charges under Crim.R. 29. The trial court denied the motion for dismissal.

¶ 10 On May 31, 2018, Phillips appeared in the courtroom with Attorney Basnett. Phillips apologized for not appearing the previous day and advised the trial court he had genuinely been ill. Phillips elected not to testify, and Basnett delivered closing argument on behalf of Phillips. The jury found Phillips guilty of burglary, a felony of the second degree, in violation of R.C. 2911.12. On July 16, 2018, the trial court sentenced Phillips to two years imprisonment on the conviction.

II. Assignment of Error

The appellant's trial was tainted by structural error when the court violated Mr. Phillips' Sixth Amendment rights to self-representation and confrontation.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
936-Phillips,"No. The text describes Phillips' assertion that the trial court violated his rights to be present at the trial and represent himself, not that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 12} The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment provides certain protections for defendants in criminal proceedings:

In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.

The United States Supreme Court has held that the Sixth Amendment implicitly provides a criminal defendant the right to self-representation. *Faretta v. California*, 422 U.S. 806, 819 (1975) (""Although not stated in the [Sixth] Amendment in so many words, the right to self-representation -- to make one's own defense personally -- is thus necessarily implied by the structure of the Amendment.""). *See also State v. Gibson*, 45 Ohio St.2d 366 (1976), paragraph one of the syllabus (""The Sixth Amendment, as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, guarantees that a defendant in a state criminal trial has an independent constitutional right of self-representation and that he may proceed to defend himself without counsel when he voluntarily, and knowingly and intelligently elects to do so.""). The court has also recognized that ""[o]ne of the most basic rights guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause [of the Sixth Amendment] is the accused's right to be present in the courtroom at every stage of his trial."" *Illinois v. Allen*, 397 U.S. 337, 338 (1970).1 Phillips asserts the trial court violated his rights to be present at the trial and represent himself by

Williams*, 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 286 (1983) (""As the constitutional principle of 'due process' has evolved on both the state and federal levels, the courts have broadened its guarantees to mandate the presence of the defendant, absent waiver of his rights or other extraordinary circumstances, at every stage of his trial."").

B. Trial Error Versus Structural Error


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
936-Phillips,No. The text is describing the types of constitutional errors that can occur in a criminal proceeding and how they are reviewed. It does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Phillips argues the alleged violations of his Sixth Amendment rights constituted structural error requiring automatic reversal of his conviction. Constitutional errors occurring in a criminal proceeding can be divided into two categories: (1) ""trial errors,"" which are reviewable for harmless error, and (2) ""structural errors,"" which are per se reversible. State v. Fisher, 99 Ohio St.3d 127, 2003-Ohio-2761, ¶ 9, citing Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 306-12 (1991). Structural errors affect the framework of the trial process, rather than simply being an error in that process; as a result of structural error, ""'a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence, and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.' "" Fulminante at 310, quoting Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 577-78 (1986). Structural error subject to automatic reversal has only been found in a very limited class of cases. State v. Wilks, 154 Ohio St.3d 359, 2018-Ohio-1562, ¶ 133. The United States Supreme Court has recognized that denial of the right to self-representation at trial is structural error. McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168, 177 (1984), fn.8 (""Since the right of self-representation is a right that when exercised usually increases the likelihood of a trial outcome unfavorable to the defendant, its denial is not amenable to 'harmless error' analysis. The right is either respected or denied; its deprivation cannot be harmless.""). By contrast, the court has also held that violations of the Confrontation Clause are subject to harmless-error review. See Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986) (""[W]e hold that the constitutionally improper denial of a defendant's opportunity to impeach a witness for bias, like other Confrontation Clause errors, is subject to Chapman [v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967)] harmless-error analysis.""). See also State v. Scott, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-1144, 2006-Ohio-4981, ¶ 11 fn. 4 (""Where preserved by objection, review of Confrontation Clause claims is for harmless error. Confrontation Clause claims not preserved by objection are reviewed for plain error under comparable Fed.R.Crim.P. 52.""). (Citations omitted.)

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
936-Phillips,"No. The text describes an assignment of error by the defendant, not the prosecutor. The defendant is arguing that the trial court erred in continuing the trial without him being present, not that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
C. Continuation of Trial in Phillips's Absence

In addition to the right to be present provided under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution states that
""[i]n any trial, in any court, the party accused shall be allowed to appear and defend in person and with counsel."" Crim.R. 43(A)(1) provides that ""[e]xcept as provided in Rule 10 of these rules and division (A)(2) of this rule, the defendant must be physically present at every stage of the criminal proceeding and trial."" Crim.R. 43(B) specifies that a defendant may be excluded from trial due to disruptive conduct when ""the hearing or trial cannot reasonably be conducted with the defendant's continued physical presence."" Crim.R. 43(A)(1) also provides that ""the defendant's voluntary absence after the trial has been commenced in the defendant's presence shall not prevent continuing the trial to and including the verdict."" As explained above, we review violations of the Confrontation Clause under the harmless error standard. Crim.R. 52(A) defines the doctrine of harmless error in criminal cases and provides that ""[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.""

¶ 15 Phillips argues there was no basis for excluding him from the courtroom for disruptive behavior under Crim.R. 43(B) because he had not engaged in disruptive behavior in front of the jury. The record indicates that Phillips was not excluded from the courtroom due to disruptive behavior. As discussed more fully below, the trial court revoked Phillips's right to self-representation due to a finding of disruptive behavior, but that was not the reason the trial continued without him being present. Rather, the court concluded that Phillips was voluntarily absent because he refused to come to court and advised the jury not to hold Phillips's absence against him. On appeal, Phillips argues the trial court erred by not taking further steps to investigate the validity of his illness that prevented him from attending the second day of trial or granting a one-day continuance to see if Phillips could attend trial the following day.

Answer:"
936-Phillips,"No. The text is describing the trial court's findings and the defendant's actions, not alleging any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 16 Whether a defendant's absence from trial is voluntary is an issue of fact and we are bound to accept a trial court's findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. State v. Dennis, 10th Dist. No. 04AP-595, 2005-Ohio-1530, ¶ 12. In this case, the trial court's deputy was advised that Phillips had been ill throughout the night of May 29th and refused to go to court on the morning of May 30th. The deputy visited Phillips in jail and reported back that Phillips was lying in his cell with blankets over his head and refused to sit up and talk to the deputy. When advised the trial would continue in his absence with Attorney Basnett representing him, Phillips refused to go to the
courtroom, insisting he was ill. The trial court noted that Phillips had previously feigned a medical condition during the October 2017 proceedings and concluded it was necessary to proceed with the trial despite Phillips’s voluntary absence.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
936-Phillips,"No. The text describes an error by the trial court, not the prosecutor. The error is related to the court's handling of the defendant's mental state and the granting of a continuance.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 17 Phillips argues the court should have done more to investigate the genuineness of his illness or should have granted a one-day continuance to permit him to attend trial, citing an Eighth District Court of Appeals decision holding that a trial court erred by failing to conduct a thorough investigation of a defendant’s mental state and grant a one-day continuance when the defendant refused to appear after trial had begun. State v. Sinclair, 8th Dist. No. 85235, 2005-Ohio-6011. In Sinclair, before the trial began the defendant, Sinclair, took an overdose of antidepression medication. This left him so drowsy and incapacitated that he was unable to assist his counsel during jury selection. Sinclair’s counsel advised the court that Sinclair was not making clear decisions. The following day, Sinclair refused to come to the courtroom from the county jail. The trial court was advised Sinclair had been placed on suicide watch due to the medication overdose. The court ordered Sinclair’s medical records, which showed that he was demonstrating bizarre behavior and had expressed suicidal thoughts. Sinclair at ¶ 14-18. On appeal, the Eighth District concluded the trial court erred by not conducting a more thorough investigation of Sinclair’s illness and that “failure to grant even a one-day continuance demonstrates an additional lack of prudence on the part of the trial court.” Id. at ¶ 19.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
936-Phillips,"No. The text is describing an assignment of error related to the trial court's decision to continue the trial in the defendant's absence, not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 18 The circumstances in the present case are substantially different from those in Sinclair. Although Phillips was reported to have been throwing up on the evening of May 29th, there was no indication his condition was as severe as that of the defendant in Sinclair. Moreover, there was evidence to suggest that even if Phillips was genuinely ill, he may have been relying on that illness as an excuse to be voluntarily absent from trial. Phillips had previously reported a medical incident in October 2017, but when examined by the emergency squad there were no signs of genuine distress. That incident resulted in a delay in the proceedings. Further, near the end of the first day of trial on May 29th, Phillips complained that the proceedings were unfair to him and stated, “I might as well not even be here, Your Honor.” (May 29, 2018 Tr. at 25). Under these circumstances, we conclude the trial court did not err by continuing the trial in Phillips’s absence on May 30th.
D. Revocation of Right to Self-Representation

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
936-Phillips,"No. The text is discussing the defendant's right to self-representation and the circumstances under which a judge may terminate self-representation due to misconduct by the defendant, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 19} As explained above, a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to self-representation. *Faretta* at 819; *State v. Keenan*, 81 Ohio St.3d 133, 138 (1998). However, the right to self-representation is not absolute. In the same decision acknowledging the implied right to self-representation present under the Sixth Amendment, the United States Supreme Court noted that ""the trial judge may terminate self-representation by a defendant who deliberately engages in serious and obstructionist misconduct."" *Faretta* at 834, fn. 46. ""The right of self-representation is not a license to abuse the dignity of the courtroom. Neither is it a license not to comply with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law."" *Id.* See also *Martinez v. Court of Appeal*, 528 U.S. 152, 162 (2000) (""Even at the trial level, therefore, the government's interest in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the trial at times outweighs the defendant's interest in acting as his own lawyer.""); *State v. Willis*, 10th Dist. No. 08AP-536, 2009-Ohio-325, ¶ 7 (holding that right to self-representation recognized under *Faretta* is not absolute and unconditional). Further, the *Faretta* court held that ""a State may -- even over objection by the accused -- appoint a 'standby counsel' to aid the accused if and when the accused requests help, and to be available to represent the accused in the event that termination of the defendant's self-representation is necessary."" *Faretta* at 834, fn. 46.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
936-Phillips,"No. The text describes the defendant's disruptive behavior and the court's response to it, not any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 20} The First District Court of Appeals has held that ""when a defendant elects to represent himself at trial in a criminal proceeding, and that defendant's conduct, following a warning to desist, is so disruptive that it threatens the integrity and efficacy of the trial, he has forfeited his right to self-representation."" *State v. Mizell*, 1st Dist. No. C-070750, 2008-Ohio-4907, ¶ 31. In that case, the defendant, Mizell, who was representing himself at trial and had appointed standby counsel, engaged in outbursts during the prosecutor's examination of a witness which prevented the prosecutor from hearing the witness's responses. Mizell was warned that he would be removed from the courtroom if such behavior continued. When he continued to disrupt the proceedings, the trial court ordered Mizell removed from the courtroom and had standby counsel take over representing him until he could return and resume self-representation. *Id.* at ¶ 32. On appeal, the First District Court of Appeals held the trial court did not abuse its discretion by removing Mizell from the courtroom and ordering standby counsel to represent him, thereby effectively
revoking his right to self-representation for part of the proceedings, because Mizell's ""continued disruptive behavior threatened to undermine the integrity and efficacy of the trial."" *Id.*

Answer:"
936-Phillips,"No. The text describes the actions of the defendant, Cedeno, and the trial court's response to his behavior, not the actions of the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 21} Similarly, the Eighth District Court of Appeals held that a trial court did not abuse its discretion by revoking a defendant's right to self-representation where the defendant engaged in ""obstructionist behaviors, delay tactics, and deliberate manipulations."" *State v. Cedeno*, 8th Dist. No. 102327, 2015-Ohio-5412, ¶ 34. The defendant in that case, Cedeno, notified the trial court on the day trial was scheduled to begin that he did not consent to trial and wanted a new attorney. Although the trial court believed this was a stalling tactic, it appointed new counsel and continued the matter for pretrial. *Id.* at ¶ 7. Subsequently, at a pretrial hearing, Cedeno rejected the second attorney and indicated he wanted to represent himself, and continued to insist that he did not consent to trial. The court granted Cedeno's request to represent himself. *Id.* at ¶ 8. At another pretrial hearing, Cedeno refused to accept discovery from the prosecution. Due to Cedeno's behavior, the trial court ordered an evaluation to determine whether he was competent to waive his right to counsel and stand trial. *Id.* at ¶ 9. Although the competency evaluations determined that Cedeno was competent to stand trial, the trial court concluded he did not understand the charges against him or the basic elements necessary to defend against those charges. Therefore, the trial court revoked the right of self-representation and appointed counsel for Cedeno. *Id.* at ¶ 18-21.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
936-Phillips,"No. The text describes the actions of the defendant, Cedeno, and the trial court's decision to revoke his right to self-representation due to his obstruction and manipulation of the proceedings. It does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor or the state.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 22} On appeal, the Eighth District Court of Appeals held the trial court did not abuse its discretion by revoking Cedeno's right to self-representation, finding that Cedeno's pattern of delay and manipulation began on the day the case was originally scheduled for trial, when he denied consent to go to trial and requested another attorney. His obstruction continued when he refused to accept discovery from the state but later demanded discovery and complained that the state would not provide it. *Id.* at ¶ 32-33. The appellate court found that ""[i]t was readily apparent that Cedeno would not cooperate in the proceedings, even when the matter was helpful to Cedeno or was a ruling in his favor."" *Id.* at ¶ 34. Thus, the court concluded that by revoking the right to self-representation, the trial court was attempting to protect all parties and the integrity of the proceedings. *Id.* at ¶ 34.
This court has also affirmed a trial court's revocation of a defendant's right to self-representation where the defendant pursued a defense strategy that was wholly irrelevant to the crimes charged against him. *State v. Timson*, 10th Dist. No. 87AP-1212 (May 25, 1989). In that case, the court found that despite repeated requests by the trial court that he restrict his pretrial motions and defense strategy to the crimes charged, Timson persisted in attempting to obtain witnesses and introduce evidence that were completely irrelevant to those charges. The court found that this persistent conduct demonstrated an inability to competently defend himself and held that ""[r]egardless of defendant's good faith or bad faith in pursuing his defense, a defense which is substantially irrelevant to the offenses charged, when conducted over the trial court's admonitions, is evidence of a *pro se* litigant's inability to represent himself at the trial on those charges."" *Id.*

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
936-Phillips,No. The error is not alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is related to the trial court's decision to revoke Phillips's right to self-representation.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
A trial court should not lightly withdraw the right to self-representation once a criminal defendant has validly invoked it. In the present case, Phillips did not act disruptively in the courtroom in the presence of the jury. However, the record supports a conclusion that he engaged in a pattern of disruptive tactics that appear to have been intended to delay or derail the trial process. He sought to discharge his first appointed counsel and represent himself on the day his trial was set to begin. Later that same day, he complained of a medical issue, but the emergency workers who attended to him indicated he was not in genuine distress. The competency evaluations the trial court ordered suggested Phillips exaggerated his mental health issues when confronted with the reality of his legal predicament. Throughout the proceedings, including at times when he was represented by counsel, Phillips engaged in voluminous *pro se* motion practice, filing multiple redundant motions. In the entry granting Phillips's request for self-representation, the trial court notified him that disruptive behavior could result in termination of the right to self-representation. When the rescheduled trial date arrived, Phillips indicated he was not prepared to proceed and suggested he wanted a public defender appointed to represent him. At the close of the first day of trial, he indicated to the trial court that he believed his presence was not necessary.

On the day Phillips refused to appear for trial, the court dispatched the deputy to advise Phillips that if he did not come to court, the court would appoint Attorney Basnett
to represent him; still, Phillips refused to come to court. Given this record, when Phillips claimed he was ill and refused to come to court for the second day of trial it was reasonable for the trial court to conclude that this was a continuation of his pattern of delay and obstruction. Moreover, upon returning for the third day of trial, Phillips did not object to the fact that Attorney Basnett had been reappointed to represent him and he permitted Attorney Basnett to continue representing him by delivering closing argument. While we acknowledge the importance of the right to self-representation, under these circumstances we conclude the trial court did not err by revoking Phillips's right to self-representation.

¶ 26 Accordingly, because we conclude the trial court did not err by terminating Phillips's right to self-representation and continuing the trial in his absence on May 30, 2018, we overrule Phillips's sole assignment of error.

I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

¶ 2 On January 27, 2014, Myers and codefendant, Timothy Mosley, began to plot burglarizing the home of a known drug dealer or the home of Justin Back, Myers’ childhood friend. Mark Cates, Back's stepfather, purportedly had a safe containing a firearm and money. Ultimately, Myers and Mosley chose to burglarize the Cates' home. The two men drove to the Cates' home. Upon knocking, they were surprised when Back answered the door. The two men briefly visited with Back and then left. Upon leaving the Cates' home, Myers suggested they return to the home, kill Back, and steal the contents of the safe. Myers and Mosley began to plan Back's murder.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes the actions of Myers and Mosley, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 3 They initially planned to kill Back by injecting him with cold medicine. In furtherance of their plan, they attempted to purchase cold medicine and a bottle of poisonous ""bug wash""; however, Myers' credit card was declined. Later that day, Myers and Mosley returned to the Cates' home and watched a movie with Back. When Cates came home from work, he joined them in watching the movie for a short time until he and Back had to leave for an appointment with a Navy recruiter. Myers and Mosley then left the house.

¶ 4 Myers and Mosley continued to discuss how to murder Back and burglarize the Cates' home. As they discussed their plans, Mosley wrote down their ideas in a small notebook. The two men hatched a scheme to strangle Back with a wire, take the safe, and make it look as though Back had stolen the safe and run away from home. The two men further planned to dump Back's body in a remote wooded area. Myers and Mosley purchased galvanized steel cable and two metal rope cleats to fashion a garrote. The garrote was put together by their friend Logan Zennie.

¶ 5 The next morning, January 28, 2014, Myers and Mosley bought ammonia, septic-tank cleaner, and rubber gloves. They believed the septic enzymes would help to
decompose the body in cold weather. Around 1:00 p.m., the two men went to the Cates' home. Mosley was carrying the garrote as well as a five- or six-inch pocketknife. The plan was for Myers to distract Back while Mosley came up behind him. Myers would hold Back down while Mosley would choke him to death with the garrote. After the two men arrived at the Cates' home, Back offered them a drink which Myers accepted. As Back was reaching into the refrigerator, Mosley came up behind him and tried to pull the garrote around his throat. However, the garrote only looped around Back's chin. Mosley panicked and as Myers restrained Back, Mosley repeatedly stabbed him with his knife. As Back begged for his life, Myers simply told him it would be over soon.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error or any allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor. It provides a summary of the events leading up to the murder, the indictments, the plea agreement, and the trial of Myers.","Context information is below.
---------------------
After the murder, Myers and Mosley wrapped Back's body in a blanket, cleaned up the crime scene, and found the safe. Myers also found a handgun belonging to Cates, which he loaded. The two men shoved Back's body into the trunk of Mosley's car and left the house with the safe and various other stolen items. They stopped at Mosley's home where they cleaned up and changed clothes. They eventually dumped Back's body behind a log in a field in Preble County. Myers poured ammonia and septic enzymes onto Back's body. Myers then shot the body twice with the stolen handgun before it jammed. Myers and Mosley were later apprehended; Back's body was discovered on January 29, 2014. An autopsy determined that Back had died of multiple stab wounds. At the time of the murder, Myers and Mosley were both 19 years old.

Myers was indicted in February 2014 on one count of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design and one count of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B). Both counts were accompanied by three death-penalty specifications. Myers was further indicted for aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, grand theft of a firearm, and abuse of a corpse, all with an accompanying firearm specification, and kidnapping, tampering with evidence, and safecracking. Mosley was indicted on similar charges.
However, a week before Myers' jury trial, Mosley reached a plea agreement in which he agreed to testify against Myers. Mosley pled guilty to all charges in exchange for the dismissal of the death-penalty specifications; he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

¶ 8 The guilt phase of Myers' jury trial commenced on September 22, 2014. On October 2, 2014, the jury found Myers guilty on all counts and specifications. The two aggravated-murder counts were merged for purposes of sentencing; the state elected to proceed on the prior-calculation-and-design aggravated murder count with the aggravated-robbery specification.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it describes the process of Myers' postconviction relief petition and the legal proceedings that followed.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 9 The penalty phase of the jury trial was held on October 6, 2014. Myers presented the testimony of his parents and a sibling and made an unsworn statement by way of mitigation. Myers had no prior criminal history or delinquency adjudications. The jury recommended a death sentence. On October 16, 2014, the trial court sentenced Myers to death and imposed prison sentences on the noncapital counts. Myers' conviction and death sentence were subsequently upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court. State v. Myers, 154 Ohio St.3d 405, 2018-Ohio-1903.

¶ 10 On November 10, 2016, while his appeal was pending before the supreme court, Myers filed a petition for postconviction relief (""PCR petition""), raising 60 grounds for relief. The PCR petition challenged the constitutionality of the death penalty and the Ohio statutes governing its imposition, argued that Myers was denied the effective assistance of counsel during both the guilt and penalty phases of the trial, and alleged violation of Myers' due process rights. On November 18, 2016, Myers moved for leave to conduct discovery in support of his PCR petition. In 2017, the state filed an answer to the PCR petition, then moved for summary judgment. In January 2018, the trial court issued a scheduling order which provided that Myers could file a supplemental motion for discovery by March 1, 2018,
and that the state's summary judgment motion would be held in abeyance pending resolution of Myers' discovery motion.

371-Myers,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The assignments of error are related to the trial court's denial of Myers' PCR petition and discovery motions, not any alleged misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 11 On March 1, 2018, Myers filed a supplemental motion for discovery, arguing he was entitled to conduct discovery in support of his PCR petition pursuant to newly-amended R.C. 2953.21, which became effective on April 6, 2017. The amended statute makes substantial changes regarding PCR petitions in death-penalty cases, and in particular, allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery in aid of their PCR petition if good cause is shown. State v. Ketterer, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2016-08-166, 2017-Ohio-4117, ¶ 46.

¶ 12 On July 3, 2018, the trial court denied Myers' discovery motions. The trial court found that amended R.C. 2953.21 was not applicable in the case at bar because the statute did not explicitly state it was retroactive. Alternatively, the trial court found that even if the statutory amendment was applied retroactively, Myers was not entitled to discovery as he had not demonstrated ""good cause.""

¶ 13 On November 26, 2018, Myers filed a memorandum opposing the state's motion for summary judgment; the memorandum included 12 additional documents consisting of affidavits, transcripts, and documentary evidence. Myers' memorandum and supplemental appendix triggered additional pleadings from the parties. Ultimately, the trial court never ruled upon the state's summary judgment motion. Instead, on June 27, 2019, the trial court denied Myers' PCR petition without a hearing. The trial court found that Myers' claims were either barred by res judicata or failed to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, and therefore, ""no evidentiary hearing [was] required.""

¶ 14 Myers now appeals the trial court's denial of his PCR petition and discovery motions, raising 11 assignments of error.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text describes the process and requirements for a postconviction proceeding (PCR petition) and does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 15} A postconviction proceeding is a collateral civil attack on a criminal judgment, not an appeal of a criminal conviction. State v. Dillingham, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2012-02-037 and CA2012-02-042, 2012-Ohio-5841, ¶ 8. To prevail on a PCR petition, the petitioner must establish a violation of his constitutional rights that renders the judgment of conviction void or voidable. R.C. 2953.21. A PCR petition does not provide a petitioner a second opportunity to litigate his or her conviction, nor is the petitioner automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing. State v. Rose, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-03-050, 2012-Ohio-5957, ¶ 16. A trial court properly denies a PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing if the supporting affidavits, the documentary evidence, the files, and the records of the case do not demonstrate that the petitioner set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief. State v. Blankenburg, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-04-088, 2012-Ohio-6175, ¶ 9; R.C. 2953.21.

{¶ 16} ""It is well established that a trial court may dismiss a postconviction relief petition on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata."" State v. Davis, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-12-258, 2013-Ohio-3878, ¶ 30. Under res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment or conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment. State v. Wagers, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2011-08-007, 2012-Ohio-2258, ¶ 10, citing State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 1996-Ohio-337, syllabus.

---------------------
{¶ 17} The presentation of competent, relevant, and material evidence outside the record may defeat the application of res judicata. State v. Lawson, 103 Ohio App.3d 307,
315 (12th Dist.1995). The evidence submitted with the petition cannot be merely cumulative of or alternative to evidence presented at trial. *State v. Jackson*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104132, 2017-Ohio-2651, ¶ 16. To overcome the res judicata bar, evidence outside the record must demonstrate that the petitioner could not have appealed the constitutional claim based upon information in the original record. *State v. Piesciuk*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-01-011, 2013-Ohio-3879, ¶ 18. If evidence outside the record is ""'marginally significant and does not advance the petitioner's claim beyond a mere hypothesis and a desire for further discovery,' res judicata still applies to the claim."" *State v. Cowans*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA98-10-090, 1999 Ohio App. LEXIS 4157, *8-9 (Sept. 7, 1999).

Clermont No. CA2014-01-014, 2014-Ohio-2895, ¶ 16. ""The term 'abuse of discretion' connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court's attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable."" *State v. Thornton*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-09-063, 2013-Ohio-2394, ¶ 34; *State v. Hancock*, 108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, ¶ 130. The trial court does not abuse its discretion in dismissing a PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing if (1) the petitioner fails to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, or (2) the operation of res judicata prohibits the claims made in the petition. *State v. Maxwell*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107758, 2020-Ohio-3027, ¶ 25.

{¶ 21} THE TRIAL COURT DENIED MYERS' RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS, ACCESS TO THE OHIO COURTS, AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, AND
VIOLATED R.C. § 2953.21, WHEN IT TREATED THE STATE'S POST-ANSWER ""MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT"" AS A MOTION SEEKING SUMMARILY DISMISSAL (sic) UNDER R.C. § 2953.21(C) [NOW (D)], AND FAILED TO APPLY THE REQUISITE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARDS IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING EVERY CLAIM SET FORTH IN MYERS' PCR PETITION.

¶ 22 This assignment of error challenges the trial court's failure to rule upon the state's summary judgment motion and the court's election instead to grant a summary dismissal of Myers' PCR petition. Specifically, Myers argues that the trial court erred in granting a summary dismissal of his PCR petition where there was a pending, fully briefed motion for summary judgment. Myers asserts that because the state filed an answer to the PCR petition and a motion for summary judgment and failed to move for dismissal of the petition under R.C. 2953.21(D), the trial court was required to apply the standard set forth in R.C. 2953.21(E) and was precluded from summarily dismissing the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D).¹

¶ 26 We find that the trial court did not err in granting a summary dismissal of Myers' PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D) notwithstanding the state's motion for summary judgment and its failure to move for dismissal of the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D). We have held that R.C. 2953.21(D) ""explicitly requires the trial court to look beyond the petition and examine the record in order to determine whether there are substantive grounds for relief. The trial court must independently review the record and address the substance of a petitioner's claims regardless of whether the state responds to his petition for postconviction relief."" *State v. Wallen*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA97-02-017, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 3647, *4 (Aug. 11, 1997). See also *State v. Hartman*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27162, 2017-Ohio-7933 (a trial court has an independent duty to analyze a PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21[D]); *State v. McCabe*, 4th Dist. Washington No. 97CA32, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 4487 (Sept. 14, 1998) (it is well settled that, regardless of whether or not the state responds to a petition for postconviction relief, R.C. 2953.21[D] requires the trial court
to sua sponte analyze the petition). Thus, the trial court was required to independently determine whether there were substantive grounds for relief and the pendency of the state's motion for summary judgment did not preclude the trial court from summarily dismissing the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D). See State v. McKelton, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-02-028, 2015-Ohio-4228; State v. Noling, 11th Dist. Portage No. 98-P-0049, 2003-Ohio-5008.

---------------------
¶ 27 In his reply brief Myers argues for the first time that the trial court's summary dismissal of the PCR petition without prior notice to the parties violated the notice requirement of procedural due process. However, it is well established that an appellant may not raise new issues or assignments of error in a reply brief. State v. Renfro, 12th Dist.

A reply brief simply provides the appellant with an opportunity to respond to the arguments raised in the appellee's brief. State v. Quaterman, 140 Ohio St.3d 464, 2014-Ohio-4034, ¶ 18. Myers' argument is not appropriately before the court and will not be considered.

At any time in conjunction with the filing of a petition for postconviction relief under division (A) of this section by a person who has been sentenced to death, or with the litigation of a petition so filed, the court, for good cause shown, may authorize the petitioner in seeking the postconviction relief and the prosecuting attorney of the county served by the court in defending the proceeding, to take depositions and to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in accordance with divisions (A)(1)(d), (A)(1)(e), and (C) of this section, and to any other form of discovery as in a civil action that the court in its discretion permits. The court may limit the extent of discovery under this division. In addition to discovery that is relevant to the claim and was available under Criminal Rule 16 through conclusion of the original criminal trial, the court, for good cause shown, may authorize the petitioner or prosecuting attorney to take depositions and issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in either of the following circumstances:

(i) For any witness who testified at trial or who was disclosed by the state prior to trial, except as otherwise provided in this division, the petitioner or prosecuting attorney shows clear and convincing evidence that the witness is material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to substantiate or refute the petitioner's claim that there is a reasonable probability of an altered verdict. This division does not apply if the witness was unavailable for trial or would not voluntarily be interviewed by the defendant or prosecuting attorney.

(ii) For any witness with respect to whom division (A)(1)(d)(i) of this section does not apply, the petitioner or prosecuting attorney shows good cause that the witness is material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to substantiate or refute the petitioner's claim that there is a reasonable probability of an altered verdict.

expressly declared to be retroactive. R.C. 1.48. Additionally, Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, prohibits the General Assembly from passing retroactive laws. Applying these two provisions, the Supreme Court of Ohio has established a two-part test to determine whether a statute may be applied retroactively. *Consilio*.

{¶ 38} Under this test, a reviewing court must first determine as a threshold matter whether the statute is expressly made retroactive. *Consilio*, 2007-Ohio-4163 at ¶ 10. ""The General Assembly's failure to clearly enunciate retroactivity ends the analysis and the relevant statute may be applied only prospectively."" *Id.* If, however, the General Assembly expressly indicated its intention that the statute apply retroactively, the reviewing court must then move to the second step of the analysis and ""determine whether the statute is remedial, in which case retroactive application is permitted, or substantive, in which case retroactive application is forbidden."" *State v. White*, 132 Ohio St.3d 344, 2012-Ohio-2583, ¶ 27.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing a legal argument regarding the application of a statute to a pending PCR petition, not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 39} As the trial court properly found, R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) as amended does not explicitly state it is to be applied retroactively. ""A statute must clearly proclaim its own retroactivity to overcome the presumption of prospective application. Retroactivity is not to be inferred."" *Consilio* at ¶ 15. ""If the retroactivity of a statute is not expressly stated in plain terms, the presumption in favor of prospective application controls. Moreover, the General Assembly is presumed to know that it must include expressly retroactive language to create that effect, and it has done so in the past."" *Id.* Because amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) does not expressly mention retroactivity, we find that the statute applies prospectively and we need not determine whether the statute is remedial or substantive under the second prong of the test.

{¶ 40} We further find that by its plain terms the statute applies prospectively to pending PCR petitions in that it allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery, for good cause
shown, ""at any time in conjunction with the filing of a [PCR petition], or with the litigation of a petition so filed[.]"" (Emphasis added.) In the case at bar, amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) was not yet in effect when Myers filed his PCR petition. However, the PCR petition was still being litigated on April 6, 2017, when the amended statute became effective. Amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d), therefore, applies to Myers' PCR petition. See Gloff, 2020-Ohio-3143.

¶ 41 The statute requires that the petitioner demonstrate ""good cause"" as a prerequisite for a trial court to allow discovery. As stated above, the trial court alternatively found that Myers failed to show ""good cause.""

---------------------
¶ 42 ""Good cause"" is not defined by the statute. Consequently, the trial court adopted the definition applied in federal habeas corpus proceedings, to wit, good cause exists ""where specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is * * * entitled to relief, it is the duty of the courts to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry."" Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 908-909, 117 S.Ct. 1793 (1997). ""Conversely, where a petitioner would not be entitled to relief on a particular claim, regardless of what facts he developed, he cannot show good cause for discovery on that claim."" Murphy v. Bradshaw, S.D.Ohio No. C-1-03-053, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15978, *2 (Sept. 13, 2003).

---------------------
¶ 43 Before determining whether a petitioner is entitled to discovery under ""good cause,"" the court must first identify the essential elements of the claim on which discovery is sought. Bracy at 904. The burden of demonstrating the materiality of the information requested is on the moving party. Stanford v. Parker, 266 F.3d 442, 460 (6th Cir.2001). Discovery may be allowed where the petitioner's claims are ""neither patently frivolous nor palpably incredible"" and where ""the discovery he requests is specific, limited, and reasonably calculated to lead to evidence in support of his claim[.]"" Hill v. Mitchell, S.D.Ohio
No. 1:98-cv-452, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71975, *31-32 (Sept. 27, 2007). A petitioner is not entitled to go on a fishing expedition based on conclusory allegations. *Id.* at *5; *Williams v. Bagley*, 380 F.3d 932, 974 (6th Cir.2004). ""Even in a death penalty case, 'bald assertions and conclusory allegations do not provide sufficient ground to warrant requiring the state to respond to discovery or to require an evidentiary hearing.'"" *Stanford* at 460. Rather, the petitioner must set forth specific allegations of fact. *Williams* at 974.

¶ 44 Myers argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery because he demonstrated ""good cause"" or, alternatively, set forth operative facts outside the record that revealed constitutional errors. Myers further argues that the trial court misapplied the *Bracy* good cause standard by essentially requiring him to prove his claims as a prerequisite to discovery.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes Myers' claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial, not misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 45 Myers' discovery motions were broad overall, seeking a wide range of information, records, and depositions of individuals, some of whom were identified only by category. The trial court broke down Myers' discovery requests into nine general categories of inquiry: (1) records in the custody of the Warren County Children's Services, the Warren County Department of Job and Family Services, and the Warren County Juvenile Court regarding Myers' family, (2) Myers' records from the Warren County Jail, (3) grand jury proceedings, (4) Mosley's institutional records, (5) records of the prosecutor's office and several law enforcement agencies relating to their investigation of Back's death and the arrest of Myers and Mosley, (6) depositions of law enforcement officers, (7) depositions of the jurors, (8) depositions of the attorneys on the prosecution team, and (9) depositions of the defense team.

¶ 46 Myers' first motion for discovery did not identify how his discovery requests related to his postconviction claims. By contrast, the supplemental motion for discovery argued that Myers was entitled to conduct discovery on (1) his claims of ineffective
assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial, (2) his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial, and (3) his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for an offender who was still a teenager at the time of the offense. In his brief, Myers argues the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery on the foregoing claims. We will address the trial court's denial of Myers' discovery motions concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial in conjunction with Myers' fifth assignment of error.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error related to the trial court's decision to deny Myers' motions for discovery, not alleging any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 47 Myers first argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery regarding his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for a 19-year-old offender at the time of the offense. In support of these constitutional challenges, Myers sought discovery of (1) the Warren County's training and instructional materials for judges, prosecutors, and sheriff deputies concerning behavioral characteristics and brain development of juveniles, adolescents, and late-adolescents (18-21 years old) offenders, and (2) Warren County's data concerning the prosecution of such juvenile, adolescent, and late-adolescent offenders for the previous seven years.

¶ 48 We find that Myers' requested discovery falls more into the category of a fishing expedition. Furthermore, as we discuss in the fourth assignment of error, Myers' claims are barred by res judicata and fail to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, given the election of the United States Supreme Court and Ohio Supreme Court not to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of 18 at the time of the crime. ""[W]here a petitioner would not be entitled to relief on a particular claim, regardless of what facts he developed, he cannot show good cause for discovery on that claim."" Murphy, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15978 at *2. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying Myers' motions for discovery regarding his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for a 19-year-old
offender at the time of the offense.

---------------------
¶ 49 Myers next argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial. Counsel's alleged ineffective assistance included the failure to (1) pursue a youth-based defense theory, (2) hire a fact investigator, (3) fully cross-examine Mosley, (4) cross-examine a sergeant and a detective regarding their failure to follow police procedure manuals, (5) present the testimony of a crime scene expert, (6) present the testimony of a police procedure expert to challenge Miranda issues, (7) present the testimony of an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his Miranda rights, (8) achieve a change of venue, and (9) challenge the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook. As we discuss in the sixth assignment of error, Myers' claims regarding the testimony of a police procedure expert to challenge Miranda issues, change of venue, and the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook are barred by res judicata as they could have been raised on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. As we further discuss in the sixth assignment of error, Myers' other claims fail to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief. Murphy at *2. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying Myers' motions for discovery concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial.

¶ 50 To that extent, Myers' second and third assignments of error are overruled.

¶ 52 THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT FOUND PROCEDURALLY BARRED MYERS' CLAIMS CHALLENGING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY, PROPRIETY, AND/OR PROPORTIONALITY OF A DEATH SENTENCE FOR AN OFFENDER, LIKE MYERS, WHO WAS STILL A TEENAGER AT THE TIME OF HIS OFFENSE (GROUNDS
5, 8, 9, 46, 47, 48), AND IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING SUCH CLAIMS UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.

¶ 53 Myers argues that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 5, 8, 9, 46, 47, and 48 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged the constitutionality, propriety, and/or proportionality of a death sentence for an offender, like Myers, who was a teenager at the time of the offense. In this assignment of error, Myers details the scientific research on adolescent brain development, references various cases acknowledging that young adults under the age of 21 share many of the characteristics of late-age adolescents, and argues that the imposition of a death sentence upon a teenage offender, such as him, is an unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. Myers asserts that a cut-off of age 18 for imposing a death penalty is arbitrary. Myers further asserts his death sentence is unconstitutionally disproportionate to the life sentence Mosley received.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes arguments made by the defense (Grounds 5, 8, 9, 46, 47, 48) against the death sentence, not allegations of misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 54 Ground 5 argues that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), Ohio's felony-murder statute, is unconstitutional because it fails to adequately account for youth in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Ground 8 argues that the death sentence was disproportionate compared to Mosley and others convicted of similar crimes in violation of Myers' Eighth Amendment rights. Ground 9 argues that Myers' death sentence was void because the trial court failed to consider the R.C. 2929.11 purposes of felony sentencing when determining the appropriateness of the death sentence on the capital specifications. Ground 46 argues that Myers' Eighth Amendment rights were violated because the trial court failed to accord his youth the mitigating value it deserved. Ground 47 argues that the death penalty was a disproportionate punishment for Myers given his youth and other individual characteristics. Ground 48 argues that the death penalty is per se unconstitutional for a youthful offender convicted of committing a crime prior to turning 21 years old.
The trial court dismissed Grounds 8 and 9, finding that both arguments were raised in Myers' direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, were addressed by the supreme court, and were therefore barred by res judicata. The trial court further dismissed Grounds 5 and 46 through 48 as follows:

The Ohio Supreme Court has already addressed whether the sentence of death for Myers based on his age is a violation of the Eighth Amendment and found that it is not a violation of his constitutional rights. Therefore, this argument is barred by res judicata.

---------------------
Further, the Supreme Court of the United States has addressed the age of youthful offenders in a number of contexts and has not chosen to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of eighteen at the time of the crime. [Myers] has submitted evidence related to the development in brain science, however, the Ohio Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court have considered these new developments and similar arguments to the ones set forth by [Myers]. The United States Supreme Court acknowledged that individuals over eighteen may still exhibit signs of a juvenile but also found that since eighteen is the line society draws for many purposes between childhood and adulthood, that was the age that the line for death penalty ought to rest. *Roper v. Simmons*, 543 U.S. 551, 574, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 1197-98 (2005).

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes the dismissal of various claims by the trial court and the supreme court, but it does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
We find that the trial court properly dismissed Grounds 5, 8, 9, and 46 through 48. On direct appeal to the supreme court, Myers argued that the death sentence violated the Eighth Amendment proscription of cruel and unusual punishment, given recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court and a growing body of new developments in brain science indicating that age 18 is not the proper cut-off point for the death penalty. Myers further argued that his death sentence was comparatively disproportionate to the life sentence Mosley received and that he should not have been sentenced to death because he was a 19-year-old immature adolescent with mental and youth-related behavioral issues when he committed his crimes. The supreme court addressed and rejected these claims. *Myers*, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 173-176. They are therefore barred by res judicata.
Myers’ other claims were properly dismissed by the trial court as failing to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, given the election of the United States Supreme Court and Ohio Supreme Court not to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of 18 at the time of the crime. Myers notes that while his direct appeal made a brief reference to the newer brain science, it did not make the constitutional claim for a *Roper*-extension that his PRC petition makes. See *Myers* at ¶ 176 (""Although Myers argues that new developments in brain science indicate that age 18 is not the 'proper cut off point for the death penalty,' he does not propose that the categorical exclusion for those under age 18 be extended to 19-year-olds""). However, such constitutional argument was recently addressed and rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court in *State v. Graham*, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-6700.

---------------------
Graham, who turned 19 years old the month before he committed his crimes and who was sentenced to death, argued that imposing a death sentence on a capital defendant who was under the age of 21 at the time of the crime violated the Eighth Amendment. Extrapolating from the United States Supreme Court’s *Roper* decision, Graham argued that it was possible the Supreme Court could extend *Roper* to find that a defendant who turned 19 the month before committing the offense is constitutionally barred from receiving a death sentence. The Ohio Supreme Court squarely rejected the argument: ""[B]ecause the United States Supreme Court has drawn the line at 18 for Eighth Amendment purposes, state courts are not free to invoke the Eighth Amendment as authority for drawing it at a higher age. * * * *Roper* is controlling, and we must follow it."" *Graham* at ¶ 182, citing *In re Phillips*, 6th Cir. No. 17-3729, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 17766 (July 20, 2017) (no authority exists at the present time to support the argument that a defendant who was 19 years old at the time of the offense is ineligible to receive a death sentence).

---------------------
Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 2, 3, 4, 7, and 57 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged the constitutionality of Ohio's death-penalty scheme and the statutes governing it. Specifically, Myers argues that Ohio's death-penalty scheme (1) is per se unconstitutional due to several fundamental constitutional defects, (2) is unconstitutional because it allows racial disparities in capital indictment practices and the actual infliction of the death penalty, (3) is incompatible with modern standards of decency, and (4) violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under Hurst v. Florida, 577 U.S. 92, 136 S.Ct. 616 (2016). Myers further argues that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), Ohio's felony-murder statute, is unconstitutional as a capital specification because it allows for invidious racial discrimination in its application and fails to provide adequate safeguards to ensure only the most culpable offenders are sentenced to death.

Myers' claims are barred by res judicata as they were either raised or could have been raised in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 201-202. This includes his Sixth Amendment argument under Hurst as his merit brief was filed in the supreme court four months after Hurst was decided. Myers acknowledges that the supreme court ""has thus far been unwilling to conclude that Ohio's death penalty

¶ 67 Myers argues that Ohio's statutory scheme for postconviction relief is unconstitutional because it does not provide an adequate corrective process due to its ""rigid"" reliance on principles of res judicata and a petitioner's inability to conduct discovery until convincing a trial court that a hearing is warranted. This court has already determined that ""the statutory procedure for postconviction relief constitutes an adequate corrective process."" State v. Lindsey, 12th Dist. Brown No. CA2002-02-002, 2003-Ohio-811, ¶ 13; State v. Lawson, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2013-12-093, 2014-Ohio-3554, ¶ 43. Other Ohio appellate courts have likewise rejected the claim that Ohio's postconviction relief statute does not afford an adequate corrective process. See, e.g. State v. Conway, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-504, 2019-Ohio-2260. Furthermore, the propriety of resolving a postconviction petitioner's arguments on the basis of res judicata is well settled. E.g., Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93.

In dismissing Ground 50, the trial court found ""NO evidence that any conversation of counsel was ever overheard,"" noted its investigation into the issue, and ""determined that the mute button was sufficient to prevent anyone from overhearing any conversation between counsel and the petitioner."" Furthermore, this issue could have been raised on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court and is therefore barred by res judicata. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 50.

¶ 77 Ground 58 alleges that the elected prosecutor engaged in misconduct by extensively posting about the case on his county prosecutor Facebook and Twitter accounts
during and after the trial and via statements he made in an interview during a 2016 BBC documentary. Ground 58 further alleges that Myers was prejudiced by the prosecutor's misconduct. The trial court dismissed the ground, finding that Myers ""failed to establish sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief."" In his brief, Myers asserts that the prosecutor's social media postings and interview ""tainted"" his right to a fair trial.

¶ 78 We find that the trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 58. The prosecutor's post-trial social media posts, post-trial media statements, and statements in the 2016 BBC documentary are irrelevant and could not and did not deprive Myers of a fair trial. Regarding the prosecutor's social media postings and statements that occurred before and during trial, Myers does not articulate how any specific post or media statement prejudiced his right to a fair trial. A review of the posts and statements shows that they were restricted to providing the public with information about the criminal proceedings against Myers and communicated the results of various stages of the criminal proceedings against Myers either directly or by sharing links to news headlines. Following the guilty verdict, the prosecutor simply recognized Back's family and the efforts of the investigators and his office.

¶ 79 Furthermore, the trial court repeatedly admonished the jurors not to view or listen to any news reports in any form. We presume the jury followed the trial court's admonitions unless it is demonstrated otherwise. State v. Miller, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2019-11-010, 2021-Ohio-162, ¶ 50. Myers has not introduced any evidence to the contrary. Prejudice to a defendant will not be presumed in the absence of proof of jury exposure to possibly prejudicial news reports, or in this case, the prosecutor's social media posts. See State v. Wright, 3d Dist. Crawford No. 3-92-24, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 6090 (Dec. 30, 1994).
Finally, this issue could have been raised by Myers in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. We note that Myers actually did allege claims of prosecutorial misconduct as part of his direct appeal under his tenth proposition of law. Res judicata applies to any issue that could have been raised on direct appeal, including a claim alleging prosecutorial misconduct. *McKelton*, 2015-Ohio-4228 at ¶ 23, citing *State v. Zych*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA97-02-012, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4731 (Oct. 27, 1997). Myers fails to identify any reason why this claim of prosecutorial misconduct could not have been raised on direct appeal. Myers does not assert he learned about the prosecutor's social media posts after filing his direct appeal. Nor does he allege the posts were not known or available at the time of trial or his direct appeal. *Dillingham*, 2012-Ohio-5841 at ¶ 10.

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS OF TRIAL COURT ERRORS IN MULTIPLE RESPECTS (GROUNDS 51-56, 59), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.

Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 51 through 56 and 59 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged several trial court's rulings.

Ground 51 challenges the trial court's failure to grant a continuance of the trial date to allow defense counsel to obtain a mitigation specialist. This issue involves lead defense counsel's request to have his wife appointed as a mitigation specialist, which was initially denied by the trial court. After he was unable to find another mitigation specialist, lead counsel moved the trial court to reconsider its previous ruling. *Alternatively*, counsel
moved the court for a continuance of the trial date. The trial court reconsidered its previous
denial, appointed lead counsel's wife as the mitigation specialist, and denied the alternative
request for continuance. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 51.

{¶ 86} Ground 52 challenges the trial court's failure to grant a continuance of the trial
date to allow defense counsel to investigate Mosley's notebook after it was disclosed to the
defense the day before trial was to commence. Ground 53 challenges the trial court's
admission of the notebook into evidence and its failure to instruct the jury on the break in
the chain of custody. The notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after
the original search warrant was executed. On direct appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court
addressed the state's delayed disclosure of the notebook, the trial court's denial of defense
counsel's motion for a continuance, and the admissibility of the notebook into evidence.
Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 86-93, 112-120. In his direct appeal, defense counsel did not
challenge the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on chain of custody. Because the issues

suppress his ""involuntary"" statements to Detective Michael Wyatt where he ""did not
understand his Miranda rights and never signed a Miranda waiver."" In support of these
grounds, Myers submitted the reports of Gary Rini, a crime scene/police procedure expert,
and Dr. Drew Barzman, a psychiatrist. Upon reviewing Myers' videotaped police
interrogations, Rini concluded that Myers ""was clearly confused and befuddled during his
questioning"" and was ""therefore apparently unable to appreciate the gravity of his situation,
nor was he aware of the constitutional rights afforded to him."" Upon reviewing Myers' police
interrogations, administering the Miranda Rights Comprehension Instruments test (""MCRI""),
and reviewing comprehensive historical information regarding Myers, Dr. Barzman opined
that ""due to his young age of 19, probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,"" Myers ""was unable to adequately apply his Miranda rights at the time of the interrogations.""

¶ 88 On direct appeal, the supreme court overruled Myers' proposition of law relating to the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress and the claims that he never validly waived his right to remain silent, that he was denied his constitutional right to counsel, and that his statements were involuntary. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 61-82. In his brief, Myers asserts that the expert reports of Rini and Dr. Barzman ""were necessary to substantiate the claim"" his statements were not voluntarily made and were obtained in violation of Miranda. With the exception of the MCRI test, the same facts and historical information reviewed by Rini and Dr. Barzman were known and available to Myers at the time of his direct appeal to the supreme court. Myers, therefore, could have appealed his statements to police on the basis of his demeanor during questioning, his age, his ""probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and his lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,"" but did not.

---------------------
¶ 89 Ground 56 challenges the trial court's denial of Myers' motion for change of venue based on the ""overwhelming"" pretrial media publicity regarding the case. Although Myers moved the trial court for a change of venue, he did not challenge the trial court's denial of his motion in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. It is therefore barred by res judicata. See McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 56.
Ground 59 challenges the trial court's failure to instruct the jury that Mosley's plea deal to a life sentence without parole was a mitigating factor. The record shows that the trial court did instruct the jury that, in addition to the specific statutory mitigation factors, it could consider any additional factors that were not specifically mentioned in favor of a sentence other than death. Defense counsel was allowed to and did argue Mosley's plea deal as a mitigating factor. Furthermore, this claim could have been raised on direct appeal to the supreme court and is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Jennings, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-248, 2018-Ohio-3871; State v. Southers, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA88-03-027, 1988 Ohio App. LEXIS 2720 (June 30, 1988). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 59.

Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 6 and 10 through 17 of his PCR petition, all of which allege numerous instances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing the process and requirements for establishing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, not alleging any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
In order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, it must be shown that an attorney's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance
prejudiced the defense. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). In postconviction proceedings, a petitioner bears the initial burden of submitting evidentiary materials containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and also that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness. *State v. Jackson*, 64 Ohio St.2d 107, 111 (1980). Pursuant to the res judicata doctrine, a PCR petition may be dismissed where a petitioner, represented by new counsel on direct appeal, could have raised the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim on direct appeal without resort to evidence outside the record. *State v. Lentz*, 70 Ohio St.3d 527 (1994), syllabus; *State v. Loza*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA96-10-214, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4574, *9-10 (Oct. 13, 1997). Additionally, mere presentation of evidence outside the record does not transform a claim into one addressable in postconviction. *Drummond*, 2006-Ohio-7078 at ¶ 17. The evidence must show that the petitioner could not have appealed his claim based upon the information in the original record. *Id.*

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error related to the defense counsel's strategy during the trial, not the prosecutor's misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 96 Ground 6 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a youth-based defense theory during the guilt phase of the trial in anticipation of the penalty phase. Myers asserts that his ""youth, its specific effects on him, and its manifestation in the conduct alleged by the State at trial should have all formed a central, consistent theme presented during both phases of the trial."" Counsel's defense theory during the guilt phase was that Mosley committed the murder, Myers was simply present during the crime, and Mosley subsequently turned on Myers by entering into a plea deal and testifying against him. This was consistent with the penalty phase during which defense counsel argued Myers' sentence should not be more severe than Mosley's sentence.

¶ 97 The decision regarding which defense theory to pursue at trial is a matter of trial strategy, and trial strategy decisions are not the basis of a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Murphy*, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 524, 2001-Ohio-112; *State v.
Moreover, as the trial court noted when it dismissed Ground 6, the fact that another defense attorney may have or would have employed a different approach does not mean the alternative strategy fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. *State v. Casey*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2017-08-013, 2018-Ohio-2084, ¶ 34. ""[T]here is a strong presumption that counsel has rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment."" *Id.* Defense counsel's guilt-phase strategy will not be second-guessed even though appellate counsel now argue that they would have defended differently. *State v. Mason*, 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 169, 1998-Ohio-370. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 6.

---------------------
Ground 10 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to hire a fact investigator even though the trial court had approved funds for an investigator. Lead defense counsel's affidavit submitted in support of the PCR petition indicates that counsel ""ultimately did not retain"" an investigator because the case was not a ""who done it."" Ground 11 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to fully cross-examine Mosley. Myers asserts that an investigator would have discovered, inter alia, that Mosley was suffering from rage and depression in the days leading to Back's murder, suffered from severe drug addiction and had violent tendencies, and was not in the habit of taking notes in a notebook. The investigation would have further discovered that Mosley's cellphone records belied his trial testimony. Myers claims that this information could have been used to properly cross-examine Mosley and impeach his credibility.

""The *Strickland* holding and the American Bar Association's Guidelines only require trial counsel to perform a reasonable investigation, not to hire an investigator."" *State v. Hairston*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 05CA008768, 2006-Ohio-4925, ¶ 36. ""Further, '[a]n attorney's decision not to hire an investigator does not equate to a failure to investigate and
result in ineffective assistance of counsel."" State v. Thompson, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, ¶ 247, quoting Hairston at ¶ 36. Defense counsel's failure to hire a fact investigator does not mean counsel did not investigate Mosley's background. The affidavits, reports, and records submitted by Myers in support of Ground 10 do not show a failure to investigate.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes defense counsel's cross-examination of Mosley and the trial court's decision to dismiss certain grounds of error, but it does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 100 Furthermore, as the Ohio Supreme Court specifically noted on direct appeal, defense counsel did cross-examine Mosley ""vigorously and at length."" Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 186. Defense counsel's cross-examination of Mosley shows that counsel was very familiar with Mosley's statements to police and demonstrated his investigation and familiarity with personal facts about Mosley, including Mosley's substance abuse issues and the fact he engaged in illegal activity. Defense counsel's cross-examination elicited testimony that later allowed counsel to argue that Mosley was the principal offender, that he had a financial motive to commit the crimes, that he had a motive to keep his testimony consistent with his statements to Detective Wyatt because of his plea agreement, and that he lied to the police about Zennie to protect Zennie over Myers. Defense counsel's cross-examination of Mosley refutes any suggestion counsel did not investigate Mosley's background.

¶ 101 Whether defense counsel discovered all of the information Myers identifies as topics of cross-examination is unknown. However, counsel's strategy was to cast Mosley as the leader who planned the crimes and executed them with little help from Myers and who was now turning on Myers to save himself. Some of the information that Myers suggests should have been a topic during Mosley's cross-examination is the same type of information which would have undermined Myers' mitigation strategy that Mosley bore primary responsibility for Back's murder. In this sense, portraying Mosley as suffering from depression and cocaine withdrawal at the time of the crime would have run counter to
defense counsel's strategy that Mosley was fully responsible for Back's murder. In addition, in light of the overwhelming evidence of Myers' guilt and the fact that Mosley's testimony regarding his and Myers' actions on the days leading to and culminating in the murder was corroborated by third-party witnesses, there is no reasonable probability Myers would have been acquitted of the charges. The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 10 and 11.

371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error related to the defense counsel's failure to cross-examine the officers, not the prosecutor's misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 102 Ground 12 challenges counsel's failure to cross-examine Sergeant Jeff Garrison of the Clayton Police Department and Detective Wyatt during the hearing on Myers' motion to suppress and at trial regarding their failure to follow their respective police procedure manual in handcuffing Myers when he was only wanted for an interview. Myers asserts that had counsel used the manuals when cross-examining the officers, this would have aided in showing that Myers was ""effectively seized"" when he was handcuffed and would have tarnished the officers' credibility.

¶ 103 The record shows that it was Clayton police officers who handcuffed Myers and placed him in the back seat of a Clayton police cruiser after he was located at Mosley's home. At the time, Myers was a suspect who was detained at the request of the Warren County Sheriff's Office. The Clayton Police Department manual allows one to be restrained when the officer can articulate a need to handcuff for safety reasons. The sergeant's testimony at the suppression hearing indicates that Myers was handcuffed for safety reasons and to prevent him from running. Detective Wyatt's testimony reveals that the detective did not direct that Myers be handcuffed, and that in fact, he directed that the handcuffs be removed after he discovered that Myers was handcuffed.

¶ 104 Furthermore, as the trial court found, the extent and scope of cross-examination clearly fall within the ambit of trial strategy, and debatable trial tactics do not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, ¶ 146. Even assuming, arguendo, that defense counsel was deficient in failing
to use the manuals when he cross-examined the officers, Myers fails to establish that, but for counsel's error, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the suppression hearing and his trial would have been different. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 12.

---------------------
{¶ 105} Ground 13 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a crime scene expert testimony to question the veracity of Mosley's notebook and rebut such evidence. The notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after the original search warrant was executed in January 2014. In support of Ground 13, Myers submitted Rini's report. The report indicates that photographs taken during the January 2014 search of Mosley's home do not show the notebook at all, nor was the notebook mentioned in any investigative report generated as a result of the January 2014 search of Mosley's home. Rini's report states that the ""discovery"" of the notebook ""eight months later, during a warrantless search in a location previously photographed during the January [2014] search, draws into question the legitimacy of the 'find' by investigating officers."" Thus, ""[i]t is not unwarranted for one to conclude the possibility that the [notebook] was not, in fact present during the original crime scene search, and may have been placed at the scene sometime after the search was completed.""

{¶ 106} ""As an initial matter, the failure to call an expert and instead rely on cross-examination does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel."" State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, ¶ 66. Further, even if the wisdom of such an approach is debatable, ""debatable trial tactics"" do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Clayton, 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49 (1980). Defense counsel cross-examined Mosley upon all issues identified in Rini's report and revisited those issues in closing argument. Detective Wyatt testified the notebook was found where Mosley said it would be. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 13.

{¶ 107} Ground 14 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present
a police procedure expert such as Rini to challenge *Miranda* issues. Myers asserts that Rini could have testified, based on his review of Myers' police interrogations, that Myers was ""clearly confused"" during questioning, that Detective Wyatt did not adequately explain the *Miranda* warnings to Myers, and that the detective provided Myers with inaccurate information concerning how he could obtain an attorney. Ground 15 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his *Miranda* rights. In support of this ground, Myers submitted the report of Dr. Barzman. Upon reviewing Myers' police interrogations, administering the MCRI test, and reviewing comprehensive historical information regarding Myers, Dr. Barzman opined that ""due to his young age of 19, probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,"" Myers ""was unable to adequately apply his *Miranda* rights at the time of the interrogations.""

¶ 108 During the suppression hearing defense counsel's cross-examination of Detective Wyatt addressed the issues raised in Rini's report, and the videotapes of Myers' interrogations were played and admitted into evidence. The videotapes were likewise played to the jury and admitted into evidence at Myers' trial. The trial court denied Myers' motion to suppress, finding that Myers validly waived his *Miranda* rights. The trial court further found that, based on the totality of the evidence, Myers understood the nature of his *Miranda* rights and the consequences in declining to exercise them. In his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, Myers challenged the validity of his *Miranda* waiver and argued that counsel was ineffective during the guilt phase of his trial. Myers' alleged confusion during police questioning, Detective Wyatt's explanation to Myers of the *Miranda* warnings and the information he provided Myers concerning how to retain an attorney, and counsel's alleged ineffectiveness in failing to present expert testimony to challenge *Miranda* issues were cognizable and could have been raised on direct appeal based solely on the original
record. Rini's report does not constitute evidence outside the record as Myers asserts. Myers' argument is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Dempsey, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 76386, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 2628 (June 15, 2000); State v. Holloway, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-900805, 1992 Ohio App. LEXIS 283 (Jan. 29, 1992).

¶ 109 The trial court dismissed Ground 15, finding that ""even if the defense had requested an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his Miranda rights, based on the evidence presented at the motion to suppress hearing it is unlikely that the Court would have granted that request since the Court denied the motion to suppress."" The trial court further found that ""[t]he failure to request a * * * police procedures expert or another expert to challenge Miranda issues was not such an error as to deny [Myers'] constitutional rights. [Myers] was not entitled to any such expert[.]"") Thus, the trial court found that even considering Dr. Barzman's report, Myers failed to set forth sufficient operative facts establishing a substantive ground for relief.

¶ 110 The MRCI administered by Dr. Barzman in October 2016 is the updated version of the Thomas Grisso's Instruments for Assessing Understanding & Appreciation of Miranda Rights, commonly referred to as the Grisso test.

---------------------
¶ 112 Myers' scores indicate he did understand his Miranda rights. Myers was interviewed five times by Detective Wyatt. Miranda warnings were not required during the first interview as Myers was not in custody. Detective Wyatt administered Miranda warnings to Myers on three separate times; each time Myers stated he understood them. Myers invoked his right to counsel in the second interview and the detective ended the interview. Myers sought to re-initiate questioning during a third interview but was rebuffed because he had invoked his right to counsel. Myers subsequently re-initiated questioning during a fourth interview, was administered the Miranda warnings again, and provided a statement. Detective Wyatt administered the Miranda warnings for a third time before the fifth interview. Myers indicated he understood them and answered the detective's questions. On direct appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court found that Myers understood his Miranda rights, which was further demonstrated by his invocation of his right to counsel. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 69-71.

¶ 113 Ground 16 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to support
the motion for a change of venue with news articles evidencing the extraordinary amount of pretrial publicity, failed to renew the motion after voir dire, and ultimately failed to achieve a change of venue. The trial court dismissed Ground 16, finding that the motion for change of venue was initially denied subject to reconsideration if a jury could not be empaneled in accordance with State v. Lundgren, 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 1995-Ohio-227. The motion was subsequently denied after the trial court was able to successfully seat a jury in accordance with Lundgren. Juror questionnaires submitted in support of Ground 16 indicate that six of the 12 jurors had seen or heard pretrial news coverage of the case. All jurors indicated that they could and would decide the case based solely on the evidence presented at trial. Furthermore, although Myers alleged claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase as part of his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, he did not challenge defense counsel's failure to achieve a change of venue. It is therefore barred by res judicata. See Piesciuk, 2013-Ohio-3879. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 16.

{¶ 114} Ground 17 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to challenge the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook either through cross-examination of the state's witnesses or by expert testimony. As stated above, the notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after the original search warrant was executed. Counsel vigorously cross-examined Mosley about the notebook and objected to its admission. On direct appeal to the supreme court, Myers challenged the admission of the notebook into evidence and alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial. The issue regarding the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook was cognizable and could have been raised on direct appeal to the supreme court and is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Dickason, 5th Dist. Stark Case No. 1996CA00423, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 3241 (July 7, 1997). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 17.

Assignment of Error No. 5:

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS THAT HIS TRIAL COUNSEL RENDERED CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFICIENT PERFORMANCE IN THE SENTENCING PHASE OF HIS CAPITAL TRIAL (GROUNDS 19-45, 49), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING, AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF ON THESE MERITORIOUS IAC CLAIMS.

371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error by Myers, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Myers argues that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 19 through 45, all of which allege several instances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial. Specifically, Myers argues that counsel was ineffective during the penalty phase of the trial because he failed to (1) conduct a competent mitigation investigation and consult with and hire a competent mitigation specialist in a timely fashion, (2) present the testimony of expert witnesses regarding Myers' youth and psychological history, (3) present expert testimony regarding the science on adolescent brain development, and (4) present the testimony of numerous witnesses who would have testified about Myers' background, family history, mental health, education, and relationships with others. Myers argues that defense counsel's primary mitigation strategy was that Myers should not receive a punishment harsher than the life sentence without parole imposed on Mosley. Myers avers that had defense counsel's focus been broader and include the testimony of experts and other witnesses, he would not have been sentenced to death.

The trial court dismissed the grounds for relief, finding that (1) the failure to
call witnesses is trial strategy that does not raise to a constitutional violation, (2) a PCR petition is not a vehicle to substitute another trial strategy for one that failed, (3) defense counsel did argue Myers' youth in mitigation and the trial court instructed the jury that youth was a mitigating factor, and (4) defense counsel's failure to present the testimony of an expert in adolescent brain development, and his decision to consult with but not call a psychology expert to the stand and instead rely on arguing that Myers' sentence should not be harsher than that of Mosley was trial strategy.

¶ 120 Myers' foregoing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial were also the basis for his motions for discovery and why he argues the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery under his second and third assignments of error. As pertinent here, the trial court denied the discovery motions as follows:

---------------------
This is not a case where the defense did not seek the assistance of an investigator, mitigation expert and mental health expert. Clearly, a decision by trial counsel not to even have these valuable tools available to him while defending a capital murder case can never be a tactical, strategic decision. However, the decision of whether or not to use these tools or how to use them, as a matter of strategy or in the context of marshalling resources, is the cornerstone in building a proper legal defense.

Petitioner has made allegations that his attorneys and mitigation specialist were ineffective and did not properly investigate and prepare a defense. In support of this claim, he has provided affidavits and documentary evidence concerning their performance. However, petitioner has made no specific representation about what he expects to learn in a deposition of [lead defense counsel, co-counsel and/or the mitigation specialist]. Both [lead counsel and the mitigation specialist] provided affidavits explaining what they knew, what they did, and why they did it. The fact that an attorney may look back in a deposition or otherwise, with 20/20 hindsight, and question or revisit his trial strategy after the jury has rendered its verdict provides no real insight to the Court. Further, the fact that [lead counsel] may have limited his mitigation strategy to what he believed to be the strongest and most compelling arguments does not support conducting discovery on this issue. * * *
In short, the petitioner has not established good cause to conduct discovery with respect to the defense team, including the attorneys.

---------------------
¶ 121 During the penalty phase of the trial, defense counsel presented the testimony of Myers' father, mother, and younger brother Bryce. All three testified about Myers' family history and background, including the breakup of the family and the parents' divorce following the mother's affair with a coworker and resultant pregnancy. They further testified about Myers' close bond with his siblings and how he was a very good mediator and mentor for his stepsiblings. Myers' mother testified that as a child, Myers tested gifted in several areas, was a talented piano player, and had designed a business card for himself in sixth grade. However, she started seeing changes in Myers when he was 14 years old. After she discovered Myers had been cutting himself and shooting his legs with a pellet gun, he was hospitalized for five days at Kettering Hospital Youth Services. Myers' mother testified that Myers was initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder and upon discharge, was prescribed medications and weekly therapy with a psychologist. However, Myers discontinued both when he began living with his father later that year. Defense counsel introduced photographs of Myers and his family, the business card he had designed for himself, his letters to his family during his incarceration, the records of his hospitalization at Kettering Hospital, and his gifted test results when he was in fifth grade. The Kettering Hospital records show that Myers was hospitalized as a result of taking 20 Benadryl tablets and that he was initially diagnosed with ""depressive disorder not otherwise specified versus bipolar disorder most recent depressed; substance induced mood disorder; over-the-counter drug abuse."" Myers was ultimately diagnosed with ""depressive disorder, not otherwise specified. Rule out bipolar disorder.""

¶ 122 Myers made an unsworn statement, telling the jury that he was sorry ""this
happened"" and wished he ""could go back in time and stop this before it even happened,"" and that the death penalty would not hurt him and would only cause more pain and suffering to innocent people such as his parents and siblings. Myers asked the jury to spare his life and give him a chance to become a better person.

¶ 123 In closing argument, defense counsel stressed Myers' good qualities and the positive influence he could have in his siblings' lives, acknowledged there had been ""bumps in the road,"" such as issues with Myers' family, ""his mental health a little bit,"" and his cutting and shooting himself with the pellet gun, and asked the jury to consider Myers' age, the love of his family, and the Kettering Hospital records. Overall, defense counsel focused on Mosley's plea agreement and resulting life sentence, telling the jury that it was the most important mitigating factor in the case and that Myers should not be punished more than Mosley who was the one who actually killed Back.

¶ 124 Grounds 22 through 43 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present or ""fully"" present the testimony of numerous witnesses who would have testified about Myers' background, family history, mental health, education, and relationships with others. In support of this claim, Myers attached 22 affidavits from relatives, friends, acquaintances, and former educators to his PCR petition. Of those witnesses, only three testified at the penalty phase, to wit, Myers' parents and his brother Bryce.

¶ 125 It is well established that a ""defense decision to call or not call a mitigation witness is a matter of trial strategy. * * * Debatable trial tactics generally do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel."" Graham, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 139. The Ohio Supreme Court has further stated that trial counsel is not ineffective for failing to call all available family members. State v.

¶ 126 Upon reviewing the witnesses' affidavits, we find that the trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 22 through 43. Although the 19 individuals who did not testify may have provided a more disinterested account of Myers' family, their testimony to a large extent was cumulative to and did not differ in substantial way from the testimony of Myers' parents and his brother Bryce. See State v. Twyford, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 98-JE-56, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 1443 (Mar. 19, 2001). Likewise, the affidavits of Myers' parents and brother did not differ in substantial way from their testimony at the penalty phase.

¶ 127 Grounds 19 and 20 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to consult with and hire a competent mitigation specialist in a timely fashion.

¶ 128 In March 2014, lead defense counsel moved to employ his wife, a licensed attorney with experience defending capital cases, as the mitigation specialist. The trial court balked at the request due to the family relationship and denied the motion. Lead counsel did not seek assistance from another mitigation specialist until he contacted the Ohio Public Defender's Office in May 2014. However, the public defender's office did not have the resources to provide a mitigation specialist. Unable to find another mitigation specialist, lead counsel moved the trial court to reconsider its previous denial. The trial court held a hearing on the motion for reconsideration on June 4, 2014. Thereafter, the trial court appointed lead counsel's wife as the mitigation specialist. The trial court's decision noted that counsel's wife had ""already undertaken some mitigation work in the case, including meeting with the family of the Defendant[.]""

¶ 129 The jury found Myers guilty on all counts and specifications on October 2, 2014. The penalty phase was held on October 6, 2014. In support of his PCR petition, Myers attached the affidavits of lead counsel and the mitigation specialist. Both affidavits
state that during the three-day weekend between the jury verdict and the penalty phase, lead counsel and the mitigation specialist met with and interviewed Myers' mother and two of his siblings at the mother's home. That same weekend, they also met with and interviewed Myers' father and stepmother at their home. The affidavits of Myers' parents and stepmother corroborated that the interviews took place that weekend. Myers' stepmother stated the interview was short. Myers' mother stated that her interview lasted about one hour and one half and that she gave photographs to the mitigation specialist at another time and ""spent another hour to an hour and a half with her.""

The trial court noted that the mitigation specialist ""was a trained attorney who has handled a number of capital cases and therefore has the ability to determine what evidence is effective in the [penalty] phase."" The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 19 and 20.

{¶ 131} Grounds 21, 44, and 45 generally challenge counsel's failure to conduct a comprehensive investigation into Myers' background and counsel's failure to present effective mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of the trial. Specifically, Grounds 21, 44, and 45 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present the expert testimony of clinical forensic psychologist Dr. Bobbie Hopes, failed to consult with and present an expert in adolescent brain development, and failed to effectively present youth as a mitigation factor.

{¶ 132} In support of his PCR petition, Myers submitted affidavits and reports from several experts related to adolescent brain development and expressing opinions based
upon their evaluation of Myers and his mental health and social records. The evidence submitted by Myers generally reflects that individuals of his age are prone to risk taking, peer influence, and impulsivity more akin to adolescents than adults. Myers argues that this evidence established substantive grounds for relief and he is therefore entitled to discovery and an evidentiary hearing on his PCR petition. The state argues that the evidence was not presented as a matter of trial strategy because it was in conflict with defense counsel's mitigation strategy to emphasize Myers' good qualities and was cumulative to evidence presented at the penalty phase.

¶ 133 In his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, Myers argued ineffective assistance of counsel in the penalty phase for failure to present any expert testimony. Specifically, Myers asserted that defense counsel ""should have adduced expert testimony to explain the meaning of his self-harming behavior in his early teens and how brain development affects the decision-making of young people."" Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 198. The supreme court rejected Myers' claim on the ground that ""nothing in the record shows what such expert would have said in the penalty phase[.] Thus, Myers has not demonstrated prejudice from missing such testimony."" Id. The supreme court further found, ""At trial, the defense requested and received funds to hire a consulting psychologist. The psychologist the defense chose was appointed, but the record does not show what she told Myers's counsel regarding her conclusions. Hence, there is nothing to show deficient performance by counsel."" Id. at ¶ 199.

State v. Pickens, 141 Ohio St.3d 462, 2014-Ohio-5445, ¶ 219. Defense counsel has a duty to make reasonable
investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. *State v. Johnson*, 24 Ohio St.3d 87, 89 (1986). Counsel's ""investigations into mitigating evidence 'should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor.'"" *Wiggins v.

Given the severity of the potential sentence and the reality that the life of a capital defendant is at stake, it is only after a full investigation of all the mitigating circumstances that counsel can make an informed, tactical decision about which information would be most helpful to the client's case. *Johnson* at 90. ""Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable[.] However, a failure to investigate, especially as to key evidence, must be supported by a reasoned and deliberate determination that investigation was not warranted."" *O'Hara v.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes the reports of two psychologists, Dr. Barzman and Dr. Davis, who examined Myers and provided opinions about his mental health and psychological development. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 135 Myers was examined by Dr. Barzman for purposes of the PCR petition and his report is attached to the petition. Myers was also examined by Dr. Daniel Davis, a forensic psychologist, and his report is attached to the PCR petition. In his report, Dr. Barzman opined that Myers' mental health history, which included significant depressive and manic symptoms, was consistent with bipolar disorder which is associated with increased impulsivity and a focus on immediate gratification.

¶ 136 In his report, Dr. Davis stated that the symptoms Myers experienced in high school were associated with bipolar disorder and that he was not fully neurologically
developed at the time of his crimes and sentencing. Dr. Davis further stated that the trial court and jury were deprived of pertinent psychological information specific to Myers and general psychological research specific to youthful and capital offenders, evidence that would have been extremely helpful to understand Myers' actions and demeanor. In particular, Dr. Davis noted that while Myers' youth was clearly evident at trial, the crimes took place when Myers was still developing neurologically and psychologically, however ""there was no specific testimony as to the considerable scientific literature concerning neurological development in late adolescents and young adults."" Dr. Davis also noted Myers' apparent lack of remorse for his crimes at sentencing but stated that scientific literature shows that an apparent lack of remorse is not indicative of anything atypical in adolescent males and is typically mistaken as one of the ""signs of the development of a psychopathic personality when they are, in fact, transient features of adolescent development."" Dr. Davis' report continued,

Further, abused and neglected children, such as Austin demonstrate a limited range of emotions as a way to cope with very stressful home environments. These research findings apply specifically to Austin. He was raised in a highly neglectful environment. He was at the time of his sentence still in the commonly accepted development stage of late adolescence. Neither the trial court nor jury had this critically important research presented to them[.]

¶ 137 In support of his PCR petition, Myers also submitted the affidavits of his lead defense counsel and Dr. Hopes. Lead counsel's affidavit details what he did and did not do. As pertinent here, lead counsel stated he believed ""that everyone close to the process thought that [Myers] would receive a life sentence regardless of the trial phase result, based upon Mosley's plea deal having been the principal offender in the aggravated murder of Justin Back."" Counsel's affidavit further stated,

I did not consider requesting funding for, or hiring, a youth/adolescent expert to help explain issues, including
youth/adolescent brain development, to the jury.

Even though we did retain a psychologist, Dr. Bobbie Hopes, for mitigation, Dr. Hopes told me that she would not be able to provide anything for the jury except for a timeline of Austin's life, something which Dr. Hopes believed Austin's mother could provide and that it would be better if it came from her. Given her statements to me, I was concerned that if Dr Hopes presented this information to the jury, it would just be seen as ""psychobabble.""

When Austin's mother * * * did not effectively provide such a timeline as I had anticipated and that [the mitigation specialist] and I had worked with her on, I did not think to then call Dr. Bobbie Hopes to the stand to testify.

There is no mention of any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 138} Lead counsel's averments were contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. Dr. Hopes evaluated Myers three times in August 2014, for a total of six hours, for purposes of death penalty mitigation. Dr. Hopes averred that she provided lead counsel with a report in which she expressed the opinion that Myers' age, his history of childhood physical abuse, including his history of being diagnosed and treated for depression, and his history of self-mutilation were mitigation factors. Following Myers' conviction for aggravated murder, lead counsel called Dr. Hopes and told her he did not intend to use her as a mitigation expert. Dr. Hopes suggested that Myers' age and relevant research on adolescent brain development were strong mitigation factors but was told by lead counsel that information about youth had come out during jury selection. Dr. Hopes averred that she was willing and prepared to testify about age and adolescent brain development research. Dr. Hopes further averred that she never advised lead counsel that she could only present a timeline of Myers' life and that she never discussed a timeline with counsel.

{¶ 139} As stated above, ""[i]n a petition for post-conviction relief, which asserts ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner bears the initial burden to submit evidentiary documents containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness."" Jackson, 64
Ohio St.2d 107 at syllabus. In order to secure an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner need not prove counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Rather, the PCR petition only needs to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.

¶ 140 Upon reviewing the reports of Drs. Barzman and Davis and the affidavits of Dr. Hopes and lead defense counsel, we find that Myers has provided evidentiary documents setting forth sufficient operative facts to warrant an evidentiary hearing on his PCR petition regarding his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony at the penalty phase of the trial.

¶ 141 Defense counsel has the affirmative duty to investigate mitigating evidence. State v. Herring, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08-MA-213, 2011-Ohio-662, ¶ 55. Defense counsel ""can make the decision to forego the presentation of evidence, but only after a full investigation."" Id. It is only after a full investigation of all the mitigating circumstances that counsel can make an informed, tactical decision about which information would be most helpful to their client's case. Johnson, 24 Ohio St.3d at 89.

¶ 142 Lead counsel's averment that he did not consider requesting funding for, or hiring, a youth/adolescent expert to explain issues regarding adolescent brain development to the jury fails to indicate counsel's motivation and instead suggests that counsel's failure to present such expert testimony was not the product of an informed, tactical decision. That is, counsel's averment shows he did not engage into a reasoned and careful consideration of such expert testimony before ultimately rejecting it. The same can be said about counsel's failure to have Dr. Hopes testify as an expert witness at the penalty phase. While counsel averred in his affidavit that Dr. Hopes did not testify because she could only provide a timeline of Myers' life, this averment was explicitly contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. There is little evidence documenting the extent of defense counsel's reasoning for his
investigation and decision making regarding expert testimony mitigation evidence.

{¶ 143} The state argues that mitigation evidence regarding Myers’ dysfunctional family, self-mutilation, and mental health issues such as childhood depression and bipolar disorder, was presented through the testimony of his mother at the penalty phase, and thus, much of the psychological testimony that Drs. Hopes, Barzman, and Davis could have presented would have been cumulative. However, Myers’ mother's testimony was much more limited on the issue. Myers’ mother testified that the deterioration of her marriage did not seem to affect Myers, that she had not noticed Myers' self-mutilation, and that she believed Kettering Hospital initially diagnosed Myers with bipolar disorder. There was no testimony regarding Myers' childhood depression. Furthermore, Myers’ mother is not qualified to provide the expert testimony necessary to contextualize the factors above.

371-Myers,"No. The text is describing an assignment of error related to the defense counsel's decision not to present certain expert testimony at the penalty phase, not alleging any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 144} The state next argues that presenting this expert testimony at the penalty phase would have been inconsistent with defense counsel's mitigation theory emphasizing Myers' good qualities and the positive influence he could have in his siblings' lives. Thus, the state asserts, defense counsel's decision not to present such testimony was trial strategy which should not be second-guessed.

{¶ 145} However, lead counsel's affidavit does not advance this as the reason he did not present Dr. Hopes' expert testimony at the penalty phase. Lead counsel avers only that he did not call Dr. Hopes as a witness because she could only provide a timeline of Myers' life, an averment explicitly contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. Whether it was defense counsel's mitigation strategy to emphasize Myers' qualities, which counsel's affidavit does not suggest, it is not apparent why such strategy excludes a parallel strategy to contextualize Myers' youth in light of the science on adolescent brain development. As her affidavit clearly indicates, Dr. Hopes was prepared and available to testify about these issues and advised lead counsel on the eve of the penalty phase that Myers' age and
relevant research on adolescent brain development were strong mitigation factors. And while a decision by defense counsel to present only positive mitigation can be a sound trial strategy, counsel's decision to pursue a positive-mitigation theory can properly be made only after counsel has conducted a full mitigation investigation. *Herring*, 2014-Ohio-5228 at ¶ 90.

{¶ 146} The state further asserts that defense counsel did argue that Myers was only 19 years old at the time of the crimes. Counsel did briefly ask the jury to take Myers' age into consideration as a mitigation factor. However, counsel never developed the significance of Myers' youth as a mitigating factor.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The error is not alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is alleging that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing certain grounds of a PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 147} In light of the foregoing, we find that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing. The trial court further erred in finding that Myers did not establish good cause to conduct discovery regarding his claim counsel was ineffective at the penalty phase in failing to present expert testimony on adolescent brain development in conjunction with Myers' age and mental health issues. Myers' claims are ""neither patently frivolous nor palpably incredible"" and ""the discovery he requests"" in the form of depositions of the defense team is ""limited and reasonably calculated to lead to evidence in support of his claim[.]"" *Hill*, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71975 at *31-32; *Johnson v. Bobby*, S.D.Ohio No. 2:08-cv-55, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103351 (Sept. 30, 2010); *Stallings v. Bradshaw*, N.D.Ohio No. 5:05CV0722, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97540 (Feb. 28, 2006).

{¶ 148} We therefore remand this case for the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition which allege ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase for failing to present expert testimony on adolescent brain development in conjunction with Myers' age and mental health issues. The advantages that an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition based on ineffective assistance of counsel
can provide a trial judge are well established:

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text is describing an assignment of error related to the trial court's handling of a claim of cumulative error, not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
The trial judge can delve into the motivation or reasoning of trial counsel through trial counsel's testimony. The court can hear the testimony of witnesses that were never called to testify at the original trial, and can determine the worth of their testimony as well as the witnesses' credibility. The trial judge can ask what the counsel knew, when he knew it, and whether a mistake was not strategic, but was instead careless. As here, in a postconviction hearing, a judge can hear testimony about what evidence was made available to trial counsel and when it was made available. A trial court in a postconviction proceeding thus plays a unique role in the consideration of ineffective assistance of counsel claims. It is the only court that actually hears testimony on that issue.

State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, ¶ 54.

¶ 149 Myers' fifth assignment of error is sustained. To the extent noted above, Myers' second and third assignments of error are sustained in part.

5. Cumulative Errors

¶ 150 Assignment of Error No. 10:

¶ 151 THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C), MYERS' CLAIM OF CUMULATIVE ERROR (GROUND 60), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error related to the trial court's dismissal of certain grounds in a PCR (Post-Conviction Relief) petition, specifically focusing on cumulative errors and the denial of effective assistance of counsel. It does not allege misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 152 Myers argues the trial court erred in dismissing Ground 60 which alleges cumulative errors. We include under this assignment of error Myers' claims that the trial court erred in dismissing Grounds 18 and 49, which allege cumulative effect of the denial of effective assistance of counsel during the guilt and penalty phases of the trial (as initially argued in the fifth and sixth assignments of error). Under the doctrine of cumulative errors, a judgment may be reversed if the cumulative effect of errors deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute
cause for reversal. *State v. Kirkland*, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, ¶ 140. Given our resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth assignments of error, this assignment of error is moot. See *State v. Stein*, 3d Dist. Logan No. 8-17-39, 2018-Ohio-2621, citing App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).

III. CONCLUSION

¶ 153 In light of our resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth assignments of error, the trial court's judgments denying Myers' motions for discovery and his PCR petition regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to present expert testimony at the penalty phase of the trial are reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Specifically, on remand, the trial court shall permit discovery, conduct an evidentiary hearing, and rule on Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition.

¶ 154 Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

I. Factual Background


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text describes the actions of the Khamisis, not the prosecutor. The error is not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Evidence presented at a jury trial showed that the Khamisis had engaged in schemes to steal real property from its rightful owners by filing fraudulent documents. The Khamisis justified their actions by claiming that the properties were abandoned and that they were in the process of establishing ownership through adverse possession.

A. 3610 Washington Avenue

Property located at 3610 Washington Avenue was the former site of the Zion Nursing Care Center. Dr. William Poole was the last remaining member of the board of directors of the nursing home and was attempting to sell the property. Dr. Poole had been devoted to the nursing home and had taken numerous actions to keep it open. He had taken a mortgage on the property in 2008, which was still valid at the time of trial.

When Dr. Poole discovered “squatters” on the property, he called an attorney, Michael Gray. According to Gray, Dr. Poole “forgot to file a statement of continuation with the secretary of state” which caused the organization, Zion
Nursing Care Center, to go “inactive.” Gray discovered that the Hamilton County auditor showed an entity that Dr. Poole did not recognize as the owner of the property. Prior to trial, Dr. Poole passed away. But both his son and Gray testified that although the nursing home was closed and the building was vacant, the property had never been abandoned.

{¶5} The Khamisis created an entity with a name similar to and using the same address as the Zion Nursing Care Center by filing paperwork with the secretary of state. Those documents were signed by Kimberly, Ayinde, and Jelani. Jelani was named as the statutory agent. They filed additional documents, including a quit-claim deed, in the Hamilton County recorder’s office that purported to transfer ownership of the property to other entities they had created. They also filed liens on the property. A representative of the Ohio attorney general’s office testified that the Khamisis never registered these alleged charitable entities with the attorney general’s office.

{¶6} Detective Cynthia Alexander of the Cincinnati Police Department began investigating the Khamisis. She discovered several organizations that the Khamisis used in an attempt to gain control of the property at 3610 Washington Avenue.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text describes various legal actions and disputes involving different parties, but it does not allege that the prosecutor or the state committed any misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶7} Kimberly filed a quiet-title action against “Zion Nursing Home, Inc.” and “Zion Care Center, Inc.” alleging that she had rightful possession of the property. The trial court in that case determined that Kimberly and her associated entities had no interest in the property and ordered the Hamilton County recorder’s office to strike the quit-claim deed.
B. 215 Mitchell Avenue

Property at 215 Mitchell Avenue was owned by Ruby Red Services, LLC, a business incorporated by Melissa Meade. Meade later died in a car accident, and the house was vacant. Visio Mortgage Services held a mortgage on the property and began foreclosure proceedings. Claiming the property was abandoned, Jelani occupied the property. Subsequently, he and Kimberly filed multiple documents asserting an interest in the property, including a quit-claim deed. Several of the documents were filed after a court had refused to let them intervene in the foreclosure proceedings.

C. 453 Sheffield Road

The Anderson family owned property located at 453 Sheffield Road. Marsha Anderson testified that it was her parents’ house, in which she had been raised. When her mother passed away, she left the property to Marsha and her siblings. Marsha moved out of the home in 2010, leaving it vacant, but continued to make mortgage payments on the home.

Claiming the property was abandoned, Jelani occupied the property. In 2017, he filed a quiet-title action naming all the Anderson siblings as the defendants. A notice about the lawsuit was sent to Marsha’s brother, Michael, who was deceased, at the Sheffield Avenue address. Jelani’s complaint was dismissed when he failed to appear for trial.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error or allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. It provides information about a quiet-title action and the parties involved, but it does not discuss any errors or misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Marsha did not know about the action until Detective Alexander notified her about it. She testified that the property was not abandoned and that the quiet-title action was hurtful because the property had belonged to her parents, and she and her sister had taken care of their parents there.
When he filed the quiet-title action, Jelani also filed an affidavit of indigency, in which he claimed had no income. In reality, he was employed by Stepping Stones, a nonprofit agency. He earned $18,979 in 2015, $22,591 in 2016, and $22,574 in 2017.

D. 533 Glenwood Avenue

Melissa Sherrod owned the property located at 533 Glenwood Avenue. Melissa's husband, Shareef Sherrod, testified that he was a real estate broker and investor who bought and rehabbed vacant properties, mostly single-family homes. The properties were put in his wife's name because it was easier for her to get financing, but he was the one who operated the business. He and his wife purchased the property in 2011 with the intent to renovate it and then rent it. He had contractors come out to look at the property for bids. Shereef made sure that the grass was cut every two to three weeks. He secured the property with a lockbox, sealed the windows, and had a neighbor watch out for trespassers.

Ayinde occupied the property, and filed a quiet-title action naming Melissa as a defendant, in which he contended that he had an interest in the property. He also filed an affidavit of indigency. Ayinde's complaint was eventually dismissed for want of prosecution.

The Sherrods had no notice of the action. They only learned of it when Detective Alexander contacted them. Shareef hired an attorney and paid her $500. He testified that he never gave anyone permission to take the property, and he had not abandoned it. He eventually sold the property and received the proceeds.

Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text above is describing quiet-title actions, not an assignment of error. It does not allege that the prosecutor (or the state) committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶16} Terrence Davis owned property located at 4945 Paddock Road. Davis owned a construction company and bought the property to remodel either as a daycare or “living units.” The property was vacant when he bought it. He sealed it with a steel door that could not be entered.

{¶17} Davis had not yet started working on the property, but roofing material had been delivered and was sitting on the roof, when he saw one man and two women walking about the property and looking in the windows. Subsequently, he began the process of cleaning out the property and putting on a new roof.

{¶18} Kaia filed a quiet-title action, naming Davis as a defendant, along with an affidavit of indigency. He received notice of the action in his post-office box. Davis hired an attorney and filed an answer. His attorney made some phone calls and learned of the police’s investigation into similar transactions. He testified that no one had his consent to come onto the property and that it was not abandoned. Kaia’s complaint was eventually dismissed for want of prosecution.

F. 200 Clinton Springs

{¶19} Brenda Willis owned property located at 200 Clinton Springs, which used to be her parents’ house. On January 6, 2017, Kimberly filed a quiet-title action naming as defendants Brenda and her husband, Charles Willis, although only Brenda’s name was on the deed. Kimberly also filed an affidavit of indigency.

{¶20} Brenda stated that her siblings were living in the house until January 2018, and that none of the claims in Kimberly’s complaint were true. She and her husband both filed answers, after which Kimberly dismissed her complaint. Brenda
also stated that the property was not abandoned, and she had never given anyone permission to enter the property.

**G. 3944 Vine Street**

{¶21} Kimberly filed a quiet-title action for property located at 3944 Vine Street, along with an affidavit of indigency. She claimed that the property was abandoned, and she was the possessor of the property. Anchor Holdings, LLC, was the property’s owner. The quiet-title action was dismissed because Kimberly never obtained service on Anchor Holdings. Detective Alexander was unable to locate a representative for the company.

**H. 1595 Summit Avenue**

{¶22} Michael West incorporated 4 Kennedy, LLC, a real estate business, to make money to pay for his daughter’s college tuition. He bought property at 1595 Summit Road in 2015 and began renovations. Kimberly filed a quiet-title action alleging that the property was abandoned and that she had entered the property and claimed title to it.

{¶23} West did not find out about the action until Detective Alexander contacted his wife. He stated that he had not abandoned the property and that he believed that “somebody was trying to steal [his] property.” The quiet-title action was dismissed when Kimberly failed to show up for court. Detective Alexander stated that at that time, Kimberly was aware that the Cincinnati Police Department was investigating the Khamisis.
I. 10508 Toulon Drive

{¶24} James and Imogene Bronson had owned property at 10508 Toulon Drive. The Bronsons passed away, and the survivor identified in the deed was Michelle Reed. Wells Fargo Bank had initiated a foreclosure proceeding. Kimberly filed a quiet-title action against the Bronsons, Reed, and Wells Fargo, along with an affidavit of indigency. She claimed that the property was abandoned and that she was in possession. She also claimed that Wells Fargo did not have a valid mortgage. The case was dismissed for want of prosecution.

J. The Convictions

{¶25} Kimberly was convicted of three counts of tampering with records and three counts of theft. She was sentenced to three years in prison. Jelani was convicted of three counts of tampering with records and three counts of theft. He was sentenced to one year in prison. Ayinde was convicted of two counts of tampering with records and two counts of theft. He was sentenced to two years in prison. Kaia was convicted of one count of tampering with records and one count of theft. She was sentenced to one year in prison. These appeals followed.

II. Structural Error

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text describes the Khamisis presenting four identical assignments of error, each alleging that the trial court committed a structural error, not that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶26} The Khamisis each present four identical assignments of error for review. In all of these assignments of error, they contend that the trial court committed structural error. A structural error is a constitutional defect that affects the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than being an error in the trial process itself. State v. Clinton, 153 Ohio St.3d 422, 2017-Ohio-9423, 108 N.E.3d 1, ¶ 198; State v. Jones, 2018-Ohio-4754, 124 N.E.3d 439, ¶ 19 (1st Dist.). Because a
structural error is deemed prejudicial per se, it requires an automatic reversal. *State v. Davis*, 127 Ohio St.3d 268, 2010-Ohio-5706, 939 N.E.2d 147, ¶ 22; *State v. Furr*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170046, 2018-Ohio-2205, ¶ 3. Most constitutional errors are not structural, and structural errors have been recognized only in limited classes of cases. *State v. Perry*, 101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, ¶ 18; *Furr* at ¶ 4; *Jones* at ¶ 20.

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"Yes. The text describes the Khamisis' first assignments of error, which allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct by creating a fatal variance between the grand jury's indictment and the bill of particulars and evidence.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶27} In determining whether an error is structural, the threshold inquiry is whether the error involves deprivation of a constitutional right. *State v. Fisher*, 99 Ohio St.3d 127, 2003-Ohio-2761, 789 N.E.2d 222, ¶ 18; *Jones* at ¶ 21. “[T]he trial-error/structural-error distinction is irrelevant unless it is first established that constitutional error has occurred.” *Jones* at ¶ 21, quoting *State v. Esparza*, 74 Ohio St.3d 660, 662, 660 N.E.2d 1194 (1996).

**III. Indictment**

{¶28} In their first assignments of error, the Khamisis contend that the trial court committed structural error “by Creating a Fatal Variance Between the Grand Jury’s Indictment and the Bill of Particulars and Evidence***.” They argue that the indictments failed to give them adequate notice of the alleged criminal conduct with which they were charged, that they were not supported by sufficient facts, and that they were falsely procured by the prosecutor. These assignments of error are not well taken.


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,No. The text is describing the requirements of an indictment and the government's obligation to aver all material facts constituting the essential elements of the offense. It is not alleging any misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶29} Under the United States and Ohio Constitutions, an individual accused of a felony is entitled to an indictment setting forth the “nature and cause of the accusation.” *State v. Sellards*, 17 Ohio St.3d 169, 170, 478 N.E.2d 781 (1985); *State v. Lukacs*, 188 Ohio App.3d 597, 2010-Ohio-2364, 936 N.E.2d 506, ¶ 41 (1st Dist.).
The government must aver all material facts constituting the essential elements of the offense so that the accused has adequate notice and an opportunity to defend. *Sellards* at 170; *Lukacs* at 41. But the indictment need not contain a recitation of the evidence supporting the various facts. *Lukacs* at ¶ 41; *State v. Gingell*, 7 Ohio App.3d 364, 366, 455 N.E.2d 1066 (1st Dist.1982). Generally, the requirements of an indictment may be met by reciting the language of the criminal statute. *State v. Childs*, 88 Ohio St.3d 194, 199, 724 N.E.2d 781 (2000).

{¶30} In this case, the indictments tracked the language of the applicable statutes. Therefore, the Khamisis can demonstrate no error. See *State v. Skatzes*, 104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, ¶ 26; *State v. Murphy*, 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 583, 605 N.E2d 884 (1992).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text describes the Khamisis' claims and the court's response to their arguments, but it does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶31} Further, each of the Khamisis was supplied with a bill of particulars. The accused can obtain more specific details by requesting a bill of particulars as provided in Crim.R. 7(E). But the bill of particulars need not provide the accused with specifications of the evidence or serve as a substitute for discovery. *Sellards* at 171; *Lukacs* at ¶ 43; *Gingell* at 367. The indictments and the bills of particulars together were sufficient to apprise the Khamisis of the charges against them. Therefore, they did not give rise to any error, much less structural error. See *State v. Roberts*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-040575 and C-050005, 2005-Ohio-4848, ¶ 9, reversed on other grounds, *In re Criminal Sentencing Statutes Cases*, 109 Ohio St.3d 313, 2006-Ohio-2109, 817 N.E.2d 1174.

{¶32} The Khamisis claimed throughout trial that they had no notice of the offenses with which they were charged. The record shows that they were provided with discovery, and that their claims that they had no notice were trial tactics. They were well aware of the factual basis of the charges against them. They took great
offense that the bill of particulars described them as “squatters,” and they argue that squatting is not necessarily illegal. The purpose of the bill of particulars is to provide notice. The use of the word is not improper, but even if it were, its use did not affect the validity of the notice.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text is discussing the validity of indictments and the role of the grand jury, not alleging any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶33} The Khamisis also argue that the indictments were not supported by sufficient and credible evidence. The grand jury, in inquiring into crimes and offenses returning indictments, does not exercise a judicial function. An indictment and subsequent proceedings based on that indictment are not rendered invalid on the ground that illegal and incompetent testimony was heard by the grand jury. Villasino v. Maxwell, 174 Ohio St. 483, 484-485, 190 N.E.2d 265 (1963); State v. Cunningham, 1st Dist. Warren No. 54, 1975 WL 181079, *4 (Dec. 29, 1975); Wickline v. Alvis, 103 Ohio App. 1, 9-10, 144 N.E.2d 207 (10th Dist.1957).

{¶34} Thus, an indictment valid on its face is not subject to challenge on the ground that the grand jury acted on the basis of inadequate or incompetent evidence. United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 344-345, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974); State v. Blalock, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 80419 and 80420, 2002-Ohio-4580, ¶ 24. “An indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury, like an information drawn by a prosecutor, if valid on its face, is enough to call for the trial of the charge on the merits.” Villasino at 485; Blalock at ¶ 24.

The Khamisis are challenging the validity of their indictments and the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, not alleging any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶35} In this case, the indictments were valid on their faces. Therefore, the Khamisis cannot challenge the evidence supporting the indictments. It appears they are actually trying to challenge the weight and sufficiency of the evidence at trial, but they have not raised assignments of error to that effect. Because they failed to raise assignments of error challenging the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, we need
not address those issues. See State v. Harris, 2017-Ohio-5594, 92 N.E.3d 1283, ¶ 43 (1st Dist.).

{¶36} Finally, under these assignments of error, the Khamisis argue that their not-guilty pleas were entered against their wishes. Crim.R. 11(A) provides that if a defendant refuses to plead, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty on behalf of the defendant. A not-guilty plea does not admit any facts and does not waive any of the defendant's rights, including the right to have the prosecution prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Schaeffer, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA92-04-038, 1993 WL 106146, *1 (Apr. 12, 1993). Because the Khamisis refused to enter pleas, the court could do so on their behalf and they were not prejudiced by the application of this rule. See Cleveland Metroparks v. Sferra, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106341, 2018-Ohio-3169, ¶ 22. Consequently, we overrule the Khamisis' first assignments of error.

IV. Self-Representation

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text describes an assignment of error by the Khamisis, not the prosecutor. The Khamisis are arguing that the court committed a structural error by denying them the right to represent themselves.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶37} In their second assignments of error, the Khamisis argue that the court committed structural error by denying them the right to represent themselves. Both the United States Supreme Court and the Ohio Supreme Court have recognized a criminal defendant's right to represent himself or herself at trial without counsel when the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily chooses to waive counsel. See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 819-820, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975); State v. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, ¶ 23-24; Furr, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170046, 2018-Ohio-2205, at ¶ 6. The right to represent oneself is “thwarted when counsel is forced upon an unwilling defendant, who alone bears the risks of a potential conviction.” State v. Obermiller, 147 Ohio
The record does not show that the Khamisis were denied their rights to represent themselves. Originally, the trial court had recognized their rights to represent themselves and had advised them it was bad idea. Subsequently, the Khamisis refused to sign written waivers of counsel, although they had indicated that they wished to represent themselves. The trial court, believing that a written waiver was required, told them they would be appointed lawyers.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text above is describing the procedure for waiver of counsel in ""serious offense"" cases under Crim.R. 44, and it does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Crim.R. 44 governs the procedure for waiver of counsel in “serious offense” cases. A “serious offense” includes any felony. Crim.R. 2(C). Under Crim.R. 44(A), when a defendant is unable to obtain counsel, counsel must be assigned to represent the defendant in all stages of the proceedings, unless the defendant, after being fully advised of his right to counsel, knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waives his right to counsel. Furr at ¶ 7. The waiver must be made in open court and must be in writing. Crim.R. 44(C).

But, the written waiver is not constitutionally required, so a trial court needs only to substantially comply with Crim.R. 44. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, at ¶ 38; Furr, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170046, 2018-Ohio-2205, at ¶ 8. A court substantially complies with Crim.R. 44 when it makes a sufficient inquiry to determine whether the defendant fully understands and intelligently relinquishes the right to counsel. Martin at ¶ 39; Furr at ¶ 8.

Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text describes the Khamisis' self-representation and the trial court's actions, but it does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
At the next hearing, the trial court stated that it had made a mistake because only substantial compliance with Crim.R. 44 was required. It then informed the Khamisis of the nature of the charges, the range of allowable punishments, possible defenses to the charges and “the other facts essential to a broad
understanding of the whole matter.” See State v. Gibson, 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 377, 345 N.E.2d 399 (1976); Furr at ¶ 9. It also explained the disadvantages of self-representation and that they would be required to follow the same rules and procedures that normally govern the conduct of a trial. See Furr at ¶ 9; State v. Murphy, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170390, 2018-Ohio-1063, ¶ 6. The court then determined that they knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived their rights to counsel.

¶42 The Khamisis then represented themselves throughout the trial. Many of the issues of which they now complain were the result of their inexperience and lack of counsel. A defendant who elects to represent himself cannot complain about the quality of his own defense. Faretta, 422 U.S. at 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, fn. 46.

¶43 One of the Khamisis’ complaints involves an order the trial court journalized early in the proceedings. The court ordered the clerk of courts to remove the case completely from display on the clerk’s website. It also stated that all parties had to seek leave of court before obtaining copies of any filings in the case. The record shows that the court made that order because the Khamisis had attempted to evade arrest, and they were not all arrested at the same time.

Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text describes the Khamisis' arguments and the court's responses, but it does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶44 The case was later assigned to a visiting judge. When the Khamisis argued that the order prevented them from defending themselves, the court said that “my interpretation was that some documents were being attempted to be filed in this case while one or more of you had an outstanding warrant; that was the rationale that I thought for the issuance of that order.” The court agreed to rescind the order, which was vacated less than four months after it was journalized.
The court also offered to grant a continuance. The Khamisis initially refused and argued about the alleged lack of notice and jurisdiction. After a lot of back-and-forth, the court granted a continuance. In fact, the court went to great lengths to ensure that the Khamisis received transcripts of the various hearings and had access to the internet at the jail. Thus, they were not prevented from preparing a defense.

Next, the Khamisis argue that because they represented themselves they were forced to appear in front of the jury in jail garb. Courts have recognized that a defendant may be prejudiced by appearing in jail clothing, but a defendant may purposefully elect, as a matter of trial strategy, to stand trial in that attire. See Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 504-505, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976); State v. Gandy, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-050804, 2006-Ohio-6282, ¶ 4. There is no rule requiring all convictions in which the defendant has worn jail clothing be overturned. Instead, the inquiry focuses on whether the accused's appearance before the jury was compelled. Gandy at ¶ 4.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"Yes. The text describes an allegation that the prosecutor (the state) committed misconduct by addressing the issue of the defendants' clothing during voir dire, despite being instructed not to do so.","Context information is below.
---------------------
The Khamisis raised the issue about the same time that they were arguing about the order removing the case from the clerk of court's website, which did not allow the parties to file any documents at that time without leave of court. Kaia said that she had asked her caseworker about wearing regular clothing, and the caseworker had said they could not “do anything” without an order from the trial court. The trial court stated, “See, this is one of the major disadvantages you have by not having an attorney, because the attorney would immediately ask that you be permitted to wear civilian clothes.” Then a public defender who was involved in the case said that his office had a bank of clothes and “we can try to get them in civilian clothes if they are interested.” They all said they were not interested.
Thus, they were not compelled to appear before the jury in jail clothing. They chose to do so. Further, the court said that it would instruct the jury that it should not hold the fact that they were wearing prison garb against them. The Khamisis said they didn’t want the instruction as they were preparing their own jury instructions.

The Khamisis further argue that the prosecutor addressed the issue even though he was instructed not to, which is untrue. Moreover, the prosecutor merely told the potential jurors during voir dire that “[t]he State and the Court have also offered these defendants [the] right to not appear in jail garb as well; that was their choice to do that, and you will not hold that against them, will you?” Therefore, the Khamisis were not prejudiced.

Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text describes the Khamisis' arguments and the court's findings, but it does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Next, the Khamisis argue that their family member, Kijai, was denied the right to advise them and to file documents on their behalf. They also argue that she was imprisoned for three days without probable cause. The record shows that the trial court found her in contempt for giggling and laughing in the court room and interrupting the court. Nothing in the record shows that that finding of contempt was improper. Moreover, the Khamisis lacked standing to raise the issue of the validity of that contempt finding. Litigants may assert their own rights, not the rights of third parties. Util. Serv. Partners, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., 124 Ohio St.3d 284, 2009-Ohio-6764, 921 N.E.3d 1038, ¶ 49; In re K.C., 2017-Ohio-8383, 99 N.E.3d 1061, ¶ 5 (1st Dist.).

Further, while the Khamisis had the right to represent themselves, they did not have the right to have a nonattorney advise them or file anything on their behalf. Only a licensed attorney may file pleadings on behalf of another in
court. R.C. 4705.01; State ex rel. Army of Twelve Monkeys v. Warren Cty. Ct. of Common Pleas, 156 Ohio St.3d 346, 2019-Ohio-901, 126 N.E.3d 1113, ¶ 5.

886-KHAMISI,"No. The text describes the Khamisis' assignments of error, which allege that the trial court committed misconduct, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶52} Finally, the Khamisis make numerous references to excessive bail. Habeas corpus is the proper remedy to raise a claim of excessive bail in pretrial-release cases. Chari v. Vore, 91 Ohio St.3d 323, 325, 744 N.E.2d 763 (2001); State v. Towns, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 88059, 2007-Ohio-529, ¶ 20. After conviction, any error concerning pretrial bail is moot, and the issue cannot be raised on direct appeal. State v. Knisley, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22897, 2010-Ohio-116, ¶ 25; Towns at ¶ 20. Consequently, we overrule the Khamisis’ second assignments of error.

V. Impartial Judge/Jurisdiction

{¶53} In their third assignments of error, the Khamisis argue that the trial court committed structural error by denying their right to an impartial judge. They argue that the trial court was biased against them, ignored jurisdiction, denied their right to represent themselves, set excessive bail, and misstated the law and the facts. These assignments of error are not well taken.

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text is describing an assignment of error related to the trial judge's potential bias, not the prosecutor's misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶54} First, as a general rule, a direct appeal is not the proper place to raise an argument that the trial judge was biased. The proper avenue for redress when a party believes that a trial judge is biased is the filing of an affidavit of bias and prejudice with the Supreme Court of Ohio as provided for in R.C. 2701.03. Gandy, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-050804, 2006-Ohio-6282, at ¶ 22. The Khamisis filed affidavits of bias and prejudice against the original trial judge, which the Ohio Supreme Court denied.
But even if we address the merits of the issue, the Khamisis’ arguments still fail. A trial before a judge who is not impartial results in structural error that would require reversal without a harmless-error analysis. *State v. Sanders*, 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 278, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001); *State v. Buck*, 2017-Ohio-8242, 100 N.E.3d 118, ¶ 82 (1st Dist.). The Ohio Supreme Court has described judicial bias as “a hostile feeling or spirit of ill will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and facts.” *Buck* at ¶ 83, quoting *State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt*, 164 Ohio St. 463, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956), paragraph four of the syllabus.

Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text describes the Khamisis' arguments against the judges, not the prosecutor. The error is not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
A trial court is presumed to be fair and impartial. *In re Disqualification of Kilpatrick*, 47 Ohio St.3d 605, 606, 546 N.E.2d 929 (1989); *Gandy* at ¶ 23. The Khamisis have failed to overcome this presumption relating to the original trial judge or the visiting judge. The judges’ failure to provide the relief to which the Khamisis believe they were entitled does not establish actual bias. See *State v. Jackson*, 149 Ohio St.3d 55, 2016-Ohio-5488, 73 N.E.3d 414, ¶ 40. Further, the fact that the Khamisis had filed litigation against the judges or that the judges had presided over the civil quiet-title actions, without more, does not establish bias. See *In re Disqualification of Pokorny*, 135 Ohio St.3d 1268, 2013-Ohio-915, 986 N.E.2d 993, ¶ 4; *In re Disqualification of Bryant*, 117 Ohio St.3d 1251, 2006-Ohio-7227, 885 N.E.2d 246, ¶ 4.

The Khamisis argue that both judges ignored their motions. Both judges simply refused to reconsider the same motions they had already ruled on that the Khamisis continued to raise time and again. When a court fails to rule on a
pending motion, we presume that the court elected to overrule it. *State v. Smith*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-180439 and C-180604, 2019-Ohio-5350, ¶ 13.

Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text describes the Khamisis' arguments against the visiting judge, not the prosecutor. The Khamisis are alleging that the judge imposed his own morality upon the proceedings and that they were prejudiced due to the bailiff's relationship with the original trial judge.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶58} Next, the Khamisis contend that the visiting judge imposed his own morality upon the proceedings. The remarks about which they complain occurred at the sentencing hearing where the judge asked how they could morally justify taking other people's property. This is a proper consideration at sentencing. *See State v. Arnett*, 88 Ohio St.3d 208, 221-222, 724 N.E.2d 302 (2000); *State v. Brown*, 11th Dist. Geauga No. 2003-G-2504, 2004-Ohio-1843, ¶ 35; *State v. Golson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 17707, 2001 WL 227372, *7* (Mar. 9, 2001).

{¶59} The Khamisis argue that even though the visiting judge tried the case, they were prejudiced because the bailiff was the original trial judge's sister, which they did not learn until after trial. Much of this argument involves matters outside the record on appeal, which we cannot consider. *See State v. Ishmail*, 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 405-406, 377 N.E.2d 500 (1978); *State v. Dieterle*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-070796, 2009-Ohio-1888, ¶ 49. Nothing in the record shows that the bailiff influenced the jury or acted in a way to deny the Khamisis a fair trial.

886-KHAMISI,"No. The text is describing an argument made by the Khamisis, not an allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶60} Finally, the Khamisis argue that both judges ignored their lack of jurisdiction, which was actually the crux of their arguments throughout the proceedings. They fail to understand the nature of subject-matter jurisdiction. Subject-matter jurisdiction involves a court's power to hear a case. *State v. Mbodj*, 129 Ohio St.3d 325, 2011-Ohio-2880, 951 N.E.2d 1025, ¶ 10.

{¶61} Section 4(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution provides that “[t]he courts of common pleas and divisions thereof shall have such original jurisdiction over all justiciable matters and such powers of review of proceedings as may be provided by law.” R.C. 2931.03 provides that jurisdiction over all crimes and
offenses is vested in the court of common pleas, general division, unless jurisdiction is specifically and exclusively vested in other divisions of the court or in the lower courts. *State ex rel. McMinn v. Whitfield*, 27 Ohio St.3d 4, 5, 500 N.E.2d 875 (1986). Moreover, “[a]bsent a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court with general subject-matter jurisdiction may determine its own jurisdiction.” *State ex rel. Brown v. Luebbers*, 137 Ohio St.3d 542, 2013-Ohio-5062, 1 N.E.3d 395, ¶ 12. The court had jurisdiction to hear the case, and the fact that it did not agree with the Khamisis’ arguments does not mean that the court lacked jurisdiction.

Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text describes the Khamisis' assignments of error, which allege that the trial court committed misconduct, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶62} In sum, nothing in the record shows that the trial court violated its duty of impartiality or behaved in a way that deprived the Khamisis of a fair trial. *See State v. Brewster*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-030024 and C-030025, 2004-Ohio-2993, ¶ 68-69; *State v. Johnson*, 140 Ohio App.3d 385, 391-392, 747 N.E.2d 863 (1st Dist.2000). Consequently, we overrule the Khamisis’ third assignments of error.

**V. Public Trial/Jury Issues**

{¶63} In their fourth assignments of error, the Khamisis contend that the trial court committed structural error by denying their rights to a public trial, a jury of their peers, and a fair trial. They argue that the trial court ignored jurisdiction, denied them their rights to represent themselves, set excessive bail, misstated the law and facts, and failed to be impartial. These assignments of error are not well taken.

{¶64} Some of arguments the Khamisis make under these assignments of error are a rehash of arguments we have already rejected. As to the right to a public trial, the United States and Ohio Constitutions guarantee an accused the right to a public trial. *Waller v. Georgia*, 467 U.S. 39, 46, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31
The violation of the right to a public trial is considered structural error and not subject to the harmless-error analysis. *Waller* at 49-50; *State v. Drummond*, 111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.3d 1038, ¶ 50.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,No. The text describes a situation involving the trial court's decision to control the proceedings and the Khamisis' complaint about the lack of space for potential jurors. It does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶65 The right to a public trial is not absolute, and in some instances, must yield to other interests. The trial court has broad discretion to exercise control over the proceedings. The court may order the exclusion of spectators as long as it does not inappropriately deny the defendant’s right to a public trial. *Drummond* at ¶ 51; *State v. Curtis*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150174, 2016-Ohio-1318, ¶ 17.

¶66 The record does not show that the trial court closed the courtroom. Prior to voir dire, the Khamisis claimed that they were told that nobody, with the exception of Kimberly’s mother and her “counselor,” would be able to attend. The trial court indicated that it had concerns about the lack of space for potential jurors. It stated that “[w]ell, that was for purposes of voir dire, and that’s just a matter of we’ve got no place to put anybody.” It went on, “I have no problem with anybody being in here as long as they don’t pose a security risk. * * * I don’t care if you fill up with your community or other people or the general public.”

¶67 The Khamisis complained that “[i]t wasn’t relayed that way” and “it’s too late, because it’s now the jury selection process and my community is not here that’s too late for that one.” The court replied that “as soon as we get the jury, hopefully one of your people can let the community know that they’re welcome to be here.”

Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text describes the Khamisis' arguments against the trial process, not the prosecutor's misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶68 Federal courts have held that exclusion of a defendant’s friends or family members because of a lack of space does not deprive the defendant of the right to a public trial. *See Bunn v. Lopez*, E.D.Cal. No. 2:11-cv-1373, 2016 WL
Moreover, the record is inconclusive as to whether any one was actually excluded from the courtroom at any time. We cannot hold, without more, that the Khamisis were denied the right to a public trial. See State v Williams, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26014, 2012-Ohio-5873, ¶ 10.

Next, the Khamisis argue that they were denied a jury of their peers because none of the jurors were aware of the doctrine of adverse possession. A jury of one’s peers means a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 527, 95 S.Ct. 692, 42 L.Ed.2d 690 (1975); State v. Seymour, 5th Dist. Richland No. 03-CA-37, 2004-Ohio-3835, ¶ 53. A defendant is entitled to a qualified panel of citizens “selected by the best method that thoughtful men, who are cognizant of the practicalities of selection and the inherent problems involved, have been able to develop.” State v. McCarter, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-830823, 1984 WL 6715, *2 (July 25, 1984), quoting State v. Strodes, 48 Ohio St.2d 113, 115, 357 N.E.2d 375 (1976), vacated on other grounds, 438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1978).

Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text is describing an assignment of error related to the composition of the jury and the instructions given to the jury, not misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
To establish a violation of this requirement, the defendant must prove, among other things, that the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community. State v. Fulton, 57 Ohio St.3d 120, 566 N.E.2d 1195 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus; State v. Ford, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014CA00145, 2015-Ohio-4093, ¶ 19. People aware of adverse possession are not a distinctive group in the community. A criminal defendant has no affirmative right to a jury of a particular racial, gender or age composition, much less one aware of certain legal doctrines. See Seymour at ¶ 54. Thus, the Khamisis have to failed show that they were not tried by a jury of their peers.
Finally, the Khamisis argue that they were denied a fair trial because the jury was not instructed on the issue of adverse possession. The trial court must fully and completely give all jury instructions that are relevant and necessary for the jury to weigh the evidence and to discharge its duty as the trier of fact. *State v. Comen*, 50 Ohio St.3d 206, 553 N.E.2d 640 (1990), paragraph two of the syllabus; *State v. Robinson*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-060434, 2007-Ohio-2388, ¶ 18. A trial court must give a defendant’s requested instructions to the jury if they are correct, pertinent statements of law and are appropriate under the facts of the case. *State v. Lessin*, 67 Ohio St.3d 487, 493, 620 N.E.2d 72 (1993); *Brewster*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-030024 and C-030025, 2004-Ohio-2993, at ¶ 58.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
886-KHAMISI,"No. The text is describing a legal decision regarding the trial court's refusal to give an instruction on adverse possession, not alleging any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
The Khamisis’ defense at trial was that the properties were abandoned and they were in the process of establishing adverse possession of the properties. The trial court instructed the jury regarding whether property was abandoned, but refused to give an instruction on adverse possession because the evidence did not warrant it. We agree with the trial court’s decision.

Adverse possession is disfavored in the law, as it is in contravention of the ideals set forth in the Constitution protecting life, liberty and property. *Houck v. Bd. of Park Commrs. of the Huron Cty. Park Dist.*, 116 Ohio St.3d 148, 2007-Ohio-5586, 876 N.E.2d 1210, ¶ 29; *Grace v. Koch*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-950802, 1996 WL 577843, *2-3 (Oct. 9, 1996), affirmed, 81 Ohio St.3d 577, 692 N.E.2d 1009 (1998). Title is strictly construed in favor of the person holding legal title and against the adverse claimant. *Grace* at *3.

A person seeking to establish adverse possession must show exclusive possession that is open, notorious, continuous, and adverse for 21 years. *Evanich v. Bridge*, 119 Ohio St.3d 260, 2008-Ohio-3820, 893 N.E.2d 481, ¶ 7; *Grace* at *3. The
Khamisis, by their own admission, had not been in possession of any of the properties for 21 years. Therefore, an instruction on adverse possession was not supported by the evidence.

{¶75} Despite their attempts to justify their conduct, the record is clear that they were never anything but trespassers and had no legal interest in the properties at all. They cannot show that they were entitled to the properties by adverse possession. “A claim for continuing trespass may be brought at any time until the claim has ripened into a presumptive right by adverse possession, which takes 21 years.” Reith v. McGill Smith Punshon, Inc., 163 Ohio App.3d 709, 2005-Ohio-4852, 840 N.E.2d 226, ¶ 50 (1st Dist).

{¶76} Simply put, attempting to establish adverse possession is not a defense to a charge of theft or tampering with records. The trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on adverse possession. The Khamisis were not denied their rights to a fair trial, and we overrule their fourth assignments of error.

VI. Summary

{¶77} In sum, we find no merit in any of the Khamisis’ assignments of error. They have not demonstrated that the trial court committed reversible error, much less structural error. Therefore, we overrule all of their assignments of error, and we affirm the trial court’s judgments.

Judgments affirmed.

Mock, P.J., and Crouse, J., concur.
