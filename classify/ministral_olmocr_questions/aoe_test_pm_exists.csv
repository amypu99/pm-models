¶ 1 Appellant, Austin Gregory Myers, appeals a decision of the Warren County Court of Common Pleas denying his motion for leave to conduct discovery and petition for postconviction relief.
I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

¶ 2 On January 27, 2014, Myers and codefendant, Timothy Mosley, began to plot burglarizing the home of a known drug dealer or the home of Justin Back, Myers’ childhood friend. Mark Cates, Back's stepfather, purportedly had a safe containing a firearm and money. Ultimately, Myers and Mosley chose to burglarize the Cates' home. The two men drove to the Cates' home. Upon knocking, they were surprised when Back answered the door. The two men briefly visited with Back and then left. Upon leaving the Cates' home, Myers suggested they return to the home, kill Back, and steal the contents of the safe. Myers and Mosley began to plan Back's murder.

¶ 3 They initially planned to kill Back by injecting him with cold medicine. In furtherance of their plan, they attempted to purchase cold medicine and a bottle of poisonous ""bug wash""; however, Myers' credit card was declined. Later that day, Myers and Mosley returned to the Cates' home and watched a movie with Back. When Cates came home from work, he joined them in watching the movie for a short time until he and Back had to leave for an appointment with a Navy recruiter. Myers and Mosley then left the house.

¶ 4 Myers and Mosley continued to discuss how to murder Back and burglarize the Cates' home. As they discussed their plans, Mosley wrote down their ideas in a small notebook. The two men hatched a scheme to strangle Back with a wire, take the safe, and make it look as though Back had stolen the safe and run away from home. The two men further planned to dump Back's body in a remote wooded area. Myers and Mosley purchased galvanized steel cable and two metal rope cleats to fashion a garrote. The garrote was put together by their friend Logan Zennie.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing the events leading up to and following the murder of Back, as well as the legal proceedings against Myers and Mosley. It does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 5 The next morning, January 28, 2014, Myers and Mosley bought ammonia, septic-tank cleaner, and rubber gloves. They believed the septic enzymes would help to
decompose the body in cold weather. Around 1:00 p.m., the two men went to the Cates' home. Mosley was carrying the garrote as well as a five- or six-inch pocketknife. The plan was for Myers to distract Back while Mosley came up behind him. Myers would hold Back down while Mosley would choke him to death with the garrote. After the two men arrived at the Cates' home, Back offered them a drink which Myers accepted. As Back was reaching into the refrigerator, Mosley came up behind him and tried to pull the garrote around his throat. However, the garrote only looped around Back's chin. Mosley panicked and as Myers restrained Back, Mosley repeatedly stabbed him with his knife. As Back begged for his life, Myers simply told him it would be over soon.

After the murder, Myers and Mosley wrapped Back's body in a blanket, cleaned up the crime scene, and found the safe. Myers also found a handgun belonging to Cates, which he loaded. The two men shoved Back's body into the trunk of Mosley's car and left the house with the safe and various other stolen items. They stopped at Mosley's home where they cleaned up and changed clothes. They eventually dumped Back's body behind a log in a field in Preble County. Myers poured ammonia and septic enzymes onto Back's body. Myers then shot the body twice with the stolen handgun before it jammed. Myers and Mosley were later apprehended; Back's body was discovered on January 29, 2014. An autopsy determined that Back had died of multiple stab wounds. At the time of the murder, Myers and Mosley were both 19 years old.

Myers was indicted in February 2014 on one count of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design and one count of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B). Both counts were accompanied by three death-penalty specifications. Myers was further indicted for aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, grand theft of a firearm, and abuse of a corpse, all with an accompanying firearm specification, and kidnapping, tampering with evidence, and safecracking. Mosley was indicted on similar charges.
However, a week before Myers' jury trial, Mosley reached a plea agreement in which he agreed to testify against Myers. Mosley pled guilty to all charges in exchange for the dismissal of the death-penalty specifications; he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

¶ 8 The guilt phase of Myers' jury trial commenced on September 22, 2014. On October 2, 2014, the jury found Myers guilty on all counts and specifications. The two aggravated-murder counts were merged for purposes of sentencing; the state elected to proceed on the prior-calculation-and-design aggravated murder count with the aggravated-robbery specification.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The assignments of error are related to the trial court's denial of Myers' PCR petition and discovery motions, not any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 9 The penalty phase of the jury trial was held on October 6, 2014. Myers presented the testimony of his parents and a sibling and made an unsworn statement by way of mitigation. Myers had no prior criminal history or delinquency adjudications. The jury recommended a death sentence. On October 16, 2014, the trial court sentenced Myers to death and imposed prison sentences on the noncapital counts. Myers' conviction and death sentence were subsequently upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court. State v. Myers, 154 Ohio St.3d 405, 2018-Ohio-1903.

¶ 10 On November 10, 2016, while his appeal was pending before the supreme court, Myers filed a petition for postconviction relief (""PCR petition""), raising 60 grounds for relief. The PCR petition challenged the constitutionality of the death penalty and the Ohio statutes governing its imposition, argued that Myers was denied the effective assistance of counsel during both the guilt and penalty phases of the trial, and alleged violation of Myers' due process rights. On November 18, 2016, Myers moved for leave to conduct discovery in support of his PCR petition. In 2017, the state filed an answer to the PCR petition, then moved for summary judgment. In January 2018, the trial court issued a scheduling order which provided that Myers could file a supplemental motion for discovery by March 1, 2018,
and that the state's summary judgment motion would be held in abeyance pending resolution of Myers' discovery motion.

¶ 11 On March 1, 2018, Myers filed a supplemental motion for discovery, arguing he was entitled to conduct discovery in support of his PCR petition pursuant to newly-amended R.C. 2953.21, which became effective on April 6, 2017. The amended statute makes substantial changes regarding PCR petitions in death-penalty cases, and in particular, allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery in aid of their PCR petition if good cause is shown. State v. Ketterer, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2016-08-166, 2017-Ohio-4117, ¶ 46.

¶ 12 On July 3, 2018, the trial court denied Myers' discovery motions. The trial court found that amended R.C. 2953.21 was not applicable in the case at bar because the statute did not explicitly state it was retroactive. Alternatively, the trial court found that even if the statutory amendment was applied retroactively, Myers was not entitled to discovery as he had not demonstrated ""good cause.""

¶ 13 On November 26, 2018, Myers filed a memorandum opposing the state's motion for summary judgment; the memorandum included 12 additional documents consisting of affidavits, transcripts, and documentary evidence. Myers' memorandum and supplemental appendix triggered additional pleadings from the parties. Ultimately, the trial court never ruled upon the state's summary judgment motion. Instead, on June 27, 2019, the trial court denied Myers' PCR petition without a hearing. The trial court found that Myers' claims were either barred by res judicata or failed to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, and therefore, ""no evidentiary hearing [was] required.""

¶ 14 Myers now appeals the trial court's denial of his PCR petition and discovery motions, raising 11 assignments of error.
II. ANALYSIS


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text above is describing the standards of review for postconviction relief petitions and does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
A. Standards of Review for Postconviction Relief Petitions

{¶ 15} A postconviction proceeding is a collateral civil attack on a criminal judgment, not an appeal of a criminal conviction. State v. Dillingham, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2012-02-037 and CA2012-02-042, 2012-Ohio-5841, ¶ 8. To prevail on a PCR petition, the petitioner must establish a violation of his constitutional rights that renders the judgment of conviction void or voidable. R.C. 2953.21. A PCR petition does not provide a petitioner a second opportunity to litigate his or her conviction, nor is the petitioner automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing. State v. Rose, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-03-050, 2012-Ohio-5957, ¶ 16. A trial court properly denies a PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing if the supporting affidavits, the documentary evidence, the files, and the records of the case do not demonstrate that the petitioner set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief. State v. Blankenburg, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-04-088, 2012-Ohio-6175, ¶ 9; R.C. 2953.21.

{¶ 16} ""It is well established that a trial court may dismiss a postconviction relief petition on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata."" State v. Davis, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-12-258, 2013-Ohio-3878, ¶ 30. Under res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment or conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment. State v. Wagers, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2011-08-007, 2012-Ohio-2258, ¶ 10, citing State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 1996-Ohio-337, syllabus.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error related to the summary dismissal of Myers' PCR (Post-Conviction Relief) petition, not alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 17} The presentation of competent, relevant, and material evidence outside the record may defeat the application of res judicata. State v. Lawson, 103 Ohio App.3d 307,
315 (12th Dist.1995). The evidence submitted with the petition cannot be merely cumulative of or alternative to evidence presented at trial. *State v. Jackson*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104132, 2017-Ohio-2651, ¶ 16. To overcome the res judicata bar, evidence outside the record must demonstrate that the petitioner could not have appealed the constitutional claim based upon information in the original record. *State v. Piesciuk*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-01-011, 2013-Ohio-3879, ¶ 18. If evidence outside the record is ""'marginally significant and does not advance the petitioner's claim beyond a mere hypothesis and a desire for further discovery,' res judicata still applies to the claim."" *State v. Cowans*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA98-10-090, 1999 Ohio App. LEXIS 4157, *8-9 (Sept. 7, 1999).

{¶ 18} ""In reviewing an appeal of postconviction relief proceedings, this court applies an abuse of discretion standard."" *State v. Snead*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2014-01-014, 2014-Ohio-2895, ¶ 16. ""The term 'abuse of discretion' connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court's attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable."" *State v. Thornton*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-09-063, 2013-Ohio-2394, ¶ 34; *State v. Hancock*, 108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, ¶ 130. The trial court does not abuse its discretion in dismissing a PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing if (1) the petitioner fails to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, or (2) the operation of res judicata prohibits the claims made in the petition. *State v. Maxwell*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107758, 2020-Ohio-3027, ¶ 25.

{¶ 19} With these principles and standards in mind, we now address Myers' assignments of error together and out of order where appropriate.

**B. Summary Dismissal of Myers' PCR Petition**

{¶ 20} Assignment of Error No. 1:


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The error is not alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it is challenging the trial court's failure to rule upon the state's summary judgment motion and its election to grant a summary dismissal of Myers' PCR petition.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 21} THE TRIAL COURT DENIED MYERS' RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS, ACCESS TO THE OHIO COURTS, AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, AND
VIOLATED R.C. § 2953.21, WHEN IT TREATED THE STATE'S POST-ANSWER ""MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT"" AS A MOTION SEEKING SUMMARILY DISMISSAL (sic) UNDER R.C. § 2953.21(C) [NOW (D)], AND FAILED TO APPLY THE REQUISITE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARDS IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING EVERY CLAIM SET FORTH IN MYERS' PCR PETITION.

¶ 22 This assignment of error challenges the trial court's failure to rule upon the state's summary judgment motion and the court's election instead to grant a summary dismissal of Myers' PCR petition. Specifically, Myers argues that the trial court erred in granting a summary dismissal of his PCR petition where there was a pending, fully briefed motion for summary judgment. Myers asserts that because the state filed an answer to the PCR petition and a motion for summary judgment and failed to move for dismissal of the petition under R.C. 2953.21(D), the trial court was required to apply the standard set forth in R.C. 2953.21(E) and was precluded from summarily dismissing the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D).¹

¶ 23 R.C. 2953.21 provides three methods for adjudicating a PCR petition: (1) ""summary dismissal"" under R.C. 2953.21(D) and State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 1999-Ohio-102, paragraph two of the syllabus; (2) ""summary judgment"" under R.C. 2953.21(E); and (3) an ""evidentiary hearing"" under R.C. 2953.21(F). State v. Blankenburg, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-11-197, 2014-Ohio-4621, ¶ 23.

¶ 24 Under R.C. 2953.21(E), either party may move for summary judgment on the issues raised. In ruling on a summary judgment motion in proceedings involving a PCR petition, the trial court must use the same standards set forth in Civ.R. 56(C), i.e., a party is

371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing the application of a statute (R.C. 2953.21) and the conditions for summary judgment in postconviction proceedings, but it does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¹. As stated earlier, R.C. 2953.21 was amended, effective April 6, 2017, and some of its provisions were renumbered. As pertinent here, former R.C. 2953.21(C), (D), and (E) were renumbered 2953.21(D), (E), and (F). We note that for purposes of this assignment of error, the language of the applicable renumbered statutory provisions is identical to the language of their pre-amendment counterparts. We therefore elect to apply the current version of R.C. 2953.21.
entitled to summary judgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. *State v. Francis*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-05-078, 2014-Ohio-443, ¶ 11. Summary judgment in postconviction proceedings is appropriate only if the right to summary judgment appears on the face of the record. R.C. 2953.21(E); *Id.*

¶ 25 Under R.C. 2953.21(D), ""a trial court properly denies a defendant's petition for postconviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing where the petition, the supporting affidavits, the documentary evidence, the files, and the records do not demonstrate that petitioner set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief."" *Calhoun*, 86 Ohio St.3d 279 at paragraph two of the syllabus; *Francis* at ¶ 12.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text is describing a legal decision regarding the trial court's handling of a postconviction relief (PCR) petition, not alleging any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 26 We find that the trial court did not err in granting a summary dismissal of Myers' PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D) notwithstanding the state's motion for summary judgment and its failure to move for dismissal of the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D). We have held that R.C. 2953.21(D) ""explicitly requires the trial court to look beyond the petition and examine the record in order to determine whether there are substantive grounds for relief. The trial court must independently review the record and address the substance of a petitioner's claims regardless of whether the state responds to his petition for postconviction relief."" *State v. Wallen*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA97-02-017, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 3647, *4 (Aug. 11, 1997). See also *State v. Hartman*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27162, 2017-Ohio-7933 (a trial court has an independent duty to analyze a PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21[D]); *State v. McCabe*, 4th Dist. Washington No. 97CA32, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 4487 (Sept. 14, 1998) (it is well settled that, regardless of whether or not the state responds to a petition for postconviction relief, R.C. 2953.21[D] requires the trial court
to sua sponte analyze the petition). Thus, the trial court was required to independently determine whether there were substantive grounds for relief and the pendency of the state's motion for summary judgment did not preclude the trial court from summarily dismissing the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D). See State v. McKelton, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-02-028, 2015-Ohio-4228; State v. Noling, 11th Dist. Portage No. 98-P-0049, 2003-Ohio-5008.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above describes an assignment of error by the defendant (Myers) against the trial court, not the prosecutor. The error is related to the trial court's denial of discovery motions and its interpretation of the retroactivity of amended R.C. 2953.21.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 27 In his reply brief Myers argues for the first time that the trial court's summary dismissal of the PCR petition without prior notice to the parties violated the notice requirement of procedural due process. However, it is well established that an appellant may not raise new issues or assignments of error in a reply brief. State v. Renfro, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-07-142, 2012-Ohio-2848, ¶ 28, citing App.R. 16; State ex rel. Colvin v. Brunner, 120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041. A reply brief simply provides the appellant with an opportunity to respond to the arguments raised in the appellee's brief. State v. Quaterman, 140 Ohio St.3d 464, 2014-Ohio-4034, ¶ 18. Myers' argument is not appropriately before the court and will not be considered. Furthermore, as the discussion above makes clear, parties in postconviction proceedings are on notice of a trial court's sua sponte authority to grant a summary dismissal of a PCR petition. R.C. 2953.21; Hartman, 2017-Ohio-7933; McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228; McCabe, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 4487.

¶ 28 Myers' first assignment of error is overruled.

C. Discovery Motions

¶ 29 Assignment of Error No. 2:

¶ 30 THE TRIAL COURT DENIED MYERS' RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS, ACCESS TO THE OHIO COURTS, AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, AND VIOLATED R.C. § 2953.21(A)(1) AND ITS DISCOVERY AMENDMENTS, WHEN THE COURT HELD THAT THE DISCOVERY AMENDMENTS WERE NON-RETROACTIVE
AND THUS INAPPLICABLE TO MYERS' CASE, AND THEN ENFORCED AN UNREASONABLE AND IMPROPERLY-RESTRICTIVE DEFINITION OF ""GOOD CAUSE"" TO DENY DISCOVERY TO MYERS ON EVERY ONE OF HIS CLAIMS.

{¶ 31} Assignment of Error No. 3:

{¶ 32} EVEN UNDER THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE PCR STATUTE, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED MYERS' PCR PETITION WITHOUT AFFORDING HIM ANY OPPORTUNITY TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY.

{¶ 33} These assignments of error challenge the trial court's denial of Myers' discovery motions. As stated above, the trial court found that amended R.C. 2953.21 was not applicable in the case at bar because the statute did not explicitly state it was retroactive. Alternatively, the trial court found that even if the statutory amendment was applied retroactively, Myers was not entitled to discovery as he had not demonstrated ""good cause."" The statute was amended after Myers filed his PCR petition and first motion for discovery but before he filed his supplemental motion for discovery.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing the legal framework for postconviction relief (PCR) petitions in death-penalty cases, specifically the changes made by the amendment of R.C. 2953.21. It does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor or the state.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 34} Before R.C. 2953.21 was amended on April 6, 2017, it was well established that the statutory scheme governing postconviction relief did not entitle a petitioner to conduct discovery. State ex rel. Love v. Cuyahoga Cty. Prosecutor's Office, 87 Ohio St.3d 158, 159, 1999-Ohio-314; Ketterer, 2017-Ohio-4117 at ¶ 45. Nevertheless, discovery could be proper where a petitioner set forth operative facts outside the record that revealed a constitutional error in his or her case. Id. The granting or overruling of discovery motions rested within the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Lawson, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2011-07-056, 2012-Ohio-548, ¶ 17.

{¶ 35} Amended R.C. 2953.21 makes substantial changes regarding PCR petitions in death-penalty cases, and in particular, allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery in aid of their PCR petition if good cause is shown. Specifically, R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) now
provides that

At any time in conjunction with the filing of a petition for postconviction relief under division (A) of this section by a person who has been sentenced to death, or with the litigation of a petition so filed, the court, for good cause shown, may authorize the petitioner in seeking the postconviction relief and the prosecuting attorney of the county served by the court in defending the proceeding, to take depositions and to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in accordance with divisions (A)(1)(d), (A)(1)(e), and (C) of this section, and to any other form of discovery as in a civil action that the court in its discretion permits. The court may limit the extent of discovery under this division. In addition to discovery that is relevant to the claim and was available under Criminal Rule 16 through conclusion of the original criminal trial, the court, for good cause shown, may authorize the petitioner or prosecuting attorney to take depositions and issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in either of the following circumstances:

(i) For any witness who testified at trial or who was disclosed by the state prior to trial, except as otherwise provided in this division, the petitioner or prosecuting attorney shows clear and convincing evidence that the witness is material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to substantiate or refute the petitioner's claim that there is a reasonable probability of an altered verdict. This division does not apply if the witness was unavailable for trial or would not voluntarily be interviewed by the defendant or prosecuting attorney.

(ii) For any witness with respect to whom division (A)(1)(d)(i) of this section does not apply, the petitioner or prosecuting attorney shows good cause that the witness is material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to substantiate or refute the petitioner's claim that there is a reasonable probability of an altered verdict.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text is describing an assignment of error related to the application of a statute (R.C. 2953.21) and its retroactivity, not alleging any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 36 We first address whether the trial court erred in finding that amended R.C. 2953.21 does not apply to the case at bar because it is not retroactive. This is a strict legal issue which we review de novo. State v. Consilio, 114 Ohio St.3d 295, 2007-Ohio-4163, ¶ 8; State v. Gloff, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2019-06-047, 2020-Ohio-3143, ¶ 17.

¶ 37 It is well settled that a statute is presumed to apply prospectively unless
expressly declared to be retroactive. R.C. 1.48. Additionally, Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, prohibits the General Assembly from passing retroactive laws. Applying these two provisions, the Supreme Court of Ohio has established a two-part test to determine whether a statute may be applied retroactively. *Consilio*.

{¶ 38} Under this test, a reviewing court must first determine as a threshold matter whether the statute is expressly made retroactive. *Consilio*, 2007-Ohio-4163 at ¶ 10. ""The General Assembly's failure to clearly enunciate retroactivity ends the analysis and the relevant statute may be applied only prospectively."" *Id.* If, however, the General Assembly expressly indicated its intention that the statute apply retroactively, the reviewing court must then move to the second step of the analysis and ""determine whether the statute is remedial, in which case retroactive application is permitted, or substantive, in which case retroactive application is forbidden."" *State v. White*, 132 Ohio St.3d 344, 2012-Ohio-2583, ¶ 27.

{¶ 39} As the trial court properly found, R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) as amended does not explicitly state it is to be applied retroactively. ""A statute must clearly proclaim its own retroactivity to overcome the presumption of prospective application. Retroactivity is not to be inferred."" *Consilio* at ¶ 15. ""If the retroactivity of a statute is not expressly stated in plain terms, the presumption in favor of prospective application controls. Moreover, the General Assembly is presumed to know that it must include expressly retroactive language to create that effect, and it has done so in the past."" *Id.* Because amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) does not expressly mention retroactivity, we find that the statute applies prospectively and we need not determine whether the statute is remedial or substantive under the second prong of the test.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error related to the trial court's decision regarding discovery in a PCR (Post-Conviction Relief) petition, not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 40} We further find that by its plain terms the statute applies prospectively to pending PCR petitions in that it allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery, for good cause
shown, ""at any time in conjunction with the filing of a [PCR petition], or with the litigation of a petition so filed[.]"" (Emphasis added.) In the case at bar, amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) was not yet in effect when Myers filed his PCR petition. However, the PCR petition was still being litigated on April 6, 2017, when the amended statute became effective. Amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d), therefore, applies to Myers' PCR petition. See Gloff, 2020-Ohio-3143.

¶ 41 The statute requires that the petitioner demonstrate ""good cause"" as a prerequisite for a trial court to allow discovery. As stated above, the trial court alternatively found that Myers failed to show ""good cause.""

¶ 42 ""Good cause"" is not defined by the statute. Consequently, the trial court adopted the definition applied in federal habeas corpus proceedings, to wit, good cause exists ""where specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is * * * entitled to relief, it is the duty of the courts to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry."" Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 908-909, 117 S.Ct. 1793 (1997). ""Conversely, where a petitioner would not be entitled to relief on a particular claim, regardless of what facts he developed, he cannot show good cause for discovery on that claim."" Murphy v. Bradshaw, S.D.Ohio No. C-1-03-053, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15978, *2 (Sept. 13, 2003).

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes Myers' claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial, not misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 43 Before determining whether a petitioner is entitled to discovery under ""good cause,"" the court must first identify the essential elements of the claim on which discovery is sought. Bracy at 904. The burden of demonstrating the materiality of the information requested is on the moving party. Stanford v. Parker, 266 F.3d 442, 460 (6th Cir.2001). Discovery may be allowed where the petitioner's claims are ""neither patently frivolous nor palpably incredible"" and where ""the discovery he requests is specific, limited, and reasonably calculated to lead to evidence in support of his claim[.]"" Hill v. Mitchell, S.D.Ohio
No. 1:98-cv-452, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71975, *31-32 (Sept. 27, 2007). A petitioner is not entitled to go on a fishing expedition based on conclusory allegations. *Id.* at *5; *Williams v. Bagley*, 380 F.3d 932, 974 (6th Cir.2004). ""Even in a death penalty case, 'bald assertions and conclusory allegations do not provide sufficient ground to warrant requiring the state to respond to discovery or to require an evidentiary hearing.'"" *Stanford* at 460. Rather, the petitioner must set forth specific allegations of fact. *Williams* at 974.

¶ 44 Myers argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery because he demonstrated ""good cause"" or, alternatively, set forth operative facts outside the record that revealed constitutional errors. Myers further argues that the trial court misapplied the *Bracy* good cause standard by essentially requiring him to prove his claims as a prerequisite to discovery.

¶ 45 Myers' discovery motions were broad overall, seeking a wide range of information, records, and depositions of individuals, some of whom were identified only by category. The trial court broke down Myers' discovery requests into nine general categories of inquiry: (1) records in the custody of the Warren County Children's Services, the Warren County Department of Job and Family Services, and the Warren County Juvenile Court regarding Myers' family, (2) Myers' records from the Warren County Jail, (3) grand jury proceedings, (4) Mosley's institutional records, (5) records of the prosecutor's office and several law enforcement agencies relating to their investigation of Back's death and the arrest of Myers and Mosley, (6) depositions of law enforcement officers, (7) depositions of the jurors, (8) depositions of the attorneys on the prosecution team, and (9) depositions of the defense team.

¶ 46 Myers' first motion for discovery did not identify how his discovery requests related to his postconviction claims. By contrast, the supplemental motion for discovery argued that Myers was entitled to conduct discovery on (1) his claims of ineffective
assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial, (2) his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial, and (3) his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for an offender who was still a teenager at the time of the offense. In his brief, Myers argues the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery on the foregoing claims. We will address the trial court's denial of Myers' discovery motions concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial in conjunction with Myers' fifth assignment of error.

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error related to the trial court's denial of discovery motions, not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 47 Myers first argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery regarding his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for a 19-year-old offender at the time of the offense. In support of these constitutional challenges, Myers sought discovery of (1) the Warren County's training and instructional materials for judges, prosecutors, and sheriff deputies concerning behavioral characteristics and brain development of juveniles, adolescents, and late-adolescents (18-21 years old) offenders, and (2) Warren County's data concerning the prosecution of such juvenile, adolescent, and late-adolescent offenders for the previous seven years.

¶ 48 We find that Myers' requested discovery falls more into the category of a fishing expedition. Furthermore, as we discuss in the fourth assignment of error, Myers' claims are barred by res judicata and fail to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, given the election of the United States Supreme Court and Ohio Supreme Court not to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of 18 at the time of the crime. ""[W]here a petitioner would not be entitled to relief on a particular claim, regardless of what facts he developed, he cannot show good cause for discovery on that claim."" Murphy, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15978 at *2. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying Myers' motions for discovery regarding his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for a 19-year-old
offender at the time of the offense.

¶ 49 Myers next argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial. Counsel's alleged ineffective assistance included the failure to (1) pursue a youth-based defense theory, (2) hire a fact investigator, (3) fully cross-examine Mosley, (4) cross-examine a sergeant and a detective regarding their failure to follow police procedure manuals, (5) present the testimony of a crime scene expert, (6) present the testimony of a police procedure expert to challenge Miranda issues, (7) present the testimony of an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his Miranda rights, (8) achieve a change of venue, and (9) challenge the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook. As we discuss in the sixth assignment of error, Myers' claims regarding the testimony of a police procedure expert to challenge Miranda issues, change of venue, and the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook are barred by res judicata as they could have been raised on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. As we further discuss in the sixth assignment of error, Myers' other claims fail to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief. Murphy at *2. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying Myers' motions for discovery concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial.

¶ 50 To that extent, Myers' second and third assignments of error are overruled.

¶ 51 Assignment of Error No. 4:


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error by Myers, not an allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 52 THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT FOUND PROCEDURALLY BARRED MYERS' CLAIMS CHALLENGING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY, PROPRIETY, AND/OR PROPORTIONALITY OF A DEATH SENTENCE FOR AN OFFENDER, LIKE MYERS, WHO WAS STILL A TEENAGER AT THE TIME OF HIS OFFENSE (GROUNDS
5, 8, 9, 46, 47, 48), AND IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING SUCH CLAIMS UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.

¶ 53 Myers argues that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 5, 8, 9, 46, 47, and 48 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged the constitutionality, propriety, and/or proportionality of a death sentence for an offender, like Myers, who was a teenager at the time of the offense. In this assignment of error, Myers details the scientific research on adolescent brain development, references various cases acknowledging that young adults under the age of 21 share many of the characteristics of late-age adolescents, and argues that the imposition of a death sentence upon a teenage offender, such as him, is an unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. Myers asserts that a cut-off of age 18 for imposing a death penalty is arbitrary. Myers further asserts his death sentence is unconstitutionally disproportionate to the life sentence Mosley received.

¶ 54 Ground 5 argues that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), Ohio's felony-murder statute, is unconstitutional because it fails to adequately account for youth in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Ground 8 argues that the death sentence was disproportionate compared to Mosley and others convicted of similar crimes in violation of Myers' Eighth Amendment rights. Ground 9 argues that Myers' death sentence was void because the trial court failed to consider the R.C. 2929.11 purposes of felony sentencing when determining the appropriateness of the death sentence on the capital specifications. Ground 46 argues that Myers' Eighth Amendment rights were violated because the trial court failed to accord his youth the mitigating value it deserved. Ground 47 argues that the death penalty was a disproportionate punishment for Myers given his youth and other individual characteristics. Ground 48 argues that the death penalty is per se unconstitutional for a youthful offender convicted of committing a crime prior to turning 21 years old.
The trial court dismissed Grounds 8 and 9, finding that both arguments were raised in Myers' direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, were addressed by the supreme court, and were therefore barred by res judicata. The trial court further dismissed Grounds 5 and 46 through 48 as follows:

The Ohio Supreme Court has already addressed whether the sentence of death for Myers based on his age is a violation of the Eighth Amendment and found that it is not a violation of his constitutional rights. Therefore, this argument is barred by res judicata.

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error related to the dismissal of certain grounds in a death penalty case, but it does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Further, the Supreme Court of the United States has addressed the age of youthful offenders in a number of contexts and has not chosen to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of eighteen at the time of the crime. [Myers] has submitted evidence related to the development in brain science, however, the Ohio Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court have considered these new developments and similar arguments to the ones set forth by [Myers]. The United States Supreme Court acknowledged that individuals over eighteen may still exhibit signs of a juvenile but also found that since eighteen is the line society draws for many purposes between childhood and adulthood, that was the age that the line for death penalty ought to rest. *Roper v. Simmons*, 543 U.S. 551, 574, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 1197-98 (2005).

We find that the trial court properly dismissed Grounds 5, 8, 9, and 46 through 48. On direct appeal to the supreme court, Myers argued that the death sentence violated the Eighth Amendment proscription of cruel and unusual punishment, given recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court and a growing body of new developments in brain science indicating that age 18 is not the proper cut-off point for the death penalty. Myers further argued that his death sentence was comparatively disproportionate to the life sentence Mosley received and that he should not have been sentenced to death because he was a 19-year-old immature adolescent with mental and youth-related behavioral issues when he committed his crimes. The supreme court addressed and rejected these claims. *Myers*, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 173-176. They are therefore barred by res judicata.
Myers’ other claims were properly dismissed by the trial court as failing to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, given the election of the United States Supreme Court and Ohio Supreme Court not to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of 18 at the time of the crime. Myers notes that while his direct appeal made a brief reference to the newer brain science, it did not make the constitutional claim for a *Roper*-extension that his PRC petition makes. See *Myers* at ¶ 176 (""Although Myers argues that new developments in brain science indicate that age 18 is not the 'proper cut off point for the death penalty,' he does not propose that the categorical exclusion for those under age 18 be extended to 19-year-olds""). However, such constitutional argument was recently addressed and rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court in *State v. Graham*, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-6700.

371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error by Myers, not an allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Graham, who turned 19 years old the month before he committed his crimes and who was sentenced to death, argued that imposing a death sentence on a capital defendant who was under the age of 21 at the time of the crime violated the Eighth Amendment. Extrapolating from the United States Supreme Court’s *Roper* decision, Graham argued that it was possible the Supreme Court could extend *Roper* to find that a defendant who turned 19 the month before committing the offense is constitutionally barred from receiving a death sentence. The Ohio Supreme Court squarely rejected the argument: ""[B]ecause the United States Supreme Court has drawn the line at 18 for Eighth Amendment purposes, state courts are not free to invoke the Eighth Amendment as authority for drawing it at a higher age. * * * *Roper* is controlling, and we must follow it."" *Graham* at ¶ 182, citing *In re Phillips*, 6th Cir. No. 17-3729, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 17766 (July 20, 2017) (no authority exists at the present time to support the argument that a defendant who was 19 years old at the time of the offense is ineligible to receive a death sentence).
Myers' fourth assignment of error is overruled.

Assignment of Error No. 9:

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT FOUND PROCEDURALLY BARRED MYERS' CLAIMS CHALLENGING IN MULTIPLE RESPECTS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF OHIO'S DEATH PENALTY STATUTE AND SYSTEMS (GROUNDS 2-4, 7, 57), AND IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING SUCH CLAIMS UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.

Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 2, 3, 4, 7, and 57 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged the constitutionality of Ohio's death-penalty scheme and the statutes governing it. Specifically, Myers argues that Ohio's death-penalty scheme (1) is per se unconstitutional due to several fundamental constitutional defects, (2) is unconstitutional because it allows racial disparities in capital indictment practices and the actual infliction of the death penalty, (3) is incompatible with modern standards of decency, and (4) violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under Hurst v. Florida, 577 U.S. 92, 136 S.Ct. 616 (2016). Myers further argues that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), Ohio's felony-murder statute, is unconstitutional as a capital specification because it allows for invidious racial discrimination in its application and fails to provide adequate safeguards to ensure only the most culpable offenders are sentenced to death.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error related to the trial court's denial of relief on Myers' first ground for relief, which is about the adequacy of Ohio's postconviction relief procedures, not alleging prosecutorial misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Myers' claims are barred by res judicata as they were either raised or could have been raised in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 201-202. This includes his Sixth Amendment argument under Hurst as his merit brief was filed in the supreme court four months after Hurst was decided. Myers acknowledges that the supreme court ""has thus far been unwilling to conclude that Ohio's death penalty
statute is unconstitutional under the U.S. and/or Ohio constitutions in the respect alleged * * in these Grounds."" See, e.g., Myers; State v. Mason, 153 Ohio St.3d 476, 2018-Ohio-1462; State v. Mammone, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942. In December 2020, the supreme court once again held that Ohio's death-penalty scheme was not unconstitutional under Hurst. Graham, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 185-186.

¶ 64 Myers' ninth assignment of error is overruled.

¶ 65 Assignment of Error No. 11:

¶ 66 THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION, AND COMMITTED AN ERROR OF LAW, WHEN IT DENIED MYERS RELIEF ON HIS FIRST GROUND FOR RELIEF, BECAUSE OHIO'S POSTCONVICTION PROCEDURES FAIL TO PROVIDE DEATH-SENTENCED PETITIONERS WITH AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS AND THEY VIOLATE THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS.

¶ 67 Myers argues that Ohio's statutory scheme for postconviction relief is unconstitutional because it does not provide an adequate corrective process due to its ""rigid"" reliance on principles of res judicata and a petitioner's inability to conduct discovery until convincing a trial court that a hearing is warranted. This court has already determined that ""the statutory procedure for postconviction relief constitutes an adequate corrective process."" State v. Lindsey, 12th Dist. Brown No. CA2002-02-002, 2003-Ohio-811, ¶ 13; State v. Lawson, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2013-12-093, 2014-Ohio-3554, ¶ 43. Other Ohio appellate courts have likewise rejected the claim that Ohio's postconviction relief statute does not afford an adequate corrective process. See, e.g. State v. Conway, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-504, 2019-Ohio-2260. Furthermore, the propriety of resolving a postconviction petitioner's arguments on the basis of res judicata is well settled. E.g., Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93. We see no reason to deviate from our prior precedent. Lawson.

{¶ 70} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT (GROUNDS 50, 58), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.

{¶ 71} Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily denying Grounds 50 and 58 of his PCR petition which allege prosecutorial misconduct.

{¶ 72} For a conviction to be reversed on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must prove the prosecutor's comments were improper and that they prejudicially affected the defendant's substantial rights. State v. Elmore, 111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, ¶ 62; McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228 at ¶ 13. However, ""[t]he focus of an inquiry into allegations of prosecutorial misconduct is upon the fairness of the trial, not upon culpability of the prosecutor."" State v. Gray, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-09-176, 2012-Ohio-4769, ¶ 56. Therefore, ""[p]rosecutorial misconduct is not grounds for error unless the defendant has been denied a fair trial."" State v.

Nos. CA2017-06-078 and CA2019-03-048, 2020-Ohio-855, ¶ 17. Myers did not raise this claim of prosecutorial misconduct in his PCR petition and has therefore forfeited it. State v. Zeune, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-147, 2013-Ohio-4156, ¶ 30; State v. Barb, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94054, 2010-Ohio-5239, ¶ 25; State v. McKee, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 96CA006599, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4433, *9 (Oct. 1, 1997) (failure to raise issue in PCR petition results in a waiver of the right to assert the issue on appeal).

¶ 75 Ground 50 alleges that Myers' due process rights were violated when privileged attorney-client discussions were potentially broadcast throughout the courthouse and into the prosecutor's office via the trial court's audio/video recording system. In his brief, Myers asserts the fact that conversations from the defense table could be broadcast in such a manner should cause ""great concern about whether any privileged conversations were 'overheard,' whether any were recorded, whether someone took notes of what they heard, [and] whether such information was utilized by the State in any fashion[.]

¶ 76 Myers does not identify the resulting prejudice. The trial court sua sponte addressed the issue at a pretrial hearing in August 2014, subsequently conducted an evaluation of its audio/video recording system to make sure that conversations taking place at the defense table could not be heard by others, and provided a copy of that evaluation to counsel. In dismissing Ground 50, the trial court found ""NO evidence that any conversation of counsel was ever overheard,"" noted its investigation into the issue, and ""determined that the mute button was sufficient to prevent anyone from overhearing any conversation between counsel and the petitioner."" Furthermore, this issue could have been raised on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court and is therefore barred by res judicata. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 50.

¶ 77 Ground 58 alleges that the elected prosecutor engaged in misconduct by extensively posting about the case on his county prosecutor Facebook and Twitter accounts
during and after the trial and via statements he made in an interview during a 2016 BBC documentary. Ground 58 further alleges that Myers was prejudiced by the prosecutor's misconduct. The trial court dismissed the ground, finding that Myers ""failed to establish sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief."" In his brief, Myers asserts that the prosecutor's social media postings and interview ""tainted"" his right to a fair trial.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text is describing an assignment of error related to the trial court's rulings, specifically the dismissal of Myers' claims of trial court errors under R.C. 2953.21(C) and Rule 12, without allowing discovery or an evidentiary hearing and failing to grant relief. It does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 78 We find that the trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 58. The prosecutor's post-trial social media posts, post-trial media statements, and statements in the 2016 BBC documentary are irrelevant and could not and did not deprive Myers of a fair trial. Regarding the prosecutor's social media postings and statements that occurred before and during trial, Myers does not articulate how any specific post or media statement prejudiced his right to a fair trial. A review of the posts and statements shows that they were restricted to providing the public with information about the criminal proceedings against Myers and communicated the results of various stages of the criminal proceedings against Myers either directly or by sharing links to news headlines. Following the guilty verdict, the prosecutor simply recognized Back's family and the efforts of the investigators and his office.

¶ 79 Furthermore, the trial court repeatedly admonished the jurors not to view or listen to any news reports in any form. We presume the jury followed the trial court's admonitions unless it is demonstrated otherwise. State v. Miller, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2019-11-010, 2021-Ohio-162, ¶ 50. Myers has not introduced any evidence to the contrary. Prejudice to a defendant will not be presumed in the absence of proof of jury exposure to possibly prejudicial news reports, or in this case, the prosecutor's social media posts. See State v. Wright, 3d Dist. Crawford No. 3-92-24, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 6090 (Dec. 30, 1994).
Finally, this issue could have been raised by Myers in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. We note that Myers actually did allege claims of prosecutorial misconduct as part of his direct appeal under his tenth proposition of law. Res judicata applies to any issue that could have been raised on direct appeal, including a claim alleging prosecutorial misconduct. *McKelton*, 2015-Ohio-4228 at ¶ 23, citing *State v. Zych*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA97-02-012, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4731 (Oct. 27, 1997). Myers fails to identify any reason why this claim of prosecutorial misconduct could not have been raised on direct appeal. Myers does not assert he learned about the prosecutor's social media posts after filing his direct appeal. Nor does he allege the posts were not known or available at the time of trial or his direct appeal. *Dillingham*, 2012-Ohio-5841 at ¶ 10.

Myers' seventh assignment of error is overruled.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes Myers' challenges to the trial court's rulings, not the prosecutor's misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 51 through 56 and 59 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged several trial court's rulings.

Ground 51 challenges the trial court's failure to grant a continuance of the trial date to allow defense counsel to obtain a mitigation specialist. This issue involves lead defense counsel's request to have his wife appointed as a mitigation specialist, which was initially denied by the trial court. After he was unable to find another mitigation specialist, lead counsel moved the trial court to reconsider its previous ruling. *Alternatively*, counsel
moved the court for a continuance of the trial date. The trial court reconsidered its previous
denial, appointed lead counsel's wife as the mitigation specialist, and denied the alternative
request for continuance. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 51.

{¶ 86} Ground 52 challenges the trial court's failure to grant a continuance of the trial
date to allow defense counsel to investigate Mosley's notebook after it was disclosed to the
defense the day before trial was to commence. Ground 53 challenges the trial court's
admission of the notebook into evidence and its failure to instruct the jury on the break in
the chain of custody. The notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after
the original search warrant was executed. On direct appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court
addressed the state's delayed disclosure of the notebook, the trial court's denial of defense
counsel's motion for a continuance, and the admissibility of the notebook into evidence.
Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 86-93, 112-120. In his direct appeal, defense counsel did not
challenge the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on chain of custody. Because the issues
above could have been or were raised on direct appeal to the supreme court, they are
barred by res judicata. The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 52 and 53.

{¶ 87} Grounds 54 and 55 challenge the trial court's denial of Myers' motion to
suppress his ""involuntary"" statements to Detective Michael Wyatt where he ""did not
understand his Miranda rights and never signed a Miranda waiver."" In support of these
grounds, Myers submitted the reports of Gary Rini, a crime scene/police procedure expert,
and Dr. Drew Barzman, a psychiatrist. Upon reviewing Myers' videotaped police
interrogations, Rini concluded that Myers ""was clearly confused and befuddled during his
questioning"" and was ""therefore apparently unable to appreciate the gravity of his situation,
nor was he aware of the constitutional rights afforded to him."" Upon reviewing Myers' police
interrogations, administering the Miranda Rights Comprehension Instruments test (""MCRI""),
and reviewing comprehensive historical information regarding Myers, Dr. Barzman opined
that ""due to his young age of 19, probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,"" Myers ""was unable to adequately apply his Miranda rights at the time of the interrogations.""

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error related to the trial court's denial of Myers' motion to suppress and other claims, not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 88 On direct appeal, the supreme court overruled Myers' proposition of law relating to the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress and the claims that he never validly waived his right to remain silent, that he was denied his constitutional right to counsel, and that his statements were involuntary. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 61-82. In his brief, Myers asserts that the expert reports of Rini and Dr. Barzman ""were necessary to substantiate the claim"" his statements were not voluntarily made and were obtained in violation of Miranda. With the exception of the MCRI test, the same facts and historical information reviewed by Rini and Dr. Barzman were known and available to Myers at the time of his direct appeal to the supreme court. Myers, therefore, could have appealed his statements to police on the basis of his demeanor during questioning, his age, his ""probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and his lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,"" but did not. ""A report not found in the record does not automatically equate to a valid issue for post-conviction review purposes where, as here, the issue could have been raised on direct appeal."" State v. Drummond, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05 MA 197, 2006-Ohio-7078, ¶ 43. The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 54 and 55.

¶ 89 Ground 56 challenges the trial court's denial of Myers' motion for change of venue based on the ""overwhelming"" pretrial media publicity regarding the case. Although Myers moved the trial court for a change of venue, he did not challenge the trial court's denial of his motion in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. It is therefore barred by res judicata. See McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 56.
Ground 59 challenges the trial court's failure to instruct the jury that Mosley's plea deal to a life sentence without parole was a mitigating factor. The record shows that the trial court did instruct the jury that, in addition to the specific statutory mitigation factors, it could consider any additional factors that were not specifically mentioned in favor of a sentence other than death. Defense counsel was allowed to and did argue Mosley's plea deal as a mitigating factor. Furthermore, this claim could have been raised on direct appeal to the supreme court and is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Jennings, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-248, 2018-Ohio-3871; State v. Southers, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA88-03-027, 1988 Ohio App. LEXIS 2720 (June 30, 1988). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 59.

Myers' eighth assignment of error is overruled.

3. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel during the Guilt Phase

Assignment of Error No. 6:

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text is describing an assignment of error related to the trial court's handling of a petition for postconviction relief (PCR) filed by Myers, not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS THAT HIS TRIAL COUNSEL RENDERED CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFICIENT PERFORMANCE IN THE TRIAL PHASE OF HIS CAPITAL TRIAL (GROUNDS 6, 10-18), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING, AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF ON THESE MERITORIOUS IAC CLAIMS.

Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 6 and 10 through 17 of his PCR petition, all of which allege numerous instances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial.

In order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, it must be shown that an attorney's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance
prejudiced the defense. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). In postconviction proceedings, a petitioner bears the initial burden of submitting evidentiary materials containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and also that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness. *State v. Jackson*, 64 Ohio St.2d 107, 111 (1980). Pursuant to the res judicata doctrine, a PCR petition may be dismissed where a petitioner, represented by new counsel on direct appeal, could have raised the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim on direct appeal without resort to evidence outside the record. *State v. Lentz*, 70 Ohio St.3d 527 (1994), syllabus; *State v. Loza*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA96-10-214, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4574, *9-10 (Oct. 13, 1997). Additionally, mere presentation of evidence outside the record does not transform a claim into one addressable in postconviction. *Drummond*, 2006-Ohio-7078 at ¶ 17. The evidence must show that the petitioner could not have appealed his claim based upon the information in the original record. *Id.*

¶ 96 Ground 6 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a youth-based defense theory during the guilt phase of the trial in anticipation of the penalty phase. Myers asserts that his ""youth, its specific effects on him, and its manifestation in the conduct alleged by the State at trial should have all formed a central, consistent theme presented during both phases of the trial."" Counsel's defense theory during the guilt phase was that Mosley committed the murder, Myers was simply present during the crime, and Mosley subsequently turned on Myers by entering into a plea deal and testifying against him. This was consistent with the penalty phase during which defense counsel argued Myers' sentence should not be more severe than Mosley's sentence.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text is describing an assignment of error related to the defense counsel's actions, not the prosecutor's misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 97 The decision regarding which defense theory to pursue at trial is a matter of trial strategy, and trial strategy decisions are not the basis of a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Murphy*, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 524, 2001-Ohio-112; *State v.
Moreover, as the trial court noted when it dismissed Ground 6, the fact that another defense attorney may have or would have employed a different approach does not mean the alternative strategy fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. *State v. Casey*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2017-08-013, 2018-Ohio-2084, ¶ 34. ""[T]here is a strong presumption that counsel has rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment."" *Id.* Defense counsel's guilt-phase strategy will not be second-guessed even though appellate counsel now argue that they would have defended differently. *State v. Mason*, 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 169, 1998-Ohio-370. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 6.

Ground 10 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to hire a fact investigator even though the trial court had approved funds for an investigator. Lead defense counsel's affidavit submitted in support of the PCR petition indicates that counsel ""ultimately did not retain"" an investigator because the case was not a ""who done it."" Ground 11 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to fully cross-examine Mosley. Myers asserts that an investigator would have discovered, inter alia, that Mosley was suffering from rage and depression in the days leading to Back's murder, suffered from severe drug addiction and had violent tendencies, and was not in the habit of taking notes in a notebook. The investigation would have further discovered that Mosley's cellphone records belied his trial testimony. Myers claims that this information could have been used to properly cross-examine Mosley and impeach his credibility.

""The *Strickland* holding and the American Bar Association's Guidelines only require trial counsel to perform a reasonable investigation, not to hire an investigator."" *State v. Hairston*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 05CA008768, 2006-Ohio-4925, ¶ 36. ""Further, '[a]n attorney's decision not to hire an investigator does not equate to a failure to investigate and
result in ineffective assistance of counsel."" State v. Thompson, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, ¶ 247, quoting Hairston at ¶ 36. Defense counsel's failure to hire a fact investigator does not mean counsel did not investigate Mosley's background. The affidavits, reports, and records submitted by Myers in support of Ground 10 do not show a failure to investigate.

371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error related to defense counsel's conduct, not the prosecutor's misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 100 Furthermore, as the Ohio Supreme Court specifically noted on direct appeal, defense counsel did cross-examine Mosley ""vigorously and at length."" Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 186. Defense counsel's cross-examination of Mosley shows that counsel was very familiar with Mosley's statements to police and demonstrated his investigation and familiarity with personal facts about Mosley, including Mosley's substance abuse issues and the fact he engaged in illegal activity. Defense counsel's cross-examination elicited testimony that later allowed counsel to argue that Mosley was the principal offender, that he had a financial motive to commit the crimes, that he had a motive to keep his testimony consistent with his statements to Detective Wyatt because of his plea agreement, and that he lied to the police about Zennie to protect Zennie over Myers. Defense counsel's cross-examination of Mosley refutes any suggestion counsel did not investigate Mosley's background.

¶ 101 Whether defense counsel discovered all of the information Myers identifies as topics of cross-examination is unknown. However, counsel's strategy was to cast Mosley as the leader who planned the crimes and executed them with little help from Myers and who was now turning on Myers to save himself. Some of the information that Myers suggests should have been a topic during Mosley's cross-examination is the same type of information which would have undermined Myers' mitigation strategy that Mosley bore primary responsibility for Back's murder. In this sense, portraying Mosley as suffering from depression and cocaine withdrawal at the time of the crime would have run counter to
defense counsel's strategy that Mosley was fully responsible for Back's murder. In addition, in light of the overwhelming evidence of Myers' guilt and the fact that Mosley's testimony regarding his and Myers' actions on the days leading to and culminating in the murder was corroborated by third-party witnesses, there is no reasonable probability Myers would have been acquitted of the charges. The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 10 and 11.

¶ 102 Ground 12 challenges counsel's failure to cross-examine Sergeant Jeff Garrison of the Clayton Police Department and Detective Wyatt during the hearing on Myers' motion to suppress and at trial regarding their failure to follow their respective police procedure manual in handcuffing Myers when he was only wanted for an interview. Myers asserts that had counsel used the manuals when cross-examining the officers, this would have aided in showing that Myers was ""effectively seized"" when he was handcuffed and would have tarnished the officers' credibility.

¶ 103 The record shows that it was Clayton police officers who handcuffed Myers and placed him in the back seat of a Clayton police cruiser after he was located at Mosley's home. At the time, Myers was a suspect who was detained at the request of the Warren County Sheriff's Office. The Clayton Police Department manual allows one to be restrained when the officer can articulate a need to handcuff for safety reasons. The sergeant's testimony at the suppression hearing indicates that Myers was handcuffed for safety reasons and to prevent him from running. Detective Wyatt's testimony reveals that the detective did not direct that Myers be handcuffed, and that in fact, he directed that the handcuffs be removed after he discovered that Myers was handcuffed.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text is describing an assignment of error related to the defense counsel's performance, not the prosecutor's misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 104 Furthermore, as the trial court found, the extent and scope of cross-examination clearly fall within the ambit of trial strategy, and debatable trial tactics do not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, ¶ 146. Even assuming, arguendo, that defense counsel was deficient in failing
to use the manuals when he cross-examined the officers, Myers fails to establish that, but for counsel's error, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the suppression hearing and his trial would have been different. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 12.

{¶ 105} Ground 13 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a crime scene expert testimony to question the veracity of Mosley's notebook and rebut such evidence. The notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after the original search warrant was executed in January 2014. In support of Ground 13, Myers submitted Rini's report. The report indicates that photographs taken during the January 2014 search of Mosley's home do not show the notebook at all, nor was the notebook mentioned in any investigative report generated as a result of the January 2014 search of Mosley's home. Rini's report states that the ""discovery"" of the notebook ""eight months later, during a warrantless search in a location previously photographed during the January [2014] search, draws into question the legitimacy of the 'find' by investigating officers."" Thus, ""[i]t is not unwarranted for one to conclude the possibility that the [notebook] was not, in fact present during the original crime scene search, and may have been placed at the scene sometime after the search was completed.""

{¶ 106} ""As an initial matter, the failure to call an expert and instead rely on cross-examination does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel."" State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, ¶ 66. Further, even if the wisdom of such an approach is debatable, ""debatable trial tactics"" do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Clayton, 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49 (1980). Defense counsel cross-examined Mosley upon all issues identified in Rini's report and revisited those issues in closing argument. Detective Wyatt testified the notebook was found where Mosley said it would be. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 13.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error related to the defense counsel's alleged ineffectiveness in presenting expert testimony to challenge *Miranda* issues, not misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 107} Ground 14 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present
a police procedure expert such as Rini to challenge *Miranda* issues. Myers asserts that Rini could have testified, based on his review of Myers' police interrogations, that Myers was ""clearly confused"" during questioning, that Detective Wyatt did not adequately explain the *Miranda* warnings to Myers, and that the detective provided Myers with inaccurate information concerning how he could obtain an attorney. Ground 15 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his *Miranda* rights. In support of this ground, Myers submitted the report of Dr. Barzman. Upon reviewing Myers' police interrogations, administering the MCRI test, and reviewing comprehensive historical information regarding Myers, Dr. Barzman opined that ""due to his young age of 19, probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,"" Myers ""was unable to adequately apply his *Miranda* rights at the time of the interrogations.""

¶ 108 During the suppression hearing defense counsel's cross-examination of Detective Wyatt addressed the issues raised in Rini's report, and the videotapes of Myers' interrogations were played and admitted into evidence. The videotapes were likewise played to the jury and admitted into evidence at Myers' trial. The trial court denied Myers' motion to suppress, finding that Myers validly waived his *Miranda* rights. The trial court further found that, based on the totality of the evidence, Myers understood the nature of his *Miranda* rights and the consequences in declining to exercise them. In his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, Myers challenged the validity of his *Miranda* waiver and argued that counsel was ineffective during the guilt phase of his trial. Myers' alleged confusion during police questioning, Detective Wyatt's explanation to Myers of the *Miranda* warnings and the information he provided Myers concerning how to retain an attorney, and counsel's alleged ineffectiveness in failing to present expert testimony to challenge *Miranda* issues were cognizable and could have been raised on direct appeal based solely on the original
record. Rini's report does not constitute evidence outside the record as Myers asserts. Myers' argument is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Dempsey, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 76386, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 2628 (June 15, 2000); State v. Holloway, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-900805, 1992 Ohio App. LEXIS 283 (Jan. 29, 1992). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 14.

¶ 109 The trial court dismissed Ground 15, finding that ""even if the defense had requested an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his Miranda rights, based on the evidence presented at the motion to suppress hearing it is unlikely that the Court would have granted that request since the Court denied the motion to suppress."" The trial court further found that ""[t]he failure to request a * * * police procedures expert or another expert to challenge Miranda issues was not such an error as to deny [Myers'] constitutional rights. [Myers] was not entitled to any such expert[.]"") Thus, the trial court found that even considering Dr. Barzman's report, Myers failed to set forth sufficient operative facts establishing a substantive ground for relief.

---------------------
¶ 110 The MRCI administered by Dr. Barzman in October 2016 is the updated version of the Thomas Grisso's Instruments for Assessing Understanding & Appreciation of Miranda Rights, commonly referred to as the Grisso test. The test specifically assesses a person's capacity to understand and appreciate Miranda rights at the time of the evaluation. Garner v. Mitchell, 557 F.3d 257, 266 (6th Cir.2009). The test consists of four subtests, called ""instruments"": Comprehension of Miranda Rights (CMR), Comprehension of Miranda Rights – Recognition (CMR-R), Function of Rights in Interrogation (FRI), and Comprehension of Miranda Vocabulary (CMV). Id.; State v. Higgins, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 12 JE 11, 2013-Ohio-2555, ¶ 43.

¶ 111 Myers' scores were within the range for 19-year-old individuals with a verbal IQ of 101 to 110 in the first three instruments; his score of 29 out of 32 in the fourth
instrument (CMV) was good in comparison to 19-year-old individuals with a verbal IQ of 101 to 110. As stated above, the Grisso test purports to assess one's capacity to understand the Miranda warnings only at the time of the evaluation, not at the time the warnings were given. Garner at 270. The test does not purport to measure the validity of the waiver of Miranda rights or legal competence to waive Miranda rights. Id. at 269. In his report Dr. Barzman admitted the limited usefulness of Myers' scores ""since his interrogations were almost 3 years ago[.]"" Nonetheless, Dr. Barzman opined that ""[b]ased on his responses to the [test], it is evident that Austin currently understands the words of the Miranda Rights but he had problems with applying his rights. Although [he] appeared to have average to above average intelligence, he did not have the 'street smarts' three years ago to actually apply his Miranda Rights under intense stress.""

¶ 112 Myers' scores indicate he did understand his Miranda rights. Myers was interviewed five times by Detective Wyatt. Miranda warnings were not required during the first interview as Myers was not in custody. Detective Wyatt administered Miranda warnings to Myers on three separate times; each time Myers stated he understood them. Myers invoked his right to counsel in the second interview and the detective ended the interview. Myers sought to re-initiate questioning during a third interview but was rebuffed because he had invoked his right to counsel. Myers subsequently re-initiated questioning during a fourth interview, was administered the Miranda warnings again, and provided a statement. Detective Wyatt administered the Miranda warnings for a third time before the fifth interview. Myers indicated he understood them and answered the detective's questions. On direct appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court found that Myers understood his Miranda rights, which was further demonstrated by his invocation of his right to counsel. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 69-71. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 15.

¶ 113 Ground 16 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to support
the motion for a change of venue with news articles evidencing the extraordinary amount of pretrial publicity, failed to renew the motion after voir dire, and ultimately failed to achieve a change of venue. The trial court dismissed Ground 16, finding that the motion for change of venue was initially denied subject to reconsideration if a jury could not be empaneled in accordance with State v. Lundgren, 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 1995-Ohio-227. The motion was subsequently denied after the trial court was able to successfully seat a jury in accordance with Lundgren. Juror questionnaires submitted in support of Ground 16 indicate that six of the 12 jurors had seen or heard pretrial news coverage of the case. All jurors indicated that they could and would decide the case based solely on the evidence presented at trial. Furthermore, although Myers alleged claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase as part of his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, he did not challenge defense counsel's failure to achieve a change of venue. It is therefore barred by res judicata. See Piesciuk, 2013-Ohio-3879. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 16.

{¶ 114} Ground 17 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to challenge the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook either through cross-examination of the state's witnesses or by expert testimony. As stated above, the notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after the original search warrant was executed. Counsel vigorously cross-examined Mosley about the notebook and objected to its admission. On direct appeal to the supreme court, Myers challenged the admission of the notebook into evidence and alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial. The issue regarding the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook was cognizable and could have been raised on direct appeal to the supreme court and is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Dickason, 5th Dist. Stark Case No. 1996CA00423, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 3241 (July 7, 1997). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 17.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error related to the trial court's dismissal of grounds for relief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial, not misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Myers argues that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 19 through 45, all of which allege several instances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial. Specifically, Myers argues that counsel was ineffective during the penalty phase of the trial because he failed to (1) conduct a competent mitigation investigation and consult with and hire a competent mitigation specialist in a timely fashion, (2) present the testimony of expert witnesses regarding Myers' youth and psychological history, (3) present expert testimony regarding the science on adolescent brain development, and (4) present the testimony of numerous witnesses who would have testified about Myers' background, family history, mental health, education, and relationships with others. Myers argues that defense counsel's primary mitigation strategy was that Myers should not receive a punishment harsher than the life sentence without parole imposed on Mosley. Myers avers that had defense counsel's focus been broader and include the testimony of experts and other witnesses, he would not have been sentenced to death.

The trial court dismissed the grounds for relief, finding that (1) the failure to
call witnesses is trial strategy that does not raise to a constitutional violation, (2) a PCR petition is not a vehicle to substitute another trial strategy for one that failed, (3) defense counsel did argue Myers' youth in mitigation and the trial court instructed the jury that youth was a mitigating factor, and (4) defense counsel's failure to present the testimony of an expert in adolescent brain development, and his decision to consult with but not call a psychology expert to the stand and instead rely on arguing that Myers' sentence should not be harsher than that of Mosley was trial strategy.

¶ 120 Myers' foregoing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial were also the basis for his motions for discovery and why he argues the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery under his second and third assignments of error. As pertinent here, the trial court denied the discovery motions as follows:

This is not a case where the defense did not seek the assistance of an investigator, mitigation expert and mental health expert. Clearly, a decision by trial counsel not to even have these valuable tools available to him while defending a capital murder case can never be a tactical, strategic decision. However, the decision of whether or not to use these tools or how to use them, as a matter of strategy or in the context of marshalling resources, is the cornerstone in building a proper legal defense.

Petitioner has made allegations that his attorneys and mitigation specialist were ineffective and did not properly investigate and prepare a defense. In support of this claim, he has provided affidavits and documentary evidence concerning their performance. However, petitioner has made no specific representation about what he expects to learn in a deposition of [lead defense counsel, co-counsel and/or the mitigation specialist]. Both [lead counsel and the mitigation specialist] provided affidavits explaining what they knew, what they did, and why they did it. The fact that an attorney may look back in a deposition or otherwise, with 20/20 hindsight, and question or revisit his trial strategy after the jury has rendered its verdict provides no real insight to the Court. Further, the fact that [lead counsel] may have limited his mitigation strategy to what he believed to be the strongest and most compelling arguments does not support conducting discovery on this issue. * * *
In short, the petitioner has not established good cause to conduct discovery with respect to the defense team, including the attorneys.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error alleging that defense counsel was ineffective, not that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 121 During the penalty phase of the trial, defense counsel presented the testimony of Myers' father, mother, and younger brother Bryce. All three testified about Myers' family history and background, including the breakup of the family and the parents' divorce following the mother's affair with a coworker and resultant pregnancy. They further testified about Myers' close bond with his siblings and how he was a very good mediator and mentor for his stepsiblings. Myers' mother testified that as a child, Myers tested gifted in several areas, was a talented piano player, and had designed a business card for himself in sixth grade. However, she started seeing changes in Myers when he was 14 years old. After she discovered Myers had been cutting himself and shooting his legs with a pellet gun, he was hospitalized for five days at Kettering Hospital Youth Services. Myers' mother testified that Myers was initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder and upon discharge, was prescribed medications and weekly therapy with a psychologist. However, Myers discontinued both when he began living with his father later that year. Defense counsel introduced photographs of Myers and his family, the business card he had designed for himself, his letters to his family during his incarceration, the records of his hospitalization at Kettering Hospital, and his gifted test results when he was in fifth grade. The Kettering Hospital records show that Myers was hospitalized as a result of taking 20 Benadryl tablets and that he was initially diagnosed with ""depressive disorder not otherwise specified versus bipolar disorder most recent depressed; substance induced mood disorder; over-the-counter drug abuse."" Myers was ultimately diagnosed with ""depressive disorder, not otherwise specified. Rule out bipolar disorder.""

¶ 122 Myers made an unsworn statement, telling the jury that he was sorry ""this
happened"" and wished he ""could go back in time and stop this before it even happened,"" and that the death penalty would not hurt him and would only cause more pain and suffering to innocent people such as his parents and siblings. Myers asked the jury to spare his life and give him a chance to become a better person.

¶ 123 In closing argument, defense counsel stressed Myers' good qualities and the positive influence he could have in his siblings' lives, acknowledged there had been ""bumps in the road,"" such as issues with Myers' family, ""his mental health a little bit,"" and his cutting and shooting himself with the pellet gun, and asked the jury to consider Myers' age, the love of his family, and the Kettering Hospital records. Overall, defense counsel focused on Mosley's plea agreement and resulting life sentence, telling the jury that it was the most important mitigating factor in the case and that Myers should not be punished more than Mosley who was the one who actually killed Back.

¶ 124 Grounds 22 through 43 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present or ""fully"" present the testimony of numerous witnesses who would have testified about Myers' background, family history, mental health, education, and relationships with others. In support of this claim, Myers attached 22 affidavits from relatives, friends, acquaintances, and former educators to his PCR petition. Of those witnesses, only three testified at the penalty phase, to wit, Myers' parents and his brother Bryce.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error related to the defense counsel's actions, not the prosecutor's. The error is alleging that the defense counsel was ineffective in his representation of the defendant.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 125 It is well established that a ""defense decision to call or not call a mitigation witness is a matter of trial strategy. * * * Debatable trial tactics generally do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel."" Graham, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 139. The Ohio Supreme Court has further stated that trial counsel is not ineffective for failing to call all available family members. State v. McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 399, 1997-Ohio-335. Furthermore, ""[a]dditional mitigating evidence that is 'merely cumulative' of that already presented does not undermine the results of sentencing."" State v. Herring, 142 Ohio St.3d 165, 2014-Ohio-
5228, ¶ 117. Instead, ""the new evidence * * * must differ in a substantial way – in strength and subject matter – from the evidence actually presented at sentencing."" Id.

¶ 126 Upon reviewing the witnesses' affidavits, we find that the trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 22 through 43. Although the 19 individuals who did not testify may have provided a more disinterested account of Myers' family, their testimony to a large extent was cumulative to and did not differ in substantial way from the testimony of Myers' parents and his brother Bryce. See State v. Twyford, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 98-JE-56, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 1443 (Mar. 19, 2001). Likewise, the affidavits of Myers' parents and brother did not differ in substantial way from their testimony at the penalty phase.

¶ 127 Grounds 19 and 20 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to consult with and hire a competent mitigation specialist in a timely fashion.

¶ 128 In March 2014, lead defense counsel moved to employ his wife, a licensed attorney with experience defending capital cases, as the mitigation specialist. The trial court balked at the request due to the family relationship and denied the motion. Lead counsel did not seek assistance from another mitigation specialist until he contacted the Ohio Public Defender's Office in May 2014. However, the public defender's office did not have the resources to provide a mitigation specialist. Unable to find another mitigation specialist, lead counsel moved the trial court to reconsider its previous denial. The trial court held a hearing on the motion for reconsideration on June 4, 2014. Thereafter, the trial court appointed lead counsel's wife as the mitigation specialist. The trial court's decision noted that counsel's wife had ""already undertaken some mitigation work in the case, including meeting with the family of the Defendant[.]""

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error related to the defense counsel's performance, not the prosecutor's misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 129 The jury found Myers guilty on all counts and specifications on October 2, 2014. The penalty phase was held on October 6, 2014. In support of his PCR petition, Myers attached the affidavits of lead counsel and the mitigation specialist. Both affidavits
state that during the three-day weekend between the jury verdict and the penalty phase, lead counsel and the mitigation specialist met with and interviewed Myers' mother and two of his siblings at the mother's home. That same weekend, they also met with and interviewed Myers' father and stepmother at their home. The affidavits of Myers' parents and stepmother corroborated that the interviews took place that weekend. Myers' stepmother stated the interview was short. Myers' mother stated that her interview lasted about one hour and one half and that she gave photographs to the mitigation specialist at another time and ""spent another hour to an hour and a half with her.""

{¶ 130} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that capital defendants ""[do] not have a constitutional right to a mitigation specialist or a right to an effective one."" Herring, 2014-Ohio-5228 at ¶ 113, citing McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d at 399 (no requirement for counsel to hire mitigation specialist in capital case); Drummond, 2006-Ohio-7078 at ¶ 69 (a mitigation specialist is not a requirement for effective assistance of counsel). The trial court noted that the mitigation specialist ""was a trained attorney who has handled a number of capital cases and therefore has the ability to determine what evidence is effective in the [penalty] phase."" The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 19 and 20.

{¶ 131} Grounds 21, 44, and 45 generally challenge counsel's failure to conduct a comprehensive investigation into Myers' background and counsel's failure to present effective mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of the trial. Specifically, Grounds 21, 44, and 45 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present the expert testimony of clinical forensic psychologist Dr. Bobbie Hopes, failed to consult with and present an expert in adolescent brain development, and failed to effectively present youth as a mitigation factor.

{¶ 132} In support of his PCR petition, Myers submitted affidavits and reports from several experts related to adolescent brain development and expressing opinions based
upon their evaluation of Myers and his mental health and social records. The evidence submitted by Myers generally reflects that individuals of his age are prone to risk taking, peer influence, and impulsivity more akin to adolescents than adults. Myers argues that this evidence established substantive grounds for relief and he is therefore entitled to discovery and an evidentiary hearing on his PCR petition. The state argues that the evidence was not presented as a matter of trial strategy because it was in conflict with defense counsel's mitigation strategy to emphasize Myers' good qualities and was cumulative to evidence presented at the penalty phase.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes an appeal by the defendant, Myers, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, not misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 133 In his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, Myers argued ineffective assistance of counsel in the penalty phase for failure to present any expert testimony. Specifically, Myers asserted that defense counsel ""should have adduced expert testimony to explain the meaning of his self-harming behavior in his early teens and how brain development affects the decision-making of young people."" Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 198. The supreme court rejected Myers' claim on the ground that ""nothing in the record shows what such expert would have said in the penalty phase[.] Thus, Myers has not demonstrated prejudice from missing such testimony."" Id. The supreme court further found, ""At trial, the defense requested and received funds to hire a consulting psychologist. The psychologist the defense chose was appointed, but the record does not show what she told Myers's counsel regarding her conclusions. Hence, there is nothing to show deficient performance by counsel."" Id. at ¶ 199.

¶ 134 In a capital case, ""[d]efense counsel has a duty to investigate the circumstances of his client's case and explore all matters relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty, including the defendant's background, education, employment record, mental and emotional stability, and family relationships."" State v. Pickens, 141 Ohio St.3d 462, 2014-Ohio-5445, ¶ 219. Defense counsel has a duty to make reasonable
investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. *State v. Johnson*, 24 Ohio St.3d 87, 89 (1986). Counsel's ""investigations into mitigating evidence 'should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor.'"" *Wiggins v. Smith*, 539 U.S. 510, 524, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (2003), citing American Bar Association, *ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases*, Section 11.4.1(C), 93 (1989). Given the severity of the potential sentence and the reality that the life of a capital defendant is at stake, it is only after a full investigation of all the mitigating circumstances that counsel can make an informed, tactical decision about which information would be most helpful to the client's case. *Johnson* at 90. ""Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable[.] However, a failure to investigate, especially as to key evidence, must be supported by a reasoned and deliberate determination that investigation was not warranted."" *O'Hara v. Wigginton*, 24 F.3d 823, 828 (6th Cir.1994). ""An attorney's failure to reasonably investigate the defendant's background and present mitigating evidence to the jury at sentencing can constitute ineffective assistance of counsel."" *Pickens* at ¶ 219.

¶ 135 Myers was examined by Dr. Barzman for purposes of the PCR petition and his report is attached to the petition. Myers was also examined by Dr. Daniel Davis, a forensic psychologist, and his report is attached to the PCR petition. In his report, Dr. Barzman opined that Myers' mental health history, which included significant depressive and manic symptoms, was consistent with bipolar disorder which is associated with increased impulsivity and a focus on immediate gratification.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error related to the defense's failure to present certain psychological and neurological information to the jury, not any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 136 In his report, Dr. Davis stated that the symptoms Myers experienced in high school were associated with bipolar disorder and that he was not fully neurologically
developed at the time of his crimes and sentencing. Dr. Davis further stated that the trial court and jury were deprived of pertinent psychological information specific to Myers and general psychological research specific to youthful and capital offenders, evidence that would have been extremely helpful to understand Myers' actions and demeanor. In particular, Dr. Davis noted that while Myers' youth was clearly evident at trial, the crimes took place when Myers was still developing neurologically and psychologically, however ""there was no specific testimony as to the considerable scientific literature concerning neurological development in late adolescents and young adults."" Dr. Davis also noted Myers' apparent lack of remorse for his crimes at sentencing but stated that scientific literature shows that an apparent lack of remorse is not indicative of anything atypical in adolescent males and is typically mistaken as one of the ""signs of the development of a psychopathic personality when they are, in fact, transient features of adolescent development."" Dr. Davis' report continued,

Further, abused and neglected children, such as Austin demonstrate a limited range of emotions as a way to cope with very stressful home environments. These research findings apply specifically to Austin. He was raised in a highly neglectful environment. He was at the time of his sentence still in the commonly accepted development stage of late adolescence. Neither the trial court nor jury had this critically important research presented to them[.]

¶ 137 In support of his PCR petition, Myers also submitted the affidavits of his lead defense counsel and Dr. Hopes. Lead counsel's affidavit details what he did and did not do. As pertinent here, lead counsel stated he believed ""that everyone close to the process thought that [Myers] would receive a life sentence regardless of the trial phase result, based upon Mosley's plea deal having been the principal offender in the aggravated murder of Justin Back."" Counsel's affidavit further stated,

I did not consider requesting funding for, or hiring, a youth/adolescent expert to help explain issues, including
youth/adolescent brain development, to the jury.

Even though we did retain a psychologist, Dr. Bobbie Hopes, for mitigation, Dr. Hopes told me that she would not be able to provide anything for the jury except for a timeline of Austin's life, something which Dr. Hopes believed Austin's mother could provide and that it would be better if it came from her. Given her statements to me, I was concerned that if Dr Hopes presented this information to the jury, it would just be seen as ""psychobabble.""

When Austin's mother * * * did not effectively provide such a timeline as I had anticipated and that [the mitigation specialist] and I had worked with her on, I did not think to then call Dr. Bobbie Hopes to the stand to testify.

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text is describing an assignment of error related to the defense counsel's alleged ineffectiveness, not misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 138} Lead counsel's averments were contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. Dr. Hopes evaluated Myers three times in August 2014, for a total of six hours, for purposes of death penalty mitigation. Dr. Hopes averred that she provided lead counsel with a report in which she expressed the opinion that Myers' age, his history of childhood physical abuse, including his history of being diagnosed and treated for depression, and his history of self-mutilation were mitigation factors. Following Myers' conviction for aggravated murder, lead counsel called Dr. Hopes and told her he did not intend to use her as a mitigation expert. Dr. Hopes suggested that Myers' age and relevant research on adolescent brain development were strong mitigation factors but was told by lead counsel that information about youth had come out during jury selection. Dr. Hopes averred that she was willing and prepared to testify about age and adolescent brain development research. Dr. Hopes further averred that she never advised lead counsel that she could only present a timeline of Myers' life and that she never discussed a timeline with counsel.

{¶ 139} As stated above, ""[i]n a petition for post-conviction relief, which asserts ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner bears the initial burden to submit evidentiary documents containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness."" Jackson, 64
Ohio St.2d 107 at syllabus. In order to secure an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner need not prove counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Rather, the PCR petition only needs to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.

¶ 140 Upon reviewing the reports of Drs. Barzman and Davis and the affidavits of Dr. Hopes and lead defense counsel, we find that Myers has provided evidentiary documents setting forth sufficient operative facts to warrant an evidentiary hearing on his PCR petition regarding his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony at the penalty phase of the trial.

¶ 141 Defense counsel has the affirmative duty to investigate mitigating evidence. State v. Herring, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08-MA-213, 2011-Ohio-662, ¶ 55. Defense counsel ""can make the decision to forego the presentation of evidence, but only after a full investigation."" Id. It is only after a full investigation of all the mitigating circumstances that counsel can make an informed, tactical decision about which information would be most helpful to their client's case. Johnson, 24 Ohio St.3d at 89.

¶ 142 Lead counsel's averment that he did not consider requesting funding for, or hiring, a youth/adolescent expert to explain issues regarding adolescent brain development to the jury fails to indicate counsel's motivation and instead suggests that counsel's failure to present such expert testimony was not the product of an informed, tactical decision. That is, counsel's averment shows he did not engage into a reasoned and careful consideration of such expert testimony before ultimately rejecting it. The same can be said about counsel's failure to have Dr. Hopes testify as an expert witness at the penalty phase. While counsel averred in his affidavit that Dr. Hopes did not testify because she could only provide a timeline of Myers' life, this averment was explicitly contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. There is little evidence documenting the extent of defense counsel's reasoning for his
investigation and decision making regarding expert testimony mitigation evidence.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text is describing an assignment of error related to the defense counsel's decision not to present certain expert testimony at the penalty phase, not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 143} The state argues that mitigation evidence regarding Myers’ dysfunctional family, self-mutilation, and mental health issues such as childhood depression and bipolar disorder, was presented through the testimony of his mother at the penalty phase, and thus, much of the psychological testimony that Drs. Hopes, Barzman, and Davis could have presented would have been cumulative. However, Myers’ mother's testimony was much more limited on the issue. Myers’ mother testified that the deterioration of her marriage did not seem to affect Myers, that she had not noticed Myers' self-mutilation, and that she believed Kettering Hospital initially diagnosed Myers with bipolar disorder. There was no testimony regarding Myers' childhood depression. Furthermore, Myers’ mother is not qualified to provide the expert testimony necessary to contextualize the factors above.

{¶ 144} The state next argues that presenting this expert testimony at the penalty phase would have been inconsistent with defense counsel's mitigation theory emphasizing Myers' good qualities and the positive influence he could have in his siblings' lives. Thus, the state asserts, defense counsel's decision not to present such testimony was trial strategy which should not be second-guessed.

{¶ 145} However, lead counsel's affidavit does not advance this as the reason he did not present Dr. Hopes' expert testimony at the penalty phase. Lead counsel avers only that he did not call Dr. Hopes as a witness because she could only provide a timeline of Myers' life, an averment explicitly contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. Whether it was defense counsel's mitigation strategy to emphasize Myers' qualities, which counsel's affidavit does not suggest, it is not apparent why such strategy excludes a parallel strategy to contextualize Myers' youth in light of the science on adolescent brain development. As her affidavit clearly indicates, Dr. Hopes was prepared and available to testify about these issues and advised lead counsel on the eve of the penalty phase that Myers' age and
relevant research on adolescent brain development were strong mitigation factors. And while a decision by defense counsel to present only positive mitigation can be a sound trial strategy, counsel's decision to pursue a positive-mitigation theory can properly be made only after counsel has conducted a full mitigation investigation. *Herring*, 2014-Ohio-5228 at ¶ 90.

{¶ 146} The state further asserts that defense counsel did argue that Myers was only 19 years old at the time of the crimes. Counsel did briefly ask the jury to take Myers' age into consideration as a mitigation factor. However, counsel never developed the significance of Myers' youth as a mitigating factor.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error by the defendant, not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 147} In light of the foregoing, we find that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing. The trial court further erred in finding that Myers did not establish good cause to conduct discovery regarding his claim counsel was ineffective at the penalty phase in failing to present expert testimony on adolescent brain development in conjunction with Myers' age and mental health issues. Myers' claims are ""neither patently frivolous nor palpably incredible"" and ""the discovery he requests"" in the form of depositions of the defense team is ""limited and reasonably calculated to lead to evidence in support of his claim[.]"" *Hill*, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71975 at *31-32; *Johnson v. Bobby*, S.D.Ohio No. 2:08-cv-55, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103351 (Sept. 30, 2010); *Stallings v. Bradshaw*, N.D.Ohio No. 5:05CV0722, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97540 (Feb. 28, 2006).

{¶ 148} We therefore remand this case for the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition which allege ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase for failing to present expert testimony on adolescent brain development in conjunction with Myers' age and mental health issues. The advantages that an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition based on ineffective assistance of counsel
can provide a trial judge are well established:

The trial judge can delve into the motivation or reasoning of trial counsel through trial counsel's testimony. The court can hear the testimony of witnesses that were never called to testify at the original trial, and can determine the worth of their testimony as well as the witnesses' credibility. The trial judge can ask what the counsel knew, when he knew it, and whether a mistake was not strategic, but was instead careless. As here, in a postconviction hearing, a judge can hear testimony about what evidence was made available to trial counsel and when it was made available. A trial court in a postconviction proceeding thus plays a unique role in the consideration of ineffective assistance of counsel claims. It is the only court that actually hears testimony on that issue.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text describes an assignment of error related to the trial court's dismissal of certain grounds in a PCR (Post-Conviction Relief) petition, specifically focusing on cumulative errors and the denial of effective assistance of counsel. It does not allege misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 152 Myers argues the trial court erred in dismissing Ground 60 which alleges cumulative errors. We include under this assignment of error Myers' claims that the trial court erred in dismissing Grounds 18 and 49, which allege cumulative effect of the denial of effective assistance of counsel during the guilt and penalty phases of the trial (as initially argued in the fifth and sixth assignments of error). Under the doctrine of cumulative errors, a judgment may be reversed if the cumulative effect of errors deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute
cause for reversal. *State v. Kirkland*, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, ¶ 140. Given our resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth assignments of error, this assignment of error is moot. See *State v. Stein*, 3d Dist. Logan No. 8-17-39, 2018-Ohio-2621, citing App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).

III. CONCLUSION

¶ 153 In light of our resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth assignments of error, the trial court's judgments denying Myers' motions for discovery and his PCR petition regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to present expert testimony at the penalty phase of the trial are reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Specifically, on remand, the trial court shall permit discovery, conduct an evidentiary hearing, and rule on Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition.

BRIAN SHANER,

Appellant.

CASE NO. CA2018-09-013

OPINION
7/15/2019

CRIMINAL APPEAL FROM PREBLE COUNTY COURT OF COMMON PLEAS
Case No. 17-CR12522

Martin P. Votel, Preble County Prosecuting Attorney, Gractia S. Manning, 101 East Main Street, Eaton, Ohio 45320, for appellee

William O. Cass, Jr., 135 W. Dorothy Lane, Suite 117, Kettering, Ohio 45429, for appellant

PIPER, J.

¶ 1 In November 2017, the Preble County Sheriff's Office used a confidential informant to conduct a controlled buy of methamphetamine from appellant, Brian Shaner. The transaction occurred in the parking lot of a local medical facility where appellant's motor vehicle was parked. Appellant had his infant child with him in the car during the drug sale.

¶ 2 Appellant was subsequently indicted for three offenses: aggravated trafficking in drugs, a second-degree felony; aggravated possession of drugs, a third-degree felony; and
endangering children, a first-degree misdemeanor. The case proceeded to a one-day jury trial on June 11, 2018 and the jury found appellant guilty as charged.

¶ 3 Within fourteen days of the jury's verdict, appellant's trial attorney filed a written motion for a new trial based on alleged discovery violations. The trial court denied the motion. Meanwhile, appellant's trial counsel indicated to the prosecutor that juror misconduct may have occurred. The prosecutor notified the court by filing a notice of alleged jury misconduct. The trial court appointed new counsel for appellant and scheduled a hearing on the matter.

¶ 4 At the end of the hearing, appellant's new trial counsel suggested a new trial was appropriate. The court assumed the request was an oral motion for a new trial, but disagreed, finding that no misconduct occurred and denied the motion. The case then proceeded to sentencing. The court merged the drug trafficking and possession offenses and sentenced appellant to an aggregate four-year prison term.

¶ 5 Appellant now appeals his convictions, raising two assignments of error.

¶ 6 Assignment of Error No. 1:

¶ 7 THE JURY'S FINDING OF GUILTY WAS BASED ON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND WAS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.

¶ 8 In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence and was otherwise against the manifest weight of the evidence.

The standard of review for a sufficiency of the evidence challenge is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the prosecution proved the essential elements of the criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecutor. *State v. Beverly*, 143 Ohio St.3d 258, 2015-Ohio-219, ¶ 15. On a sufficiency challenge, the reviewing court will not consider the credibility of the witnesses. *State v. Wilks*, 154 Ohio St.3d 359, 2018-Ohio-1562, ¶ 162. Instead, the appellate court will defer to the trier of fact on questions of credibility and weight. *State v. Kirkland*, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, ¶ 132.

Answer:"
937-Shaner,"No. The text describes the legal standards and requirements for convictions under Ohio law, specifically for aggravated trafficking and aggravated possession offenses. It does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 10 A manifest weight challenge, on the other hand, requires the appellate court examine the evidence to determine whether the ""greater amount of credible evidence"" supports one side of the issue over the other. *State v. Bell*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2008-05-044, 2009-Ohio-2335, ¶ 57. As such the appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether in resolving the conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. *State v. Spencer*, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2018-08-082, 2019-Ohio-2165, ¶ 21. While the issue of credibility is relevant to the manifest weight review, an appellate court ""must be mindful the trier of fact has the primary role of weighing the evidence and evaluating witness credibility."" *State v. Salinger*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2014-10-208, 2015-Ohio-2821, ¶ 15, citing *State v. DeHass*, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 231 (1967). An appellate court will overturn a conviction only in ""extraordinary circumstances to correct a manifest miscarriage of justice, and only when the evidence presented at trial weighs heavily in favor of acquittal."" *State v. Cobb*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2007-06-153, 2008-Ohio-5210, ¶ 95, citing *Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387.

¶ 11 To convict appellant for the aggravated trafficking offense the prosecutor had to
prove that appellant knowingly sold, or offered to sell, a controlled substance or controlled substance analog. R.C. 2925.03(A)(1). For this offense to constitute a second-degree felony, the prosecutor had to prove that the amount of the drug exceeded the bulk amount, but was less than five times the bulk amount, and appellant committed the offense “in the vicinity of a juvenile.” R.C. 2925.03(C)(1)(c). Regarding the aggravated possession offense, the prosecutor had to prove that appellant knowingly obtained, possessed, or used a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog. R.C. 2925.11(A). For this offense to constitute a third-degree felony, the prosecutor had to prove that appellant possessed an amount of the drug greater than the bulk amount, but less than five times the bulk amount. R.C. 2925.11(C)(1)(b).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
937-Shaner,No. The text describes the evidence presented at trial and the court's finding that the evidence was sufficient to convict the appellant. It does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 12 As relevant here, the controlled substance appellant was accused of trafficking was methamphetamine, a schedule II substance pursuant to R.C. 3719.41. The bulk amount of a schedule II substance is three grams. R.C. 2925.01(D)(1)(g). The requisite mental state for these offenses was knowingly. This mental state is defined as ""regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature."" R.C. 2901.22(B).

¶ 13 After review of the record, this court finds that the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of both drug offenses and was not otherwise against the manifest weight of the evidence. At trial the prosecutor presented testimony from three witnesses: two detectives from the Preble County Sheriff’s Office and a confidential informant. Both detectives testified that before the target drug buy, they observed a female correctional officer perform a patdown search of the confidential informant to check the informant for contraband. This search yielded nothing. The detectives further testified that at least one officer was present with the informant up to the time the informant made contact with appellant and after the buy. The first detective testified that during the transaction he acted
as the ""cover"" officer to provide overwatch of the operation. In his position as overwatch, he was able to observe appellant and his girlfriend exit the medical facility and approach appellant's vehicle in the parking lot prior to the transaction.

¶ 14 The second detective testified that he rode in the vehicle with the informant to the parking lot of the medical facility. This detective provided the informant with an audio/visual recording device. Upon arrival, the second detective testified that he and the informant exited the vehicle and walked to their respective positions. The informant headed towards appellant's vehicle, while the second detective walked into the medical facility to observe the transaction through a window of the building. This detective testified that he observed appellant and his girlfriend walk towards appellant's vehicle from the medical buildings. Appellant was carrying an infant child. The detective then testified he watched the informant meet appellant and the girlfriend at the vehicle. The informant and appellant moved to the passenger side of the vehicle out of the detective's line of sight, so the detective was unable to see the exchange occur. During this time the detective saw the child in the rear seat of the vehicle on the driver's side. After the transaction, the detective testified that he met the informant in the medical building and received the bag of suspected methamphetamine from the informant.

¶ 15 Finally, the informant testified that prior to the target purchase she did not possess any type of contraband. She then testified that she approached appellant's vehicle in the parking lot, saw a child in the back seat of the vehicle, and engaged in casual conversation with appellant's girlfriend before moving to the passenger side of the car to conduct the exchange and retrieve the methamphetamine. The informant testified that while she gave appellant money for the sale, she was unsure of whether she directly handed him the cash or if she placed the money inside the car. After the sale, the informant walked away from appellant's vehicle and into the medical facility. She then convened with the second
detective and provided him the methamphetamine.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
937-Shaner,"No. The text describes the evidence presented and the jury's decision, but it does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 16} In addition to testimony, the prosecutor admitted into evidence the bag of methamphetamine, a laboratory analysis report that established that the substance was around 6.98 grams of methamphetamine, and a video of the transaction. While the video alone was not dispositive of the drug sale, it did corroborate the testimonies of the three witnesses. Unfortunately, the video only captured images of the ground and the subjects' feet during the transaction. Nevertheless, at the point of the suspected transaction, the video shows that of the three individuals present, the informant moved away from the girlfriend and stood near appellant, at which time a zipping sound can be heard indicating appellant was retrieving something from a zippered bag.

{¶ 17} Consequently, the evidence established that appellant knowingly possessed and then sold 6.98 grams of methamphetamine to the confidential informant in the presence of appellant's infant child. The testimony from the witnesses, the laboratory report, the video, and the bag of methamphetamine together comprised sufficient proof that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the trafficking and possession offenses proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

{¶ 18} Furthermore, this court finds that the jury did not clearly lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice when it found appellant guilty. Appellant argues that the confidential informant had a self-serving motive to carry out the drug sale, or was otherwise biased, because her aid in this investigation would lead to the state dismissing charges against her. However, the record shows that the informant was searched for contraband prior to the operation and nothing was found. Moreover, the detectives testified that they did not have any reason to believe that the methamphetamine did not come from appellant as a part of the transaction, because they were able to observe the informant throughout the operation. The guilty verdicts indicate that the jury found the informant's and detectives'
testimony credible. Therefore, this is not a case where the evidence weighs heavily in favor of appellant. The drug offense convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.

¶ 19 Next, to convict appellant for the endangering children offense, the prosecutor had to prove that appellant was a ""parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control of a child or person in loco parentis of under eighteen years of age"" and created a ""substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a duty of care, protection, or support."" R.C. 2919.22(A). The prosecutor had to prove that the appellant acted with the culpable mental state of recklessness. State v. McGee, 79 Ohio St.3d 193, 195 (1997). This means the prosecutor had to show that appellant acted with ""heedless indifference to the consequences"" and disregarded a ""substantial and unjustifiable risk"" that his conduct was ""likely to cause a certain result."" R.C. 2901.22(C). For our purposes, a substantial risk is ""a strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist."" R.C. 2901.01(A)(8).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
937-Shaner,No. The error is alleging that the trial court erred when it did not grant the appellant a new trial based on juror misconduct.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 20 Other Ohio appellate districts have held that permitting illegal drugs to be in the presence of children is sufficient to constitute a violation of R.C. 2919.22(A). State v. Ray, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24536, 2012-Ohio-840, ¶ 16; State v. Thompson, 3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-17-26, 2018-Ohio-637, ¶ 95; see also State v. Norris, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 14CA010699, 2015-Ohio-5180, ¶ 17. Moreover, this court has previously explained that dealing drugs is, itself, ""inherently dangerous."" State v. Workman, 12th Dist. Clermont Nos. CA2016-10-065 and CA2016-10-066, 2017-Ohio-2802, ¶ 24.

¶ 21 In State v. Ray, supra, the Second District Court of Appeals considered a case with similar facts to the case sub judice. In that case, the defendant and her boyfriend brought the defendant's five-year-old child along with them when they went to purchase heroin. The child was present when police arrested the defendant and found heroin on the
codefendant and drug paraphernalia in the defendant's house. Ray at ¶ 16. Even though police apprehended the defendant after the sale, the Ray court held there was ""legally sufficient evidence to support a child-endangering conviction based on [the defendant's] act of transporting her child to a drug buy especially when the occupants of the vehicle return with the drugs in their possession."" Id.

{¶ 22} In this case, the second detective and the confidential informant testified that they saw appellant with an infant child at the time the drug sale was made. Moreover, the first detective testified that he knew the child was present with appellant. The informant testified that appellant produced the methamphetamine from a bag located in the passenger compartment. This would obviously be near the child's position in the rear seat of the vehicle. Whether appellant possessed more drugs in the vehicle after the sale is irrelevant because the evidence shows that appellant permitted a child under his control to be in close proximity to methamphetamine. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.

{¶ 23} Turning to the manifest weight challenge, the facts are such that we do not find the jury clearly lost its way. While it is true that law enforcement did not act immediately to arrest appellant and that the child may have been adequately restrained in a child safety seat, these facts do not weigh against the conviction. Appellant permitted illegal and dangerous drugs to be near a child under his control. This again is not a case where the evidence weighs in favor of acquittal and the jury's verdict created a manifest miscarriage of justice.

{¶ 24} Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant for each offense and these convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Appellant's first assignment of error is overruled.

{¶ 25} Assignment of Error No. 2:
{¶ 26} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT GRANT THE APPELLANT A NEW TRIAL BASED UPON JUROR MISCONDUCT.

---------------------
{¶ 27} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a new trial because the court improperly decided no juror misconduct occurred.

{¶ 28} The decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial pursuant to Crim.R. 33 is within the discretion of the trial court. State v. Brakeall, 12th Dist. Fayette Nos. CA2008-06-022 and CA2008-06-023, 2009-Ohio-3542, ¶ 9. An appellate court reviews the trial court's decision for an abuse of discretion. State v. Carroll, 12th Dist. Clermont Nos. CA2007-02-030 and CA2007-03-041, 2007-Ohio-7075, ¶ 64. A motion for new trial must be made within fourteen days of the jury's verdict. Crim.R. 33(B). Appellant's counsel filed a motion for new trial on June 25, 2018 which suggested prosecutorial misconduct, not juror misconduct. Appellant's motion was denied July 26, 2018. There was no formal motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct made within fourteen days of the jury's verdict and in any event, there were no supporting affidavits provided as required by Crim.R. 33(C). However, because the state does not assert these reasons for supporting the trial court's denial of a new trial, we will address the merits of appellant's argument.

{¶ 29} In criminal trials, the accused has the constitutional right to be tried before a fair and impartial jury. State v. Villarreal, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2004-02-035, 2005-Ohio-1924, ¶ 37, citing Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444 (1968) and Article I, Section 10, Ohio Constitution. This means a ""jury must decide a case solely on the evidence before it, and not reach its verdict based upon influences outside the courtroom."" Villarreal at ¶ 37. A deviation from this standard constitutes juror misconduct. State v. Taylor, 73 Ohio App.3d 827, 831 (4th Dist.1991). The determination of juror misconduct requires a two-part analysis. Id. at 833. First, the court must determine if juror misconduct occurred. Id. Second, the
court must determine whether the misconduct materially prejudiced the defendant's substantial rights. *Id.*

---------------------
{¶ 30} In this case, appellant argues that one of the jurors used outside information by suggesting the possibility that the juror used the clerk of court's website to look up appellant's criminal history to find appellant guilty. The trial court held a hearing on the matter in which appellant's former trial counsel and the juror testified. The juror testified that she rode in the elevator with appellant's former counsel and briefly chatted with the attorney before exiting the elevator. The juror acknowledged that the attorney had remarked about the speed of the guilty verdict, but the juror testified that she only mentioned that people were sick of drugs in response to the statement. The juror denied accessing any court records or otherwise being influenced by outside information.

{¶ 31} Next, appellant's former counsel testified that after the trial she rode the elevator with the juror. During the ride she engaged in a conversation with the juror about the quickness with which the jury arrived at the guilty verdict. According to the former counsel, the juror told her the reason they convicted appellant was because appellant had ""done it before."" However, the attorney later admitted that the juror in the elevator did not expressly tell her that she looked up appellant's prior record.

{¶ 32} As part of its reason for denying the motion for a new trial, the trial court found there was no credible evidence that juror misconduct occurred. This court agrees. Appellant's argument suggesting juror misconduct is unsupported and premised upon inferences from mere possibilities, not established facts. The trial court was in the best position to determine credibility of the witnesses. Since no misconduct occurred, appellant

1. We note the aliunde rule, Evid.R. 606(B), is not implicated herein. Neither party raised the rule's application and the juror's testimony was not offered to impeach the jury's verdict, but rather to give clarification and context to the conversation that took place as previously reported by appellant's former trial counsel.
cannot show prejudice. Consequently, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it
denied appellant's motion for a new trial. Accordingly, appellant's second assignment of error
is overruled.

MARY J. BOYLE, A.J.:

{¶ 1} Defendant-appellant, Henry Jordan, appeals the trial court’s denial of his petition for postconviction relief. He raises six assignments of error for our review.
1. It was a violation of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution and the Ohio Revised Code for the trial court or his agent to communicate ex parte with the prosecutor concerning the findings of facts and conclusions of law and for the prosecutor to write verbatim the [findings of fact and conclusions of law].

2. The trial Judge in [postconviction] was biased or “probably biased” which violated appellant’s right to a neutral and detached magistrate and Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.

3. Defense counsel was ineffective under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution when he failed to conduct an adequate investigation that prejudiced his client’s defense at trial.

4. Mr. Jordan’s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution and Article I section 10 of the Ohio Constitution were violated when Brady evidence was not disclosed to the defense as evidenced by the [postconviction] exhibits.

5. Mr. Jordan is actually innocent and his convictions and sentence violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.

6. The cumulative effect of the errors presented demonstrate Mr. Jordan was denied Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.

Finding no merit to his arguments, we affirm.

I. Procedural History and Factual Background

In January 2017, Jordan was convicted after a bench trial of two counts of rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), one count of aggravated burglary under R.C. 2911.11(A)(1), and one count of kidnapping under R.C. 2905.01(A)(4). The trial court sentenced Jordan to seven years in prison on each count and ordered them to be served concurrent to each other. The trial court notified Jordan that he would be
subject to a mandatory period of five years of postrelease control upon his release from prison and that he would be classified as a Tier II sex offender.

¶ 4 Jordan appealed his convictions to this court, raising five assignments of error. We overruled his assigned errors, upheld his convictions, and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. See State v. Jordan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108.

Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text above is describing a witness testimony in a trial, not an assignment of error. It does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
[T]he first witness to testify was M.S.’s daughter C.M., who was five years old at the time of the incident and nine years old at the time of trial. C.M. testified that on the night of December 23, 2012, her mom M.S. was getting her and her younger brother ready for bed when someone knocked on their door. M.S. went to see who was at the door, and C.M. heard her mother scream and yell for help. C.M. went into the living room and saw “stuff, broken stuff all over the floor.” M.S. was naked and on the floor, and a man was there with “his pants down halfway.” *** He was on top of her and she was on the bottom.” C.M. testified that she did not know who this man was and she had never seen him before. M.S. “had scratches all over her body,” and she was crying.

M.S. told C.M. to get her phone. C.M. called her aunt and said that “a bad guy was there.” C.M.’s aunt, who lived down the street, came to M.S.’s house and called 911. The police arrived shortly after. C.M. could not make an in-court identification of the man she saw that day, testifying, “I don’t remember how his face looked.” Asked if she had ever seen Jordan before, C.M. stated, “No.” Asked if her mom had a boyfriend, C.M. replied, “No.” Asked if she knew “a guy named Marcus Ladson,” C.M. answered, “I don’t remember him.”

M.S. testified that in 2012, she was living with her two children and her fiancé Marcus Ladson. She had met Jordan that summer while walking down the street. M.S. and Jordan exchanged phone numbers and had a consensual sexual relationship. On December 23, 2012, when M.S. was putting her kids to bed, she heard a knock on the door. She opened the door but did not see anyone there, although she saw a silver car parked outside. All of a sudden, Jordan “rushed in” to her house smelling of liquor. M.S. testified about what happened next:
Once he — once he came in, he had, like, my neck, and, you know, forced me, like, on the floor where — I had my son’s bed, like a — toddler bed. I was, like, on the floor, like, towards the TV and he had me, like, towards my stomach, like I was down on my stomach, and, you know, forced me — * * * he rushed into the door, like, having — you know, from behind my neck and, you know, I was on the floor and all I remember is I was on my stomach and his pants was down. * * * My stomach was, like — I was, like, facing down on my stomach and he was on top of me.

M.S. testified that Jordan “shoved” her to the floor “and his pants was down and his penis was in my vagina.” M.S. was crying and screaming. M.S. testified that she thought Jordan used a condom because she saw “a wrapper on the floor.” Jordan then turned her around and put his penis in her mouth. “His stuff, you know, was in. I guess he was — had used a condom, but his stuff was in my mouth. * * * He just had my neck and grabbed his penis and put it in my mouth[.] I was coughing. I was gagging. I was throwing up.”

Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. It describes the events and testimonies related to a sexual assault case, including the investigation and evidence collected by the police.","Context information is below.
---------------------
M.S. testified that she could not physically get up and leave. M.S. tried to get Jordan to stop by throwing a lamp at him. M.S. does not remember Jordan leaving, but she recalls her daughter C.M. and her son standing in the doorway as she was crying and screaming.

All I know is my daughter was — my daughter and my son was, like, standing there. My daughter, she had got — somehow she got to my phone. She found my phone and she had called her auntie, whether — she didn’t know — it was just whoever she called first and realized it was her auntie and her auntie came down because she lived down the street from me and her auntie came, which is Alexis, she had came. She called the police.

M.S. testified that when the nurse at the hospital and the police interviewed her, she told them that she did not know who did this to her, although she “tried to say his name, * * * Harry or Henry” and allegedly described him as being bald. M.S. also testified that she told the police her attacker had tattoos. “I was scared and I thought that, you know, nobody would believe me, you know, and that actually that he actually had done it and had hurt me, you know, but I admit that I do know him.” M.S. testified that she never saw or talked to Jordan again after the night of the assault. However, on cross examination M.S. testified inconsistently about whether her relationship with Jordan continued after December 23, 2012.
M.S. testified that in 2015, a detective contacted her about a “DNA hit from a case from 2012.” The police showed M.S. a photographic lineup, and she picked out Jordan as “the one that came into my house” and raped her on December 23, 2012.

Former Cleveland police detective Andrew Harasimchuk testified that on December 27, 2012, he interviewed M.S. concerning her allegations of rape. M.S. indicated that she had a consensual sexual partner at the time, Marcus Ladson. Det. Harasimchuk had Ladson come to the station to give the police “an elimination standard swab” of his DNA. This sample was sent to the DNA lab so Ladson’s DNA “can be eliminated from the sexual assault kit.” The results of M.S.’s rape kit showed one swab from M.S.’s neck that contained “unknown DNA.”

There was no testimony from Det. Harasimchuk about a condom, the name “Harry or Henry,” or M.S.’s assailant being bald or having tattoos. By May 2013, the police were unable to develop a suspect from this information, and the case went cold.

Cleveland police officer Timothy McGinty testified that he responded to a sexual assault call at M.S.’s house on December 23, 2012. Officer McGinty testified that the front door jamb was pushed out, indicating forced entry, and there was “some kind of lamp globe that’s broken on the floor.” Officer McGinty testified that M.S. was “very upset,” and he requested EMS transport her to the hospital. Furthermore, Officer McGinty testified that he went back to M.S.’s house after accompanying her to the hospital to look for a fingernail that M.S. stated broke off during the attack.

Q: Okay. And included in your work was a visit to Fairview Hospital and then a return visit to the house to look for a fingernail?

A: Correct.

Q: *** Did you look for a condom wrapper while you were at the scene of the house?

A: We looked for any kind of evidence.

Q: Were you ever told about a condom wrapper?

A: No.

Meredith Molnar testified that, in 2012, she was working as a sexual assault nurse examiner (“SANE nurse”) at Fairview Hospital. On
December 23, 2012, she examined M.S. for a sexual assault. Molnar testified that she asked M.S. what happened and M.S. reported to her that the following occurred:

Me and my fiancé and my kids were chilling in my house watching TV and my fiancé was getting ready to go to the bus for work and I was getting my kids ready for bed around 9 p.m. I went to the hallway to get clothes and into the kitchen to get food for dinner and into the bathroom to wash [C.M.] up. She was in the tub. I told her to give me a few minutes to get dinner ready and she said okay.

Then I went into the hallway and I heard someone banging really loud on the front door. I waited in the hallway and someone was banging again on the front door, so I went to go see who it was through the curtain on the door and the man bum-rushed the door somehow. The door hit me on my head and I stumbled back and he got past me in the hallway in the house, and I heard my daughter yell out for me, and I think it scared him or something and he started choking me from behind with one of his arms and my mouth started foaming and I think I passed out. I woke up because my daughter was hitting my legs above my knees yelling at me to get up. I woke up and I didn’t see him and my shorts were messed up and down to my thighs. My shirt was still on. I panicked and all I could do is cry.

My daughter called her auntie, who lived down the street, and she came over and called 911.

Molnar testified that M.S. assumed she was penetrated vaginally, because her pants were down, “but she was unsure if a penis or fingers were penetrating her vagina.” Furthermore, M.S. indicated “that she thinks she remembers performing oral sex” on the offender. Based on these allegations, Molnar took swabs of M.S.’s vaginal and oral cavities, as well as other areas of her body, including a “dried stain” of M.S.’s neck “because she stated [she] was being choked by the assailant with one arm.” Molnar explained that for a dried stain, “we will dip sterile swabs in sterile water and swab that area for possible DNA.”

Molnar also took pictures of M.S.’s neck, on which was a “linear superficial laceration.” M.S. had additional “fresh” bruising on her chin, upper back, left arm, wrist, and hand, and both knees. Molnar testified that M.S. was “very emotional, crying, shaking, talking very quickly.” According to Molnar, M.S. indicated to her that Ladson left the house prior to the incident occurring. Nothing in Molnar’s testimony or M.S.’s medical records indicated a description of M.S.’s
attacker, including whether he was bald or had tattoos. There is also no mention of the name “Harry or Henry”; rather, M.S.’s medical records indicated that the attacker was a “stranger.” Additionally, a checklist that is part of M.S.’s medical records asked if a condom was used at the time of the assault, and the box checked is “Unsure.”

---------------------
Hristina Lekova is a DNA analyst at the Cuyahoga County Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, and she processed M.S.’s rape kit in January 2013. According to Lekova, “Marcus Ladson’s DNA is present in the sperm fraction of the anal swab and the cutting from the crotch area of the underpants. It’s also in the sperm fraction of the vaginal swab ***. He’s also part of the mixture in the dried stain on the neck *** as well as the fingernail scrapings.”

No “seminal fluid” was found in M.S.’s oral swab. An enzyme consistent with vaginal fluid or saliva was found in M.S.’s oral swab, although Lekova did not reach a conclusion regarding the oral swab, other than the enzyme “did not come from the seminal material.” The state asked Lekova, “if somebody was wearing a condom and put a condom in a victim mouth and had vaginal fluid on that condom, would that be consistent with your findings?” Lekova answered, “Yes, that’s possible for that vaginal fluid to be transferred in the mouth cavity.”

Other than Ladson’s and M.S.’s DNA, an unknown DNA profile was found on the “dried stain” swab taken from M.S.’s neck. This unknown DNA profile was uploaded to the CODIS database, and the case went cold.

Lekova’s involvement in this case resumed in December 2015, when she was given a reference swab of Jordan’s DNA that was submitted in another case. Lekova testified that “Jordan could not be excluded as a possible contributor to the DNA mixture obtained from *** the dried stain” found on M.S.’s neck. According to Lekova, the material of the dried stain, i.e., what kind of bodily fluid, was unknown. Asked if Jordan’s DNA was found in M.S.’s vaginal swab, Lekova replied, “There is no Mr. Jordan in the vaginal swab.” Lekova further explained that if an offender uses a condom, she would not expect to find his DNA in the victim’s vaginal swab.

Cleveland police detective Karl Lessman testified that he works in the CODIS Task Force of the Sex Crimes Unit. In October 2015, he received information from the coroner’s office identifying Jordan as “a hit” in M.S.’s cold case. Det. Lessman compiled a photo array and, along with former Det. Harasimchuk, went to M.S.’s house to see if she could
identify her attacker. M.S. picked Jordan’s photo out of the lineup. Det. Lessman located Jordan and took a bucal swab from him, which was sent to the DNA lab. Jordan’s DNA was identified as a match with the DNA found on the dried stain on M.S.’s neck.

¶ 6 In January 2019, Jordan filed a petition for postconviction relief, which the trial court denied on March 22, 2019. While the trial court initially denied Jordan’s requests for findings of fact and conclusions of law, it ultimately issued them in December 2019, after Jordan filed a writ of mandamus in the Ohio Supreme Court. It is from this judgment that Jordan now appeals.

II. Petition for Postconviction Relief

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text above is describing the process and requirements for a postconviction petition under Ohio law, not an assignment of error alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 7 R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) permits a petitioner who claims “that there was such a denial or infringement of the person’s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States” to petition “the court to vacate or set aside the judgment or sentence or to grant other appropriate relief.” Petitioners must state all grounds for relief on which they rely, and they waive all other grounds not set forth in the petition. R.C. 2953.21(A)(4). In determining whether substantive grounds for relief exist, the trial court must consider, among other things, the petition, the supporting affidavits, and the documentary evidence filed in support of the petition. R.C. 2953.21(C).

¶ 8 A postconviction proceeding is not an appeal of a criminal conviction, but, rather, a collateral civil attack on the judgment. State v. Steffen, 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410, 639 N.E.2d 67 (1994). “It is a means to reach constitutional issues which would otherwise be impossible to reach because the evidence supporting those
issues is not contained in the record.” *State v. Murphy*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 00AP-233, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 6129, 5 (Dec. 26, 2000).

¶ 9 A postconviction petition, however, does not provide a petitioner a second opportunity to litigate the conviction. *State v. Hessler*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 01 AP-1011, 2002-Ohio-3321, ¶ 32. Therefore, a petition for postconviction relief is not the proper vehicle to raise issues that were or could have been determined on direct appeal. *State v. Perry*, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph seven of the syllabus.

¶ 10 A criminal defendant seeking to challenge his conviction through a petition for postconviction relief is not automatically entitled to a hearing. R.C. 2953.21; *State v. Calhoun*, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 282, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999). According to R.C. 2953.21(C), a petitioner is entitled to a hearing when, upon review of the petition and the record, the trial court finds that there are “substantive grounds for relief.” In making such a determination, the trial court must consider the petition and supporting affidavits as well as all of the files and records pertaining to the proceedings against the petitioner. R.C. 2953.21(C). A trial court’s decision to deny a postconviction petition without a hearing is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. *State v. Gondor*, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, ¶ 45; *State v. Abdussatar*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92439, 2009-Ohio-5232, ¶ 15.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,Yes.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 11 The trial court does not abuse its discretion in dismissing a petition for postconviction relief without a hearing where (1) the petitioner fails to set out
sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, or (2) the operation of res judicata prohibits the claims advanced in the petition. *Id.* The evidence submitted with the petition must be competent, relevant, and material and not merely cumulative of or alternative to evidence presented at trial. *State v. Combs*, 100 Ohio App.3d 90, 97-98, 652 N.E.2d 205 (1st Dist.1994).

**III. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law**

12 In his first assignment of error, Jordan argues that his due process rights were violated when the trial court had an ex parte communication with the state “concerning the findings of fact[] and conclusions of law” and because the trial court adopted the state’s proposed findings and conclusions verbatim. In his second assignment of error, he argues that “[t]he odor of bias” against him was “overwhelming” because the trial court “improperly conduct[ed] ex parte communications with the prosecutor.” We will address these assignments of error together because they are interrelated.

13 When a trial court denies a postconviction relief petition, R.C. 2953.21(H) requires the trial court to make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law. The purpose of requiring findings of fact and conclusions of law is to apprise the petitioner of the basis for the court’s disposition and to facilitate meaningful appellate review. *State ex rel. Carrion v. Harris*, 40 Ohio St.3d 19, 19, 530 N.E.2d 1330 (1988).
In *State v. Maxwell*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107758, 2020-Ohio-3027, a case involving a trial court’s denial of a postconviction petition, this court recently explained:


---------------------

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text describes Jordan's arguments against the trial court's adoption of the state's proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, but it does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, Jordan questions the timing and process of the state's submission and the trial court's adoption of the findings.","Context information is below.
---------------------
When a party’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law are accurate in law and in fact, nothing prohibits a trial court from adopting that party’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a postconviction proceeding. *State v. Williams*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 85180, 2005-Ohio-3023, ¶ 35, citing *State v. Combs*, 100 Ohio App.3d 90, 652 N.E.2d 205 (1st Dist.1994). “In the absence of demonstrated prejudice, it is not erroneous for the trial court to adopt, in verbatim form, findings of fact and conclusions of law which are submitted by the state.” *State v. Thomas*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87666, 2006-Ohio-6588, ¶ 15, citing *State v. Powell*, 90 Ohio App.3d 260, 263, 629 N.E.2d 13 (1st Dist.1993). Moreover, a trial court may adopt verbatim a party’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law as its own if it has thoroughly read the document to ensure that it is completely accurate in fact and law. *State v. Jester*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 83520, 2004-Ohio-3611, ¶ 16; see also *Thomas* at id.

*Id.* at ¶ 13.

There is nothing in the record in this case that establishes the trial court had an ex parte communication with the state at any point. Jordan makes assumptions based upon how quickly the state filed findings of fact and conclusions of law and how quickly the trial court adopted them verbatim. Jordan questions “how * * * the [s]tate [knew] to file such proposed findings.” Jordan makes an unsupported assumption that “[e]vidently, the [j]udge or the [j]udge’s counsel (his agent) told the prosecutor handling the [postconviction] [p]etition to prepare [findings of fact and conclusions of law] ex parte.” In support of his assumption, he points out that “[a] lot of activity took place on this [p]etition in the 48 hours
between December 17 – 19, 2019, after months of inactivity.” But Jordan fails to acknowledge that the Ohio Supreme Court’s docket is public for anyone to view.

{¶ 16} Jordan further argues that a “trial court cannot delegate its deliberative process,” and the trial court here did so when it used the state’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Jordan cites to State v. Roberts, 110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168, and State v. Pickens, 2016-Ohio-5257, 60 N.E.3d 20 (1st Dist.), claiming his case “fits squarely in the analysis” of these cases. However, both Roberts and Pickens involved the trial court’s ex parte communications with the state in rendering its judicial opinions, and there is simply no evidence of that here.


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text describes Jordan's first and second assignments of error, which are related to the trial court's involvement in preparing the sentencing opinion and the trial court's alleged bias due to ex parte communications. The third assignment of error is about ineffective assistance of counsel. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor in the first two assignments of error.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 17} Roberts is further distinguishable because it involved a trial court “directly involv[ing] the prosecutor in preparing the sentencing opinion” in a death-penalty case, which the Ohio Supreme Court stated is not permitted. Id. at ¶ 159. Pickens is also distinguishable because the prosecutor in the case did not file the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and did not serve them on the defendant. Id. at ¶ 9. Here, the prosecutor both filed her proposed findings and conclusions and served a copy on Jordan’s counsel the same day that she filed them. Accordingly, we disagree with Jordan that this case falls “squarely in the analysis” of Roberts and Pickens.

{¶ 18} Further, we find no merit to Jordan’s second assignment of error that the trial court was biased against him due to ex parte communications occurring between the judge and the state. We further note that Jordan had every opportunity
along the way, from May until December, to file his own proposed findings and conclusions of law, and he did not do so.

¶ 19 Thus, we overrule Jordan’s first and second assignments of error.

IV. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel

¶ 20 In his third assignment of error, Jordan argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately investigate his case, violating his constitutional rights.

¶ 21 The trial court found that Jordan’s claim for ineffective assistance of counsel is barred by res judicata because he raised the same issue in his direct appeal. Additionally, the trial court addressed the merits of Jordan’s claim and found it to be meritless.

A. Res Judicata

¶ 22 Under the doctrine of res judicata, “a valid, final judgment rendered upon the merits bars all subsequent actions based upon any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the previous action.” State v. Patrick, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99418, 2013-Ohio-5020, ¶ 7, citing Grava v. Parkman Twp., 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 382, 653 N.E.2d 226 (1995). To overcome the res judicata bar, the petitioner must show, using extrinsic evidence, that he or she could not have appealed the original constitutional claim based on the information in the original trial record. Combs, 100 Ohio App.3d at 97-98, 652 N.E.2d 205. Said another way, issues properly raised in a petition for postconviction relief are only those that could not have been raised on direct appeal because the evidence
supporting such issues is outside the record. *State v. Milanovich*, 42 Ohio St.2d 46, 50, 325 N.E.2d 540 (1975). Thus, a trial court may dismiss a petition based on res judicata if an issue was or should have been raised on direct appeal. *State v. Dowell*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 86232, 2006-Ohio-110, ¶ 10, citing *Perry*, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph seven of the syllabus.

Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text describes Jordan's argument that his trial counsel was ineffective, not that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Extrinsic evidence attached to the petition, however, does not automatically defeat the res judicata bar. Rather, evidence outside the record must meet “some threshold standard of cogency; otherwise it would be too easy to defeat the holding of *Perry* by simply attaching as exhibits evidence which is only marginally significant and does not advance the petitioner’s claim[.]” *State v. Lawson*, 103 Ohio App.3d 307, 315, 659 N.E.2d 362 (12th Dist.1995), quoting *State v. Coleman*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-900811, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 1485, 21 (Mar. 17, 1993). Moreover, the evidence dehors the record must not be evidence that was in existence and available for use at the time of trial and that could and should have been submitted at trial if the defendant wished to use it. *Dowell* at ¶ 10.

In his direct appeal, Jordan argued that

his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to investigate and pursue the theory that Ladson was the man who raped M.S. Jordan alleges that counsel should have cross examined witnesses about Ladson and presented “evidence in the public record concerning” Ladson, including Ladson’s 2015 and 2016 convictions for murder and other gang-related violent felonies, which resulted in a sentence of life in prison.

*Jordan*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106272, 2018-Ohio-4108, at ¶ 42.
The state argued that trial counsel was not ineffective because trial counsel’s decision was a strategic decision and that Jordan was not prejudiced because it was only speculation that the outcome of trial would have been different had trial counsel investigated Ladson. *Id.* at ¶ 42. We agreed. *Id.* at ¶ 43-44. We pointed out that the victim had “consistently maintained that her sexual activity with Ladson was consensual.” *Id.* at ¶ 43. We rejected Jordan’s argument, finding that Jordan failed to show that his trial counsel’s performance was deficient, and that he was prejudiced. *Id.* at ¶ 44.

In his direct appeal, Jordan had asked this court to take judicial notice of four exhibits that the state used in Ladson’s murder trial, including three pictures of Ladson showing his tattoos and one expert report from a detective in the Cleveland Police Department’s Gang Impact Unit concluding that Ladson was a member of the criminal gang the Heartless Felons. We declined to do so. *Id.* at ¶ 7. Jordan attached those exhibits to his petition for postconviction relief as well as an affidavit from his trial counsel.


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error related to Jordan's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, not misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Jordan’s trial counsel averred that he “did not employ an investigator and did not otherwise discover any photographs of the victim’s [fiancé] or any reports about him being a Heartless Felon gang member.” Trial counsel further stated that he “was aware that the [fiancé] was serving a prison sentence at the time” of Jordan’s trial and that if counsel had “had the photographs of the [fiancé] and the report of him being a member of the Heartless Felons gang then [he] would have used them to [Jordan’s] benefit at his trial.” Thus, although the exhibits were
available at the time of Jordan’s trial, his trial counsel stated in the affidavit attached to Jordan’s petition for postconviction relief that he did not investigate the matter or discover the exhibits. That is the basis of Jordan’s claim now.

{¶ 28} When a postconviction claim depends for its resolution upon outside evidence, a common pleas court may not apply res judicata to dismiss the claim. Perry at paragraph nine of the syllabus. But a reviewing court may sustain the claim’s dismissal on other grounds. State v. Peagler, 76 Ohio St.3d 496, 668 N.E.2d 489 (1996), paragraph one of the syllabus. After review, we do not agree with the trial court that Jordan’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was barred by res judicata. We will therefore address the merits of Jordan’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which the trial court did as well.

B. Merits of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim

{¶ 29} To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance, a defendant must establish that counsel’s performance was deficient and that the defendant was prejudiced by the deficient performance. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Counsel will only be considered deficient if his or her conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Id. at 688. Further, a defendant must show that he or she was prejudiced by counsel’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 694.

{¶ 30} When reviewing counsel’s performance, this court must be highly deferential and “must indulge a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.” Id. at 689. To
establish resulting prejudice, a “defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” *Id.* at 694. “A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” *Id.*

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text describes Jordan's contention that his trial counsel was ineffective, not that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 31 Jordan contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failure to adequately investigate Ladson and the fact that Ladson had tattoos. However, Jordan’s entire argument that his trial counsel was ineffective is based on his assertion is that the SANE nurse’s notes “state clearly” that the victim told her “shortly after the attack that her fiancé [Ladson] was home during the attack” and that her attacker had tattoos that “cover his body.” Jordan further claims that the victim “told the authorities the attacker had tattoos including neck/facial tattoos.” Jordan claims that the exhibits attached to his petition establish that Ladson had tattoos all over his body and was a member of the Heartless Felons. Jordan maintains these exhibits would have changed the outcome of his case because he does not have tattoos on his neck or face, his DNA was not found on the victim’s vaginal or anal swabs, and Ladson’s DNA was found on both of the victim’s swabs. He contends that this “case presents itself completely differently after the exhibits and facts contained in the exhibits submitted in postconviction are considered.” We disagree.

¶ 32 Throughout his petition and appellate brief, Jordan repeats that the evidence presented at trial established that the victim told the SANE nurse that her fiancé was home during the attack and that her attacker had tattoos all over his body.
These claims are simply not true. Nor is it true that the evidence presented at trial established that the victim told police that her attacker had tattoos on his face or neck.

¶ 33 In Jordan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, we stated that according to the SANE nurse’s notes discussing the victim’s narrative of what occurred, the victim told the SANE nurse that on the evening of December 23, 2012, she and her fiancé and children were “chilling in [her] house watching TV and [her] fiancé was getting ready to go to the bus for work and [she] was getting her kids ready for bed around 9 pm.” Id. at ¶ 18. The victim continued to describe what occurred after that without specifically stating that her fiancé left to go to work at some point before the attack. But we explained that “[a]ccording to [the SANE nurse], M.S. indicated to her that [her fiancé] left the house prior to the incident occurring.” Id. at ¶ 20. And we pointed out in Jordan’s direct appeal that “[t]here is nothing in the medical records, SANE nurse’s testimony, or the police officer’s testimony indicating that M.S. told anyone that her attacker * * * was bald, or that he had tattoos.” Id. at ¶ 38. Finally, we stated that the SANE nurse’s notes and M.S.’s medical records were introduced into evidence, although we acknowledged that no police reports were made part of the record. Id. at ¶ 37.

Answer:"
095-Jordan,Yes.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 34 Even if we assume for the sake of argument now that Jordan’s trial counsel should have investigated Ladson further, Jordan has not established that he was prejudiced by such a purported deficient performance. As we found in Jordan’s direct appeal, the victim consistently maintained that she had consensual sex only
with Ladson. Moreover, Jordan fails to account for the fact that the victim’s daughter, who was five years old at the time of the rape and nine years old at the time of trial, testified that she had never before seen the man whose pants were “down halfway” and was “on top” of her mother. At the time of the rape, Ladson was the victim’s fiancé and thus, the victim’s daughter would have known him at the time of the attack (although she did not remember Ladson at the time of trial four years later). And most importantly, Jordan’s theory that the victim told the nurse that her fiancé was home at the time of the rape and that her attacker had tattoos, and that she told police that her attacker had tattoos, is not supported by the evidence. Although the victim did testify that she thought she told police that her attacker had tattoos, even Jordan acknowledges that what she told police and the SANE nurse immediately following the attack (which was over four years earlier) would be more credible, and she did not mention tattoos to the nurse or police. Thus, the exhibits that Jordan attached to his petition showing Ladson’s tattoos and that he was a member of the Heartless Felons, do not establish “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.

Accordingly, we overrule Jordan’s third assignment of error.

V. Brady Violation

In his fourth assignment of error, Jordan maintains that his due process rights were violated when the state failed to disclose Brady material to him. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). In his
direct appeal, Jordan argued that the prosecutors committed misconduct when they “failed to turn over to the defense information regarding Ladson’s gang and criminal activity.” *Jordan*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, ¶ 46. In his petition for postconviction relief, he argues that the state should have disclosed the photos of Ladson evidencing his tattoos and the gang report showing that Ladson was a member of the Heartless Felons. According to Jordan, the same prosecutor who tried his case also tried Ladson’s murder case and admitted these exhibits in Ladson’s criminal cases.

¶ 37 The trial court found that Jordan’s *Brady* claim was barred by res judicata and was meritless. After review, we agree with the trial court that Jordan’s claim regarding Ladson’s criminal activity is barred by res judicata. Although the documents establishing Ladson’s criminal gang activity were not before this court in Jordan’s direct appeal, Jordan still argued that the prosecutor should have turned them over to defense counsel. We fully addressed this argument and therefore find that Jordan cannot now raise it in his postconviction petition. We will, however, address Jordan’s claim with respect to the photo exhibits attached to his petition showing that Ladson has tattoos all over his body.

¶ 38 As we explained in *Jordan*, “*Brady* stands for the proposition that ‘the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.’” *Jordan*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, ¶ 46, quoting *Brady* at 87. See
also Crim.R. 16(B)(5). We further stated in Jordan that “Brady does not apply to materials that are not wholly within the control of the prosecution. There is no need to require the state to “disclose” material that is readily available to the defense.” Id. at ¶ 47, quoting State v. McGuire, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105732, 2018-Ohio-1390, ¶ 24.

¶ 39 Ladson was convicted of murder in June 2016. Jordan’s trial was not until January 2017. The photo exhibits of Ladson’s tattoos were not ones that were wholly within the state’s control because they were part of the public record in Ladson’s criminal trial where the state proved that Ladson was a member of the Heartless Felons and had tattoos on his body indicative of membership in the gang. Therefore, the state was not required to disclose these photos to Jordan.

¶ 40 Moreover, as we explained in the previous assignment of error, the exhibits that Jordan attached to his petition for postconviction relief showing Ladson was “covered” in tattoos, had been convicted of murder, and was a member of the Heartless Felons is not material or exculpatory.

¶ 41 Accordingly, Jordan’s fourth assignment of error is overruled.

VI. Actual Innocence

¶ 42 In his fifth assignment of error, Jordan argues that he is “actually innocent” of the acts against the victim and asks this court to recognize this as a freestanding, cognizable claim.

¶ 43 The state contends that this claim fails under State v. Apanovitch, 155 Ohio St.3d 358, 2018-Ohio-4744, 121 N.E.3d 351. In his reply to this court, Jordan
counters that *Apanovitch* held no such thing. An in-depth review of *Apanovitch* is necessary.

¶ 44 In *Apanovitch*, the defendant was convicted of one count each of aggravated murder and aggravated burglary, and two counts of rape. He was sentenced to death in January 1985. The body of the victim was found in a bedroom of her home. She had been strangled and severely beaten, and sperm was found in her mouth and vagina.

Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text describes a case involving a postconviction petition based on newly discovered DNA evidence, and it discusses the legal standards and procedures for such petitions. It does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 45 Apanovitch’s case before the Ohio Supreme Court involved his fourth postconviction petition based on newly discovered DNA evidence taken from the victim’s vagina. After a hearing, the trial court found that because Apanovitch’s DNA could not have contributed to the vaginal swab taken from the victim, that Apanovitch “presented clear and convincing evidence of his actual innocence of vaginal rape, and acquitted him of same.” *Id.* at ¶ 28. This court upheld the trial court’s findings. *State v. Apanovitch*, 2016-Ohio-2831, 64 N.E.3d 429, ¶ 46 (8th Dist.).

¶ 46 Apanovitch brought his fourth postconviction petition under R.C. 2953.23(A)(2), which states:

The petitioner was convicted of a felony, the petitioner is an offender for whom DNA testing was performed under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code or under former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code and analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence related to the inmate’s case as described in division (D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, and the results of the DNA testing establish, by clear and convincing evidence, actual innocence of that felony offense or, if the person was sentenced to death, establish, by clear and convincing evidence, actual
innocence of the aggravating circumstance or circumstances the person was found guilty of committing and that is or are the basis of that sentence of death.

As used in this division, “actual innocence” has the same meaning as in division (A)(1)(b) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code, and “former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code has the same meaning as in division (A)(1)(c) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code.

¶ 47 R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(b) defines “actual innocence.” It states:

“[A]ctual innocence” means that, had the results of the DNA testing conducted under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code or under former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code been presented at trial, and had those results been analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence related to the person’s case as described in division (D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted, or, if the person was sentenced to death, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the aggravating circumstance or circumstances the petitioner was found guilty of committing and that is or are the basis of that sentence of death.

Answer:"
095-Jordan,No. The text describes a petition for postconviction relief and the Supreme Court's analysis of whether the petitioner met the criteria for filing such a petition. It does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 48 Because Apanovitch’s petition for postconviction relief was an untimely and successive petition, it fell under R.C. 2953.23(A), which the Supreme Court explained is jurisdictional and only permits an inmate to file a petition “under specific, limited circumstances.” Apanovitch, 155 Ohio St.3d 358, 2018-Ohio-4744, 121 N.E.3d 351, ¶ 22. Under this provision, a petitioner must meet the criteria in either R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) or (2) before a trial court can consider the petition.

¶ 49 R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) provides that petitioner must show both of the following: (a) the petitioner was “unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts” upon which the petitioner relies or the petitioner is asserting a claim based on a new, retroactively applicable federal or state right recognized by the United States
Supreme Court after the petition became untimely and after the petitioner had filed earlier petitions, and (b) the petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty or eligible for the death sentence but for “constitutional error at trial.” R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a) and (b).

The second exception under R.C. 2953.23(A)(2) applies when the results of DNA testing establish by clear and convincing evidence the petitioner’s “actual innocence” of a felony offense of which the petitioner was convicted or of an aggravating circumstance that is the basis of a death sentence. Because this subsection is not relevant to our present analysis, we will not discuss the Supreme Court’s analysis of this subsection here, except to note that the Supreme Court held that Apanovitch did not meet the requirements to file a petition for postconviction relief under this section. See id. at ¶ 27-34.

The Supreme Court further held that Apanovitch did not meet the jurisdictional criteria under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1). First, the Supreme Court determined that it did not need to determine if Apanovitch satisfied R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a), because he “clearly [had] not satisfied R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b), which require[d] him to show that his conviction resulted from ‘constitutional error at trial.’” Id. at ¶ 26. In arguing that he satisfied R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b), Apanovitch asserted only that he was actually innocent of rape. But the Supreme Court explained that “under the United States Constitution, an actual-innocence claim ‘is not itself a constitutional claim,’” and “therefore does not involve a ‘constitutional error at trial’ under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b).” Id., quoting Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S.
390, 404, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993). Because Apanovitch did not raise any other argument relating to a “constitutional error at trial,” the Supreme Court held that his petition did not qualify under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1).

---------------------
{¶ 52} The Ohio Supreme Court held in Apanovitch that a claim for “actual innocence” does not amount to a “constitutional error at trial” for purposes of establishing R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b). In this case, however, we are not dealing with an untimely or successive petition under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b). Rather, we are addressing a timely and first petition for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a).

---------------------
{¶ 53} Nonetheless, Apanovitch is still instructive here. And after reviewing the relevant case law, we find that because a claim for actual innocence “is not itself a constitutional claim,” it does not set forth a cognizable claim under R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) either. Because Jordan’s petition does not involve DNA testing or a death sentence, the relevant portion of R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) permits a petitioner to file a petition asking a court to set aside or vacate his or conviction when the petitioner claims “that there was such a denial or infringement of the person’s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States.” Thus, a claim for actual innocence cannot meet the requirements of R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) because it “is not itself” a constitutional claim. Ohio courts have held as much. See State v. Zich, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-15-1263, 2017-Ohio-414, ¶23, discretionary appeal not accepted, 151 Ohio St.3d 1425, 2017-Ohio-8371, 84 N.E.3d 1063 (“In light of the United States Supreme Court’s
decision in *Herrera*, we find no merit to appellant’s due process arguments regarding his claims of actual innocence.”); *State v. Watson*, 126 Ohio App.3d 316, 323, 710 N.E.2d 340 (12th Dist.1998) (“Since the United States Supreme Court has not recognized actual innocence as a constitutional right, we also refuse to judicially create such a constitutional right.”); *State v. Loza*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA96-10-214, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4574 (Oct. 13, 1997) (“Courts have interpreted *Herrera* to stand for the proposition that a petitioner is not entitled to postconviction relief without a showing of a violation of rights that were constitutional in dimension, which occurred at the time that the petitioner was tried and convicted.”); *State v. Hunter*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-090569, 2012-Ohio-2859, ¶ 54 (an actual innocence claim does not demonstrate “a constitutional violation in the proceedings” that led to the petitioner’s conviction); *State v. Davis*, 5th Dist. Licking No. 2008-CA-16, 2008-Ohio-6841 (“The trial court did not err in dismissing appellant’s claim of actual innocence because his claim fails to raise ‘a denial or infringement of appellant’s rights under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States’ as required by R.C. 2953.21.”); *State v. Nash*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87635, 2006-Ohio-5925, ¶ 14 (“[T]rial court did not err in failing to consider the merits of this ‘actual innocence’ claim because the claim fails to raise ‘a denial or infringement of rights under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States’ as required by R.C. 2953.21.”); *State v. Hines*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 89848, 2008-Ohio-1927, ¶ 24, quoting *State v. Williams*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 85180, 2005-Ohio-3023, ¶ 31 (“[A] claim of actual innocence is not itself a
constitutional claim, nor does it constitute a substantive ground for postconviction relief.”

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text describes a claim of ""actual innocence"" and discusses the petitioner's constitutional rights, but it does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Moreover, R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23 address the phrase, “actual innocence,” throughout the text of the statutes. R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(b) defines “actual innocence” for purposes of postconviction petitions (which we previously set forth). Indeed, throughout the entirety of R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23, the General Assembly discusses “actual innocence,” but only in terms of DNA testing. Nowhere in R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23 do the statutes allow for a claim of “actual innocence” except with respect to DNA testing.

Jordan contends that he has “squarely raised a [d]ue-[p]rocess claim under both the Ohio and federal [c]onstitutions” in his petition for postconviction relief by asserting that he is actually innocent and maintaining that he established as much through the documents he attached to his petition. He asks this court to recognize his “freestanding actual innocence claim” that no other court in Ohio has previously recognized in a petition for postconviction relief. Again, “R.C. 2953.21(A) requires a petitioner for postconviction relief to allege a ‘denial or infringement’ of [the person’s] rights under the Ohio or United States Constitutions.” Thus, this requires petitioners to show that a procedural error occurred at trial such that their constitutional rights were violated. State v. Warmus, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99962, 2014-Ohio-928, ¶ 8 (discussing the petitioner’s claims of prosecutorial misconduct denying him a fair trial, ineffective assistance of counsel violating his Sixth Amendment rights, and a denial of his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination). A claim of “actual innocence, however, involves a claim of factual innocence. As explained by the Iowa Supreme Court in *Dewberry v. State*, 941 N.W.2d 1 (Iowa 2019), regarding a “freestanding claim of actual innocence”:

Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text above is discussing the legal concept of actual innocence and the Supreme Court's approach to it, not alleging any misconduct by the prosecutor or the state.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Our understanding of actual innocence is consistent with the United States Supreme Court’s approach to actual innocence. The Supreme Court has “not resolved whether a prisoner may be entitled to habeas relief based on a freestanding claim of actual innocence.” *McQuiggin v. Perkins*, 569 U.S. 383, 392, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 1931, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013); see *Schmidt v. State*, 909 N.W.2d [778,] 790 [Iowa 2018] (stating the Supreme Court has not yet recognized a freestanding claim of actual innocence). Instead, the Supreme Court has recognized “a gateway claim of actual innocence such that the petitioner may obtain review of the underlying constitutional merits of his or her procedurally defaulted claim.” *Schmidt*, 909 N.W.2d at 790 (citing *Herrera*, 506 U.S. at 404, 113 S.Ct. at 862 (majority opinion), and *In re Davis*, 557 U.S. 952, 955, 130 S.Ct. 1, 3, 174 L.Ed.2d 614 (2009) (Scalia, J., dissenting)). In discussing the concept of actual innocence in this context, the Court has made clear it is referring to factual innocence:

“A prototypical example of ‘actual innocence’ in a colloquial sense is the case where the State has convicted the wrong person of the crime. Such claims are of course regularly made on motions for new trial after conviction in both state and federal courts, and quite regularly denied because the evidence adduced in support of them fails to meet the rigorous standards for granting such motions. But in rare instances it may turn out later, for example, that another person has credibly confessed to the crime, and it is evident that the law has made a mistake. In the context of a noncapital case, the concept of ‘actual innocence’ is easy to grasp.”

*Sawyer v. Whitley*, 505 U.S. 333, 340-41, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 2519-20, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992). In *Bousley v. United States*, the Court stated “‘actual innocence’ means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.” 523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). This understanding of actual innocence is consistent with the Court’s pronouncement that “substantial claim[s] of actual innocence are extremely rare.” *Schlup v. Delo*, 513 U.S. 298, 321, 115 S.Ct. 851, 864, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995); see also *McQuiggin*, 569 U.S. at 386, 133
S.Ct. at 1928 (cautioning that “tenable actual-innocence gateway pleas are rare”).

---------------------
Dewberry at 6-7. We note that in Dewberry, the court refers to cases cited by Jordan in support of his argument, including Schmidt and Schlup.

¶ 56 Thus, even assuming for the sake of argument that we could consider Jordan’s freestanding claim of actual innocence, he would not be entitled to a new trial based upon the exhibits he attached to his petition. “To establish actual innocence, petitioners must demonstrate that, ‘in light of all the evidence,’ ‘it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted’” them. Bousley at 623, quoting Schlup at 327-328. Although the Bousley court was discussing when a federal habeas court may grant a writ even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default; i.e., where a constitutional violation “‘has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,’” it is instructional here (because that is what Jordan is attempting to claim). Id., quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 491-492, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986), superseded by statute on other grounds, Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, Pub. L. 104-132, Apr. 24, 1996, 110 Stat. 1214. But as we previously explained, Jordan’s exhibits showing Ladson was “covered” in tattoos, had been convicted of murder, and was a member of the Heartless Felons is not material or exculpatory to Jordan’s claims, and certainly do not demonstrate that it is “‘more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.’” Bousley at 623, quoting Schlup at 327-328.
After review, we conclude that Jordan’s “actual innocence” claim fails to raise “a denial or infringement of rights under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States” as required by R.C. 2953.21. We therefore overrule his fifth assignment of error.

VII. Cumulative Error

In his six assignment of error, Jordan contends that “[t]he cumulative effect of the errors in this case, * * * ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and a biased judge, amounted to a denial of a fair trial.” Not having found any error or prejudice, Jordan’s argument has no merit.

Accordingly, we overrule Jordan’s six assignments of error.

Judgment affirmed.

It is ordered that appellee recover from appellant the costs herein taxed.

The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.

It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the common pleas court to carry this judgment into execution. The defendant’s conviction having been affirmed, any bail pending is terminated. Case remanded to the trial court for execution of sentence.
A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.

IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO
SIXTH APPELLATE DISTRICT
ERIE COUNTY

State of Ohio     Court of Appeals Nos. E-17-024
    Appellee

v.

Steven W. Yee     DECISION AND JUDGMENT
    Appellant

Decided:  February 9, 2018

Kevin J. Baxter, Erie County Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.

Steven W. Yee, pro se.

JENSEN, P.J.

I. Introduction

¶ 1 Appellant, Steven W. Yee, appeals the judgment of the Erie County Court of
Common Pleas, denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We affirm.
A. Facts and Procedural Background

¶ 2 Appellant has been before this court on several occasions. Most recently, we considered appellant’s arguments concerning a petition for postconviction relief that was filed by him and denied by the trial court. State v. Yee, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-12-017, 2013-Ohio-5184. In that case, we summarized the background facts of this case as follows:

In March 1989, the Erie County Grand Jury issued a six count indictment against appellant, Steven W. Yee, charging three counts of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery. The indictment included both capital and firearm specifications.

Yee entered into a plea agreement wherein the state promised to nolle four counts of the indictment and the capital specifications. In exchange, Yee agreed to enter a plea of guilty to one count of aggravated murder with a firearm specification and one count of aggravated robbery with a firearm specification. On August 30, 1993, Yee appeared in court, withdrew his previous pleas of not guilty and entered pleas of guilty pursuant to the agreement. When entering his plea, Yee reserved the right to appeal the trial court’s authority to sentence him to two consecutive terms of incarceration on the firearm specifications.

A sentencing hearing was held in September 1993. As to the charge of aggravated murder, Yee was sentenced to life in prison with eligibility of parole after 20 years. As to the charge of aggravated robbery, Yee was 2.
sentenced to 10-25 years in prison. Yee was sentenced to three years each for the two firearm specifications. The trial court ordered that the sentences for the aggravated murder and aggravated robbery be served concurrently. The sentences for the firearm specifications were ordered to be served consecutive to each other and consecutive to the concurrent sentences for aggravated murder and aggravated robbery.

Yee appealed. Upon review, we vacated the portion of the sentence which imposed two consecutive three-year terms of incarceration for the firearm specifications. See State v. Yee, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-93-72, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 5142 (Nov. 18, 1994). * * *

We remanded the matter to the trial court.

On December 28, 1995, with consent of counsel, the trial judge issued a judgment entry nunc pro tunc merging the firearm specifications and imposing three years of actual incarceration for the specifications. The stated purpose of the entry was to “reflect the correct language as to the sentence imposed on the firearm specifications.” The judgment entry was filed with the clerk of courts on January 4, 1996.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
286-Yee,Yes. The text describes an assignment of error where the defendant (Yee) alleges that the prosecutor (the state) committed misconduct by using misleading evidence to secure his convictions.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
On July 27, 2004, Yee filed a motion for leave to withdraw his guilty pleas or, in the alternative, to vacate and set aside the judgment of conviction. The trial court denied Yee’s motion. On April 8, 2011, Yee filed a motion to vacate his conviction or withdraw his guilty plea. Again, the trial court denied Yee’s motion.
On February 29, 2012, Yee filed a motion for de novo resentencing pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision in State v. Johnson, 128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061. The trial court, construing the motion as a petition for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21, denied the motion as untimely. The trial court also found that Yee’s claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Yee, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-12-017, 2013-Ohio-5184, at ¶ 2-8.

¶ 3 Appellant subsequently appealed the trial court’s denial of his petition for postconviction relief. We rejected appellant’s arguments, and found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the postconviction petition. Id. at ¶ 15.

¶ 4 Thereafter, on October 11, 2016, appellant filed a “motion for leave to withdraw his ‘void’ guilty plea based on actual innocence, prosecutorial misconduct and newly discovered evidence” pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1. In his motion, appellant asserted that his conviction was void because he was lured into pleading guilty despite his innocence based upon the state’s pledge to seek the death penalty “with a 100% chance of acquiring it” based on “bogus” DNA evidence. In support of his argument, appellant stated that he had recently received documents the FBI sent to the Innocence Project on August 1, 2013, allegedly revealing that the federal government utilized misleading evidence to secure his convictions in federal court. Appellant insisted that, had he been aware of the use of such evidence, he would not have entered a guilty plea. Appellant
further indicated that the state threatened to use the same “bogus” evidence as the federal authorities used to secure the convictions.

{¶ 5} In response to appellant’s motion, the state noted that the evidence referred to by the FBI in its letter to the Innocence Project pertained to hair analysis that was performed by the government’s experts. The conclusions drawn from the hair analysis were later found to have exceeded the limits of science. However, the state argued that this evidence was inconsequential in light of the overwhelming incriminatory evidence that remained to establish appellant’s guilt.

{¶ 6} The state pointed out that the FBI’s letter included a disclaimer that the Bureau took “no position regarding the materiality of the error in this case.” Moreover, the state cited the additional incriminating evidence to support its opposition to appellant’s motion. This evidence placed appellant in the vicinity of the murder on the day in question, and included, inter alia, shell casings that were discovered in appellant’s vehicle matching those found in the victim’s vehicle as well as a coconspirator’s blood found in both the victim’s vehicle and appellant’s vehicle.

Answer:"
286-Yee,Yes.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 7} The state also emphasized the fact that appellant’s guilty plea, which followed the state’s disclosure of all incriminating evidence including the hair analysis, constituted an absolute admission of guilt belying his claim of actual innocence.

{¶ 8} Upon consideration of the parties’ arguments, the trial court issued its decision summarily denying appellant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea on March 30, 2017. Appellant’s timely notice of appeal followed.
B. Assignments of Error

¶ 9 On appeal, appellant assigns the following errors for our review:

Assignment of Error One: The trial court retains jurisdiction over deciding a post sentencing motion to withdraw guilty plea, Crim.R. 32.1, and committed plain error, Crim.R. 52(B), and/or abused its discretion by the denial of the appellant’s motion.

Assignment of Error Two: The trial court committed plain error, Crim.R. 52(B), and/or abused its discretion by the denial of Mr. Yee’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea that was improperly motivated and/or coerced by the government that was utilizing bogus evidence to create a windfall conviction, rendering the guilty plea void and open to collateral attack at any time.

II. Analysis

¶ 10 In his assignments of error, appellant argues that the trial court committed plain error in denying his Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty plea.

¶ 11 Under Crim.R. 32.1, “[a] motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.” A motion to withdraw a guilty plea made subsequent to sentencing will be granted only in “extraordinary cases” upon the demonstration of manifest injustice. State v. Smith, 49 Ohio St.2d 261, 264, 361 N.E.2d 1324 (1977).
A motion made pursuant to Crim. R. 32.1 is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. *Id.* at paragraph two of the syllabus. Thus, we review the trial court’s decision denying appellant’s motion under an abuse of discretion standard. *State v. Francis*, 104 Ohio St.3d 490, 2004-Ohio-6894, 820 N.E.2d 355, ¶ 32. Abuse of discretion suggests that the trial court’s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. *Blakemore v. Blakemore*, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983).

In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court retained jurisdiction to consider his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In his second assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
286-Yee,No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is related to the reliability of the hair analysis evidence and the denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
In making his arguments, appellant relies upon the FBI’s letter to the Innocence Project as evidence that he was actually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted. However, the statements made in the letter, as represented to this court by appellant, only call into question the veracity of a small fraction of the state’s evidence – namely the scientific reliability of the hair analysis that was performed in this case. As noted by the state, the incriminating evidence implicating appellant in this case was not limited to the hair evidence. Moreover, it is axiomatic that a guilty plea operates as a complete admission of guilt. *State v. Stumpf*, 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 104, 512 N.E.2d 598 (1987). Appellant does not challenge the trial court’s plea colloquy or assert that his plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.
¶ 15 In sum, we find that the newly discovered unreliability of the hair analysis evidence in this case, standing alone, does not justify a finding a manifest injustice necessary to warrant the granting of appellant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea under Crim.R. 32.1. Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. Accordingly, appellant’s assignments of error are not well-taken.

III. Conclusion

¶ 16 In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.

Judgment affirmed.

A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to App.R. 27. See also 6th Dist.Loc.App.R. 4.

346-Vance,"No. The text describes errors assigned by the defendant (Lewis Vance) against the trial court, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
This is an appeal from a Jackson County Common Pleas Court judgment of conviction and sentence. Lewis Vance, defendant below and appellant herein, assigns the following errors for review:

FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:

“THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT REFUSED TO HOLD A HEARING OR REVIEW APPELLANT VANCE’S MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL. FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH

1Different counsel represented appellant during the trial court proceedings.
AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION; ARTICLE I, SECTION 10 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION; CRIM.R. 33.”

SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:

“THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY FAILING TO PROPERLY NOTIFY APPELLANT VANCE THAT HE WAS SUBJECT TO A DISCRETIONARY TERM OF UP TO THREE YEARS OF POST-RELEASE CONTROL AT THE SENTENCING HEARING. ADDITIONALLY, ANY NOTIFICATION REGARDING POST-RELEASE CONTROL WAS OMITTED FROM THE SENTENCING ENTRY. THESE FAILURES VIOLATED VANCE’S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AS GUARANTEED BY THE FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE I, SECTION 10 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION.”

THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:

“THE SENTENCE IMPOSED BY THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD BE REVERSED AND REMANDED AS IT DOES NOT COMPORT WITH THE PURPOSES OF FELONY SENTENCING. FIFTH AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION; ARTICLE I, SECTION 10 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION; R.C. 2929.11.”

FOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:

“THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO SPECIFY ITS CONSECUTIVE SENTENCING FINDINGS IN ITS JUDGMENT ENTRY. R.C. 2929.14(C)(4).”

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
346-Vance,"No. The text describes a series of events related to a criminal trial, including competency evaluations and plea changes, but it does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 2 On June 23, 2014, a Jackson County Grand Jury returned an indictment that charged appellant with crimes alleged to have been committed against Patrick Morgan, including aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(D), murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A), murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B), felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), and felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2). The indictment also included crimes alleged to have been
committed against Rachel Canode and her daughter M.C., including kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), abduction in violation of R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), attempted rape in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A)/2907.02(A)(2), tampering with evidence in violation of R.C. 29021.12(A), abduction in violation of R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), and kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(B)(2). The trial court appointed counsel and appellant entered not guilty pleas to all charges.

¶ 3 Counsel filed various motions and, inter alia, requested a competency evaluation. The trial court granted the request. At the November 21, 2014 competency hearing, both parties stipulated to the forensic report and the court later determined appellant to be competent to stand trial.

¶ 4 On March 30, 2015, appellant's trial counsel requested leave to change appellant's plea to not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) and an evaluation, along with a third competency evaluation. The trial court granted appellant’s request for leave to change his plea and ordered an evaluation at Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare. However, on June 16, 2015, the court ordered the evaluation to occur at Twin Valley Behavioral Healthcare. The court also denied the request for the third competency evaluation.

¶ 5 On February 19, 2016, appellant sent a pro se letter to the trial court judge and indicated that he wished to have different counsel. At this juncture, counsel also requested yet another competency evaluation, but the trial court indicated that both prior evaluations determined appellant's competency, as set forth in R.C. 2945.37(G), and that appellant raised no additional facts or argument as to why a third competency evaluation was necessary. Thus, the court denied the motion.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
346-Vance,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The text describes the events leading up to and during the trial, including witness testimonies and the actions of the trial court. There is no mention of any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 6 On July 14, 2016, the trial court issued a pretrial order and indicated that it had
received additional unsolicited correspondence from appellant, including: (1) a June 27, 2016 letter, (2) a June 27, 2016 voluntary statement, (3) a June 24, 2016 voluntary statement, and (4) a June 19, 2016 motion for dismissal and a list of witnesses. Because appellant had counsel, the court did not file any of the documents, but instructed counsel to file, within 14 days, any necessary motion regarding the issues that appellant raised in the documents. In a separate order, the court indicated that it had received defendant’s pro se motion for acquittal, but again stated that it would not consider appellant’s pro se motion because counsel represented appellant.

¶ 7 The trial court held a four day trial beginning October 20, 2016. The first witness, William Ghearing, stated that he was driving toward Wellston, Ohio at 7:00 or 8:00 p.m. on November 29, 2013 when appellant's pick-up truck struck him head-on. When Ghearing approached appellant, appellant told him “You never seen me. You never seen me at all, and don’t know who I am.” Shortly thereafter, appellant disappeared.

¶ 8 Chillicothe Police Officer Morgan Music testified that at the time of the accident, he worked for the Coalton Police Department. After Officer Music arrived at the crash site, he noticed a body in the truck bed. Once he secured the scene, Officer Music also learned that a man had been observed walking about a quarter mile away. Officer Music assisted in detaining that man (appellant), who displayed blood on his face, pants and jacket. Jackson County Sheriff's Deputy Urias Hall later visited the hospital to see appellant and testified that he smelled of alcohol, but appeared to be oriented.

¶ 9 Officers eventually learned that appellant's truck actually belonged to Patrick Morgan. Also, Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) Special Agent Bryan White testified about processing the vehicle crash site, and stated that the victim’s (Morgan's) pants and underwear were
found around his knees, and that the victim had only one shoe.

¶ 10 Nineteen-year-old Dustin Jones testified that on the night in question, appellant came to his parents’ neighboring home and asked him to help load a deer into a truck. Jones assisted, but observed that the object was not a deer but rather a human body that he recognized as the person who had been staying with appellant. Appellant then threatened Jones and his family with harm if he did not help. Jones helped appellant, then returned to his parents’ home. The following morning, he told his father about the incident.

346-Vance,"No. The text above is describing the evidence presented in a trial, not an assignment of error. It does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 11 Rachel Canode testified that, as a friend of appellant’s sister, she knew appellant. Canode explained that she was at her mother’s house on November 29, 2013 when appellant came by to look for her mother to sell some rings. Canode told appellant that her mother was at a friend’s house, and that she and her twelve-year-old daughter (M.C.) were also getting ready to walk to that house. Canode stated that while appellant walked with them, he kept putting his arms around her and grabbing her breasts and legs. Canode testified that the second or third time appellant put his arms around her, a knife fell from appellant’s coat. When they arrived at appellant’s sister’s house (the house where appellant was living), he started to walk up the sidewalk to the home while Canode attempted to escape his grasp. Ultimately, Canode’s daughter (M.C.) grabbed appellant’s arm and appellant put the knife to her throat. Canode stated that she and her daughter then fled to her mother’s house.

¶ 12 Wellston Police Department Officer Steve Wilbur testified that he was at the fire station when he heard the radio call about the crash and the body in the truck bed. Officer Wilbur also explained that he later received a call from Rachel Canode who stated that appellant attempted to force her and her daughter into a house. Officer Wilbur testified that he met with Canode, then
walked to the home where appellant had been living. When no one answered the door, Officer Wilbur looked in the windows. Blood could be seen on the porch and inside the house on a couch and a knife. Officer Wilbur also found a single shoe in the driveway.

¶ 13 BCI Agent Todd Fortner testified that he processed the crime scene at the home and found no signs of struggle. Fortner observed two couches, one with and one without bloodstains, a wooden chair, a lamp, a table and a small radio. None of the furniture had been overturned or broken. Because one couch and the door area contained all of the bloodstains, Fortner testified that, based on his experience, he believed that at the time of the attack the victim was either lying or sitting on the couch.

¶ 14 BCI Forensic Scientist (DNA Section) Andrea Weisenburger testified that (1) the knife blade recovered from appellant’s home contained Patrick Morgan’s blood, (2) the knife handle had mostly Morgan’s blood, but also some of appellant’s blood, (3) Morgan’s blood appeared on appellant's jeans, and (4) the truck's air bag had mostly Morgan’s blood, but also some of appellant’s blood.

¶ 15 Franklin County forensic pathologist John Daniels testified that he performed Patrick Morgan's autopsy. The autopsy revealed multiple stab wounds to Morgan's face, eye and neck, including a wound through his eye and one inch into his brain. In total, Morgan had 24 wounds, including defensive wrist wounds. Daniels testified that the manner of death was homicide.

¶ 16 Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections Parole Officer Brett McRoberts testified that on November 29, 2013, appellant was under his supervision while on community control after his judicial release. McRoberts noted that appellant had been living at a homeless shelter in Athens, but McRoberts did not know that appellant had moved to Wellston.
¶ 17 At the close of the state’s evidence, appellant's counsel requested a Crim.R. 29 motion for dismissal of Count 8 of the indictment (rape). The trial court denied the motion.

---------------------
¶ 18 Michelle Vance, appellant’s sister, testified that her brother and his roommate, Morgan, were living at her home. She explained that she offered the two a place to stay after they had been removed from Timothy House, an Athens shelter.

¶ 19 Phillip Lemaster testified that Jay Poe told him that Brian Canode, Rachel Canode’s brother, wanted to talk with him. Lemaster stated that Brian Canode asked him to assault appellant in exchange for heroin, and that he agreed to do so. Brian Canode and Lemaster parked at Brian Canode’s mother’s house, then Lemaster, Canode and Jay Poe, who had been waiting at the Canode home, walked to appellant’s house. Lemaster stated that appellant's truck was not at the house and when no one answered their knock, Brian Canode took Lemaster home.

¶ 20 Brian Canode, however, denied any agreement with Lemaster to attack appellant. Canode also testified that he, Rachel Canode’s brother, went to appellant’s home that evening, but because he did not see the truck that his sister described, he left the residence. Against the advice of counsel, appellant chose to exercise his right to testify. On the night in question, appellant and Morgan were abusing drugs and alcohol. Appellant claimed that Rachel Canode’s brother and several other men came to the house with bats and a knife and attacked him and Morgan. Appellant testified that the men beat him with a bat and raped him with a stick, but appellant managed to drag Morgan from the house and screamed for help. Appellant left the home to get help, but because he was unsuccessful in that endeavor, he returned to the house to save Morgan. After the men overwhelmed appellant, the men forced appellant into the truck and threw Morgan into the truck bed. Appellant testified that he did not kill Morgan, that he did not grab Rachel
Canode and that he did not attempt to restrain Canode or her daughter. Appellant, however, admitted that officers found his knife at the scene and that his knife contained Morgan’s blood.

¶ 21 After the four-day trial, the jury found appellant guilty of: Count 1 aggravated murder R.C. 2903.01(D), Count 2 murder R.C. 2903.02(A), Count 3 murder R.C. 2903.02(B)), Count 4 felonious assault R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), Count 5 felonious assault R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), and Count 9 tampering with evidence R.C. 2921.12(A). The jury also found appellant not guilty of: Count 6 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), Count 7 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), Count 8 attempted rape R.C. 2923.02(A)/2907.02(A)(2), Count 10 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), and Count 11 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(B)(2).

Answer:"
346-Vance,No. The text describes the first assignment of error as alleging that the trial court erred by refusing to hold a hearing or to conduct a review of the appellant's motion for new trial. It does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 22 The trial court sentenced appellant to serve life in prison without parole on count one (aggravated murder) and thirty-six months on count 9 (tampering with evidence), with the sentences to be served consecutively to one another. At that point, appellant filed a pro se (1) Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial and argued that irregularities existed in the court proceedings, including jury and prosecutorial misconduct, and that new evidence supported his self-defense claim, and (2) a Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. This appeal followed.2

I.

2The Appellate Rules require us to determine the appeal on the assignments of error set forth in the briefs. App.R. 16 provides for a brief for the appellant, a brief for the appellee, and a reply brief, stating that “[n]o further briefs may be filed except with leave of court.” As provided by App.R. 16, appellant’s counsel filed an appellate brief and raised four assignments of error. The appellee also filed a brief and appellate counsel filed a reply brief. It also appears that appellant filed a pro se brief and raised four additional assignments of error. Neither the United States nor Ohio Constitution mandates a hybrid representation to allow a pro se appellant with appointed counsel to file briefs in addition to those that his attorney filed. State v. Thompson, 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 6-7, 514 N.E.2d 407 (1987); State v. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, paragraph one of the syllabus; State v. White, 71 Ohio App.3d 550, fn. 1, 594 N.E.2d 1087 (4th Dist.1991). Nevertheless, we may choose later in this opinion to briefly address appellant’s arguments in his pro se brief.
¶ 23 In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by refusing to hold a hearing or to conduct a review of appellant’s motion for new trial.

¶ 24 Generally, the decision to grant a new trial is within a trial court’s discretion, and a ruling on a motion for a new trial will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 564 N.E.2d 54 (1990); State v. Williams, 43 Ohio St.2d 88, 330 N.E.2d 891 (1975). An abuse of discretion “implies that the court’s attitude [was] unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.” State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 404 N.E.2d 144 (1980). “A decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process that would support that decision.” AAAA Enterprises, Inc. v. River Place Community Redevelopment, 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597 (1990).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
346-Vance,"No. The text is describing an assignment of error related to the trial court's refusal to rule on the appellant's pro se motion for new trial, not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 25 Appellant filed a pro se motion for new trial, but the trial court refused to rule on appellant’s pro se motion. Appellant contends that no sound reasoning process supported the court's decision, and, thus, the trial court's refusal to consider the motion constitutes an abuse of discretion. The state points out that the trial court refused to rule on the pro se motion because appellant had legal representation and that neither the United States Constitution nor the Ohio Constitution or case authority permits hybrid representation.

¶ 26 “Although appellant has the right either to appear pro se or to have counsel, he has no corresponding right to act as co-counsel on his own behalf.” State v. Thompson, 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 6-7, 514 N.E.2d 407 (1987). The Supreme Court of Ohio has reaffirmed that principle and held that “in Ohio, a criminal defendant has the right to representation by counsel or to proceed pro se with the assistance of standby counsel. However, these two rights are independent of each other and may not be asserted simultaneously.” State v. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d
227, paragraph one of the syllabus.

{¶ 27} In the case sub judice, appellant attempted to make multiple pro se filings while he had legal representation. The trial court aptly noted that appellant had legal representation and advised counsel to review the pro se filings and file any necessary motion within 14 days with regard to any relevant issues raised in the pro se documents. Once again, Ohio courts need not address pro se motions when the defendant enjoys the benefit of counsel. See State v. Smith, 4th Dist. Highland No. 09CA29, 2010-Ohio-4507, ¶ 100 [“The trial court indicated that it would refuse to consider motions filed by Smith because the court was appointing counsel to represent him. We are satisfied that the trial court did not err as, although a defendant ‘has the right either to appear pro se or to have counsel, he has no corresponding right to act as co-counsel on his own behalf.’”]; State v. Smith, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-160836 and C-160837, 2017-Ohio-8558; State v. Greenleaf, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2005-P-0017, 2006-Ohio-4317. “When a criminal defendant is represented by counsel and counsel does not join the defendant’s pro se motion or otherwise indicate a need for the relief sought by the defendant pro se, the trial court cannot properly consider the defendant’s pro se motion.” Smith at ¶ 32, citing State v. Davis, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 05AP-193, 2006-Ohio-5039, ¶ 12; State v. Pizzaro, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94849, 2011-Ohio-611, ¶ 7 [“One who is represented by counsel and who does not move the court to proceed pro se, may not ‘act as co-counsel on his own behalf.’”, quoting Greenleaf at ¶ 70].

Answer:"
346-Vance,"No. The text describes an assignment of error by the appellant, not misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 28} Appellant, however, argues that State v. Keene, 4th Dist. Washington No. 16CA10, 2017-Ohio-7058, mandates a different result. In Keene, the defendant, prior to the scheduled sentencing hearing, sent two letters to the trial court, without counsel’s assistance, and sought to withdraw his guilty pleas. Although the trial court held a hearing and ruled on the defendant’s pro
se motion in spite of counsel's representation, the court was not required to do so. Once again, the Supreme Court of Ohio has established that a defendant has either the right to representation by counsel or the right to proceed pro se, but has no right to hybrid representation. *Martin*, paragraph one of the syllabus.

{¶ 29} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons we overrule appellant’s first assignment of error.

II.

{¶ 30} In his second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court: (1) failed to properly notify him at the sentencing hearing that he is subject to a discretionary term of up to three years of post-release control, and (2) omitted from the sentencing entry the notification regarding post-release control. Appellant asserts that these failures violate his constitutional rights as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.

{¶ 31} In the case sub judice, appellant was convicted of aggravated murder and tampering with evidence. The tampering with evidence charge carries an additional three-year term of post-release control. At sentencing, the trial court stated: “If you are placed on Post-Release Control under the Authority of the Adult Parole, you could be returned to Prison for up to nine months for each violation of rule if your stated Prison term equals or exceeds eighteen months. Otherwise, the longest single Prison sanction, you (unintelligible) half of your stated Prison term. You can be returned to Prison for up to fifty percent of your Prison Sentence for all violations committed. If convicted of a new Felony while on Post-Release Control, in addition to being punished for the new offense, the Court can add an additional consecutive Prison term of one year, however, whatever part
remains of the Post-Release Control term; whichever is greater.”

{¶ 32} The state concedes that the post-release control language did not state that the term would be three years. The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that the failure to properly impose post-release control renders the post-release control portion of the sentence void. State v. Fischer, 128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, 942 N.E.2d 332, ¶ 26. The remedy for this error is a new sentencing hearing, limited to the proper imposition of the post release control sanction. Id. at ¶ 29.

As we previously mentioned, the state concedes this issue and we hereby sustain appellant's second assignment of error.

{¶ 33} Accordingly, we find merit to appellant's argument and we remand this matter to the trial court for proceedings consistent with R.C. 2929.191 to properly impose the term of post-release control.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct? Respond 'Yes' or 'No'.
Answer:"
346-Vance,"No. The text describes an assignment of error by the appellant, not the prosecutor. The error is related to the trial court's sentence and the consideration of the appellant's mental health issues, not any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 34} In his third assignment of error, appellant, citing the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. 2929.11, asserts that the trial court’s sentence does not comport with the purposes of felony sentencing. In particular, appellant argues that the trial court's refusal to consider appellant’s mental health issues and impose a term of life without parole, which will not provide appellant with an opportunity for parole or future mental health services, fails to comply with the requirements and purpose of R.C. 2929.11.

{¶ 35} Appellant cites State v. Marcum, 146 Ohio St.3d 516, 2016-Ohio-1002, 59 N.E.3d 1231, for the proposition that an appellate court may vacate or modify any sentence that is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law only if the appellate court finds, by clear and convincing evidence,
that the record does not support the sentence. Counsel argues that appellant self-medicated with alcohol and drugs and had no access to professional mental health services. The state counters that *Marcum* dealt with sentencing for a classified felony, not for aggravated murder. *Id.* at ¶ 22-23. The state points out that *Marcum* relied on R.C. 2953.08 for the statutory authority to review a felony sentence, however, R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) makes clear, “[a] sentence imposed for aggravated murder or murder pursuant to sections 2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code is not subject to review under this section.” (Emphasis added.)

{¶ 36} The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that “R.C. 2953.08(D) is unambiguous. ‘A sentence imposed for aggravated murder or murder pursuant to section 2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code is not subject to review under this section’ clearly means what it says: such a sentence cannot be reviewed.” *State v. Porterfield*, 106 Ohio St.3d 5, 2005-Ohio-3095, 829 N.E.2d 690, ¶ 17. Moreover, this court has held “[i]t is evident that the General Assembly intended to treat sentencing on aggravated murder and murder convictions differently from other felony sentences.” *State v. Hawkins*, 4th Dist. No. 13CA3, 2014-Ohio-1224, ¶ 15., citing *State v. Porterfield* at ¶ 17-18.

{¶ 37} Appellant also contends that the trial court’s sentence did not comport with due process and is excessive. However, our review of the record reveals that, although the trial court expressed concern and acknowledged appellant’s mental health issues, and allowed competency evaluations and forensic reviews and pondered how better treatment earlier in life might have affected appellant, the court concluded that the aggravating factors nevertheless outweighed appellant’s mental health concerns: “You know, we’ve talked about the failures of the mental health
system. We’ve talked about the dramatic cuts to that system. Maybe if we had a system that was properly funded, Mr. Vance may have received appropriate treatment. But, those are all ‘what ifs.’ I don’t know. The reality that I have to deal with is that Mr. Vance is a dangerous individual. He has committed a savage crime.” The court further noted the injury to the victim, his family, and appellant’s criminal history, including a prior violent offense.

¶ 38 Consequently, after our review, we conclude that (1) appellant’s aggravated murder sentence is not subject to appellate review, and (2) appellant's sentence for tampering with evidence comported with due process and is not excessive. Accordingly, we overrule appellant’s third assignment of error.

IV.

¶ 39 In his final assignment of error, appellant asserts that at the sentencing hearing the trial court sentenced him to serve (1) life in prison without parole for the aggravated murder conviction, and (2) thirty-six months on the tampering with evidence charge. Appellant argues, however, that the court failed to specify its consecutive sentencing findings in its entry as R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) requires. The court stated: “[t]hat will be consecutive punishment as necessary to protect the public. The punishment is not disproportionate to the crime, and your criminal history demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary.” The court's December 6, 2016 sentencing entry recited the statutory language of R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) - including the subsections (a), (b), and (c). However, the entry provides lines next to the restatements of these subsections, presumably, as the state contends, as a check-off. Based on the trial court’s remarks at sentencing, subsection (c) - “the offender’s history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender” should have been initialed or checked, but it
does not appear that the court did so.

¶ 40 The state maintains that this error may be corrected with a nunc pro tunc entry. However, in view of our resolution of appellant’s second assignment of error, the trial court may address this issue when, on remand, it addresses the imposition of post-release control as referenced in appellant’s second assignment of error.

¶ 41 Accordingly, we sustain appellant’s fourth assignment of error and remand the matter to the trial court to include the findings to support consecutive sentencing.

V.

¶ 42 In conclusion, we (1) overrule appellant’s first and third assignments of error, (2) find appellant’s second and fourth assignments of error to be well-taken, and (3) remand this cause to the trial court to address the post-release control term for tampering with evidence the and the findings for consecutive sentences.3

Answer:"
346-Vance,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The text discusses the appellant's claims against the trial court and his trial counsel, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.

3Appellant’s pro se brief contends that the trial court abused appellant’s First Amendment rights when it referred to appellant as Muslim. However, our review finds no such reference. Appellant also asserts that he consistently stated that he had been attacked on November 29, 2013. Thus, he appears to attack the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. However, the state presented ample competent, credible evidence so that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of aggravated murder and tampering with evidence proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury heard appellant’s version of the events and did not find his testimony credible. Appellant also asserts that the trial court erred by failing to replace the jury after (1) one juror revealed she participated in an event in support of the county prosecutor, and (2) another juror shared outside information to the jury. However, the trial court properly questioned the first juror and concluded that she could be impartial. Later, during deliberations, the second juror revealed to several jurors that she disputed the victim’s daughter’s (M.C.) age. After the trial court conducted a hearing and questioned the jurors, the court dismissed the second juror, brought in an alternate, and retained the other jurors who stated that the comments did not influence their deliberations. Appellant also asserts that his trial counsel failed to (1) use certain evidence, (2) investigate and subpoena witnesses, (3) remove jury members, (4) defend appellant, and (5) that he should have been granted new counsel. However, appellant’s claims are undermined by the fact that the jury found appellant not guilty of five of the eleven charges. Additionally, after the trial court discussed appellant’s representation, the court asked appellant if he was satisfied with defense counsel, and appellant agreed. Here, counsel’s representation did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.
PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
JUDGMENT ENTRY
