121-Whittaker,Yes.,0,", 2014-Ohio- 5445, 25 N.E.3d 1023, ¶ 203, citing State v. Treesh , 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 490, 739 N.E.2d 749. This court will not second guess an attorney’s trial tactics as they are generally not subject to question by a reviewing court. State v. Armstrong , 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 09-MA-204, 2011-Ohio-661, ¶ 47. {¶34} In sum, appellant has failed to meet her burden to demonstrate that she was prejudiced by her counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness. – 8 – Case No. 17 JE 0025 {¶35} Accordingly, appellant’s second assignment of error is without merit and is overruled. {¶36} Appellant’s third assignment of error states: APPELLANT WAS DENIED A FAIR TRIAL UNDER THE DOCTRINES OF “CUMULATIVE ERROR” OR “PLAIN ERROR”. {¶37} Appellant raises two issues in this assignment of error. First, she argues the cumulative effect of the errors cited in her previous two assignments denied her a fair trial. Second, she makes a claim of prosecutorial misconduct. We will address each in turn. {¶38} An appellate court may reverse a defendant's conviction based on the doctrine of cumulative error. Cumulative error occurs when errors deemed separately harmless deny the defendant a fair trial. State v. DeMarco , 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus. {¶39} We have not found any harmless errors in this case. Thus, the doctrine of cumulative error does not apply. {¶40} Appellant also makes a claim of prosecutorial misconduct. She points to comments by the prosecutor describing her defense as “laughable” and calling her a “nut.” (Tr. 61, 62). {¶41} The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the conduct complained of deprived the defendant of a fair trial. State v. Fears , 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 332, 715 N.E.2d 136 (1999). In reviewing a prosecut or's alleged misconduct, a court should look at whether the prosecutor's remarks were improper and whether the prosecutor's remarks affected the appellant's substantial rights. State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984). “[T]he touchstone of analysis ‘is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.’” State v. Hanna, 95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, ¶ 61, quoting Smith v. Phillips , 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982). An appellate court should not deem a trial unfair if, in the context of the entire trial, it appears clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found the defendant guilty even without the improper comments. State v. LaMar , 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, ¶ 121. – 9 – Case No. 17 JE 0025 {¶42} Calling appellant a “nut” and her defense “laughable” although unprofessional, does not rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct. This was a bench trial, not a jury trial. The impact of remarks is lessened when they are heard by a court, since the court is presumed to only consider relevant evidence. State v. Wiles, 59 Ohio St. 3d 71, 87, 571 N.E.2d 97 (1991). Nothing in the record indicates that the trial court relied upon these statements in any way. Moreover, the trial court reprimanded the prosecutor by instructing him to treat appellant with some respect. (Tr. 63). {¶43} Although the prosecutor’s comments were improper, there is no indication that they affected appellant’s substantial rights or denied her a fair trial. {¶44} Accordingly, appellant’s third assignment of error is without merit and is overruled. {¶45} For the reasons stated above, the trial court’s judgment is hereby affirmed. Waite, J., concurs Bartlett, J., concurs [Cite as Steubenville v. Whittaker, 2018-Ohio-4014.] For the reasons stated in the Opinion rendered herein, the assignments of error are overruled and it is the final judgment and order of this Court that the judgment of the Steubenville Municipal Court of Jefferson County, Ohio, is affirmed. Costs to be waived. A certified copy of this opinion and judgment entry shall constitute the mandate in this case pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. It is ordered that a certified copy be sent by the clerk to the trial court to carry this judgment into execution. NOTICE TO COUNSEL This document constitutes a final judgment entry."
371-Myers,Yes.,0,"'s testimony. The court can hear the testimony of witnesses that were never called to testify at the original trial, and can determine the worth of their testimony as well as the witnesses' credibility. The trial judge can ask what the counsel knew, when he knew it, and whether a mistake was not strategic, but was instead careless. As here, in a postconviction hearing, a judge can hear testimony about what evidence was made available to trial counsel and when it was made available. A trial court in a postconviction proceeding thus plays a unique role in the consideration of ineffective assistance of counsel claims. It is the only court that actually hears testimony on that issue. State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, ¶ 54. {¶ 149} Myers' fifth assignment of error is sustained. To the extent n oted above, Myers' second and third assignments of error are sustained in part. 5. Cumulative Errors {¶ 150} Assignment of Error No. 10: {¶ 151} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C), MYERS' CLAIM OF CUMULATIVE ERROR (GROUND 60), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF. {¶ 152} Myers argues the trial court erred in dismissing Ground 60 whic h alleges cumulative errors. We include under this assignment of error M yers' claims that the trial court erred in dismissing Grounds 18 and 49, which allege cumul ative effect of the denial of effective assistance of counsel during the guilt and penalty phases of the trial (as initially argued in the fifth and sixth assignments of error). Under the doctrine of cumulative errors, a judgment may be reversed if the cumulative effect of errors deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the instances of trial-court error do es not individually constitute Warren CA2019-07-074 - 53 - cause for reversal. State v. Kirkland, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, ¶ 140. Given our resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth assignments o f error, this assignment of error is moot. See State v. Stein , 3d Dist. Logan No. 8-17-39, 2018-Ohio-2621, citing App.R. 12(A)(1)(c). III. CONCLUSION {¶ 153} In light of our resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth a ssignments of error, the trial court's judgments denying Myers' motions for discovery and his PCR petition regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to present expert testimony at the penalty phase of the trial are reversed and the matter i s remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Specifically, on remand, the trial court shall permit discovery, conduct an evidentiary hearing, and rule on Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition. {¶ 154} Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. HENDRICKSON, P.J., and S. POWELL, J., concur."
