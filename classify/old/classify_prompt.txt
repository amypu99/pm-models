I want to know whether or not this appellate case meets some criteria for further evaluation of prosecutorial misconduct. Cases with any of the following do not meet the standards for further review: Allegation is procedurally barred (e.g. barred by res judicata because it was not raised during original trial and now itâ€™s too late), Defendant is a juvenile, Case is not criminal, Allegation of error is against the court, not the prosecutor/state, Allegation is against defense attorney, not state, No allegation of prosecutorial misconduct, Misconduct is from a grand jury proceeding, Trial is before 2001, Allegation is in procedural history, Appellee is the city, not state, and Prosecutor is a city prosecutor, not county prosecutor. In your response, include whether the case meets standards or does not meet standards for future evaluation. If it does not meet standards for further evaluation, provide the reason why (from the above reasons listed). Please think through this task step-by-step. Use the following text from the case to make your decision
