The defendant, Justin Jarmon, was originally sentenced to 35 years in prison, but the sentence was remanded to the trial court after an appeal. The trial court then resentenced Jarmon to 30 years in prison. It was during this resentencing process that Jarmon claims the trial court erred by failing to hold a hearing before issuing the journal entry regarding his ""modified sentence."" 

This issue was raised on appeal after the resentencing, so it is not barred by res judicata.",0,0

The case discusses the standards for reopening an appeal based on a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The applicant, Tamir H. Butts, is seeking to reopen his appeal, and the court is considering whether his proposed assignments of error present a colorable claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court is evaluating whether the alleged errors at trial were prejudicial and whether the applicant's appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise these issues on appeal. The court is not addressing the issue of whether the allegations were procedurally barred, such as by res judicata, because the applicant is seeking to reopen his appeal, not to raise new issues that were not previously litigated.",0,0
