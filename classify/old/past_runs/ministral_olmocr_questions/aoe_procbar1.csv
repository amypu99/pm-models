{¶2} App.R. 26(B)(1) and (2)(b) require applications claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel to be filed within 90 days from journalization of the decision unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later time. This court issued its decision on April 12, 2018, and Johnson filed his application one day late on July 12, 2018 (18 (remaining days in April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 12 (July) = 91). Thus, this application is untimely. Johnson did not proffer any explanation to show good cause.

¶ 15 On appeal, appellant does not contend his successive petition was timely under R.C. 2953.21(A)(2). In addressing the issue of timeliness, the trial court noted the trial transcripts in appellant's direct appeal in case No. 12CR-5963 were filed February 2, 2015 and, therefore, appellant's petition ""should have been filed no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the filing of the trial transcript in the Court of Appeals, which is February 2, 2016."" (Dec. 7, 2018 Dec. & Entry at 4.) Because the petition was not filed until August 1, 2018, the court found the petition to be untimely. We agree.

---------------------
¶ 1 On March 16, 2021, the applicant, Dazelle Newman, pursuant to
App.R. 26(B) and State v. Murnahan, 62 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204 (1992),
applied to reopen this court’s judgment in State v. Newman, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.
107944, which this court dismissed as untimely on October 22, 2019. Newman now argues that his appellate counsel should have raised the following issues: (1) The trial court erred in proceeding to trial without holding a hearing or obtaining an evaluation as to Newman’s competency to represent himself. (2) There was insufficient evidence to convict Newman of attempted murder; the evidence could only allow simple assault and vehicular assault. (3) The kidnapping convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. (4) His convictions generally were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. (5) His convictions were the result of police and prosecutorial misconduct. (6) The trial judge had predetermined Newman’s guilt. (7) The photo lineup was unduly suggestive. For the following reasons, this court denies the application to reopen.¹

Moreover, the Supreme Court of Ohio in State v. LaMar, 102 Ohio St.3d 467, 2004-Ohio-3976, 812 N.E.2d 970, and State v. Gumm, 103 Ohio St.3d 162, 2004-Ohio-4755, 814 N.E.2d 861, held that the 90-day deadline for filing must be strictly enforced. In those cases, the applicants argued that after the court of appeals decided their cases, their appellate lawyers continued to represent them, and their appellate lawyers could not be expected to raise their own incompetence. Although the Supreme Court agreed with this latter principle, it rejected the argument that continued representation provided good cause. In both cases, the court ruled that the applicants could not ignore the 90-day deadline, even if it meant retaining new counsel or filing the applications themselves. The court then reaffirmed the principle that lack of effort, lack of imagination, and ignorance of the law do not establish good cause for failure to seek timely relief under App.R. 26(B). Accordingly, this court denies the application as untimely.

134-Boler,Yes,0,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 18 We first point out that the version of R.C. 2953.21(A)(2) in effect prior to March 2015, the time window for appellant’s petition, limited the filing of a petition to no later than 180 days after the filing of the transcript. Appellant was ordered to file his transcript in his direct appeal on or before October 12, 2009, but a notification on the clerk of courts’ record indicates that a “Notice of Supplemental Transmission of Record” filed on October 13, 2009. Thus, appellant filed his latest petition for postconviction relief more than eight years after the notation of the supplemental transmission of record was filed. “[A] court may not entertain a petition filed after the expiration of the period prescribed in division (A) of that section or a second petition or successive petitions for similar relief on behalf of a petitioner unless division (A)(1) or (2) of this section applies[.]” (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2953.23(A). Here, neither section applies. Appellant does not (1) claim that he was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which he must rely to present the claim for relief [R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a)], (2) claim that subsequent to the deadline or his earlier
petition that the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively [R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a)], (3) argue that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty of the offense of which he was convicted, [R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b)], and (4) claim that he has submitted DNA evidence to show his “actual innocence” [R.C. 2953.23(A)(2)]. Thus, appellant untimely filed his petition for postconviction relief.

---------------------
On January 16, 2008, while his direct appeal was still pending before this court, Lloyd filed a petition for postconviction relief. Although represented by counsel, Lloyd's petition raised many of the same issues as part of his then pending direct appeal. On July 29, 2008, the trial court denied Lloyd's petition without a hearing. Lloyd did not appeal from the trial court's decision.
On January 4, 2010, approximately 18 months after this court's decision affirming Lloyd's conviction and sentence on direct appeal, Lloyd filed a motion with this court requesting his appeal be reopened pursuant to App.R. 26(B). Pursuant to App.R. 26(B)(1), an application for reopening must be filed ""within ninety days from journalization of the appellate judgment unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later time."" On April 7, 2010, this court denied Lloyd's motion to reopen his appeal after finding he had ""failed to show good cause as to why his application was not filed in a timely manner[.]"" State v. Lloyd, 12th Dist. Warren Nos. CA2007-04-052 and CA2007-04-053 (April 7, 2010) (Entry Denying Application for Reopening). Lloyd then appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court, which again declined review.

[Appellant’s] rights to due process and a fair trial were violated when the trial court allowed the State to present irrelevant, cumulative, overly prejudicial evidence about prior bad acts through additional non-victim witnesses, whose testimony also violated the Ohio Rape Shield Statute, as well as testimony of hundreds of unindicted offenses.
Davis. See also State v. Cochran, 10th Dist. No. 16AP-491, 2017-Ohio-1528, ¶ 5 (""Absent extraordinary circumstances, such as an intervening decision by the Supreme Court, an inferior court has no discretion to disregard the mandate of a superior court in a prior appeal in the same case.""). The fact the dissenting opinion in Armengau II arguably supports the grounds for new trial appellant asserted under Crim.R. 33(A)(1) through (5) does not alter our conclusion in Armengau I that appellant’s motion asserting those grounds was untimely filed, and appellant failed to demonstrate compliance with Crim.R. 33(B). The only ""newly discovered"" evidence cited by appellant in his combined motion for reconsideration and second motion for leave to file a motion for new trial was the Caldwell affidavit. Appellant presented nothing to excuse his untimeliness that this court had not already considered in Armengau I.
