¶ 1 Appellant, Austin Gregory Myers, appeals a decision of the Warren County Court of Common Pleas denying his motion for leave to conduct discovery and petition for postconviction relief.
I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

¶ 2 On January 27, 2014, Myers and codefendant, Timothy Mosley, began to plot burglarizing the home of a known drug dealer or the home of Justin Back, Myers’ childhood friend. Mark Cates, Back's stepfather, purportedly had a safe containing a firearm and money. Ultimately, Myers and Mosley chose to burglarize the Cates' home. The two men drove to the Cates' home. Upon knocking, they were surprised when Back answered the door. The two men briefly visited with Back and then left. Upon leaving the Cates' home, Myers suggested they return to the home, kill Back, and steal the contents of the safe. Myers and Mosley began to plan Back's murder.

¶ 3 They initially planned to kill Back by injecting him with cold medicine. In furtherance of their plan, they attempted to purchase cold medicine and a bottle of poisonous ""bug wash""; however, Myers' credit card was declined. Later that day, Myers and Mosley returned to the Cates' home and watched a movie with Back. When Cates came home from work, he joined them in watching the movie for a short time until he and Back had to leave for an appointment with a Navy recruiter. Myers and Mosley then left the house.

¶ 4 Myers and Mosley continued to discuss how to murder Back and burglarize the Cates' home. As they discussed their plans, Mosley wrote down their ideas in a small notebook. The two men hatched a scheme to strangle Back with a wire, take the safe, and make it look as though Back had stolen the safe and run away from home. The two men further planned to dump Back's body in a remote wooded area. Myers and Mosley purchased galvanized steel cable and two metal rope cleats to fashion a garrote. The garrote was put together by their friend Logan Zennie.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It provides a detailed account of the events leading up to and following the murder of Back by Myers and Mosley, including the charges they faced and the plea agreement Mosley reached. There is no mention of any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 5 The next morning, January 28, 2014, Myers and Mosley bought ammonia, septic-tank cleaner, and rubber gloves. They believed the septic enzymes would help to
decompose the body in cold weather. Around 1:00 p.m., the two men went to the Cates' home. Mosley was carrying the garrote as well as a five- or six-inch pocketknife. The plan was for Myers to distract Back while Mosley came up behind him. Myers would hold Back down while Mosley would choke him to death with the garrote. After the two men arrived at the Cates' home, Back offered them a drink which Myers accepted. As Back was reaching into the refrigerator, Mosley came up behind him and tried to pull the garrote around his throat. However, the garrote only looped around Back's chin. Mosley panicked and as Myers restrained Back, Mosley repeatedly stabbed him with his knife. As Back begged for his life, Myers simply told him it would be over soon.

After the murder, Myers and Mosley wrapped Back's body in a blanket, cleaned up the crime scene, and found the safe. Myers also found a handgun belonging to Cates, which he loaded. The two men shoved Back's body into the trunk of Mosley's car and left the house with the safe and various other stolen items. They stopped at Mosley's home where they cleaned up and changed clothes. They eventually dumped Back's body behind a log in a field in Preble County. Myers poured ammonia and septic enzymes onto Back's body. Myers then shot the body twice with the stolen handgun before it jammed. Myers and Mosley were later apprehended; Back's body was discovered on January 29, 2014. An autopsy determined that Back had died of multiple stab wounds. At the time of the murder, Myers and Mosley were both 19 years old.

Myers was indicted in February 2014 on one count of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design and one count of aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B). Both counts were accompanied by three death-penalty specifications. Myers was further indicted for aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, grand theft of a firearm, and abuse of a corpse, all with an accompanying firearm specification, and kidnapping, tampering with evidence, and safecracking. Mosley was indicted on similar charges.
However, a week before Myers' jury trial, Mosley reached a plea agreement in which he agreed to testify against Myers. Mosley pled guilty to all charges in exchange for the dismissal of the death-penalty specifications; he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.

¶ 8 The guilt phase of Myers' jury trial commenced on September 22, 2014. On October 2, 2014, the jury found Myers guilty on all counts and specifications. The two aggravated-murder counts were merged for purposes of sentencing; the state elected to proceed on the prior-calculation-and-design aggravated murder count with the aggravated-robbery specification.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignments of error are related to the trial court's denial of Myers' PCR petition and discovery motions, and the allegations are against the trial court, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 9 The penalty phase of the jury trial was held on October 6, 2014. Myers presented the testimony of his parents and a sibling and made an unsworn statement by way of mitigation. Myers had no prior criminal history or delinquency adjudications. The jury recommended a death sentence. On October 16, 2014, the trial court sentenced Myers to death and imposed prison sentences on the noncapital counts. Myers' conviction and death sentence were subsequently upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court. State v. Myers, 154 Ohio St.3d 405, 2018-Ohio-1903.

¶ 10 On November 10, 2016, while his appeal was pending before the supreme court, Myers filed a petition for postconviction relief (""PCR petition""), raising 60 grounds for relief. The PCR petition challenged the constitutionality of the death penalty and the Ohio statutes governing its imposition, argued that Myers was denied the effective assistance of counsel during both the guilt and penalty phases of the trial, and alleged violation of Myers' due process rights. On November 18, 2016, Myers moved for leave to conduct discovery in support of his PCR petition. In 2017, the state filed an answer to the PCR petition, then moved for summary judgment. In January 2018, the trial court issued a scheduling order which provided that Myers could file a supplemental motion for discovery by March 1, 2018,
and that the state's summary judgment motion would be held in abeyance pending resolution of Myers' discovery motion.

¶ 11 On March 1, 2018, Myers filed a supplemental motion for discovery, arguing he was entitled to conduct discovery in support of his PCR petition pursuant to newly-amended R.C. 2953.21, which became effective on April 6, 2017. The amended statute makes substantial changes regarding PCR petitions in death-penalty cases, and in particular, allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery in aid of their PCR petition if good cause is shown. State v. Ketterer, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2016-08-166, 2017-Ohio-4117, ¶ 46.

¶ 12 On July 3, 2018, the trial court denied Myers' discovery motions. The trial court found that amended R.C. 2953.21 was not applicable in the case at bar because the statute did not explicitly state it was retroactive. Alternatively, the trial court found that even if the statutory amendment was applied retroactively, Myers was not entitled to discovery as he had not demonstrated ""good cause.""

¶ 13 On November 26, 2018, Myers filed a memorandum opposing the state's motion for summary judgment; the memorandum included 12 additional documents consisting of affidavits, transcripts, and documentary evidence. Myers' memorandum and supplemental appendix triggered additional pleadings from the parties. Ultimately, the trial court never ruled upon the state's summary judgment motion. Instead, on June 27, 2019, the trial court denied Myers' PCR petition without a hearing. The trial court found that Myers' claims were either barred by res judicata or failed to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, and therefore, ""no evidentiary hearing [was] required.""

¶ 14 Myers now appeals the trial court's denial of his PCR petition and discovery motions, raising 11 assignments of error.
II. ANALYSIS


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text above is describing the standards of review for postconviction relief petitions and does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
A. Standards of Review for Postconviction Relief Petitions

{¶ 15} A postconviction proceeding is a collateral civil attack on a criminal judgment, not an appeal of a criminal conviction. State v. Dillingham, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2012-02-037 and CA2012-02-042, 2012-Ohio-5841, ¶ 8. To prevail on a PCR petition, the petitioner must establish a violation of his constitutional rights that renders the judgment of conviction void or voidable. R.C. 2953.21. A PCR petition does not provide a petitioner a second opportunity to litigate his or her conviction, nor is the petitioner automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing. State v. Rose, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-03-050, 2012-Ohio-5957, ¶ 16. A trial court properly denies a PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing if the supporting affidavits, the documentary evidence, the files, and the records of the case do not demonstrate that the petitioner set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief. State v. Blankenburg, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-04-088, 2012-Ohio-6175, ¶ 9; R.C. 2953.21.

{¶ 16} ""It is well established that a trial court may dismiss a postconviction relief petition on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata."" State v. Davis, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-12-258, 2013-Ohio-3878, ¶ 30. Under res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment or conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment. State v. Wagers, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2011-08-007, 2012-Ohio-2258, ¶ 10, citing State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 1996-Ohio-337, syllabus.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error related to the summary dismissal of Myers' PCR petition, but it does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the dismissal of the petition by the trial court, not any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 17} The presentation of competent, relevant, and material evidence outside the record may defeat the application of res judicata. State v. Lawson, 103 Ohio App.3d 307,
315 (12th Dist.1995). The evidence submitted with the petition cannot be merely cumulative of or alternative to evidence presented at trial. *State v. Jackson*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104132, 2017-Ohio-2651, ¶ 16. To overcome the res judicata bar, evidence outside the record must demonstrate that the petitioner could not have appealed the constitutional claim based upon information in the original record. *State v. Piesciuk*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-01-011, 2013-Ohio-3879, ¶ 18. If evidence outside the record is ""'marginally significant and does not advance the petitioner's claim beyond a mere hypothesis and a desire for further discovery,' res judicata still applies to the claim."" *State v. Cowans*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA98-10-090, 1999 Ohio App. LEXIS 4157, *8-9 (Sept. 7, 1999).

{¶ 18} ""In reviewing an appeal of postconviction relief proceedings, this court applies an abuse of discretion standard."" *State v. Snead*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2014-01-014, 2014-Ohio-2895, ¶ 16. ""The term 'abuse of discretion' connotes more than an error of law or of judgment; it implies that the court's attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable."" *State v. Thornton*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-09-063, 2013-Ohio-2394, ¶ 34; *State v. Hancock*, 108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, ¶ 130. The trial court does not abuse its discretion in dismissing a PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing if (1) the petitioner fails to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, or (2) the operation of res judicata prohibits the claims made in the petition. *State v. Maxwell*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107758, 2020-Ohio-3027, ¶ 25.

{¶ 19} With these principles and standards in mind, we now address Myers' assignments of error together and out of order where appropriate.

**B. Summary Dismissal of Myers' PCR Petition**

{¶ 20} Assignment of Error No. 1:


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The error is not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor. The allegation is against the trial court for failing to rule upon the state's summary judgment motion and for summarily dismissing the PCR petition instead.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 21} THE TRIAL COURT DENIED MYERS' RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS, ACCESS TO THE OHIO COURTS, AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, AND
VIOLATED R.C. § 2953.21, WHEN IT TREATED THE STATE'S POST-ANSWER ""MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT"" AS A MOTION SEEKING SUMMARILY DISMISSAL (sic) UNDER R.C. § 2953.21(C) [NOW (D)], AND FAILED TO APPLY THE REQUISITE SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARDS IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING EVERY CLAIM SET FORTH IN MYERS' PCR PETITION.

¶ 22 This assignment of error challenges the trial court's failure to rule upon the state's summary judgment motion and the court's election instead to grant a summary dismissal of Myers' PCR petition. Specifically, Myers argues that the trial court erred in granting a summary dismissal of his PCR petition where there was a pending, fully briefed motion for summary judgment. Myers asserts that because the state filed an answer to the PCR petition and a motion for summary judgment and failed to move for dismissal of the petition under R.C. 2953.21(D), the trial court was required to apply the standard set forth in R.C. 2953.21(E) and was precluded from summarily dismissing the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D).¹

¶ 23 R.C. 2953.21 provides three methods for adjudicating a PCR petition: (1) ""summary dismissal"" under R.C. 2953.21(D) and State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 1999-Ohio-102, paragraph two of the syllabus; (2) ""summary judgment"" under R.C. 2953.21(E); and (3) an ""evidentiary hearing"" under R.C. 2953.21(F). State v. Blankenburg, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-11-197, 2014-Ohio-4621, ¶ 23.

¶ 24 Under R.C. 2953.21(E), either party may move for summary judgment on the issues raised. In ruling on a summary judgment motion in proceedings involving a PCR petition, the trial court must use the same standards set forth in Civ.R. 56(C), i.e., a party is

Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is related to the application of R.C. 2953.21 and the denial of a defendant's petition for postconviction relief by the trial court.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¹. As stated earlier, R.C. 2953.21 was amended, effective April 6, 2017, and some of its provisions were renumbered. As pertinent here, former R.C. 2953.21(C), (D), and (E) were renumbered 2953.21(D), (E), and (F). We note that for purposes of this assignment of error, the language of the applicable renumbered statutory provisions is identical to the language of their pre-amendment counterparts. We therefore elect to apply the current version of R.C. 2953.21.
entitled to summary judgment only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. *State v. Francis*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-05-078, 2014-Ohio-443, ¶ 11. Summary judgment in postconviction proceedings is appropriate only if the right to summary judgment appears on the face of the record. R.C. 2953.21(E); *Id.*

¶ 25 Under R.C. 2953.21(D), ""a trial court properly denies a defendant's petition for postconviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing where the petition, the supporting affidavits, the documentary evidence, the files, and the records do not demonstrate that petitioner set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief."" *Calhoun*, 86 Ohio St.3d 279 at paragraph two of the syllabus; *Francis* at ¶ 12.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it discusses the trial court's duty to independently review a postconviction relief (PCR) petition under Ohio law, regardless of the state's (prosecutor's) response. The error is not directed at the prosecutor but rather at the trial court's failure to perform its duty under R.C. 2953.21(D).","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 26 We find that the trial court did not err in granting a summary dismissal of Myers' PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D) notwithstanding the state's motion for summary judgment and its failure to move for dismissal of the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D). We have held that R.C. 2953.21(D) ""explicitly requires the trial court to look beyond the petition and examine the record in order to determine whether there are substantive grounds for relief. The trial court must independently review the record and address the substance of a petitioner's claims regardless of whether the state responds to his petition for postconviction relief."" *State v. Wallen*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA97-02-017, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 3647, *4 (Aug. 11, 1997). See also *State v. Hartman*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27162, 2017-Ohio-7933 (a trial court has an independent duty to analyze a PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21[D]); *State v. McCabe*, 4th Dist. Washington No. 97CA32, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 4487 (Sept. 14, 1998) (it is well settled that, regardless of whether or not the state responds to a petition for postconviction relief, R.C. 2953.21[D] requires the trial court
to sua sponte analyze the petition). Thus, the trial court was required to independently determine whether there were substantive grounds for relief and the pendency of the state's motion for summary judgment did not preclude the trial court from summarily dismissing the PCR petition under R.C. 2953.21(D). See State v. McKelton, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-02-028, 2015-Ohio-4228; State v. Noling, 11th Dist. Portage No. 98-P-0049, 2003-Ohio-5008.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignments of error are directed against the trial court's actions, specifically the denial of discovery motions and the interpretation of the discovery amendments to R.C. 2953.21.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 27 In his reply brief Myers argues for the first time that the trial court's summary dismissal of the PCR petition without prior notice to the parties violated the notice requirement of procedural due process. However, it is well established that an appellant may not raise new issues or assignments of error in a reply brief. State v. Renfro, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-07-142, 2012-Ohio-2848, ¶ 28, citing App.R. 16; State ex rel. Colvin v. Brunner, 120 Ohio St.3d 110, 2008-Ohio-5041. A reply brief simply provides the appellant with an opportunity to respond to the arguments raised in the appellee's brief. State v. Quaterman, 140 Ohio St.3d 464, 2014-Ohio-4034, ¶ 18. Myers' argument is not appropriately before the court and will not be considered. Furthermore, as the discussion above makes clear, parties in postconviction proceedings are on notice of a trial court's sua sponte authority to grant a summary dismissal of a PCR petition. R.C. 2953.21; Hartman, 2017-Ohio-7933; McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228; McCabe, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 4487.

¶ 28 Myers' first assignment of error is overruled.

C. Discovery Motions

¶ 29 Assignment of Error No. 2:

¶ 30 THE TRIAL COURT DENIED MYERS' RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS, ACCESS TO THE OHIO COURTS, AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, AND VIOLATED R.C. § 2953.21(A)(1) AND ITS DISCOVERY AMENDMENTS, WHEN THE COURT HELD THAT THE DISCOVERY AMENDMENTS WERE NON-RETROACTIVE
AND THUS INAPPLICABLE TO MYERS' CASE, AND THEN ENFORCED AN UNREASONABLE AND IMPROPERLY-RESTRICTIVE DEFINITION OF ""GOOD CAUSE"" TO DENY DISCOVERY TO MYERS ON EVERY ONE OF HIS CLAIMS.

{¶ 31} Assignment of Error No. 3:

{¶ 32} EVEN UNDER THE PRIOR VERSION OF THE PCR STATUTE, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED MYERS' PCR PETITION WITHOUT AFFORDING HIM ANY OPPORTUNITY TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY.

{¶ 33} These assignments of error challenge the trial court's denial of Myers' discovery motions. As stated above, the trial court found that amended R.C. 2953.21 was not applicable in the case at bar because the statute did not explicitly state it was retroactive. Alternatively, the trial court found that even if the statutory amendment was applied retroactively, Myers was not entitled to discovery as he had not demonstrated ""good cause."" The statute was amended after Myers filed his PCR petition and first motion for discovery but before he filed his supplemental motion for discovery.

371-Myers,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It is discussing the changes to the law regarding postconviction relief (PCR) petitions in death-penalty cases, specifically the amendments to R.C. 2953.21 that allow capital petitioners to obtain discovery if good cause is shown. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor, the trial court, or the defense attorney.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 34} Before R.C. 2953.21 was amended on April 6, 2017, it was well established that the statutory scheme governing postconviction relief did not entitle a petitioner to conduct discovery. State ex rel. Love v. Cuyahoga Cty. Prosecutor's Office, 87 Ohio St.3d 158, 159, 1999-Ohio-314; Ketterer, 2017-Ohio-4117 at ¶ 45. Nevertheless, discovery could be proper where a petitioner set forth operative facts outside the record that revealed a constitutional error in his or her case. Id. The granting or overruling of discovery motions rested within the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Lawson, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2011-07-056, 2012-Ohio-548, ¶ 17.

{¶ 35} Amended R.C. 2953.21 makes substantial changes regarding PCR petitions in death-penalty cases, and in particular, allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery in aid of their PCR petition if good cause is shown. Specifically, R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) now
provides that

At any time in conjunction with the filing of a petition for postconviction relief under division (A) of this section by a person who has been sentenced to death, or with the litigation of a petition so filed, the court, for good cause shown, may authorize the petitioner in seeking the postconviction relief and the prosecuting attorney of the county served by the court in defending the proceeding, to take depositions and to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in accordance with divisions (A)(1)(d), (A)(1)(e), and (C) of this section, and to any other form of discovery as in a civil action that the court in its discretion permits. The court may limit the extent of discovery under this division. In addition to discovery that is relevant to the claim and was available under Criminal Rule 16 through conclusion of the original criminal trial, the court, for good cause shown, may authorize the petitioner or prosecuting attorney to take depositions and issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum in either of the following circumstances:

(i) For any witness who testified at trial or who was disclosed by the state prior to trial, except as otherwise provided in this division, the petitioner or prosecuting attorney shows clear and convincing evidence that the witness is material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to substantiate or refute the petitioner's claim that there is a reasonable probability of an altered verdict. This division does not apply if the witness was unavailable for trial or would not voluntarily be interviewed by the defendant or prosecuting attorney.

(ii) For any witness with respect to whom division (A)(1)(d)(i) of this section does not apply, the petitioner or prosecuting attorney shows good cause that the witness is material and that a deposition of the witness or the issuing of a subpoena or subpoena duces tecum is of assistance in order to substantiate or refute the petitioner's claim that there is a reasonable probability of an altered verdict.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error related to the trial court's interpretation of a statute, specifically whether amended R.C. 2953.21 applies retroactively. The error is not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 36 We first address whether the trial court erred in finding that amended R.C. 2953.21 does not apply to the case at bar because it is not retroactive. This is a strict legal issue which we review de novo. State v. Consilio, 114 Ohio St.3d 295, 2007-Ohio-4163, ¶ 8; State v. Gloff, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2019-06-047, 2020-Ohio-3143, ¶ 17.

¶ 37 It is well settled that a statute is presumed to apply prospectively unless
expressly declared to be retroactive. R.C. 1.48. Additionally, Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, prohibits the General Assembly from passing retroactive laws. Applying these two provisions, the Supreme Court of Ohio has established a two-part test to determine whether a statute may be applied retroactively. *Consilio*.

{¶ 38} Under this test, a reviewing court must first determine as a threshold matter whether the statute is expressly made retroactive. *Consilio*, 2007-Ohio-4163 at ¶ 10. ""The General Assembly's failure to clearly enunciate retroactivity ends the analysis and the relevant statute may be applied only prospectively."" *Id.* If, however, the General Assembly expressly indicated its intention that the statute apply retroactively, the reviewing court must then move to the second step of the analysis and ""determine whether the statute is remedial, in which case retroactive application is permitted, or substantive, in which case retroactive application is forbidden."" *State v. White*, 132 Ohio St.3d 344, 2012-Ohio-2583, ¶ 27.

{¶ 39} As the trial court properly found, R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) as amended does not explicitly state it is to be applied retroactively. ""A statute must clearly proclaim its own retroactivity to overcome the presumption of prospective application. Retroactivity is not to be inferred."" *Consilio* at ¶ 15. ""If the retroactivity of a statute is not expressly stated in plain terms, the presumption in favor of prospective application controls. Moreover, the General Assembly is presumed to know that it must include expressly retroactive language to create that effect, and it has done so in the past."" *Id.* Because amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) does not expressly mention retroactivity, we find that the statute applies prospectively and we need not determine whether the statute is remedial or substantive under the second prong of the test.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is not describing an assignment of error. It is discussing the application of a statute to a pending PCR petition and the definition of ""good cause"" for discovery. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 40} We further find that by its plain terms the statute applies prospectively to pending PCR petitions in that it allows capital petitioners to obtain discovery, for good cause
shown, ""at any time in conjunction with the filing of a [PCR petition], or with the litigation of a petition so filed[.]"" (Emphasis added.) In the case at bar, amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d) was not yet in effect when Myers filed his PCR petition. However, the PCR petition was still being litigated on April 6, 2017, when the amended statute became effective. Amended R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(d), therefore, applies to Myers' PCR petition. See Gloff, 2020-Ohio-3143.

¶ 41 The statute requires that the petitioner demonstrate ""good cause"" as a prerequisite for a trial court to allow discovery. As stated above, the trial court alternatively found that Myers failed to show ""good cause.""

¶ 42 ""Good cause"" is not defined by the statute. Consequently, the trial court adopted the definition applied in federal habeas corpus proceedings, to wit, good cause exists ""where specific allegations before the court show reason to believe that the petitioner may, if the facts are fully developed, be able to demonstrate that he is * * * entitled to relief, it is the duty of the courts to provide the necessary facilities and procedures for an adequate inquiry."" Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 908-909, 117 S.Ct. 1793 (1997). ""Conversely, where a petitioner would not be entitled to relief on a particular claim, regardless of what facts he developed, he cannot show good cause for discovery on that claim."" Murphy v. Bradshaw, S.D.Ohio No. C-1-03-053, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15978, *2 (Sept. 13, 2003).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is related to the trial court's denial of Myers' discovery motions, specifically concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 43 Before determining whether a petitioner is entitled to discovery under ""good cause,"" the court must first identify the essential elements of the claim on which discovery is sought. Bracy at 904. The burden of demonstrating the materiality of the information requested is on the moving party. Stanford v. Parker, 266 F.3d 442, 460 (6th Cir.2001). Discovery may be allowed where the petitioner's claims are ""neither patently frivolous nor palpably incredible"" and where ""the discovery he requests is specific, limited, and reasonably calculated to lead to evidence in support of his claim[.]"" Hill v. Mitchell, S.D.Ohio
No. 1:98-cv-452, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71975, *31-32 (Sept. 27, 2007). A petitioner is not entitled to go on a fishing expedition based on conclusory allegations. *Id.* at *5; *Williams v. Bagley*, 380 F.3d 932, 974 (6th Cir.2004). ""Even in a death penalty case, 'bald assertions and conclusory allegations do not provide sufficient ground to warrant requiring the state to respond to discovery or to require an evidentiary hearing.'"" *Stanford* at 460. Rather, the petitioner must set forth specific allegations of fact. *Williams* at 974.

¶ 44 Myers argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery because he demonstrated ""good cause"" or, alternatively, set forth operative facts outside the record that revealed constitutional errors. Myers further argues that the trial court misapplied the *Bracy* good cause standard by essentially requiring him to prove his claims as a prerequisite to discovery.

¶ 45 Myers' discovery motions were broad overall, seeking a wide range of information, records, and depositions of individuals, some of whom were identified only by category. The trial court broke down Myers' discovery requests into nine general categories of inquiry: (1) records in the custody of the Warren County Children's Services, the Warren County Department of Job and Family Services, and the Warren County Juvenile Court regarding Myers' family, (2) Myers' records from the Warren County Jail, (3) grand jury proceedings, (4) Mosley's institutional records, (5) records of the prosecutor's office and several law enforcement agencies relating to their investigation of Back's death and the arrest of Myers and Mosley, (6) depositions of law enforcement officers, (7) depositions of the jurors, (8) depositions of the attorneys on the prosecution team, and (9) depositions of the defense team.

¶ 46 Myers' first motion for discovery did not identify how his discovery requests related to his postconviction claims. By contrast, the supplemental motion for discovery argued that Myers was entitled to conduct discovery on (1) his claims of ineffective
assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial, (2) his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial, and (3) his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for an offender who was still a teenager at the time of the offense. In his brief, Myers argues the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery on the foregoing claims. We will address the trial court's denial of Myers' discovery motions concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial in conjunction with Myers' fifth assignment of error.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text above does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The assignment of error is related to the trial court's denial of discovery motions and the defense attorney's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 47 Myers first argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery regarding his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for a 19-year-old offender at the time of the offense. In support of these constitutional challenges, Myers sought discovery of (1) the Warren County's training and instructional materials for judges, prosecutors, and sheriff deputies concerning behavioral characteristics and brain development of juveniles, adolescents, and late-adolescents (18-21 years old) offenders, and (2) Warren County's data concerning the prosecution of such juvenile, adolescent, and late-adolescent offenders for the previous seven years.

¶ 48 We find that Myers' requested discovery falls more into the category of a fishing expedition. Furthermore, as we discuss in the fourth assignment of error, Myers' claims are barred by res judicata and fail to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, given the election of the United States Supreme Court and Ohio Supreme Court not to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of 18 at the time of the crime. ""[W]here a petitioner would not be entitled to relief on a particular claim, regardless of what facts he developed, he cannot show good cause for discovery on that claim."" Murphy, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15978 at *2. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying Myers' motions for discovery regarding his claims challenging the constitutionality and propriety of the death sentence for a 19-year-old
offender at the time of the offense.

¶ 49 Myers next argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial. Counsel's alleged ineffective assistance included the failure to (1) pursue a youth-based defense theory, (2) hire a fact investigator, (3) fully cross-examine Mosley, (4) cross-examine a sergeant and a detective regarding their failure to follow police procedure manuals, (5) present the testimony of a crime scene expert, (6) present the testimony of a police procedure expert to challenge Miranda issues, (7) present the testimony of an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his Miranda rights, (8) achieve a change of venue, and (9) challenge the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook. As we discuss in the sixth assignment of error, Myers' claims regarding the testimony of a police procedure expert to challenge Miranda issues, change of venue, and the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook are barred by res judicata as they could have been raised on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. As we further discuss in the sixth assignment of error, Myers' other claims fail to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief. Murphy at *2. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying Myers' motions for discovery concerning his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial.

¶ 50 To that extent, Myers' second and third assignments of error are overruled.

¶ 51 Assignment of Error No. 4:


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is directed at the trial court for summarily dismissing certain grounds of Myers' PCR petition without allowing discovery or an evidentiary hearing, and for failing to grant relief.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 52 THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT FOUND PROCEDURALLY BARRED MYERS' CLAIMS CHALLENGING THE CONSTITUTIONALITY, PROPRIETY, AND/OR PROPORTIONALITY OF A DEATH SENTENCE FOR AN OFFENDER, LIKE MYERS, WHO WAS STILL A TEENAGER AT THE TIME OF HIS OFFENSE (GROUNDS
5, 8, 9, 46, 47, 48), AND IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING SUCH CLAIMS UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.

¶ 53 Myers argues that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 5, 8, 9, 46, 47, and 48 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged the constitutionality, propriety, and/or proportionality of a death sentence for an offender, like Myers, who was a teenager at the time of the offense. In this assignment of error, Myers details the scientific research on adolescent brain development, references various cases acknowledging that young adults under the age of 21 share many of the characteristics of late-age adolescents, and argues that the imposition of a death sentence upon a teenage offender, such as him, is an unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. Myers asserts that a cut-off of age 18 for imposing a death penalty is arbitrary. Myers further asserts his death sentence is unconstitutionally disproportionate to the life sentence Mosley received.

¶ 54 Ground 5 argues that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), Ohio's felony-murder statute, is unconstitutional because it fails to adequately account for youth in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Ground 8 argues that the death sentence was disproportionate compared to Mosley and others convicted of similar crimes in violation of Myers' Eighth Amendment rights. Ground 9 argues that Myers' death sentence was void because the trial court failed to consider the R.C. 2929.11 purposes of felony sentencing when determining the appropriateness of the death sentence on the capital specifications. Ground 46 argues that Myers' Eighth Amendment rights were violated because the trial court failed to accord his youth the mitigating value it deserved. Ground 47 argues that the death penalty was a disproportionate punishment for Myers given his youth and other individual characteristics. Ground 48 argues that the death penalty is per se unconstitutional for a youthful offender convicted of committing a crime prior to turning 21 years old.
The trial court dismissed Grounds 8 and 9, finding that both arguments were raised in Myers' direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, were addressed by the supreme court, and were therefore barred by res judicata. The trial court further dismissed Grounds 5 and 46 through 48 as follows:

The Ohio Supreme Court has already addressed whether the sentence of death for Myers based on his age is a violation of the Eighth Amendment and found that it is not a violation of his constitutional rights. Therefore, this argument is barred by res judicata.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is related to the trial court's dismissal of certain grounds and the Supreme Court's rejection of Myers' claims regarding the death penalty and brain science developments.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Further, the Supreme Court of the United States has addressed the age of youthful offenders in a number of contexts and has not chosen to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of eighteen at the time of the crime. [Myers] has submitted evidence related to the development in brain science, however, the Ohio Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court have considered these new developments and similar arguments to the ones set forth by [Myers]. The United States Supreme Court acknowledged that individuals over eighteen may still exhibit signs of a juvenile but also found that since eighteen is the line society draws for many purposes between childhood and adulthood, that was the age that the line for death penalty ought to rest. *Roper v. Simmons*, 543 U.S. 551, 574, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 1197-98 (2005).

We find that the trial court properly dismissed Grounds 5, 8, 9, and 46 through 48. On direct appeal to the supreme court, Myers argued that the death sentence violated the Eighth Amendment proscription of cruel and unusual punishment, given recent decisions of the United States Supreme Court and a growing body of new developments in brain science indicating that age 18 is not the proper cut-off point for the death penalty. Myers further argued that his death sentence was comparatively disproportionate to the life sentence Mosley received and that he should not have been sentenced to death because he was a 19-year-old immature adolescent with mental and youth-related behavioral issues when he committed his crimes. The supreme court addressed and rejected these claims. *Myers*, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 173-176. They are therefore barred by res judicata.
Myers’ other claims were properly dismissed by the trial court as failing to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, given the election of the United States Supreme Court and Ohio Supreme Court not to extend the ban on the death penalty to individuals who are over the age of 18 at the time of the crime. Myers notes that while his direct appeal made a brief reference to the newer brain science, it did not make the constitutional claim for a *Roper*-extension that his PRC petition makes. See *Myers* at ¶ 176 (""Although Myers argues that new developments in brain science indicate that age 18 is not the 'proper cut off point for the death penalty,' he does not propose that the categorical exclusion for those under age 18 be extended to 19-year-olds""). However, such constitutional argument was recently addressed and rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court in *State v. Graham*, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-6700.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above describes an assignment of error by Myers, not an allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is directed at the trial court's decision to summarily dismiss certain grounds of Myers' PCR petition challenging the constitutionality of Ohio's death penalty statute and systems.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Graham, who turned 19 years old the month before he committed his crimes and who was sentenced to death, argued that imposing a death sentence on a capital defendant who was under the age of 21 at the time of the crime violated the Eighth Amendment. Extrapolating from the United States Supreme Court’s *Roper* decision, Graham argued that it was possible the Supreme Court could extend *Roper* to find that a defendant who turned 19 the month before committing the offense is constitutionally barred from receiving a death sentence. The Ohio Supreme Court squarely rejected the argument: ""[B]ecause the United States Supreme Court has drawn the line at 18 for Eighth Amendment purposes, state courts are not free to invoke the Eighth Amendment as authority for drawing it at a higher age. * * * *Roper* is controlling, and we must follow it."" *Graham* at ¶ 182, citing *In re Phillips*, 6th Cir. No. 17-3729, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 17766 (July 20, 2017) (no authority exists at the present time to support the argument that a defendant who was 19 years old at the time of the offense is ineligible to receive a death sentence).
Myers' fourth assignment of error is overruled.

Assignment of Error No. 9:

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT FOUND PROCEDURALLY BARRED MYERS' CLAIMS CHALLENGING IN MULTIPLE RESPECTS THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF OHIO'S DEATH PENALTY STATUTE AND SYSTEMS (GROUNDS 2-4, 7, 57), AND IN SUMMARILY DISMISSING SUCH CLAIMS UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.

Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 2, 3, 4, 7, and 57 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged the constitutionality of Ohio's death-penalty scheme and the statutes governing it. Specifically, Myers argues that Ohio's death-penalty scheme (1) is per se unconstitutional due to several fundamental constitutional defects, (2) is unconstitutional because it allows racial disparities in capital indictment practices and the actual infliction of the death penalty, (3) is incompatible with modern standards of decency, and (4) violates the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial under Hurst v. Florida, 577 U.S. 92, 136 S.Ct. 616 (2016). Myers further argues that R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), Ohio's felony-murder statute, is unconstitutional as a capital specification because it allows for invidious racial discrimination in its application and fails to provide adequate safeguards to ensure only the most culpable offenders are sentenced to death.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error, but it is not alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is related to the trial court's denial of relief on Myers' first ground for relief, which is about the adequacy of Ohio's postconviction relief procedures.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Myers' claims are barred by res judicata as they were either raised or could have been raised in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 201-202. This includes his Sixth Amendment argument under Hurst as his merit brief was filed in the supreme court four months after Hurst was decided. Myers acknowledges that the supreme court ""has thus far been unwilling to conclude that Ohio's death penalty
statute is unconstitutional under the U.S. and/or Ohio constitutions in the respect alleged * * in these Grounds."" See, e.g., Myers; State v. Mason, 153 Ohio St.3d 476, 2018-Ohio-1462; State v. Mammone, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942. In December 2020, the supreme court once again held that Ohio's death-penalty scheme was not unconstitutional under Hurst. Graham, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 185-186.

¶ 64 Myers' ninth assignment of error is overruled.

¶ 65 Assignment of Error No. 11:

¶ 66 THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION, AND COMMITTED AN ERROR OF LAW, WHEN IT DENIED MYERS RELIEF ON HIS FIRST GROUND FOR RELIEF, BECAUSE OHIO'S POSTCONVICTION PROCEDURES FAIL TO PROVIDE DEATH-SENTENCED PETITIONERS WITH AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS AND THEY VIOLATE THE FEDERAL AND STATE CONSTITUTIONS.

¶ 67 Myers argues that Ohio's statutory scheme for postconviction relief is unconstitutional because it does not provide an adequate corrective process due to its ""rigid"" reliance on principles of res judicata and a petitioner's inability to conduct discovery until convincing a trial court that a hearing is warranted. This court has already determined that ""the statutory procedure for postconviction relief constitutes an adequate corrective process."" State v. Lindsey, 12th Dist. Brown No. CA2002-02-002, 2003-Ohio-811, ¶ 13; State v. Lawson, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2013-12-093, 2014-Ohio-3554, ¶ 43. Other Ohio appellate courts have likewise rejected the claim that Ohio's postconviction relief statute does not afford an adequate corrective process. See, e.g. State v. Conway, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-504, 2019-Ohio-2260. Furthermore, the propriety of resolving a postconviction petitioner's arguments on the basis of res judicata is well settled. E.g., Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93. We see no reason to deviate from our prior precedent. Lawson.

¶ 68 Myers' eleventh assignment of error is overruled.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"Yes, the text is describing an assignment of error alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Specifically, the error is that the prosecutor's late and questionable disclosure of Mosley's notebook may have been the result of prosecutorial misconduct.","Context information is below.

{¶ 70} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT (GROUNDS 50, 58), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.

{¶ 71} Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily denying Grounds 50 and 58 of his PCR petition which allege prosecutorial misconduct.

{¶ 72} For a conviction to be reversed on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must prove the prosecutor's comments were improper and that they prejudicially affected the defendant's substantial rights. State v. Elmore, 111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, ¶ 62; McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228 at ¶ 13. However, ""[t]he focus of an inquiry into allegations of prosecutorial misconduct is upon the fairness of the trial, not upon culpability of the prosecutor."" State v. Gray, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-09-176, 2012-Ohio-4769, ¶ 56. Therefore, ""[p]rosecutorial misconduct is not grounds for error unless the defendant has been denied a fair trial."" State v. Olvera-Guillen, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2007-05-118, 2008-Ohio-5416, ¶ 27, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239 (1984).

Nos. CA2017-06-078 and CA2019-03-048, 2020-Ohio-855, ¶ 17. Myers did not raise this claim of prosecutorial misconduct in his PCR petition and has therefore forfeited it. State v. Zeune, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-147, 2013-Ohio-4156, ¶ 30; State v. Barb, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94054, 2010-Ohio-5239, ¶ 25; State v. McKee, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 96CA006599, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4433, *9 (Oct. 1, 1997) (failure to raise issue in PCR petition results in a waiver of the right to assert the issue on appeal).

¶ 75 Ground 50 alleges that Myers' due process rights were violated when privileged attorney-client discussions were potentially broadcast throughout the courthouse and into the prosecutor's office via the trial court's audio/video recording system. In his brief, Myers asserts the fact that conversations from the defense table could be broadcast in such a manner should cause ""great concern about whether any privileged conversations were 'overheard,' whether any were recorded, whether someone took notes of what they heard, [and] whether such information was utilized by the State in any fashion[.]

¶ 76 Myers does not identify the resulting prejudice. The trial court sua sponte addressed the issue at a pretrial hearing in August 2014, subsequently conducted an evaluation of its audio/video recording system to make sure that conversations taking place at the defense table could not be heard by others, and provided a copy of that evaluation to counsel. In dismissing Ground 50, the trial court found ""NO evidence that any conversation of counsel was ever overheard,"" noted its investigation into the issue, and ""determined that the mute button was sufficient to prevent anyone from overhearing any conversation between counsel and the petitioner."" Furthermore, this issue could have been raised on direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court and is therefore barred by res judicata. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 50.

¶ 77 Ground 58 alleges that the elected prosecutor engaged in misconduct by extensively posting about the case on his county prosecutor Facebook and Twitter accounts
during and after the trial and via statements he made in an interview during a 2016 BBC documentary. Ground 58 further alleges that Myers was prejudiced by the prosecutor's misconduct. The trial court dismissed the ground, finding that Myers ""failed to establish sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief."" In his brief, Myers asserts that the prosecutor's social media postings and interview ""tainted"" his right to a fair trial.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error against the trial court, not the prosecutor. The allegation is that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Myers' claims of trial court errors in multiple respects (Grounds 51-56, 59) without allowing discovery or an evidentiary hearing and in failing to grant relief.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 78 We find that the trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 58. The prosecutor's post-trial social media posts, post-trial media statements, and statements in the 2016 BBC documentary are irrelevant and could not and did not deprive Myers of a fair trial. Regarding the prosecutor's social media postings and statements that occurred before and during trial, Myers does not articulate how any specific post or media statement prejudiced his right to a fair trial. A review of the posts and statements shows that they were restricted to providing the public with information about the criminal proceedings against Myers and communicated the results of various stages of the criminal proceedings against Myers either directly or by sharing links to news headlines. Following the guilty verdict, the prosecutor simply recognized Back's family and the efforts of the investigators and his office.

¶ 79 Furthermore, the trial court repeatedly admonished the jurors not to view or listen to any news reports in any form. We presume the jury followed the trial court's admonitions unless it is demonstrated otherwise. State v. Miller, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2019-11-010, 2021-Ohio-162, ¶ 50. Myers has not introduced any evidence to the contrary. Prejudice to a defendant will not be presumed in the absence of proof of jury exposure to possibly prejudicial news reports, or in this case, the prosecutor's social media posts. See State v. Wright, 3d Dist. Crawford No. 3-92-24, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 6090 (Dec. 30, 1994).
Finally, this issue could have been raised by Myers in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. We note that Myers actually did allege claims of prosecutorial misconduct as part of his direct appeal under his tenth proposition of law. Res judicata applies to any issue that could have been raised on direct appeal, including a claim alleging prosecutorial misconduct. *McKelton*, 2015-Ohio-4228 at ¶ 23, citing *State v. Zych*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA97-02-012, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4731 (Oct. 27, 1997). Myers fails to identify any reason why this claim of prosecutorial misconduct could not have been raised on direct appeal. Myers does not assert he learned about the prosecutor's social media posts after filing his direct appeal. Nor does he allege the posts were not known or available at the time of trial or his direct appeal. *Dillingham*, 2012-Ohio-5841 at ¶ 10.

Myers' seventh assignment of error is overruled.

2. Trial Court Rulings

Assignment of Error No. 8:

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS OF TRIAL COURT ERRORS IN MULTIPLE RESPECTS (GROUNDS 51-56, 59), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed any misconduct. The errors are all directed against the trial court's rulings and decisions.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 51 through 56 and 59 of his PCR petition, all of which challenged several trial court's rulings.

Ground 51 challenges the trial court's failure to grant a continuance of the trial date to allow defense counsel to obtain a mitigation specialist. This issue involves lead defense counsel's request to have his wife appointed as a mitigation specialist, which was initially denied by the trial court. After he was unable to find another mitigation specialist, lead counsel moved the trial court to reconsider its previous ruling. *Alternatively*, counsel
moved the court for a continuance of the trial date. The trial court reconsidered its previous
denial, appointed lead counsel's wife as the mitigation specialist, and denied the alternative
request for continuance. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 51.

{¶ 86} Ground 52 challenges the trial court's failure to grant a continuance of the trial
date to allow defense counsel to investigate Mosley's notebook after it was disclosed to the
defense the day before trial was to commence. Ground 53 challenges the trial court's
admission of the notebook into evidence and its failure to instruct the jury on the break in
the chain of custody. The notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after
the original search warrant was executed. On direct appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court
addressed the state's delayed disclosure of the notebook, the trial court's denial of defense
counsel's motion for a continuance, and the admissibility of the notebook into evidence.
Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 86-93, 112-120. In his direct appeal, defense counsel did not
challenge the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on chain of custody. Because the issues
above could have been or were raised on direct appeal to the supreme court, they are
barred by res judicata. The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 52 and 53.

{¶ 87} Grounds 54 and 55 challenge the trial court's denial of Myers' motion to
suppress his ""involuntary"" statements to Detective Michael Wyatt where he ""did not
understand his Miranda rights and never signed a Miranda waiver."" In support of these
grounds, Myers submitted the reports of Gary Rini, a crime scene/police procedure expert,
and Dr. Drew Barzman, a psychiatrist. Upon reviewing Myers' videotaped police
interrogations, Rini concluded that Myers ""was clearly confused and befuddled during his
questioning"" and was ""therefore apparently unable to appreciate the gravity of his situation,
nor was he aware of the constitutional rights afforded to him."" Upon reviewing Myers' police
interrogations, administering the Miranda Rights Comprehension Instruments test (""MCRI""),
and reviewing comprehensive historical information regarding Myers, Dr. Barzman opined
that ""due to his young age of 19, probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,"" Myers ""was unable to adequately apply his Miranda rights at the time of the interrogations.""

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error related to the trial court's denial of a motion to suppress and other claims, not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 88 On direct appeal, the supreme court overruled Myers' proposition of law relating to the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress and the claims that he never validly waived his right to remain silent, that he was denied his constitutional right to counsel, and that his statements were involuntary. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 61-82. In his brief, Myers asserts that the expert reports of Rini and Dr. Barzman ""were necessary to substantiate the claim"" his statements were not voluntarily made and were obtained in violation of Miranda. With the exception of the MCRI test, the same facts and historical information reviewed by Rini and Dr. Barzman were known and available to Myers at the time of his direct appeal to the supreme court. Myers, therefore, could have appealed his statements to police on the basis of his demeanor during questioning, his age, his ""probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and his lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,"" but did not. ""A report not found in the record does not automatically equate to a valid issue for post-conviction review purposes where, as here, the issue could have been raised on direct appeal."" State v. Drummond, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05 MA 197, 2006-Ohio-7078, ¶ 43. The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 54 and 55.

¶ 89 Ground 56 challenges the trial court's denial of Myers' motion for change of venue based on the ""overwhelming"" pretrial media publicity regarding the case. Although Myers moved the trial court for a change of venue, he did not challenge the trial court's denial of his motion in his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. It is therefore barred by res judicata. See McKelton, 2015-Ohio-4228. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 56.
Ground 59 challenges the trial court's failure to instruct the jury that Mosley's plea deal to a life sentence without parole was a mitigating factor. The record shows that the trial court did instruct the jury that, in addition to the specific statutory mitigation factors, it could consider any additional factors that were not specifically mentioned in favor of a sentence other than death. Defense counsel was allowed to and did argue Mosley's plea deal as a mitigating factor. Furthermore, this claim could have been raised on direct appeal to the supreme court and is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Jennings, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-248, 2018-Ohio-3871; State v. Southers, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA88-03-027, 1988 Ohio App. LEXIS 2720 (June 30, 1988). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 59.

Myers' eighth assignment of error is overruled.

3. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel during the Guilt Phase

Assignment of Error No. 6:


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is directed at the trial court for summarily dismissing the petitioner's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel without allowing discovery or an evidentiary hearing.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS THAT HIS TRIAL COUNSEL RENDERED CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFICIENT PERFORMANCE IN THE TRIAL PHASE OF HIS CAPITAL TRIAL (GROUNDS 6, 10-18), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING, AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF ON THESE MERITORIOUS IAC CLAIMS.

Myers argues the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 6 and 10 through 17 of his PCR petition, all of which allege numerous instances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial.

In order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, it must be shown that an attorney's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance
prejudiced the defense. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). In postconviction proceedings, a petitioner bears the initial burden of submitting evidentiary materials containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and also that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness. *State v. Jackson*, 64 Ohio St.2d 107, 111 (1980). Pursuant to the res judicata doctrine, a PCR petition may be dismissed where a petitioner, represented by new counsel on direct appeal, could have raised the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim on direct appeal without resort to evidence outside the record. *State v. Lentz*, 70 Ohio St.3d 527 (1994), syllabus; *State v. Loza*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA96-10-214, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4574, *9-10 (Oct. 13, 1997). Additionally, mere presentation of evidence outside the record does not transform a claim into one addressable in postconviction. *Drummond*, 2006-Ohio-7078 at ¶ 17. The evidence must show that the petitioner could not have appealed his claim based upon the information in the original record. *Id.*

¶ 96 Ground 6 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a youth-based defense theory during the guilt phase of the trial in anticipation of the penalty phase. Myers asserts that his ""youth, its specific effects on him, and its manifestation in the conduct alleged by the State at trial should have all formed a central, consistent theme presented during both phases of the trial."" Counsel's defense theory during the guilt phase was that Mosley committed the murder, Myers was simply present during the crime, and Mosley subsequently turned on Myers by entering into a plea deal and testifying against him. This was consistent with the penalty phase during which defense counsel argued Myers' sentence should not be more severe than Mosley's sentence.

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is focused on the actions of the defense attorney and the trial court.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 97 The decision regarding which defense theory to pursue at trial is a matter of trial strategy, and trial strategy decisions are not the basis of a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Murphy*, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 524, 2001-Ohio-112; *State v.
Moreover, as the trial court noted when it dismissed Ground 6, the fact that another defense attorney may have or would have employed a different approach does not mean the alternative strategy fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. *State v. Casey*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2017-08-013, 2018-Ohio-2084, ¶ 34. ""[T]here is a strong presumption that counsel has rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment."" *Id.* Defense counsel's guilt-phase strategy will not be second-guessed even though appellate counsel now argue that they would have defended differently. *State v. Mason*, 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 169, 1998-Ohio-370. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 6.

Ground 10 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to hire a fact investigator even though the trial court had approved funds for an investigator. Lead defense counsel's affidavit submitted in support of the PCR petition indicates that counsel ""ultimately did not retain"" an investigator because the case was not a ""who done it."" Ground 11 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to fully cross-examine Mosley. Myers asserts that an investigator would have discovered, inter alia, that Mosley was suffering from rage and depression in the days leading to Back's murder, suffered from severe drug addiction and had violent tendencies, and was not in the habit of taking notes in a notebook. The investigation would have further discovered that Mosley's cellphone records belied his trial testimony. Myers claims that this information could have been used to properly cross-examine Mosley and impeach his credibility.

""The *Strickland* holding and the American Bar Association's Guidelines only require trial counsel to perform a reasonable investigation, not to hire an investigator."" *State v. Hairston*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 05CA008768, 2006-Ohio-4925, ¶ 36. ""Further, '[a]n attorney's decision not to hire an investigator does not equate to a failure to investigate and
result in ineffective assistance of counsel."" State v. Thompson, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, ¶ 247, quoting Hairston at ¶ 36. Defense counsel's failure to hire a fact investigator does not mean counsel did not investigate Mosley's background. The affidavits, reports, and records submitted by Myers in support of Ground 10 do not show a failure to investigate.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors are directed at the trial court and defense attorney.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 100 Furthermore, as the Ohio Supreme Court specifically noted on direct appeal, defense counsel did cross-examine Mosley ""vigorously and at length."" Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 186. Defense counsel's cross-examination of Mosley shows that counsel was very familiar with Mosley's statements to police and demonstrated his investigation and familiarity with personal facts about Mosley, including Mosley's substance abuse issues and the fact he engaged in illegal activity. Defense counsel's cross-examination elicited testimony that later allowed counsel to argue that Mosley was the principal offender, that he had a financial motive to commit the crimes, that he had a motive to keep his testimony consistent with his statements to Detective Wyatt because of his plea agreement, and that he lied to the police about Zennie to protect Zennie over Myers. Defense counsel's cross-examination of Mosley refutes any suggestion counsel did not investigate Mosley's background.

¶ 101 Whether defense counsel discovered all of the information Myers identifies as topics of cross-examination is unknown. However, counsel's strategy was to cast Mosley as the leader who planned the crimes and executed them with little help from Myers and who was now turning on Myers to save himself. Some of the information that Myers suggests should have been a topic during Mosley's cross-examination is the same type of information which would have undermined Myers' mitigation strategy that Mosley bore primary responsibility for Back's murder. In this sense, portraying Mosley as suffering from depression and cocaine withdrawal at the time of the crime would have run counter to
defense counsel's strategy that Mosley was fully responsible for Back's murder. In addition, in light of the overwhelming evidence of Myers' guilt and the fact that Mosley's testimony regarding his and Myers' actions on the days leading to and culminating in the murder was corroborated by third-party witnesses, there is no reasonable probability Myers would have been acquitted of the charges. The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 10 and 11.

¶ 102 Ground 12 challenges counsel's failure to cross-examine Sergeant Jeff Garrison of the Clayton Police Department and Detective Wyatt during the hearing on Myers' motion to suppress and at trial regarding their failure to follow their respective police procedure manual in handcuffing Myers when he was only wanted for an interview. Myers asserts that had counsel used the manuals when cross-examining the officers, this would have aided in showing that Myers was ""effectively seized"" when he was handcuffed and would have tarnished the officers' credibility.

¶ 103 The record shows that it was Clayton police officers who handcuffed Myers and placed him in the back seat of a Clayton police cruiser after he was located at Mosley's home. At the time, Myers was a suspect who was detained at the request of the Warren County Sheriff's Office. The Clayton Police Department manual allows one to be restrained when the officer can articulate a need to handcuff for safety reasons. The sergeant's testimony at the suppression hearing indicates that Myers was handcuffed for safety reasons and to prevent him from running. Detective Wyatt's testimony reveals that the detective did not direct that Myers be handcuffed, and that in fact, he directed that the handcuffs be removed after he discovered that Myers was handcuffed.


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors are directed against the trial court for dismissing certain grounds of appeal and against the defense attorney for failing to use certain trial strategies or present specific evidence.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 104 Furthermore, as the trial court found, the extent and scope of cross-examination clearly fall within the ambit of trial strategy, and debatable trial tactics do not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, ¶ 146. Even assuming, arguendo, that defense counsel was deficient in failing
to use the manuals when he cross-examined the officers, Myers fails to establish that, but for counsel's error, a reasonable probability exists that the result of the suppression hearing and his trial would have been different. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 12.

{¶ 105} Ground 13 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a crime scene expert testimony to question the veracity of Mosley's notebook and rebut such evidence. The notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after the original search warrant was executed in January 2014. In support of Ground 13, Myers submitted Rini's report. The report indicates that photographs taken during the January 2014 search of Mosley's home do not show the notebook at all, nor was the notebook mentioned in any investigative report generated as a result of the January 2014 search of Mosley's home. Rini's report states that the ""discovery"" of the notebook ""eight months later, during a warrantless search in a location previously photographed during the January [2014] search, draws into question the legitimacy of the 'find' by investigating officers."" Thus, ""[i]t is not unwarranted for one to conclude the possibility that the [notebook] was not, in fact present during the original crime scene search, and may have been placed at the scene sometime after the search was completed.""

{¶ 106} ""As an initial matter, the failure to call an expert and instead rely on cross-examination does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel."" State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, ¶ 66. Further, even if the wisdom of such an approach is debatable, ""debatable trial tactics"" do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Clayton, 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49 (1980). Defense counsel cross-examined Mosley upon all issues identified in Rini's report and revisited those issues in closing argument. Detective Wyatt testified the notebook was found where Mosley said it would be. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 13.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is focused on the defense attorney's alleged ineffectiveness in presenting expert testimony to challenge *Miranda* issues.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 107} Ground 14 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present
a police procedure expert such as Rini to challenge *Miranda* issues. Myers asserts that Rini could have testified, based on his review of Myers' police interrogations, that Myers was ""clearly confused"" during questioning, that Detective Wyatt did not adequately explain the *Miranda* warnings to Myers, and that the detective provided Myers with inaccurate information concerning how he could obtain an attorney. Ground 15 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his *Miranda* rights. In support of this ground, Myers submitted the report of Dr. Barzman. Upon reviewing Myers' police interrogations, administering the MCRI test, and reviewing comprehensive historical information regarding Myers, Dr. Barzman opined that ""due to his young age of 19, probable, but at that time untreated, Bipolar Disorder, and lack of experience with interrogations and the adult criminal justice system in general,"" Myers ""was unable to adequately apply his *Miranda* rights at the time of the interrogations.""

¶ 108 During the suppression hearing defense counsel's cross-examination of Detective Wyatt addressed the issues raised in Rini's report, and the videotapes of Myers' interrogations were played and admitted into evidence. The videotapes were likewise played to the jury and admitted into evidence at Myers' trial. The trial court denied Myers' motion to suppress, finding that Myers validly waived his *Miranda* rights. The trial court further found that, based on the totality of the evidence, Myers understood the nature of his *Miranda* rights and the consequences in declining to exercise them. In his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, Myers challenged the validity of his *Miranda* waiver and argued that counsel was ineffective during the guilt phase of his trial. Myers' alleged confusion during police questioning, Detective Wyatt's explanation to Myers of the *Miranda* warnings and the information he provided Myers concerning how to retain an attorney, and counsel's alleged ineffectiveness in failing to present expert testimony to challenge *Miranda* issues were cognizable and could have been raised on direct appeal based solely on the original
record. Rini's report does not constitute evidence outside the record as Myers asserts. Myers' argument is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Dempsey, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 76386, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 2628 (June 15, 2000); State v. Holloway, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-900805, 1992 Ohio App. LEXIS 283 (Jan. 29, 1992). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 14.

¶ 109 The trial court dismissed Ground 15, finding that ""even if the defense had requested an expert to evaluate Myers' understanding of his Miranda rights, based on the evidence presented at the motion to suppress hearing it is unlikely that the Court would have granted that request since the Court denied the motion to suppress."" The trial court further found that ""[t]he failure to request a * * * police procedures expert or another expert to challenge Miranda issues was not such an error as to deny [Myers'] constitutional rights. [Myers] was not entitled to any such expert[.]"") Thus, the trial court found that even considering Dr. Barzman's report, Myers failed to set forth sufficient operative facts establishing a substantive ground for relief.

---------------------
¶ 110 The MRCI administered by Dr. Barzman in October 2016 is the updated version of the Thomas Grisso's Instruments for Assessing Understanding & Appreciation of Miranda Rights, commonly referred to as the Grisso test. The test specifically assesses a person's capacity to understand and appreciate Miranda rights at the time of the evaluation. Garner v. Mitchell, 557 F.3d 257, 266 (6th Cir.2009). The test consists of four subtests, called ""instruments"": Comprehension of Miranda Rights (CMR), Comprehension of Miranda Rights – Recognition (CMR-R), Function of Rights in Interrogation (FRI), and Comprehension of Miranda Vocabulary (CMV). Id.; State v. Higgins, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 12 JE 11, 2013-Ohio-2555, ¶ 43.

¶ 111 Myers' scores were within the range for 19-year-old individuals with a verbal IQ of 101 to 110 in the first three instruments; his score of 29 out of 32 in the fourth
instrument (CMV) was good in comparison to 19-year-old individuals with a verbal IQ of 101 to 110. As stated above, the Grisso test purports to assess one's capacity to understand the Miranda warnings only at the time of the evaluation, not at the time the warnings were given. Garner at 270. The test does not purport to measure the validity of the waiver of Miranda rights or legal competence to waive Miranda rights. Id. at 269. In his report Dr. Barzman admitted the limited usefulness of Myers' scores ""since his interrogations were almost 3 years ago[.]"" Nonetheless, Dr. Barzman opined that ""[b]ased on his responses to the [test], it is evident that Austin currently understands the words of the Miranda Rights but he had problems with applying his rights. Although [he] appeared to have average to above average intelligence, he did not have the 'street smarts' three years ago to actually apply his Miranda Rights under intense stress.""

¶ 112 Myers' scores indicate he did understand his Miranda rights. Myers was interviewed five times by Detective Wyatt. Miranda warnings were not required during the first interview as Myers was not in custody. Detective Wyatt administered Miranda warnings to Myers on three separate times; each time Myers stated he understood them. Myers invoked his right to counsel in the second interview and the detective ended the interview. Myers sought to re-initiate questioning during a third interview but was rebuffed because he had invoked his right to counsel. Myers subsequently re-initiated questioning during a fourth interview, was administered the Miranda warnings again, and provided a statement. Detective Wyatt administered the Miranda warnings for a third time before the fifth interview. Myers indicated he understood them and answered the detective's questions. On direct appeal, the Ohio Supreme Court found that Myers understood his Miranda rights, which was further demonstrated by his invocation of his right to counsel. Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 69-71. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 15.

Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is directed at the trial court for summarily dismissing Myers' claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the sentencing phase of his capital trial.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 113 Ground 16 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to support
the motion for a change of venue with news articles evidencing the extraordinary amount of pretrial publicity, failed to renew the motion after voir dire, and ultimately failed to achieve a change of venue. The trial court dismissed Ground 16, finding that the motion for change of venue was initially denied subject to reconsideration if a jury could not be empaneled in accordance with State v. Lundgren, 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 1995-Ohio-227. The motion was subsequently denied after the trial court was able to successfully seat a jury in accordance with Lundgren. Juror questionnaires submitted in support of Ground 16 indicate that six of the 12 jurors had seen or heard pretrial news coverage of the case. All jurors indicated that they could and would decide the case based solely on the evidence presented at trial. Furthermore, although Myers alleged claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase as part of his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, he did not challenge defense counsel's failure to achieve a change of venue. It is therefore barred by res judicata. See Piesciuk, 2013-Ohio-3879. The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 16.

{¶ 114} Ground 17 alleges that counsel was ineffective because he failed to challenge the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook either through cross-examination of the state's witnesses or by expert testimony. As stated above, the notebook was discovered in Mosley's home eight months after the original search warrant was executed. Counsel vigorously cross-examined Mosley about the notebook and objected to its admission. On direct appeal to the supreme court, Myers challenged the admission of the notebook into evidence and alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of the trial. The issue regarding the chain of custody of Mosley's notebook was cognizable and could have been raised on direct appeal to the supreme court and is therefore barred by res judicata. See State v. Dickason, 5th Dist. Stark Case No. 1996CA00423, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 3241 (July 7, 1997). The trial court did not err in dismissing Ground 17.
Myers' sixth assignment of error is overruled.

4. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel during the Penalty Phase

Assignment of Error No. 5:

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C) AND RULE 12, MYERS' CLAIMS THAT HIS TRIAL COUNSEL RENDERED CONSTITUTIONALLY DEFICIENT PERFORMANCE IN THE SENTENCING PHASE OF HIS CAPITAL TRIAL (GROUNDS 19-45, 49), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING, AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF ON THESE MERITORIOUS IAC CLAIMS.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above describes an assignment of error related to the trial court's decision to dismiss grounds for relief and deny discovery motions, not misconduct by the prosecutor. The allegations are against the trial court for dismissing ineffective assistance of counsel claims and against the defense attorney for not conducting a competent mitigation investigation and presenting certain witnesses and expert testimony. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Myers argues that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 19 through 45, all of which allege several instances of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial. Specifically, Myers argues that counsel was ineffective during the penalty phase of the trial because he failed to (1) conduct a competent mitigation investigation and consult with and hire a competent mitigation specialist in a timely fashion, (2) present the testimony of expert witnesses regarding Myers' youth and psychological history, (3) present expert testimony regarding the science on adolescent brain development, and (4) present the testimony of numerous witnesses who would have testified about Myers' background, family history, mental health, education, and relationships with others. Myers argues that defense counsel's primary mitigation strategy was that Myers should not receive a punishment harsher than the life sentence without parole imposed on Mosley. Myers avers that had defense counsel's focus been broader and include the testimony of experts and other witnesses, he would not have been sentenced to death.

The trial court dismissed the grounds for relief, finding that (1) the failure to
call witnesses is trial strategy that does not raise to a constitutional violation, (2) a PCR petition is not a vehicle to substitute another trial strategy for one that failed, (3) defense counsel did argue Myers' youth in mitigation and the trial court instructed the jury that youth was a mitigating factor, and (4) defense counsel's failure to present the testimony of an expert in adolescent brain development, and his decision to consult with but not call a psychology expert to the stand and instead rely on arguing that Myers' sentence should not be harsher than that of Mosley was trial strategy.

¶ 120 Myers' foregoing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of the trial were also the basis for his motions for discovery and why he argues the trial court erred in denying his motions for discovery under his second and third assignments of error. As pertinent here, the trial court denied the discovery motions as follows:

This is not a case where the defense did not seek the assistance of an investigator, mitigation expert and mental health expert. Clearly, a decision by trial counsel not to even have these valuable tools available to him while defending a capital murder case can never be a tactical, strategic decision. However, the decision of whether or not to use these tools or how to use them, as a matter of strategy or in the context of marshalling resources, is the cornerstone in building a proper legal defense.

Petitioner has made allegations that his attorneys and mitigation specialist were ineffective and did not properly investigate and prepare a defense. In support of this claim, he has provided affidavits and documentary evidence concerning their performance. However, petitioner has made no specific representation about what he expects to learn in a deposition of [lead defense counsel, co-counsel and/or the mitigation specialist]. Both [lead counsel and the mitigation specialist] provided affidavits explaining what they knew, what they did, and why they did it. The fact that an attorney may look back in a deposition or otherwise, with 20/20 hindsight, and question or revisit his trial strategy after the jury has rendered its verdict provides no real insight to the Court. Further, the fact that [lead counsel] may have limited his mitigation strategy to what he believed to be the strongest and most compelling arguments does not support conducting discovery on this issue. * * *
In short, the petitioner has not established good cause to conduct discovery with respect to the defense team, including the attorneys.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error, but it is not alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is being alleged against the defense attorney for failing to present or fully present the testimony of numerous witnesses.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 121 During the penalty phase of the trial, defense counsel presented the testimony of Myers' father, mother, and younger brother Bryce. All three testified about Myers' family history and background, including the breakup of the family and the parents' divorce following the mother's affair with a coworker and resultant pregnancy. They further testified about Myers' close bond with his siblings and how he was a very good mediator and mentor for his stepsiblings. Myers' mother testified that as a child, Myers tested gifted in several areas, was a talented piano player, and had designed a business card for himself in sixth grade. However, she started seeing changes in Myers when he was 14 years old. After she discovered Myers had been cutting himself and shooting his legs with a pellet gun, he was hospitalized for five days at Kettering Hospital Youth Services. Myers' mother testified that Myers was initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder and upon discharge, was prescribed medications and weekly therapy with a psychologist. However, Myers discontinued both when he began living with his father later that year. Defense counsel introduced photographs of Myers and his family, the business card he had designed for himself, his letters to his family during his incarceration, the records of his hospitalization at Kettering Hospital, and his gifted test results when he was in fifth grade. The Kettering Hospital records show that Myers was hospitalized as a result of taking 20 Benadryl tablets and that he was initially diagnosed with ""depressive disorder not otherwise specified versus bipolar disorder most recent depressed; substance induced mood disorder; over-the-counter drug abuse."" Myers was ultimately diagnosed with ""depressive disorder, not otherwise specified. Rule out bipolar disorder.""

¶ 122 Myers made an unsworn statement, telling the jury that he was sorry ""this
happened"" and wished he ""could go back in time and stop this before it even happened,"" and that the death penalty would not hurt him and would only cause more pain and suffering to innocent people such as his parents and siblings. Myers asked the jury to spare his life and give him a chance to become a better person.

¶ 123 In closing argument, defense counsel stressed Myers' good qualities and the positive influence he could have in his siblings' lives, acknowledged there had been ""bumps in the road,"" such as issues with Myers' family, ""his mental health a little bit,"" and his cutting and shooting himself with the pellet gun, and asked the jury to consider Myers' age, the love of his family, and the Kettering Hospital records. Overall, defense counsel focused on Mosley's plea agreement and resulting life sentence, telling the jury that it was the most important mitigating factor in the case and that Myers should not be punished more than Mosley who was the one who actually killed Back.

¶ 124 Grounds 22 through 43 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present or ""fully"" present the testimony of numerous witnesses who would have testified about Myers' background, family history, mental health, education, and relationships with others. In support of this claim, Myers attached 22 affidavits from relatives, friends, acquaintances, and former educators to his PCR petition. Of those witnesses, only three testified at the penalty phase, to wit, Myers' parents and his brother Bryce.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is focused on the trial court's decision to dismiss certain grounds and the defense attorney's actions regarding the mitigation specialist.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 125 It is well established that a ""defense decision to call or not call a mitigation witness is a matter of trial strategy. * * * Debatable trial tactics generally do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel."" Graham, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 139. The Ohio Supreme Court has further stated that trial counsel is not ineffective for failing to call all available family members. State v. McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 399, 1997-Ohio-335. Furthermore, ""[a]dditional mitigating evidence that is 'merely cumulative' of that already presented does not undermine the results of sentencing."" State v. Herring, 142 Ohio St.3d 165, 2014-Ohio-
5228, ¶ 117. Instead, ""the new evidence * * * must differ in a substantial way – in strength and subject matter – from the evidence actually presented at sentencing."" Id.

¶ 126 Upon reviewing the witnesses' affidavits, we find that the trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 22 through 43. Although the 19 individuals who did not testify may have provided a more disinterested account of Myers' family, their testimony to a large extent was cumulative to and did not differ in substantial way from the testimony of Myers' parents and his brother Bryce. See State v. Twyford, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 98-JE-56, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 1443 (Mar. 19, 2001). Likewise, the affidavits of Myers' parents and brother did not differ in substantial way from their testimony at the penalty phase.

¶ 127 Grounds 19 and 20 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to consult with and hire a competent mitigation specialist in a timely fashion.

¶ 128 In March 2014, lead defense counsel moved to employ his wife, a licensed attorney with experience defending capital cases, as the mitigation specialist. The trial court balked at the request due to the family relationship and denied the motion. Lead counsel did not seek assistance from another mitigation specialist until he contacted the Ohio Public Defender's Office in May 2014. However, the public defender's office did not have the resources to provide a mitigation specialist. Unable to find another mitigation specialist, lead counsel moved the trial court to reconsider its previous denial. The trial court held a hearing on the motion for reconsideration on June 4, 2014. Thereafter, the trial court appointed lead counsel's wife as the mitigation specialist. The trial court's decision noted that counsel's wife had ""already undertaken some mitigation work in the case, including meeting with the family of the Defendant[.]""

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors are directed at the trial court and defense attorney, specifically challenging the effectiveness of the defense attorney's representation and the trial court's decision to dismiss certain grounds of the PCR petition.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 129 The jury found Myers guilty on all counts and specifications on October 2, 2014. The penalty phase was held on October 6, 2014. In support of his PCR petition, Myers attached the affidavits of lead counsel and the mitigation specialist. Both affidavits
state that during the three-day weekend between the jury verdict and the penalty phase, lead counsel and the mitigation specialist met with and interviewed Myers' mother and two of his siblings at the mother's home. That same weekend, they also met with and interviewed Myers' father and stepmother at their home. The affidavits of Myers' parents and stepmother corroborated that the interviews took place that weekend. Myers' stepmother stated the interview was short. Myers' mother stated that her interview lasted about one hour and one half and that she gave photographs to the mitigation specialist at another time and ""spent another hour to an hour and a half with her.""

{¶ 130} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that capital defendants ""[do] not have a constitutional right to a mitigation specialist or a right to an effective one."" Herring, 2014-Ohio-5228 at ¶ 113, citing McGuire, 80 Ohio St.3d at 399 (no requirement for counsel to hire mitigation specialist in capital case); Drummond, 2006-Ohio-7078 at ¶ 69 (a mitigation specialist is not a requirement for effective assistance of counsel). The trial court noted that the mitigation specialist ""was a trained attorney who has handled a number of capital cases and therefore has the ability to determine what evidence is effective in the [penalty] phase."" The trial court did not err in dismissing Grounds 19 and 20.

{¶ 131} Grounds 21, 44, and 45 generally challenge counsel's failure to conduct a comprehensive investigation into Myers' background and counsel's failure to present effective mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of the trial. Specifically, Grounds 21, 44, and 45 allege that counsel was ineffective because he failed to present the expert testimony of clinical forensic psychologist Dr. Bobbie Hopes, failed to consult with and present an expert in adolescent brain development, and failed to effectively present youth as a mitigation factor.

{¶ 132} In support of his PCR petition, Myers submitted affidavits and reports from several experts related to adolescent brain development and expressing opinions based
upon their evaluation of Myers and his mental health and social records. The evidence submitted by Myers generally reflects that individuals of his age are prone to risk taking, peer influence, and impulsivity more akin to adolescents than adults. Myers argues that this evidence established substantive grounds for relief and he is therefore entitled to discovery and an evidentiary hearing on his PCR petition. The state argues that the evidence was not presented as a matter of trial strategy because it was in conflict with defense counsel's mitigation strategy to emphasize Myers' good qualities and was cumulative to evidence presented at the penalty phase.

Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is being raised against the defense attorney for failing to present expert testimony in the penalty phase of the trial.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 133 In his direct appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, Myers argued ineffective assistance of counsel in the penalty phase for failure to present any expert testimony. Specifically, Myers asserted that defense counsel ""should have adduced expert testimony to explain the meaning of his self-harming behavior in his early teens and how brain development affects the decision-making of young people."" Myers, 2018-Ohio-1903 at ¶ 198. The supreme court rejected Myers' claim on the ground that ""nothing in the record shows what such expert would have said in the penalty phase[.] Thus, Myers has not demonstrated prejudice from missing such testimony."" Id. The supreme court further found, ""At trial, the defense requested and received funds to hire a consulting psychologist. The psychologist the defense chose was appointed, but the record does not show what she told Myers's counsel regarding her conclusions. Hence, there is nothing to show deficient performance by counsel."" Id. at ¶ 199.

¶ 134 In a capital case, ""[d]efense counsel has a duty to investigate the circumstances of his client's case and explore all matters relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty, including the defendant's background, education, employment record, mental and emotional stability, and family relationships."" State v. Pickens, 141 Ohio St.3d 462, 2014-Ohio-5445, ¶ 219. Defense counsel has a duty to make reasonable
investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary. *State v. Johnson*, 24 Ohio St.3d 87, 89 (1986). Counsel's ""investigations into mitigating evidence 'should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor.'"" *Wiggins v. Smith*, 539 U.S. 510, 524, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (2003), citing American Bar Association, *ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases*, Section 11.4.1(C), 93 (1989). Given the severity of the potential sentence and the reality that the life of a capital defendant is at stake, it is only after a full investigation of all the mitigating circumstances that counsel can make an informed, tactical decision about which information would be most helpful to the client's case. *Johnson* at 90. ""Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable[.] However, a failure to investigate, especially as to key evidence, must be supported by a reasoned and deliberate determination that investigation was not warranted."" *O'Hara v. Wigginton*, 24 F.3d 823, 828 (6th Cir.1994). ""An attorney's failure to reasonably investigate the defendant's background and present mitigating evidence to the jury at sentencing can constitute ineffective assistance of counsel."" *Pickens* at ¶ 219.

¶ 135 Myers was examined by Dr. Barzman for purposes of the PCR petition and his report is attached to the petition. Myers was also examined by Dr. Daniel Davis, a forensic psychologist, and his report is attached to the PCR petition. In his report, Dr. Barzman opined that Myers' mental health history, which included significant depressive and manic symptoms, was consistent with bipolar disorder which is associated with increased impulsivity and a focus on immediate gratification.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is being assigned to the trial court and defense attorney for not presenting pertinent psychological information and expert testimony regarding Myers' youth, brain development, and emotional coping mechanisms.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 136 In his report, Dr. Davis stated that the symptoms Myers experienced in high school were associated with bipolar disorder and that he was not fully neurologically
developed at the time of his crimes and sentencing. Dr. Davis further stated that the trial court and jury were deprived of pertinent psychological information specific to Myers and general psychological research specific to youthful and capital offenders, evidence that would have been extremely helpful to understand Myers' actions and demeanor. In particular, Dr. Davis noted that while Myers' youth was clearly evident at trial, the crimes took place when Myers was still developing neurologically and psychologically, however ""there was no specific testimony as to the considerable scientific literature concerning neurological development in late adolescents and young adults."" Dr. Davis also noted Myers' apparent lack of remorse for his crimes at sentencing but stated that scientific literature shows that an apparent lack of remorse is not indicative of anything atypical in adolescent males and is typically mistaken as one of the ""signs of the development of a psychopathic personality when they are, in fact, transient features of adolescent development."" Dr. Davis' report continued,

Further, abused and neglected children, such as Austin demonstrate a limited range of emotions as a way to cope with very stressful home environments. These research findings apply specifically to Austin. He was raised in a highly neglectful environment. He was at the time of his sentence still in the commonly accepted development stage of late adolescence. Neither the trial court nor jury had this critically important research presented to them[.]

¶ 137 In support of his PCR petition, Myers also submitted the affidavits of his lead defense counsel and Dr. Hopes. Lead counsel's affidavit details what he did and did not do. As pertinent here, lead counsel stated he believed ""that everyone close to the process thought that [Myers] would receive a life sentence regardless of the trial phase result, based upon Mosley's plea deal having been the principal offender in the aggravated murder of Justin Back."" Counsel's affidavit further stated,

I did not consider requesting funding for, or hiring, a youth/adolescent expert to help explain issues, including
youth/adolescent brain development, to the jury.

Even though we did retain a psychologist, Dr. Bobbie Hopes, for mitigation, Dr. Hopes told me that she would not be able to provide anything for the jury except for a timeline of Austin's life, something which Dr. Hopes believed Austin's mother could provide and that it would be better if it came from her. Given her statements to me, I was concerned that if Dr Hopes presented this information to the jury, it would just be seen as ""psychobabble.""

When Austin's mother * * * did not effectively provide such a timeline as I had anticipated and that [the mitigation specialist] and I had worked with her on, I did not think to then call Dr. Bobbie Hopes to the stand to testify.

Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error related to the defense attorney's alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, not misconduct by the prosecutor. The error alleges that the defense attorney failed to present expert testimony at the penalty phase of the trial, specifically regarding adolescent brain development and Myers' history of childhood physical abuse, depression, and self-mutilation.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 138} Lead counsel's averments were contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. Dr. Hopes evaluated Myers three times in August 2014, for a total of six hours, for purposes of death penalty mitigation. Dr. Hopes averred that she provided lead counsel with a report in which she expressed the opinion that Myers' age, his history of childhood physical abuse, including his history of being diagnosed and treated for depression, and his history of self-mutilation were mitigation factors. Following Myers' conviction for aggravated murder, lead counsel called Dr. Hopes and told her he did not intend to use her as a mitigation expert. Dr. Hopes suggested that Myers' age and relevant research on adolescent brain development were strong mitigation factors but was told by lead counsel that information about youth had come out during jury selection. Dr. Hopes averred that she was willing and prepared to testify about age and adolescent brain development research. Dr. Hopes further averred that she never advised lead counsel that she could only present a timeline of Myers' life and that she never discussed a timeline with counsel.

{¶ 139} As stated above, ""[i]n a petition for post-conviction relief, which asserts ineffective assistance of counsel, the petitioner bears the initial burden to submit evidentiary documents containing sufficient operative facts to demonstrate the lack of competent counsel and that the defense was prejudiced by counsel's ineffectiveness."" Jackson, 64
Ohio St.2d 107 at syllabus. In order to secure an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner need not prove counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Rather, the PCR petition only needs to set forth sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.

¶ 140 Upon reviewing the reports of Drs. Barzman and Davis and the affidavits of Dr. Hopes and lead defense counsel, we find that Myers has provided evidentiary documents setting forth sufficient operative facts to warrant an evidentiary hearing on his PCR petition regarding his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony at the penalty phase of the trial.

¶ 141 Defense counsel has the affirmative duty to investigate mitigating evidence. State v. Herring, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08-MA-213, 2011-Ohio-662, ¶ 55. Defense counsel ""can make the decision to forego the presentation of evidence, but only after a full investigation."" Id. It is only after a full investigation of all the mitigating circumstances that counsel can make an informed, tactical decision about which information would be most helpful to their client's case. Johnson, 24 Ohio St.3d at 89.

¶ 142 Lead counsel's averment that he did not consider requesting funding for, or hiring, a youth/adolescent expert to explain issues regarding adolescent brain development to the jury fails to indicate counsel's motivation and instead suggests that counsel's failure to present such expert testimony was not the product of an informed, tactical decision. That is, counsel's averment shows he did not engage into a reasoned and careful consideration of such expert testimony before ultimately rejecting it. The same can be said about counsel's failure to have Dr. Hopes testify as an expert witness at the penalty phase. While counsel averred in his affidavit that Dr. Hopes did not testify because she could only provide a timeline of Myers' life, this averment was explicitly contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. There is little evidence documenting the extent of defense counsel's reasoning for his
investigation and decision making regarding expert testimony mitigation evidence.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The text discusses the state's arguments regarding the presentation of expert testimony and the defense counsel's mitigation strategy, but it does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 143} The state argues that mitigation evidence regarding Myers’ dysfunctional family, self-mutilation, and mental health issues such as childhood depression and bipolar disorder, was presented through the testimony of his mother at the penalty phase, and thus, much of the psychological testimony that Drs. Hopes, Barzman, and Davis could have presented would have been cumulative. However, Myers’ mother's testimony was much more limited on the issue. Myers’ mother testified that the deterioration of her marriage did not seem to affect Myers, that she had not noticed Myers' self-mutilation, and that she believed Kettering Hospital initially diagnosed Myers with bipolar disorder. There was no testimony regarding Myers' childhood depression. Furthermore, Myers’ mother is not qualified to provide the expert testimony necessary to contextualize the factors above.

{¶ 144} The state next argues that presenting this expert testimony at the penalty phase would have been inconsistent with defense counsel's mitigation theory emphasizing Myers' good qualities and the positive influence he could have in his siblings' lives. Thus, the state asserts, defense counsel's decision not to present such testimony was trial strategy which should not be second-guessed.

{¶ 145} However, lead counsel's affidavit does not advance this as the reason he did not present Dr. Hopes' expert testimony at the penalty phase. Lead counsel avers only that he did not call Dr. Hopes as a witness because she could only provide a timeline of Myers' life, an averment explicitly contradicted by Dr. Hopes' affidavit. Whether it was defense counsel's mitigation strategy to emphasize Myers' qualities, which counsel's affidavit does not suggest, it is not apparent why such strategy excludes a parallel strategy to contextualize Myers' youth in light of the science on adolescent brain development. As her affidavit clearly indicates, Dr. Hopes was prepared and available to testify about these issues and advised lead counsel on the eve of the penalty phase that Myers' age and
relevant research on adolescent brain development were strong mitigation factors. And while a decision by defense counsel to present only positive mitigation can be a sound trial strategy, counsel's decision to pursue a positive-mitigation theory can properly be made only after counsel has conducted a full mitigation investigation. *Herring*, 2014-Ohio-5228 at ¶ 90.

{¶ 146} The state further asserts that defense counsel did argue that Myers was only 19 years old at the time of the crimes. Counsel did briefly ask the jury to take Myers' age into consideration as a mitigation factor. However, counsel never developed the significance of Myers' youth as a mitigating factor.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text above does not allege that the prosecutor committed any misconduct. The error is being assigned against the trial court for summarily dismissing Myers' claim of cumulative error (Ground 60) without allowing discovery or an evidentiary hearing and failing to grant relief.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 147} In light of the foregoing, we find that the trial court erred in summarily dismissing Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition without an evidentiary hearing. The trial court further erred in finding that Myers did not establish good cause to conduct discovery regarding his claim counsel was ineffective at the penalty phase in failing to present expert testimony on adolescent brain development in conjunction with Myers' age and mental health issues. Myers' claims are ""neither patently frivolous nor palpably incredible"" and ""the discovery he requests"" in the form of depositions of the defense team is ""limited and reasonably calculated to lead to evidence in support of his claim[.]"" *Hill*, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 71975 at *31-32; *Johnson v. Bobby*, S.D.Ohio No. 2:08-cv-55, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 103351 (Sept. 30, 2010); *Stallings v. Bradshaw*, N.D.Ohio No. 5:05CV0722, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97540 (Feb. 28, 2006).

{¶ 148} We therefore remand this case for the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition which allege ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase for failing to present expert testimony on adolescent brain development in conjunction with Myers' age and mental health issues. The advantages that an evidentiary hearing on a PCR petition based on ineffective assistance of counsel
can provide a trial judge are well established:

The trial judge can delve into the motivation or reasoning of trial counsel through trial counsel's testimony. The court can hear the testimony of witnesses that were never called to testify at the original trial, and can determine the worth of their testimony as well as the witnesses' credibility. The trial judge can ask what the counsel knew, when he knew it, and whether a mistake was not strategic, but was instead careless. As here, in a postconviction hearing, a judge can hear testimony about what evidence was made available to trial counsel and when it was made available. A trial court in a postconviction proceeding thus plays a unique role in the consideration of ineffective assistance of counsel claims. It is the only court that actually hears testimony on that issue.

State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, ¶ 54.

¶ 149 Myers' fifth assignment of error is sustained. To the extent noted above, Myers' second and third assignments of error are sustained in part.

5. Cumulative Errors

¶ 150 Assignment of Error No. 10:

¶ 151 THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AND DENIED MYERS DUE PROCESS AND AN ADEQUATE CORRECTIVE PROCESS, WHEN IT SUMMARILY DISMISSED, UNDER R.C. 2953.21(C), MYERS' CLAIM OF CUMULATIVE ERROR (GROUND 60), WITHOUT ALLOWING DISCOVERY OR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING AND IN FAILING TO GRANT RELIEF.

Answer:"
371-Myers,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is alleged against the trial court for dismissing certain grounds of the PCR petition.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 152 Myers argues the trial court erred in dismissing Ground 60 which alleges cumulative errors. We include under this assignment of error Myers' claims that the trial court erred in dismissing Grounds 18 and 49, which allege cumulative effect of the denial of effective assistance of counsel during the guilt and penalty phases of the trial (as initially argued in the fifth and sixth assignments of error). Under the doctrine of cumulative errors, a judgment may be reversed if the cumulative effect of errors deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute
cause for reversal. *State v. Kirkland*, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, ¶ 140. Given our resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth assignments of error, this assignment of error is moot. See *State v. Stein*, 3d Dist. Logan No. 8-17-39, 2018-Ohio-2621, citing App.R. 12(A)(1)(c).

III. CONCLUSION

¶ 153 In light of our resolution of Myers' second, third, and fifth assignments of error, the trial court's judgments denying Myers' motions for discovery and his PCR petition regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to present expert testimony at the penalty phase of the trial are reversed and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Specifically, on remand, the trial court shall permit discovery, conduct an evidentiary hearing, and rule on Grounds 21, 44, and 45 of the PCR petition.

¶ 154 Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

IN THE COURT OF APPEALS
TWELFTH APPELLATE DISTRICT OF OHIO
PREBLE COUNTY

STATE OF OHIO,

Appellee,

- vs -

BRIAN SHANER,

Appellant.

CASE NO. CA2018-09-013

OPINION
7/15/2019

CRIMINAL APPEAL FROM PREBLE COUNTY COURT OF COMMON PLEAS
Case No. 17-CR12522

Martin P. Votel, Preble County Prosecuting Attorney, Gractia S. Manning, 101 East Main Street, Eaton, Ohio 45320, for appellee

William O. Cass, Jr., 135 W. Dorothy Lane, Suite 117, Kettering, Ohio 45429, for appellant

PIPER, J.

¶ 1 In November 2017, the Preble County Sheriff's Office used a confidential informant to conduct a controlled buy of methamphetamine from appellant, Brian Shaner. The transaction occurred in the parking lot of a local medical facility where appellant's motor vehicle was parked. Appellant had his infant child with him in the car during the drug sale.

¶ 2 Appellant was subsequently indicted for three offenses: aggravated trafficking in drugs, a second-degree felony; aggravated possession of drugs, a third-degree felony; and
endangering children, a first-degree misdemeanor. The case proceeded to a one-day jury trial on June 11, 2018 and the jury found appellant guilty as charged.

¶ 3 Within fourteen days of the jury's verdict, appellant's trial attorney filed a written motion for a new trial based on alleged discovery violations. The trial court denied the motion. Meanwhile, appellant's trial counsel indicated to the prosecutor that juror misconduct may have occurred. The prosecutor notified the court by filing a notice of alleged jury misconduct. The trial court appointed new counsel for appellant and scheduled a hearing on the matter.

¶ 4 At the end of the hearing, appellant's new trial counsel suggested a new trial was appropriate. The court assumed the request was an oral motion for a new trial, but disagreed, finding that no misconduct occurred and denied the motion. The case then proceeded to sentencing. The court merged the drug trafficking and possession offenses and sentenced appellant to an aggregate four-year prison term.

¶ 5 Appellant now appeals his convictions, raising two assignments of error.

¶ 6 Assignment of Error No. 1:

¶ 7 THE JURY'S FINDING OF GUILTY WAS BASED ON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND WAS AGAINST THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.

¶ 8 In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence and was otherwise against the manifest weight of the evidence.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
937-Shaner,"No. The text above is describing the standard of review for a sufficiency of the evidence challenge, not alleging any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error being discussed is related to the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the prosecution to support a conviction, not any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 9 The concepts of sufficiency of the evidence and weight of the evidence are both quantitatively and qualitatively different. State v. Couch, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2016-03-062, 2016-Ohio-8452, ¶ 9, citing State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386 (1997). Sufficiency of the evidence is the concept of whether the conviction can be supported as a matter of law. State v. Green, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2017-11-161, 2018-Ohio-3991, ¶ 25.
The standard of review for a sufficiency of the evidence challenge is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the prosecution proved the essential elements of the criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecutor. *State v. Beverly*, 143 Ohio St.3d 258, 2015-Ohio-219, ¶ 15. On a sufficiency challenge, the reviewing court will not consider the credibility of the witnesses. *State v. Wilks*, 154 Ohio St.3d 359, 2018-Ohio-1562, ¶ 162. Instead, the appellate court will defer to the trier of fact on questions of credibility and weight. *State v. Kirkland*, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, ¶ 132.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
937-Shaner,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it discusses the legal standards and requirements for convictions under Ohio law for aggravated trafficking and aggravated possession offenses.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 10 A manifest weight challenge, on the other hand, requires the appellate court examine the evidence to determine whether the ""greater amount of credible evidence"" supports one side of the issue over the other. *State v. Bell*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2008-05-044, 2009-Ohio-2335, ¶ 57. As such the appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether in resolving the conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. *State v. Spencer*, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2018-08-082, 2019-Ohio-2165, ¶ 21. While the issue of credibility is relevant to the manifest weight review, an appellate court ""must be mindful the trier of fact has the primary role of weighing the evidence and evaluating witness credibility."" *State v. Salinger*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2014-10-208, 2015-Ohio-2821, ¶ 15, citing *State v. DeHass*, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 231 (1967). An appellate court will overturn a conviction only in ""extraordinary circumstances to correct a manifest miscarriage of justice, and only when the evidence presented at trial weighs heavily in favor of acquittal."" *State v. Cobb*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2007-06-153, 2008-Ohio-5210, ¶ 95, citing *Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387.

¶ 11 To convict appellant for the aggravated trafficking offense the prosecutor had to
prove that appellant knowingly sold, or offered to sell, a controlled substance or controlled substance analog. R.C. 2925.03(A)(1). For this offense to constitute a second-degree felony, the prosecutor had to prove that the amount of the drug exceeded the bulk amount, but was less than five times the bulk amount, and appellant committed the offense “in the vicinity of a juvenile.” R.C. 2925.03(C)(1)(c). Regarding the aggravated possession offense, the prosecutor had to prove that appellant knowingly obtained, possessed, or used a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog. R.C. 2925.11(A). For this offense to constitute a third-degree felony, the prosecutor had to prove that appellant possessed an amount of the drug greater than the bulk amount, but less than five times the bulk amount. R.C. 2925.11(C)(1)(b).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
937-Shaner,No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It is a summary of the evidence presented at trial and the court's findings regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to convict the appellant. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 12 As relevant here, the controlled substance appellant was accused of trafficking was methamphetamine, a schedule II substance pursuant to R.C. 3719.41. The bulk amount of a schedule II substance is three grams. R.C. 2925.01(D)(1)(g). The requisite mental state for these offenses was knowingly. This mental state is defined as ""regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature."" R.C. 2901.22(B).

¶ 13 After review of the record, this court finds that the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of both drug offenses and was not otherwise against the manifest weight of the evidence. At trial the prosecutor presented testimony from three witnesses: two detectives from the Preble County Sheriff’s Office and a confidential informant. Both detectives testified that before the target drug buy, they observed a female correctional officer perform a patdown search of the confidential informant to check the informant for contraband. This search yielded nothing. The detectives further testified that at least one officer was present with the informant up to the time the informant made contact with appellant and after the buy. The first detective testified that during the transaction he acted
as the ""cover"" officer to provide overwatch of the operation. In his position as overwatch, he was able to observe appellant and his girlfriend exit the medical facility and approach appellant's vehicle in the parking lot prior to the transaction.

¶ 14 The second detective testified that he rode in the vehicle with the informant to the parking lot of the medical facility. This detective provided the informant with an audio/visual recording device. Upon arrival, the second detective testified that he and the informant exited the vehicle and walked to their respective positions. The informant headed towards appellant's vehicle, while the second detective walked into the medical facility to observe the transaction through a window of the building. This detective testified that he observed appellant and his girlfriend walk towards appellant's vehicle from the medical buildings. Appellant was carrying an infant child. The detective then testified he watched the informant meet appellant and the girlfriend at the vehicle. The informant and appellant moved to the passenger side of the vehicle out of the detective's line of sight, so the detective was unable to see the exchange occur. During this time the detective saw the child in the rear seat of the vehicle on the driver's side. After the transaction, the detective testified that he met the informant in the medical building and received the bag of suspected methamphetamine from the informant.

¶ 15 Finally, the informant testified that prior to the target purchase she did not possess any type of contraband. She then testified that she approached appellant's vehicle in the parking lot, saw a child in the back seat of the vehicle, and engaged in casual conversation with appellant's girlfriend before moving to the passenger side of the car to conduct the exchange and retrieve the methamphetamine. The informant testified that while she gave appellant money for the sale, she was unsure of whether she directly handed him the cash or if she placed the money inside the car. After the sale, the informant walked away from appellant's vehicle and into the medical facility. She then convened with the second
detective and provided him the methamphetamine.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
937-Shaner,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it discusses the evidence presented by the prosecutor and the jury's decision based on that evidence.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 16} In addition to testimony, the prosecutor admitted into evidence the bag of methamphetamine, a laboratory analysis report that established that the substance was around 6.98 grams of methamphetamine, and a video of the transaction. While the video alone was not dispositive of the drug sale, it did corroborate the testimonies of the three witnesses. Unfortunately, the video only captured images of the ground and the subjects' feet during the transaction. Nevertheless, at the point of the suspected transaction, the video shows that of the three individuals present, the informant moved away from the girlfriend and stood near appellant, at which time a zipping sound can be heard indicating appellant was retrieving something from a zippered bag.

{¶ 17} Consequently, the evidence established that appellant knowingly possessed and then sold 6.98 grams of methamphetamine to the confidential informant in the presence of appellant's infant child. The testimony from the witnesses, the laboratory report, the video, and the bag of methamphetamine together comprised sufficient proof that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the trafficking and possession offenses proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

{¶ 18} Furthermore, this court finds that the jury did not clearly lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice when it found appellant guilty. Appellant argues that the confidential informant had a self-serving motive to carry out the drug sale, or was otherwise biased, because her aid in this investigation would lead to the state dismissing charges against her. However, the record shows that the informant was searched for contraband prior to the operation and nothing was found. Moreover, the detectives testified that they did not have any reason to believe that the methamphetamine did not come from appellant as a part of the transaction, because they were able to observe the informant throughout the operation. The guilty verdicts indicate that the jury found the informant's and detectives'
testimony credible. Therefore, this is not a case where the evidence weighs heavily in favor of appellant. The drug offense convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.

¶ 19 Next, to convict appellant for the endangering children offense, the prosecutor had to prove that appellant was a ""parent, guardian, custodian, person having custody or control of a child or person in loco parentis of under eighteen years of age"" and created a ""substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a duty of care, protection, or support."" R.C. 2919.22(A). The prosecutor had to prove that the appellant acted with the culpable mental state of recklessness. State v. McGee, 79 Ohio St.3d 193, 195 (1997). This means the prosecutor had to show that appellant acted with ""heedless indifference to the consequences"" and disregarded a ""substantial and unjustifiable risk"" that his conduct was ""likely to cause a certain result."" R.C. 2901.22(C). For our purposes, a substantial risk is ""a strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist."" R.C. 2901.01(A)(8).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
937-Shaner,No. The error is not alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The allegation is against the trial court for not granting a new trial based on juror misconduct.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 20 Other Ohio appellate districts have held that permitting illegal drugs to be in the presence of children is sufficient to constitute a violation of R.C. 2919.22(A). State v. Ray, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24536, 2012-Ohio-840, ¶ 16; State v. Thompson, 3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-17-26, 2018-Ohio-637, ¶ 95; see also State v. Norris, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 14CA010699, 2015-Ohio-5180, ¶ 17. Moreover, this court has previously explained that dealing drugs is, itself, ""inherently dangerous."" State v. Workman, 12th Dist. Clermont Nos. CA2016-10-065 and CA2016-10-066, 2017-Ohio-2802, ¶ 24.

¶ 21 In State v. Ray, supra, the Second District Court of Appeals considered a case with similar facts to the case sub judice. In that case, the defendant and her boyfriend brought the defendant's five-year-old child along with them when they went to purchase heroin. The child was present when police arrested the defendant and found heroin on the
codefendant and drug paraphernalia in the defendant's house. Ray at ¶ 16. Even though police apprehended the defendant after the sale, the Ray court held there was ""legally sufficient evidence to support a child-endangering conviction based on [the defendant's] act of transporting her child to a drug buy especially when the occupants of the vehicle return with the drugs in their possession."" Id.

{¶ 22} In this case, the second detective and the confidential informant testified that they saw appellant with an infant child at the time the drug sale was made. Moreover, the first detective testified that he knew the child was present with appellant. The informant testified that appellant produced the methamphetamine from a bag located in the passenger compartment. This would obviously be near the child's position in the rear seat of the vehicle. Whether appellant possessed more drugs in the vehicle after the sale is irrelevant because the evidence shows that appellant permitted a child under his control to be in close proximity to methamphetamine. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements beyond a reasonable doubt.

{¶ 23} Turning to the manifest weight challenge, the facts are such that we do not find the jury clearly lost its way. While it is true that law enforcement did not act immediately to arrest appellant and that the child may have been adequately restrained in a child safety seat, these facts do not weigh against the conviction. Appellant permitted illegal and dangerous drugs to be near a child under his control. This again is not a case where the evidence weighs in favor of acquittal and the jury's verdict created a manifest miscarriage of justice.

{¶ 24} Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant for each offense and these convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Appellant's first assignment of error is overruled.

{¶ 25} Assignment of Error No. 2:
{¶ 26} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT GRANT THE APPELLANT A NEW TRIAL BASED UPON JUROR MISCONDUCT.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
937-Shaner,No. The text above describes an assignment of error alleging that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied a motion for a new trial because the court improperly decided no juror misconduct occurred. The error is not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 27} In his second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a new trial because the court improperly decided no juror misconduct occurred.

{¶ 28} The decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial pursuant to Crim.R. 33 is within the discretion of the trial court. State v. Brakeall, 12th Dist. Fayette Nos. CA2008-06-022 and CA2008-06-023, 2009-Ohio-3542, ¶ 9. An appellate court reviews the trial court's decision for an abuse of discretion. State v. Carroll, 12th Dist. Clermont Nos. CA2007-02-030 and CA2007-03-041, 2007-Ohio-7075, ¶ 64. A motion for new trial must be made within fourteen days of the jury's verdict. Crim.R. 33(B). Appellant's counsel filed a motion for new trial on June 25, 2018 which suggested prosecutorial misconduct, not juror misconduct. Appellant's motion was denied July 26, 2018. There was no formal motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct made within fourteen days of the jury's verdict and in any event, there were no supporting affidavits provided as required by Crim.R. 33(C). However, because the state does not assert these reasons for supporting the trial court's denial of a new trial, we will address the merits of appellant's argument.

{¶ 29} In criminal trials, the accused has the constitutional right to be tried before a fair and impartial jury. State v. Villarreal, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2004-02-035, 2005-Ohio-1924, ¶ 37, citing Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444 (1968) and Article I, Section 10, Ohio Constitution. This means a ""jury must decide a case solely on the evidence before it, and not reach its verdict based upon influences outside the courtroom."" Villarreal at ¶ 37. A deviation from this standard constitutes juror misconduct. State v. Taylor, 73 Ohio App.3d 827, 831 (4th Dist.1991). The determination of juror misconduct requires a two-part analysis. Id. at 833. First, the court must determine if juror misconduct occurred. Id. Second, the
court must determine whether the misconduct materially prejudiced the defendant's substantial rights. *Id.*

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
937-Shaner,No. The error is not alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The allegation is against the juror for using outside information to influence the verdict.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 30} In this case, appellant argues that one of the jurors used outside information by suggesting the possibility that the juror used the clerk of court's website to look up appellant's criminal history to find appellant guilty. The trial court held a hearing on the matter in which appellant's former trial counsel and the juror testified. The juror testified that she rode in the elevator with appellant's former counsel and briefly chatted with the attorney before exiting the elevator. The juror acknowledged that the attorney had remarked about the speed of the guilty verdict, but the juror testified that she only mentioned that people were sick of drugs in response to the statement. The juror denied accessing any court records or otherwise being influenced by outside information.

{¶ 31} Next, appellant's former counsel testified that after the trial she rode the elevator with the juror. During the ride she engaged in a conversation with the juror about the quickness with which the jury arrived at the guilty verdict. According to the former counsel, the juror told her the reason they convicted appellant was because appellant had ""done it before."" However, the attorney later admitted that the juror in the elevator did not expressly tell her that she looked up appellant's prior record.

{¶ 32} As part of its reason for denying the motion for a new trial, the trial court found there was no credible evidence that juror misconduct occurred. This court agrees. Appellant's argument suggesting juror misconduct is unsupported and premised upon inferences from mere possibilities, not established facts. The trial court was in the best position to determine credibility of the witnesses. Since no misconduct occurred, appellant

---

1. We note the aliunde rule, Evid.R. 606(B), is not implicated herein. Neither party raised the rule's application and the juror's testimony was not offered to impeach the jury's verdict, but rather to give clarification and context to the conversation that took place as previously reported by appellant's former trial counsel.
cannot show prejudice. Consequently, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it
denied appellant's motion for a new trial. Accordingly, appellant's second assignment of error
is overruled.

¶ 33 Judgment affirmed.

---------------------
MARY J. BOYLE, A.J.:

{¶ 1} Defendant-appellant, Henry Jordan, appeals the trial court’s denial of his petition for postconviction relief. He raises six assignments of error for our review.
1. It was a violation of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution and the Ohio Revised Code for the trial court or his agent to communicate ex parte with the prosecutor concerning the findings of facts and conclusions of law and for the prosecutor to write verbatim the [findings of fact and conclusions of law].

2. The trial Judge in [postconviction] was biased or “probably biased” which violated appellant’s right to a neutral and detached magistrate and Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.

3. Defense counsel was ineffective under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution when he failed to conduct an adequate investigation that prejudiced his client’s defense at trial.

4. Mr. Jordan’s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution and Article I section 10 of the Ohio Constitution were violated when Brady evidence was not disclosed to the defense as evidenced by the [postconviction] exhibits.

5. Mr. Jordan is actually innocent and his convictions and sentence violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.

6. The cumulative effect of the errors presented demonstrate Mr. Jordan was denied Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.

Finding no merit to his arguments, we affirm.

I. Procedural History and Factual Background

In January 2017, Jordan was convicted after a bench trial of two counts of rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), one count of aggravated burglary under R.C. 2911.11(A)(1), and one count of kidnapping under R.C. 2905.01(A)(4). The trial court sentenced Jordan to seven years in prison on each count and ordered them to be served concurrent to each other. The trial court notified Jordan that he would be
subject to a mandatory period of five years of postrelease control upon his release from prison and that he would be classified as a Tier II sex offender.

¶ 4 Jordan appealed his convictions to this court, raising five assignments of error. We overruled his assigned errors, upheld his convictions, and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. See State v. Jordan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108.

¶ 5 In Jordan, this court set forth the facts as follows at ¶ 8-25:

Answer:"
095-Jordan,No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It is a narrative of the testimony given by witnesses in a trial. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
[T]he first witness to testify was M.S.’s daughter C.M., who was five years old at the time of the incident and nine years old at the time of trial. C.M. testified that on the night of December 23, 2012, her mom M.S. was getting her and her younger brother ready for bed when someone knocked on their door. M.S. went to see who was at the door, and C.M. heard her mother scream and yell for help. C.M. went into the living room and saw “stuff, broken stuff all over the floor.” M.S. was naked and on the floor, and a man was there with “his pants down halfway.” *** He was on top of her and she was on the bottom.” C.M. testified that she did not know who this man was and she had never seen him before. M.S. “had scratches all over her body,” and she was crying.

M.S. told C.M. to get her phone. C.M. called her aunt and said that “a bad guy was there.” C.M.’s aunt, who lived down the street, came to M.S.’s house and called 911. The police arrived shortly after. C.M. could not make an in-court identification of the man she saw that day, testifying, “I don’t remember how his face looked.” Asked if she had ever seen Jordan before, C.M. stated, “No.” Asked if her mom had a boyfriend, C.M. replied, “No.” Asked if she knew “a guy named Marcus Ladson,” C.M. answered, “I don’t remember him.”

M.S. testified that in 2012, she was living with her two children and her fiancé Marcus Ladson. She had met Jordan that summer while walking down the street. M.S. and Jordan exchanged phone numbers and had a consensual sexual relationship. On December 23, 2012, when M.S. was putting her kids to bed, she heard a knock on the door. She opened the door but did not see anyone there, although she saw a silver car parked outside. All of a sudden, Jordan “rushed in” to her house smelling of liquor. M.S. testified about what happened next:
Once he — once he came in, he had, like, my neck, and, you know, forced me, like, on the floor where — I had my son’s bed, like a — toddler bed. I was, like, on the floor, like, towards the TV and he had me, like, towards my stomach, like I was down on my stomach, and, you know, forced me — * * * he rushed into the door, like, having — you know, from behind my neck and, you know, I was on the floor and all I remember is I was on my stomach and his pants was down. * * * My stomach was, like — I was, like, facing down on my stomach and he was on top of me.

M.S. testified that Jordan “shoved” her to the floor “and his pants was down and his penis was in my vagina.” M.S. was crying and screaming. M.S. testified that she thought Jordan used a condom because she saw “a wrapper on the floor.” Jordan then turned her around and put his penis in her mouth. “His stuff, you know, was in. I guess he was — had used a condom, but his stuff was in my mouth. * * * He just had my neck and grabbed his penis and put it in my mouth[.] I was coughing. I was gagging. I was throwing up.”

Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The text describes the actions of the police officers and detectives involved in the case, but it does not mention any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
M.S. testified that she could not physically get up and leave. M.S. tried to get Jordan to stop by throwing a lamp at him. M.S. does not remember Jordan leaving, but she recalls her daughter C.M. and her son standing in the doorway as she was crying and screaming.

All I know is my daughter was — my daughter and my son was, like, standing there. My daughter, she had got — somehow she got to my phone. She found my phone and she had called her auntie, whether — she didn’t know — it was just whoever she called first and realized it was her auntie and her auntie came down because she lived down the street from me and her auntie came, which is Alexis, she had came. She called the police.

M.S. testified that when the nurse at the hospital and the police interviewed her, she told them that she did not know who did this to her, although she “tried to say his name, * * * Harry or Henry” and allegedly described him as being bald. M.S. also testified that she told the police her attacker had tattoos. “I was scared and I thought that, you know, nobody would believe me, you know, and that actually that he actually had done it and had hurt me, you know, but I admit that I do know him.” M.S. testified that she never saw or talked to Jordan again after the night of the assault. However, on cross examination M.S. testified inconsistently about whether her relationship with Jordan continued after December 23, 2012.
M.S. testified that in 2015, a detective contacted her about a “DNA hit from a case from 2012.” The police showed M.S. a photographic lineup, and she picked out Jordan as “the one that came into my house” and raped her on December 23, 2012.

Former Cleveland police detective Andrew Harasimchuk testified that on December 27, 2012, he interviewed M.S. concerning her allegations of rape. M.S. indicated that she had a consensual sexual partner at the time, Marcus Ladson. Det. Harasimchuk had Ladson come to the station to give the police “an elimination standard swab” of his DNA. This sample was sent to the DNA lab so Ladson’s DNA “can be eliminated from the sexual assault kit.” The results of M.S.’s rape kit showed one swab from M.S.’s neck that contained “unknown DNA.”

There was no testimony from Det. Harasimchuk about a condom, the name “Harry or Henry,” or M.S.’s assailant being bald or having tattoos. By May 2013, the police were unable to develop a suspect from this information, and the case went cold.

Cleveland police officer Timothy McGinty testified that he responded to a sexual assault call at M.S.’s house on December 23, 2012. Officer McGinty testified that the front door jamb was pushed out, indicating forced entry, and there was “some kind of lamp globe that’s broken on the floor.” Officer McGinty testified that M.S. was “very upset,” and he requested EMS transport her to the hospital. Furthermore, Officer McGinty testified that he went back to M.S.’s house after accompanying her to the hospital to look for a fingernail that M.S. stated broke off during the attack.

Q: Okay. And included in your work was a visit to Fairview Hospital and then a return visit to the house to look for a fingernail?

A: Correct.

Q: *** Did you look for a condom wrapper while you were at the scene of the house?

A: We looked for any kind of evidence.

Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It provides a detailed account of a sexual assault case involving a woman named M.S. and her examination by a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE nurse) named Meredith Molnar. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor, the trial court, or the defense attorney.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Q: Were you ever told about a condom wrapper?

A: No.

Meredith Molnar testified that, in 2012, she was working as a sexual assault nurse examiner (“SANE nurse”) at Fairview Hospital. On
December 23, 2012, she examined M.S. for a sexual assault. Molnar testified that she asked M.S. what happened and M.S. reported to her that the following occurred:

Me and my fiancé and my kids were chilling in my house watching TV and my fiancé was getting ready to go to the bus for work and I was getting my kids ready for bed around 9 p.m. I went to the hallway to get clothes and into the kitchen to get food for dinner and into the bathroom to wash [C.M.] up. She was in the tub. I told her to give me a few minutes to get dinner ready and she said okay.

Then I went into the hallway and I heard someone banging really loud on the front door. I waited in the hallway and someone was banging again on the front door, so I went to go see who it was through the curtain on the door and the man bum-rushed the door somehow. The door hit me on my head and I stumbled back and he got past me in the hallway in the house, and I heard my daughter yell out for me, and I think it scared him or something and he started choking me from behind with one of his arms and my mouth started foaming and I think I passed out. I woke up because my daughter was hitting my legs above my knees yelling at me to get up. I woke up and I didn’t see him and my shorts were messed up and down to my thighs. My shirt was still on. I panicked and all I could do is cry.

My daughter called her auntie, who lived down the street, and she came over and called 911.

Molnar testified that M.S. assumed she was penetrated vaginally, because her pants were down, “but she was unsure if a penis or fingers were penetrating her vagina.” Furthermore, M.S. indicated “that she thinks she remembers performing oral sex” on the offender. Based on these allegations, Molnar took swabs of M.S.’s vaginal and oral cavities, as well as other areas of her body, including a “dried stain” of M.S.’s neck “because she stated [she] was being choked by the assailant with one arm.” Molnar explained that for a dried stain, “we will dip sterile swabs in sterile water and swab that area for possible DNA.”

Molnar also took pictures of M.S.’s neck, on which was a “linear superficial laceration.” M.S. had additional “fresh” bruising on her chin, upper back, left arm, wrist, and hand, and both knees. Molnar testified that M.S. was “very emotional, crying, shaking, talking very quickly.” According to Molnar, M.S. indicated to her that Ladson left the house prior to the incident occurring. Nothing in Molnar’s testimony or M.S.’s medical records indicated a description of M.S.’s
attacker, including whether he was bald or had tattoos. There is also no mention of the name “Harry or Henry”; rather, M.S.’s medical records indicated that the attacker was a “stranger.” Additionally, a checklist that is part of M.S.’s medical records asked if a condom was used at the time of the assault, and the box checked is “Unsure.”

Answer:"
095-Jordan,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is not directed at the prosecutor but rather at the trial court's denial of Jordan's petition for postconviction relief.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Hristina Lekova is a DNA analyst at the Cuyahoga County Regional Forensic Science Laboratory, and she processed M.S.’s rape kit in January 2013. According to Lekova, “Marcus Ladson’s DNA is present in the sperm fraction of the anal swab and the cutting from the crotch area of the underpants. It’s also in the sperm fraction of the vaginal swab ***. He’s also part of the mixture in the dried stain on the neck *** as well as the fingernail scrapings.”

No “seminal fluid” was found in M.S.’s oral swab. An enzyme consistent with vaginal fluid or saliva was found in M.S.’s oral swab, although Lekova did not reach a conclusion regarding the oral swab, other than the enzyme “did not come from the seminal material.” The state asked Lekova, “if somebody was wearing a condom and put a condom in a victim mouth and had vaginal fluid on that condom, would that be consistent with your findings?” Lekova answered, “Yes, that’s possible for that vaginal fluid to be transferred in the mouth cavity.”

Other than Ladson’s and M.S.’s DNA, an unknown DNA profile was found on the “dried stain” swab taken from M.S.’s neck. This unknown DNA profile was uploaded to the CODIS database, and the case went cold.

Lekova’s involvement in this case resumed in December 2015, when she was given a reference swab of Jordan’s DNA that was submitted in another case. Lekova testified that “Jordan could not be excluded as a possible contributor to the DNA mixture obtained from *** the dried stain” found on M.S.’s neck. According to Lekova, the material of the dried stain, i.e., what kind of bodily fluid, was unknown. Asked if Jordan’s DNA was found in M.S.’s vaginal swab, Lekova replied, “There is no Mr. Jordan in the vaginal swab.” Lekova further explained that if an offender uses a condom, she would not expect to find his DNA in the victim’s vaginal swab.

Cleveland police detective Karl Lessman testified that he works in the CODIS Task Force of the Sex Crimes Unit. In October 2015, he received information from the coroner’s office identifying Jordan as “a hit” in M.S.’s cold case. Det. Lessman compiled a photo array and, along with former Det. Harasimchuk, went to M.S.’s house to see if she could
identify her attacker. M.S. picked Jordan’s photo out of the lineup. Det. Lessman located Jordan and took a bucal swab from him, which was sent to the DNA lab. Jordan’s DNA was identified as a match with the DNA found on the dried stain on M.S.’s neck.

¶ 6 In January 2019, Jordan filed a petition for postconviction relief, which the trial court denied on March 22, 2019. While the trial court initially denied Jordan’s requests for findings of fact and conclusions of law, it ultimately issued them in December 2019, after Jordan filed a writ of mandamus in the Ohio Supreme Court. It is from this judgment that Jordan now appeals.

II. Petition for Postconviction Relief

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text above does not describe an assignment of error. It provides information about the process and requirements for filing a postconviction petition under Ohio law, including the grounds for relief, the role of the trial court, and the review process. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor in the provided text.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 7 R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) permits a petitioner who claims “that there was such a denial or infringement of the person’s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States” to petition “the court to vacate or set aside the judgment or sentence or to grant other appropriate relief.” Petitioners must state all grounds for relief on which they rely, and they waive all other grounds not set forth in the petition. R.C. 2953.21(A)(4). In determining whether substantive grounds for relief exist, the trial court must consider, among other things, the petition, the supporting affidavits, and the documentary evidence filed in support of the petition. R.C. 2953.21(C).

¶ 8 A postconviction proceeding is not an appeal of a criminal conviction, but, rather, a collateral civil attack on the judgment. State v. Steffen, 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410, 639 N.E.2d 67 (1994). “It is a means to reach constitutional issues which would otherwise be impossible to reach because the evidence supporting those
issues is not contained in the record.” *State v. Murphy*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 00AP-233, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 6129, 5 (Dec. 26, 2000).

¶ 9 A postconviction petition, however, does not provide a petitioner a second opportunity to litigate the conviction. *State v. Hessler*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 01 AP-1011, 2002-Ohio-3321, ¶ 32. Therefore, a petition for postconviction relief is not the proper vehicle to raise issues that were or could have been determined on direct appeal. *State v. Perry*, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph seven of the syllabus.

¶ 10 A criminal defendant seeking to challenge his conviction through a petition for postconviction relief is not automatically entitled to a hearing. R.C. 2953.21; *State v. Calhoun*, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 282, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999). According to R.C. 2953.21(C), a petitioner is entitled to a hearing when, upon review of the petition and the record, the trial court finds that there are “substantive grounds for relief.” In making such a determination, the trial court must consider the petition and supporting affidavits as well as all of the files and records pertaining to the proceedings against the petitioner. R.C. 2953.21(C). A trial court’s decision to deny a postconviction petition without a hearing is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard. *State v. Gondor*, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, ¶ 45; *State v. Abdussatar*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92439, 2009-Ohio-5232, ¶ 15.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The error is not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it is alleging misconduct by the trial court for having ex parte communications with the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 11 The trial court does not abuse its discretion in dismissing a petition for postconviction relief without a hearing where (1) the petitioner fails to set out
sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, or (2) the operation of res judicata prohibits the claims advanced in the petition. *Id.* The evidence submitted with the petition must be competent, relevant, and material and not merely cumulative of or alternative to evidence presented at trial. *State v. Combs*, 100 Ohio App.3d 90, 97-98, 652 N.E.2d 205 (1st Dist.1994).

**III. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law**

12 In his first assignment of error, Jordan argues that his due process rights were violated when the trial court had an ex parte communication with the state “concerning the findings of fact[] and conclusions of law” and because the trial court adopted the state’s proposed findings and conclusions verbatim. In his second assignment of error, he argues that “[t]he odor of bias” against him was “overwhelming” because the trial court “improperly conduct[ed] ex parte communications with the prosecutor.” We will address these assignments of error together because they are interrelated.

13 When a trial court denies a postconviction relief petition, R.C. 2953.21(H) requires the trial court to make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law. The purpose of requiring findings of fact and conclusions of law is to apprise the petitioner of the basis for the court’s disposition and to facilitate meaningful appellate review. *State ex rel. Carrion v. Harris*, 40 Ohio St.3d 19, 19, 530 N.E.2d 1330 (1988).
In *State v. Maxwell*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107758, 2020-Ohio-3027, a case involving a trial court’s denial of a postconviction petition, this court recently explained:

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it discusses Jordan's unsupported assumption that the judge or the judge's counsel communicated ex parte with the prosecutor to prepare the findings of fact and conclusions of law. The text also clarifies that there is no evidence of such ex parte communication.","Context information is below.
---------------------
When a party’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law are accurate in law and in fact, nothing prohibits a trial court from adopting that party’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a postconviction proceeding. *State v. Williams*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 85180, 2005-Ohio-3023, ¶ 35, citing *State v. Combs*, 100 Ohio App.3d 90, 652 N.E.2d 205 (1st Dist.1994). “In the absence of demonstrated prejudice, it is not erroneous for the trial court to adopt, in verbatim form, findings of fact and conclusions of law which are submitted by the state.” *State v. Thomas*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87666, 2006-Ohio-6588, ¶ 15, citing *State v. Powell*, 90 Ohio App.3d 260, 263, 629 N.E.2d 13 (1st Dist.1993). Moreover, a trial court may adopt verbatim a party’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law as its own if it has thoroughly read the document to ensure that it is completely accurate in fact and law. *State v. Jester*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 83520, 2004-Ohio-3611, ¶ 16; see also *Thomas* at id.

*Id.* at ¶ 13.

There is nothing in the record in this case that establishes the trial court had an ex parte communication with the state at any point. Jordan makes assumptions based upon how quickly the state filed findings of fact and conclusions of law and how quickly the trial court adopted them verbatim. Jordan questions “how * * * the [s]tate [knew] to file such proposed findings.” Jordan makes an unsupported assumption that “[e]vidently, the [j]udge or the [j]udge’s counsel (his agent) told the prosecutor handling the [postconviction] [p]etition to prepare [findings of fact and conclusions of law] ex parte.” In support of his assumption, he points out that “[a] lot of activity took place on this [p]etition in the 48 hours
between December 17 – 19, 2019, after months of inactivity.” But Jordan fails to acknowledge that the Ohio Supreme Court’s docket is public for anyone to view.

{¶ 16} Jordan further argues that a “trial court cannot delegate its deliberative process,” and the trial court here did so when it used the state’s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Jordan cites to State v. Roberts, 110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168, and State v. Pickens, 2016-Ohio-5257, 60 N.E.3d 20 (1st Dist.), claiming his case “fits squarely in the analysis” of these cases. However, both Roberts and Pickens involved the trial court’s ex parte communications with the state in rendering its judicial opinions, and there is simply no evidence of that here.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 17} Roberts is further distinguishable because it involved a trial court “directly involv[ing] the prosecutor in preparing the sentencing opinion” in a death-penalty case, which the Ohio Supreme Court stated is not permitted. Id. at ¶ 159. Pickens is also distinguishable because the prosecutor in the case did not file the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and did not serve them on the defendant. Id. at ¶ 9. Here, the prosecutor both filed her proposed findings and conclusions and served a copy on Jordan’s counsel the same day that she filed them. Accordingly, we disagree with Jordan that this case falls “squarely in the analysis” of Roberts and Pickens.

{¶ 18} Further, we find no merit to Jordan’s second assignment of error that the trial court was biased against him due to ex parte communications occurring between the judge and the state. We further note that Jordan had every opportunity
along the way, from May until December, to file his own proposed findings and conclusions of law, and he did not do so.

¶ 19 Thus, we overrule Jordan’s first and second assignments of error.

IV. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel

¶ 20 In his third assignment of error, Jordan argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately investigate his case, violating his constitutional rights.

¶ 21 The trial court found that Jordan’s claim for ineffective assistance of counsel is barred by res judicata because he raised the same issue in his direct appeal. Additionally, the trial court addressed the merits of Jordan’s claim and found it to be meritless.

A. Res Judicata

¶ 22 Under the doctrine of res judicata, “a valid, final judgment rendered upon the merits bars all subsequent actions based upon any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that was the subject matter of the previous action.” State v. Patrick, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99418, 2013-Ohio-5020, ¶ 7, citing Grava v. Parkman Twp., 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 382, 653 N.E.2d 226 (1995). To overcome the res judicata bar, the petitioner must show, using extrinsic evidence, that he or she could not have appealed the original constitutional claim based on the information in the original trial record. Combs, 100 Ohio App.3d at 97-98, 652 N.E.2d 205. Said another way, issues properly raised in a petition for postconviction relief are only those that could not have been raised on direct appeal because the evidence
supporting such issues is outside the record. *State v. Milanovich*, 42 Ohio St.2d 46, 50, 325 N.E.2d 540 (1975). Thus, a trial court may dismiss a petition based on res judicata if an issue was or should have been raised on direct appeal. *State v. Dowell*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 86232, 2006-Ohio-110, ¶ 10, citing *Perry*, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph seven of the syllabus.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the defense attorney's performance, specifically the allegation that the trial counsel was ineffective for not investigating and pursuing the theory that Ladson was the man who raped M.S.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Extrinsic evidence attached to the petition, however, does not automatically defeat the res judicata bar. Rather, evidence outside the record must meet “some threshold standard of cogency; otherwise it would be too easy to defeat the holding of *Perry* by simply attaching as exhibits evidence which is only marginally significant and does not advance the petitioner’s claim[.]” *State v. Lawson*, 103 Ohio App.3d 307, 315, 659 N.E.2d 362 (12th Dist.1995), quoting *State v. Coleman*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-900811, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 1485, 21 (Mar. 17, 1993). Moreover, the evidence dehors the record must not be evidence that was in existence and available for use at the time of trial and that could and should have been submitted at trial if the defendant wished to use it. *Dowell* at ¶ 10.

In his direct appeal, Jordan argued that

his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to investigate and pursue the theory that Ladson was the man who raped M.S. Jordan alleges that counsel should have cross examined witnesses about Ladson and presented “evidence in the public record concerning” Ladson, including Ladson’s 2015 and 2016 convictions for murder and other gang-related violent felonies, which resulted in a sentence of life in prison.

*Jordan*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106272, 2018-Ohio-4108, at ¶ 42.
The state argued that trial counsel was not ineffective because trial counsel’s decision was a strategic decision and that Jordan was not prejudiced because it was only speculation that the outcome of trial would have been different had trial counsel investigated Ladson. *Id.* at ¶ 42. We agreed. *Id.* at ¶ 43-44. We pointed out that the victim had “consistently maintained that her sexual activity with Ladson was consensual.” *Id.* at ¶ 43. We rejected Jordan’s argument, finding that Jordan failed to show that his trial counsel’s performance was deficient, and that he was prejudiced. *Id.* at ¶ 44.

In his direct appeal, Jordan had asked this court to take judicial notice of four exhibits that the state used in Ladson’s murder trial, including three pictures of Ladson showing his tattoos and one expert report from a detective in the Cleveland Police Department’s Gang Impact Unit concluding that Ladson was a member of the criminal gang the Heartless Felons. We declined to do so. *Id.* at ¶ 7. Jordan attached those exhibits to his petition for postconviction relief as well as an affidavit from his trial counsel.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error related to Jordan's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, not misconduct by the prosecutor. The allegation is against Jordan's trial counsel, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Jordan’s trial counsel averred that he “did not employ an investigator and did not otherwise discover any photographs of the victim’s [fiancé] or any reports about him being a Heartless Felon gang member.” Trial counsel further stated that he “was aware that the [fiancé] was serving a prison sentence at the time” of Jordan’s trial and that if counsel had “had the photographs of the [fiancé] and the report of him being a member of the Heartless Felons gang then [he] would have used them to [Jordan’s] benefit at his trial.” Thus, although the exhibits were
available at the time of Jordan’s trial, his trial counsel stated in the affidavit attached to Jordan’s petition for postconviction relief that he did not investigate the matter or discover the exhibits. That is the basis of Jordan’s claim now.

{¶ 28} When a postconviction claim depends for its resolution upon outside evidence, a common pleas court may not apply res judicata to dismiss the claim. Perry at paragraph nine of the syllabus. But a reviewing court may sustain the claim’s dismissal on other grounds. State v. Peagler, 76 Ohio St.3d 496, 668 N.E.2d 489 (1996), paragraph one of the syllabus. After review, we do not agree with the trial court that Jordan’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim was barred by res judicata. We will therefore address the merits of Jordan’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which the trial court did as well.

B. Merits of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim

{¶ 29} To succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance, a defendant must establish that counsel’s performance was deficient and that the defendant was prejudiced by the deficient performance. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Counsel will only be considered deficient if his or her conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Id. at 688. Further, a defendant must show that he or she was prejudiced by counsel’s ineffectiveness. Id. at 694.

{¶ 30} When reviewing counsel’s performance, this court must be highly deferential and “must indulge a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.” Id. at 689. To
establish resulting prejudice, a “defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” *Id.* at 694. “A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” *Id.*

The text also refutes Jordan's claims about the evidence presented at trial regarding the victim's statements about her attacker's tattoos and the presence of Ladson during the attack.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 31 Jordan contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failure to adequately investigate Ladson and the fact that Ladson had tattoos. However, Jordan’s entire argument that his trial counsel was ineffective is based on his assertion is that the SANE nurse’s notes “state clearly” that the victim told her “shortly after the attack that her fiancé [Ladson] was home during the attack” and that her attacker had tattoos that “cover his body.” Jordan further claims that the victim “told the authorities the attacker had tattoos including neck/facial tattoos.” Jordan claims that the exhibits attached to his petition establish that Ladson had tattoos all over his body and was a member of the Heartless Felons. Jordan maintains these exhibits would have changed the outcome of his case because he does not have tattoos on his neck or face, his DNA was not found on the victim’s vaginal or anal swabs, and Ladson’s DNA was found on both of the victim’s swabs. He contends that this “case presents itself completely differently after the exhibits and facts contained in the exhibits submitted in postconviction are considered.” We disagree.

¶ 32 Throughout his petition and appellate brief, Jordan repeats that the evidence presented at trial established that the victim told the SANE nurse that her fiancé was home during the attack and that her attacker had tattoos all over his body.
These claims are simply not true. Nor is it true that the evidence presented at trial established that the victim told police that her attacker had tattoos on his face or neck.

¶ 33 In Jordan, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, we stated that according to the SANE nurse’s notes discussing the victim’s narrative of what occurred, the victim told the SANE nurse that on the evening of December 23, 2012, she and her fiancé and children were “chilling in [her] house watching TV and [her] fiancé was getting ready to go to the bus for work and [she] was getting her kids ready for bed around 9 pm.” Id. at ¶ 18. The victim continued to describe what occurred after that without specifically stating that her fiancé left to go to work at some point before the attack. But we explained that “[a]ccording to [the SANE nurse], M.S. indicated to her that [her fiancé] left the house prior to the incident occurring.” Id. at ¶ 20. And we pointed out in Jordan’s direct appeal that “[t]here is nothing in the medical records, SANE nurse’s testimony, or the police officer’s testimony indicating that M.S. told anyone that her attacker * * * was bald, or that he had tattoos.” Id. at ¶ 38. Finally, we stated that the SANE nurse’s notes and M.S.’s medical records were introduced into evidence, although we acknowledged that no police reports were made part of the record. Id. at ¶ 37.

Answer:"
095-Jordan,"Yes, the error is alleging that the prosecutor (the state) committed misconduct. The allegation is that the prosecutor failed to disclose Brady material, specifically photos of Ladson's tattoos and a gang report showing that Ladson was a member of the Heartless Felons.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 34 Even if we assume for the sake of argument now that Jordan’s trial counsel should have investigated Ladson further, Jordan has not established that he was prejudiced by such a purported deficient performance. As we found in Jordan’s direct appeal, the victim consistently maintained that she had consensual sex only
with Ladson. Moreover, Jordan fails to account for the fact that the victim’s daughter, who was five years old at the time of the rape and nine years old at the time of trial, testified that she had never before seen the man whose pants were “down halfway” and was “on top” of her mother. At the time of the rape, Ladson was the victim’s fiancé and thus, the victim’s daughter would have known him at the time of the attack (although she did not remember Ladson at the time of trial four years later). And most importantly, Jordan’s theory that the victim told the nurse that her fiancé was home at the time of the rape and that her attacker had tattoos, and that she told police that her attacker had tattoos, is not supported by the evidence. Although the victim did testify that she thought she told police that her attacker had tattoos, even Jordan acknowledges that what she told police and the SANE nurse immediately following the attack (which was over four years earlier) would be more credible, and she did not mention tattoos to the nurse or police. Thus, the exhibits that Jordan attached to his petition showing Ladson’s tattoos and that he was a member of the Heartless Felons, do not establish “a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.

Accordingly, we overrule Jordan’s third assignment of error.

V. Brady Violation

In his fourth assignment of error, Jordan maintains that his due process rights were violated when the state failed to disclose Brady material to him. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). In his
direct appeal, Jordan argued that the prosecutors committed misconduct when they “failed to turn over to the defense information regarding Ladson’s gang and criminal activity.” *Jordan*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, ¶ 46. In his petition for postconviction relief, he argues that the state should have disclosed the photos of Ladson evidencing his tattoos and the gang report showing that Ladson was a member of the Heartless Felons. According to Jordan, the same prosecutor who tried his case also tried Ladson’s murder case and admitted these exhibits in Ladson’s criminal cases.

¶ 37 The trial court found that Jordan’s *Brady* claim was barred by res judicata and was meritless. After review, we agree with the trial court that Jordan’s claim regarding Ladson’s criminal activity is barred by res judicata. Although the documents establishing Ladson’s criminal gang activity were not before this court in Jordan’s direct appeal, Jordan still argued that the prosecutor should have turned them over to defense counsel. We fully addressed this argument and therefore find that Jordan cannot now raise it in his postconviction petition. We will, however, address Jordan’s claim with respect to the photo exhibits attached to his petition showing that Ladson has tattoos all over his body.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
095-Jordan,No. The text describes an assignment of error where Jordan alleges that the prosecutor (the state) did not disclose evidence that was not wholly within their control. The allegation is not about misconduct by the trial court or defense attorney.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 38 As we explained in *Jordan*, “*Brady* stands for the proposition that ‘the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.’” *Jordan*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106273, 2018-Ohio-4108, ¶ 46, quoting *Brady* at 87. See
also Crim.R. 16(B)(5). We further stated in Jordan that “Brady does not apply to materials that are not wholly within the control of the prosecution. There is no need to require the state to “disclose” material that is readily available to the defense.” Id. at ¶ 47, quoting State v. McGuire, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105732, 2018-Ohio-1390, ¶ 24.

¶ 39 Ladson was convicted of murder in June 2016. Jordan’s trial was not until January 2017. The photo exhibits of Ladson’s tattoos were not ones that were wholly within the state’s control because they were part of the public record in Ladson’s criminal trial where the state proved that Ladson was a member of the Heartless Felons and had tattoos on his body indicative of membership in the gang. Therefore, the state was not required to disclose these photos to Jordan.

¶ 40 Moreover, as we explained in the previous assignment of error, the exhibits that Jordan attached to his petition for postconviction relief showing Ladson was “covered” in tattoos, had been convicted of murder, and was a member of the Heartless Felons is not material or exculpatory.

¶ 41 Accordingly, Jordan’s fourth assignment of error is overruled.

VI. Actual Innocence

¶ 42 In his fifth assignment of error, Jordan argues that he is “actually innocent” of the acts against the victim and asks this court to recognize this as a freestanding, cognizable claim.

¶ 43 The state contends that this claim fails under State v. Apanovitch, 155 Ohio St.3d 358, 2018-Ohio-4744, 121 N.E.3d 351. In his reply to this court, Jordan
counters that *Apanovitch* held no such thing. An in-depth review of *Apanovitch* is necessary.

¶ 44 In *Apanovitch*, the defendant was convicted of one count each of aggravated murder and aggravated burglary, and two counts of rape. He was sentenced to death in January 1985. The body of the victim was found in a bedroom of her home. She had been strangled and severely beaten, and sperm was found in her mouth and vagina.

Answer:"
095-Jordan,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the trial court's decision and the application of the law regarding postconviction DNA evidence.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 45 Apanovitch’s case before the Ohio Supreme Court involved his fourth postconviction petition based on newly discovered DNA evidence taken from the victim’s vagina. After a hearing, the trial court found that because Apanovitch’s DNA could not have contributed to the vaginal swab taken from the victim, that Apanovitch “presented clear and convincing evidence of his actual innocence of vaginal rape, and acquitted him of same.” *Id.* at ¶ 28. This court upheld the trial court’s findings. *State v. Apanovitch*, 2016-Ohio-2831, 64 N.E.3d 429, ¶ 46 (8th Dist.).

¶ 46 Apanovitch brought his fourth postconviction petition under R.C. 2953.23(A)(2), which states:

The petitioner was convicted of a felony, the petitioner is an offender for whom DNA testing was performed under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code or under former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code and analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence related to the inmate’s case as described in division (D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, and the results of the DNA testing establish, by clear and convincing evidence, actual innocence of that felony offense or, if the person was sentenced to death, establish, by clear and convincing evidence, actual
innocence of the aggravating circumstance or circumstances the person was found guilty of committing and that is or are the basis of that sentence of death.

As used in this division, “actual innocence” has the same meaning as in division (A)(1)(b) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code, and “former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code has the same meaning as in division (A)(1)(c) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code.

¶ 47 R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(b) defines “actual innocence.” It states:

“[A]ctual innocence” means that, had the results of the DNA testing conducted under sections 2953.71 to 2953.81 of the Revised Code or under former section 2953.82 of the Revised Code been presented at trial, and had those results been analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence related to the person’s case as described in division (D) of section 2953.74 of the Revised Code, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted, or, if the person was sentenced to death, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the aggravating circumstance or circumstances the petitioner was found guilty of committing and that is or are the basis of that sentence of death.

Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the petitioner's failure to meet the criteria for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1), specifically the requirement to show constitutional error at trial.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 48 Because Apanovitch’s petition for postconviction relief was an untimely and successive petition, it fell under R.C. 2953.23(A), which the Supreme Court explained is jurisdictional and only permits an inmate to file a petition “under specific, limited circumstances.” Apanovitch, 155 Ohio St.3d 358, 2018-Ohio-4744, 121 N.E.3d 351, ¶ 22. Under this provision, a petitioner must meet the criteria in either R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) or (2) before a trial court can consider the petition.

¶ 49 R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) provides that petitioner must show both of the following: (a) the petitioner was “unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts” upon which the petitioner relies or the petitioner is asserting a claim based on a new, retroactively applicable federal or state right recognized by the United States
Supreme Court after the petition became untimely and after the petitioner had filed earlier petitions, and (b) the petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty or eligible for the death sentence but for “constitutional error at trial.” R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a) and (b).

The second exception under R.C. 2953.23(A)(2) applies when the results of DNA testing establish by clear and convincing evidence the petitioner’s “actual innocence” of a felony offense of which the petitioner was convicted or of an aggravating circumstance that is the basis of a death sentence. Because this subsection is not relevant to our present analysis, we will not discuss the Supreme Court’s analysis of this subsection here, except to note that the Supreme Court held that Apanovitch did not meet the requirements to file a petition for postconviction relief under this section. See id. at ¶ 27-34.

The Supreme Court further held that Apanovitch did not meet the jurisdictional criteria under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1). First, the Supreme Court determined that it did not need to determine if Apanovitch satisfied R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a), because he “clearly [had] not satisfied R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b), which require[d] him to show that his conviction resulted from ‘constitutional error at trial.’” Id. at ¶ 26. In arguing that he satisfied R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b), Apanovitch asserted only that he was actually innocent of rape. But the Supreme Court explained that “under the United States Constitution, an actual-innocence claim ‘is not itself a constitutional claim,’” and “therefore does not involve a ‘constitutional error at trial’ under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b).” Id., quoting Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S.
390, 404, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993). Because Apanovitch did not raise any other argument relating to a “constitutional error at trial,” the Supreme Court held that his petition did not qualify under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1).

095-Jordan,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 52} The Ohio Supreme Court held in Apanovitch that a claim for “actual innocence” does not amount to a “constitutional error at trial” for purposes of establishing R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b). In this case, however, we are not dealing with an untimely or successive petition under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b). Rather, we are addressing a timely and first petition for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a).

Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text above is not describing an assignment of error. It is discussing the legal precedent and case law regarding the claim for actual innocence under Ohio's postconviction relief statute (R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a)). The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor, the trial court, or the defense attorney.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 53} Nonetheless, Apanovitch is still instructive here. And after reviewing the relevant case law, we find that because a claim for actual innocence “is not itself a constitutional claim,” it does not set forth a cognizable claim under R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) either. Because Jordan’s petition does not involve DNA testing or a death sentence, the relevant portion of R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) permits a petitioner to file a petition asking a court to set aside or vacate his or conviction when the petitioner claims “that there was such a denial or infringement of the person’s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States.” Thus, a claim for actual innocence cannot meet the requirements of R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a) because it “is not itself” a constitutional claim. Ohio courts have held as much. See State v. Zich, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-15-1263, 2017-Ohio-414, ¶23, discretionary appeal not accepted, 151 Ohio St.3d 1425, 2017-Ohio-8371, 84 N.E.3d 1063 (“In light of the United States Supreme Court’s
decision in *Herrera*, we find no merit to appellant’s due process arguments regarding his claims of actual innocence.”); *State v. Watson*, 126 Ohio App.3d 316, 323, 710 N.E.2d 340 (12th Dist.1998) (“Since the United States Supreme Court has not recognized actual innocence as a constitutional right, we also refuse to judicially create such a constitutional right.”); *State v. Loza*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA96-10-214, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 4574 (Oct. 13, 1997) (“Courts have interpreted *Herrera* to stand for the proposition that a petitioner is not entitled to postconviction relief without a showing of a violation of rights that were constitutional in dimension, which occurred at the time that the petitioner was tried and convicted.”); *State v. Hunter*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-090569, 2012-Ohio-2859, ¶ 54 (an actual innocence claim does not demonstrate “a constitutional violation in the proceedings” that led to the petitioner’s conviction); *State v. Davis*, 5th Dist. Licking No. 2008-CA-16, 2008-Ohio-6841 (“The trial court did not err in dismissing appellant’s claim of actual innocence because his claim fails to raise ‘a denial or infringement of appellant’s rights under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States’ as required by R.C. 2953.21.”); *State v. Nash*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.

Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it discusses the petitioner's claims of prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel, and a denial of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, but it does not specifically allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
87635, 2006-Ohio-5925, ¶ 14 (“[T]rial court did not err in failing to consider the merits of this ‘actual innocence’ claim because the claim fails to raise ‘a denial or infringement of rights under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States’ as required by R.C. 2953.21.”); *State v. Hines*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 89848, 2008-Ohio-1927, ¶ 24, quoting *State v. Williams*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 85180, 2005-Ohio-3023, ¶ 31 (“[A] claim of actual innocence is not itself a
constitutional claim, nor does it constitute a substantive ground for postconviction relief.”

Moreover, R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23 address the phrase, “actual innocence,” throughout the text of the statutes. R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(b) defines “actual innocence” for purposes of postconviction petitions (which we previously set forth). Indeed, throughout the entirety of R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23, the General Assembly discusses “actual innocence,” but only in terms of DNA testing. Nowhere in R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23 do the statutes allow for a claim of “actual innocence” except with respect to DNA testing.

Jordan contends that he has “squarely raised a [d]ue-[p]rocess claim under both the Ohio and federal [c]onstitutions” in his petition for postconviction relief by asserting that he is actually innocent and maintaining that he established as much through the documents he attached to his petition. He asks this court to recognize his “freestanding actual innocence claim” that no other court in Ohio has previously recognized in a petition for postconviction relief. Again, “R.C. 2953.21(A) requires a petitioner for postconviction relief to allege a ‘denial or infringement’ of [the person’s] rights under the Ohio or United States Constitutions.” Thus, this requires petitioners to show that a procedural error occurred at trial such that their constitutional rights were violated. State v. Warmus, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99962, 2014-Ohio-928, ¶ 8 (discussing the petitioner’s claims of prosecutorial misconduct denying him a fair trial, ineffective assistance of counsel violating his Sixth Amendment rights, and a denial of his Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination). A claim of “actual innocence, however, involves a claim of factual innocence. As explained by the Iowa Supreme Court in *Dewberry v. State*, 941 N.W.2d 1 (Iowa 2019), regarding a “freestanding claim of actual innocence”:

Answer:"
095-Jordan,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it discusses the legal concept of actual innocence and the Supreme Court's approach to it, including the rarity of such claims and the standards for granting motions for new trial.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Our understanding of actual innocence is consistent with the United States Supreme Court’s approach to actual innocence. The Supreme Court has “not resolved whether a prisoner may be entitled to habeas relief based on a freestanding claim of actual innocence.” *McQuiggin v. Perkins*, 569 U.S. 383, 392, 133 S.Ct. 1924, 1931, 185 L.Ed.2d 1019 (2013); see *Schmidt v. State*, 909 N.W.2d [778,] 790 [Iowa 2018] (stating the Supreme Court has not yet recognized a freestanding claim of actual innocence). Instead, the Supreme Court has recognized “a gateway claim of actual innocence such that the petitioner may obtain review of the underlying constitutional merits of his or her procedurally defaulted claim.” *Schmidt*, 909 N.W.2d at 790 (citing *Herrera*, 506 U.S. at 404, 113 S.Ct. at 862 (majority opinion), and *In re Davis*, 557 U.S. 952, 955, 130 S.Ct. 1, 3, 174 L.Ed.2d 614 (2009) (Scalia, J., dissenting)). In discussing the concept of actual innocence in this context, the Court has made clear it is referring to factual innocence:

“A prototypical example of ‘actual innocence’ in a colloquial sense is the case where the State has convicted the wrong person of the crime. Such claims are of course regularly made on motions for new trial after conviction in both state and federal courts, and quite regularly denied because the evidence adduced in support of them fails to meet the rigorous standards for granting such motions. But in rare instances it may turn out later, for example, that another person has credibly confessed to the crime, and it is evident that the law has made a mistake. In the context of a noncapital case, the concept of ‘actual innocence’ is easy to grasp.”

*Sawyer v. Whitley*, 505 U.S. 333, 340-41, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 2519-20, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992). In *Bousley v. United States*, the Court stated “‘actual innocence’ means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency.” 523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 1611, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998). This understanding of actual innocence is consistent with the Court’s pronouncement that “substantial claim[s] of actual innocence are extremely rare.” *Schlup v. Delo*, 513 U.S. 298, 321, 115 S.Ct. 851, 864, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995); see also *McQuiggin*, 569 U.S. at 386, 133
S.Ct. at 1928 (cautioning that “tenable actual-innocence gateway pleas are rare”).

Dewberry at 6-7. We note that in Dewberry, the court refers to cases cited by Jordan in support of his argument, including Schmidt and Schlup.

¶ 56 Thus, even assuming for the sake of argument that we could consider Jordan’s freestanding claim of actual innocence, he would not be entitled to a new trial based upon the exhibits he attached to his petition. “To establish actual innocence, petitioners must demonstrate that, ‘in light of all the evidence,’ ‘it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted’” them. Bousley at 623, quoting Schlup at 327-328. Although the Bousley court was discussing when a federal habeas court may grant a writ even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default; i.e., where a constitutional violation “‘has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,’” it is instructional here (because that is what Jordan is attempting to claim). Id., quoting Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 491-492, 106 S.Ct. 2639, 91 L.Ed.2d 397 (1986), superseded by statute on other grounds, Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, Pub. L. 104-132, Apr. 24, 1996, 110 Stat. 1214. But as we previously explained, Jordan’s exhibits showing Ladson was “covered” in tattoos, had been convicted of murder, and was a member of the Heartless Felons is not material or exculpatory to Jordan’s claims, and certainly do not demonstrate that it is “‘more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted him.’” Bousley at 623, quoting Schlup at 327-328.
After review, we conclude that Jordan’s “actual innocence” claim fails to raise “a denial or infringement of rights under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States” as required by R.C. 2953.21. We therefore overrule his fifth assignment of error.

VII. Cumulative Error

In his six assignment of error, Jordan contends that “[t]he cumulative effect of the errors in this case, * * * ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and a biased judge, amounted to a denial of a fair trial.” Not having found any error or prejudice, Jordan’s argument has no merit.

Accordingly, we overrule Jordan’s six assignments of error.

Judgment affirmed.

It is ordered that appellee recover from appellant the costs herein taxed.

The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.

It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the common pleas court to carry this judgment into execution. The defendant’s conviction having been affirmed, any bail pending is terminated. Case remanded to the trial court for execution of sentence.
A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.

IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO
SIXTH APPELLATE DISTRICT
ERIE COUNTY

State of Ohio     Court of Appeals Nos. E-17-024
    Appellee

v.

Steven W. Yee     DECISION AND JUDGMENT
    Appellant

Decided:  February 9, 2018

Kevin J. Baxter, Erie County Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.

Steven W. Yee, pro se.

JENSEN, P.J.

I. Introduction

¶ 1 Appellant, Steven W. Yee, appeals the judgment of the Erie County Court of
Common Pleas, denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We affirm.
A. Facts and Procedural Background

¶ 2 Appellant has been before this court on several occasions. Most recently, we considered appellant’s arguments concerning a petition for postconviction relief that was filed by him and denied by the trial court. State v. Yee, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-12-017, 2013-Ohio-5184. In that case, we summarized the background facts of this case as follows:

In March 1989, the Erie County Grand Jury issued a six count indictment against appellant, Steven W. Yee, charging three counts of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery. The indictment included both capital and firearm specifications.

Yee entered into a plea agreement wherein the state promised to nolle four counts of the indictment and the capital specifications. In exchange, Yee agreed to enter a plea of guilty to one count of aggravated murder with a firearm specification and one count of aggravated robbery with a firearm specification. On August 30, 1993, Yee appeared in court, withdrew his previous pleas of not guilty and entered pleas of guilty pursuant to the agreement. When entering his plea, Yee reserved the right to appeal the trial court’s authority to sentence him to two consecutive terms of incarceration on the firearm specifications.

A sentencing hearing was held in September 1993. As to the charge of aggravated murder, Yee was sentenced to life in prison with eligibility of parole after 20 years. As to the charge of aggravated robbery, Yee was 2.
sentenced to 10-25 years in prison. Yee was sentenced to three years each for the two firearm specifications. The trial court ordered that the sentences for the aggravated murder and aggravated robbery be served concurrently. The sentences for the firearm specifications were ordered to be served consecutive to each other and consecutive to the concurrent sentences for aggravated murder and aggravated robbery.

Yee appealed. Upon review, we vacated the portion of the sentence which imposed two consecutive three-year terms of incarceration for the firearm specifications. See State v. Yee, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-93-72, 1994 Ohio App. LEXIS 5142 (Nov. 18, 1994). * * *

We remanded the matter to the trial court.

On December 28, 1995, with consent of counsel, the trial judge issued a judgment entry nunc pro tunc merging the firearm specifications and imposing three years of actual incarceration for the specifications. The stated purpose of the entry was to “reflect the correct language as to the sentence imposed on the firearm specifications.” The judgment entry was filed with the clerk of courts on January 4, 1996.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
286-Yee,"Yes, the error is alleging that the prosecutor (the state) committed misconduct. The allegation is that the prosecutor used misleading evidence, specifically ""bogus"" DNA evidence, to secure the conviction.","Context information is below.
---------------------
On July 27, 2004, Yee filed a motion for leave to withdraw his guilty pleas or, in the alternative, to vacate and set aside the judgment of conviction. The trial court denied Yee’s motion. On April 8, 2011, Yee filed a motion to vacate his conviction or withdraw his guilty plea. Again, the trial court denied Yee’s motion.
On February 29, 2012, Yee filed a motion for de novo resentencing pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision in State v. Johnson, 128 Ohio St.3d 153, 2010-Ohio-6314, 942 N.E.2d 1061. The trial court, construing the motion as a petition for postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21, denied the motion as untimely. The trial court also found that Yee’s claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Yee, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-12-017, 2013-Ohio-5184, at ¶ 2-8.

¶ 3 Appellant subsequently appealed the trial court’s denial of his petition for postconviction relief. We rejected appellant’s arguments, and found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the postconviction petition. Id. at ¶ 15.

¶ 4 Thereafter, on October 11, 2016, appellant filed a “motion for leave to withdraw his ‘void’ guilty plea based on actual innocence, prosecutorial misconduct and newly discovered evidence” pursuant to Crim.R. 32.1. In his motion, appellant asserted that his conviction was void because he was lured into pleading guilty despite his innocence based upon the state’s pledge to seek the death penalty “with a 100% chance of acquiring it” based on “bogus” DNA evidence. In support of his argument, appellant stated that he had recently received documents the FBI sent to the Innocence Project on August 1, 2013, allegedly revealing that the federal government utilized misleading evidence to secure his convictions in federal court. Appellant insisted that, had he been aware of the use of such evidence, he would not have entered a guilty plea. Appellant
further indicated that the state threatened to use the same “bogus” evidence as the federal authorities used to secure the convictions.

{¶ 5} In response to appellant’s motion, the state noted that the evidence referred to by the FBI in its letter to the Innocence Project pertained to hair analysis that was performed by the government’s experts. The conclusions drawn from the hair analysis were later found to have exceeded the limits of science. However, the state argued that this evidence was inconsequential in light of the overwhelming incriminatory evidence that remained to establish appellant’s guilt.

{¶ 6} The state pointed out that the FBI’s letter included a disclaimer that the Bureau took “no position regarding the materiality of the error in this case.” Moreover, the state cited the additional incriminating evidence to support its opposition to appellant’s motion. This evidence placed appellant in the vicinity of the murder on the day in question, and included, inter alia, shell casings that were discovered in appellant’s vehicle matching those found in the victim’s vehicle as well as a coconspirator’s blood found in both the victim’s vehicle and appellant’s vehicle.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
286-Yee,No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The allegation is against the trial court.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 7} The state also emphasized the fact that appellant’s guilty plea, which followed the state’s disclosure of all incriminating evidence including the hair analysis, constituted an absolute admission of guilt belying his claim of actual innocence.

{¶ 8} Upon consideration of the parties’ arguments, the trial court issued its decision summarily denying appellant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea on March 30, 2017. Appellant’s timely notice of appeal followed.
B. Assignments of Error

¶ 9 On appeal, appellant assigns the following errors for our review:

Assignment of Error One: The trial court retains jurisdiction over deciding a post sentencing motion to withdraw guilty plea, Crim.R. 32.1, and committed plain error, Crim.R. 52(B), and/or abused its discretion by the denial of the appellant’s motion.

Assignment of Error Two: The trial court committed plain error, Crim.R. 52(B), and/or abused its discretion by the denial of Mr. Yee’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea that was improperly motivated and/or coerced by the government that was utilizing bogus evidence to create a windfall conviction, rendering the guilty plea void and open to collateral attack at any time.

II. Analysis

¶ 10 In his assignments of error, appellant argues that the trial court committed plain error in denying his Crim.R. 32.1 motion to withdraw his guilty plea.

¶ 11 Under Crim.R. 32.1, “[a] motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or no contest may be made only before sentence is imposed; but to correct manifest injustice the court after sentence may set aside the judgment of conviction and permit the defendant to withdraw his or her plea.” A motion to withdraw a guilty plea made subsequent to sentencing will be granted only in “extraordinary cases” upon the demonstration of manifest injustice. State v. Smith, 49 Ohio St.2d 261, 264, 361 N.E.2d 1324 (1977).
A motion made pursuant to Crim. R. 32.1 is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. *Id.* at paragraph two of the syllabus. Thus, we review the trial court’s decision denying appellant’s motion under an abuse of discretion standard. *State v. Francis*, 104 Ohio St.3d 490, 2004-Ohio-6894, 820 N.E.2d 355, ¶ 32. Abuse of discretion suggests that the trial court’s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable. *Blakemore v. Blakemore*, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983).

In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court retained jurisdiction to consider his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. In his second assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
286-Yee,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the trial court's denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea based on the unreliability of hair analysis evidence.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
In making his arguments, appellant relies upon the FBI’s letter to the Innocence Project as evidence that he was actually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted. However, the statements made in the letter, as represented to this court by appellant, only call into question the veracity of a small fraction of the state’s evidence – namely the scientific reliability of the hair analysis that was performed in this case. As noted by the state, the incriminating evidence implicating appellant in this case was not limited to the hair evidence. Moreover, it is axiomatic that a guilty plea operates as a complete admission of guilt. *State v. Stumpf*, 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 104, 512 N.E.2d 598 (1987). Appellant does not challenge the trial court’s plea colloquy or assert that his plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.
¶ 15 In sum, we find that the newly discovered unreliability of the hair analysis evidence in this case, standing alone, does not justify a finding a manifest injustice necessary to warrant the granting of appellant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea under Crim.R. 32.1. Therefore, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. Accordingly, appellant’s assignments of error are not well-taken.

III. Conclusion

¶ 16 In light of the foregoing, the judgment of the Erie County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24.

Judgment affirmed.

A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to App.R. 27. See also 6th Dist.Loc.App.R. 4.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
346-Vance,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors described in the text are related to the trial court's decisions regarding competency evaluations and plea changes, not any actions by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 2 On June 23, 2014, a Jackson County Grand Jury returned an indictment that charged appellant with crimes alleged to have been committed against Patrick Morgan, including aggravated murder in violation of R.C. 2903.01(D), murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A), murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B), felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), and felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2). The indictment also included crimes alleged to have been
committed against Rachel Canode and her daughter M.C., including kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), abduction in violation of R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), attempted rape in violation of R.C. 2923.02(A)/2907.02(A)(2), tampering with evidence in violation of R.C. 29021.12(A), abduction in violation of R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), and kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(B)(2). The trial court appointed counsel and appellant entered not guilty pleas to all charges.

¶ 3 Counsel filed various motions and, inter alia, requested a competency evaluation. The trial court granted the request. At the November 21, 2014 competency hearing, both parties stipulated to the forensic report and the court later determined appellant to be competent to stand trial.

¶ 4 On March 30, 2015, appellant's trial counsel requested leave to change appellant's plea to not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) and an evaluation, along with a third competency evaluation. The trial court granted appellant’s request for leave to change his plea and ordered an evaluation at Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare. However, on June 16, 2015, the court ordered the evaluation to occur at Twin Valley Behavioral Healthcare. The court also denied the request for the third competency evaluation.

¶ 5 On February 19, 2016, appellant sent a pro se letter to the trial court judge and indicated that he wished to have different counsel. At this juncture, counsel also requested yet another competency evaluation, but the trial court indicated that both prior evaluations determined appellant's competency, as set forth in R.C. 2945.37(G), and that appellant raised no additional facts or argument as to why a third competency evaluation was necessary. Thus, the court denied the motion.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
346-Vance,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors described in the text are related to the trial court's handling of documents and the trial process, not the actions of the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 6 On July 14, 2016, the trial court issued a pretrial order and indicated that it had
received additional unsolicited correspondence from appellant, including: (1) a June 27, 2016 letter, (2) a June 27, 2016 voluntary statement, (3) a June 24, 2016 voluntary statement, and (4) a June 19, 2016 motion for dismissal and a list of witnesses. Because appellant had counsel, the court did not file any of the documents, but instructed counsel to file, within 14 days, any necessary motion regarding the issues that appellant raised in the documents. In a separate order, the court indicated that it had received defendant’s pro se motion for acquittal, but again stated that it would not consider appellant’s pro se motion because counsel represented appellant.

¶ 7 The trial court held a four day trial beginning October 20, 2016. The first witness, William Ghearing, stated that he was driving toward Wellston, Ohio at 7:00 or 8:00 p.m. on November 29, 2013 when appellant's pick-up truck struck him head-on. When Ghearing approached appellant, appellant told him “You never seen me. You never seen me at all, and don’t know who I am.” Shortly thereafter, appellant disappeared.

¶ 8 Chillicothe Police Officer Morgan Music testified that at the time of the accident, he worked for the Coalton Police Department. After Officer Music arrived at the crash site, he noticed a body in the truck bed. Once he secured the scene, Officer Music also learned that a man had been observed walking about a quarter mile away. Officer Music assisted in detaining that man (appellant), who displayed blood on his face, pants and jacket. Jackson County Sheriff's Deputy Urias Hall later visited the hospital to see appellant and testified that he smelled of alcohol, but appeared to be oriented.

¶ 9 Officers eventually learned that appellant's truck actually belonged to Patrick Morgan. Also, Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) Special Agent Bryan White testified about processing the vehicle crash site, and stated that the victim’s (Morgan's) pants and underwear were
found around his knees, and that the victim had only one shoe.

¶ 10 Nineteen-year-old Dustin Jones testified that on the night in question, appellant came to his parents’ neighboring home and asked him to help load a deer into a truck. Jones assisted, but observed that the object was not a deer but rather a human body that he recognized as the person who had been staying with appellant. Appellant then threatened Jones and his family with harm if he did not help. Jones helped appellant, then returned to his parents’ home. The following morning, he told his father about the incident.

Answer:"
346-Vance,"No. The text above is not describing an assignment of error. It is providing context and testimony related to a case, but it does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 11 Rachel Canode testified that, as a friend of appellant’s sister, she knew appellant. Canode explained that she was at her mother’s house on November 29, 2013 when appellant came by to look for her mother to sell some rings. Canode told appellant that her mother was at a friend’s house, and that she and her twelve-year-old daughter (M.C.) were also getting ready to walk to that house. Canode stated that while appellant walked with them, he kept putting his arms around her and grabbing her breasts and legs. Canode testified that the second or third time appellant put his arms around her, a knife fell from appellant’s coat. When they arrived at appellant’s sister’s house (the house where appellant was living), he started to walk up the sidewalk to the home while Canode attempted to escape his grasp. Ultimately, Canode’s daughter (M.C.) grabbed appellant’s arm and appellant put the knife to her throat. Canode stated that she and her daughter then fled to her mother’s house.

¶ 12 Wellston Police Department Officer Steve Wilbur testified that he was at the fire station when he heard the radio call about the crash and the body in the truck bed. Officer Wilbur also explained that he later received a call from Rachel Canode who stated that appellant attempted to force her and her daughter into a house. Officer Wilbur testified that he met with Canode, then
walked to the home where appellant had been living. When no one answered the door, Officer Wilbur looked in the windows. Blood could be seen on the porch and inside the house on a couch and a knife. Officer Wilbur also found a single shoe in the driveway.

¶ 13 BCI Agent Todd Fortner testified that he processed the crime scene at the home and found no signs of struggle. Fortner observed two couches, one with and one without bloodstains, a wooden chair, a lamp, a table and a small radio. None of the furniture had been overturned or broken. Because one couch and the door area contained all of the bloodstains, Fortner testified that, based on his experience, he believed that at the time of the attack the victim was either lying or sitting on the couch.

¶ 14 BCI Forensic Scientist (DNA Section) Andrea Weisenburger testified that (1) the knife blade recovered from appellant’s home contained Patrick Morgan’s blood, (2) the knife handle had mostly Morgan’s blood, but also some of appellant’s blood, (3) Morgan’s blood appeared on appellant's jeans, and (4) the truck's air bag had mostly Morgan’s blood, but also some of appellant’s blood.

¶ 15 Franklin County forensic pathologist John Daniels testified that he performed Patrick Morgan's autopsy. The autopsy revealed multiple stab wounds to Morgan's face, eye and neck, including a wound through his eye and one inch into his brain. In total, Morgan had 24 wounds, including defensive wrist wounds. Daniels testified that the manner of death was homicide.

¶ 16 Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections Parole Officer Brett McRoberts testified that on November 29, 2013, appellant was under his supervision while on community control after his judicial release. McRoberts noted that appellant had been living at a homeless shelter in Athens, but McRoberts did not know that appellant had moved to Wellston.
¶ 17 At the close of the state’s evidence, appellant's counsel requested a Crim.R. 29 motion for dismissal of Count 8 of the indictment (rape). The trial court denied the motion.

346-Vance,No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It provides a summary of the testimony and the jury's verdict in a criminal trial. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 18 Michelle Vance, appellant’s sister, testified that her brother and his roommate, Morgan, were living at her home. She explained that she offered the two a place to stay after they had been removed from Timothy House, an Athens shelter.

¶ 19 Phillip Lemaster testified that Jay Poe told him that Brian Canode, Rachel Canode’s brother, wanted to talk with him. Lemaster stated that Brian Canode asked him to assault appellant in exchange for heroin, and that he agreed to do so. Brian Canode and Lemaster parked at Brian Canode’s mother’s house, then Lemaster, Canode and Jay Poe, who had been waiting at the Canode home, walked to appellant’s house. Lemaster stated that appellant's truck was not at the house and when no one answered their knock, Brian Canode took Lemaster home.

¶ 20 Brian Canode, however, denied any agreement with Lemaster to attack appellant. Canode also testified that he, Rachel Canode’s brother, went to appellant’s home that evening, but because he did not see the truck that his sister described, he left the residence. Against the advice of counsel, appellant chose to exercise his right to testify. On the night in question, appellant and Morgan were abusing drugs and alcohol. Appellant claimed that Rachel Canode’s brother and several other men came to the house with bats and a knife and attacked him and Morgan. Appellant testified that the men beat him with a bat and raped him with a stick, but appellant managed to drag Morgan from the house and screamed for help. Appellant left the home to get help, but because he was unsuccessful in that endeavor, he returned to the house to save Morgan. After the men overwhelmed appellant, the men forced appellant into the truck and threw Morgan into the truck bed. Appellant testified that he did not kill Morgan, that he did not grab Rachel
Canode and that he did not attempt to restrain Canode or her daughter. Appellant, however, admitted that officers found his knife at the scene and that his knife contained Morgan’s blood.

¶ 21 After the four-day trial, the jury found appellant guilty of: Count 1 aggravated murder R.C. 2903.01(D), Count 2 murder R.C. 2903.02(A), Count 3 murder R.C. 2903.02(B)), Count 4 felonious assault R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), Count 5 felonious assault R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), and Count 9 tampering with evidence R.C. 2921.12(A). The jury also found appellant not guilty of: Count 6 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), Count 7 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), Count 8 attempted rape R.C. 2923.02(A)/2907.02(A)(2), Count 10 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), and Count 11 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(B)(2).

Answer:"
346-Vance,No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The allegation is against the trial court for refusing to hold a hearing or to conduct a review of the appellant's motion for new trial.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 22 The trial court sentenced appellant to serve life in prison without parole on count one (aggravated murder) and thirty-six months on count 9 (tampering with evidence), with the sentences to be served consecutively to one another. At that point, appellant filed a pro se (1) Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial and argued that irregularities existed in the court proceedings, including jury and prosecutorial misconduct, and that new evidence supported his self-defense claim, and (2) a Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. This appeal followed.2

I.

2The Appellate Rules require us to determine the appeal on the assignments of error set forth in the briefs. App.R. 16 provides for a brief for the appellant, a brief for the appellee, and a reply brief, stating that “[n]o further briefs may be filed except with leave of court.” As provided by App.R. 16, appellant’s counsel filed an appellate brief and raised four assignments of error. The appellee also filed a brief and appellate counsel filed a reply brief. It also appears that appellant filed a pro se brief and raised four additional assignments of error. Neither the United States nor Ohio Constitution mandates a hybrid representation to allow a pro se appellant with appointed counsel to file briefs in addition to those that his attorney filed. State v. Thompson, 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 6-7, 514 N.E.2d 407 (1987); State v. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, paragraph one of the syllabus; State v. White, 71 Ohio App.3d 550, fn. 1, 594 N.E.2d 1087 (4th Dist.1991). Nevertheless, we may choose later in this opinion to briefly address appellant’s arguments in his pro se brief.
¶ 23 In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by refusing to hold a hearing or to conduct a review of appellant’s motion for new trial.

¶ 24 Generally, the decision to grant a new trial is within a trial court’s discretion, and a ruling on a motion for a new trial will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 564 N.E.2d 54 (1990); State v. Williams, 43 Ohio St.2d 88, 330 N.E.2d 891 (1975). An abuse of discretion “implies that the court’s attitude [was] unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.” State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 404 N.E.2d 144 (1980). “A decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process that would support that decision.” AAAA Enterprises, Inc. v. River Place Community Redevelopment, 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597 (1990).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
346-Vance,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error related to the trial court's refusal to rule on the appellant's pro se motion for new trial. The allegation is not against the prosecutor but rather against the trial court for not considering the pro se motion. The state (prosecutor) is mentioned in the context of the trial court's decision, but the error is not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 25 Appellant filed a pro se motion for new trial, but the trial court refused to rule on appellant’s pro se motion. Appellant contends that no sound reasoning process supported the court's decision, and, thus, the trial court's refusal to consider the motion constitutes an abuse of discretion. The state points out that the trial court refused to rule on the pro se motion because appellant had legal representation and that neither the United States Constitution nor the Ohio Constitution or case authority permits hybrid representation.

¶ 26 “Although appellant has the right either to appear pro se or to have counsel, he has no corresponding right to act as co-counsel on his own behalf.” State v. Thompson, 33 Ohio St.3d 1, 6-7, 514 N.E.2d 407 (1987). The Supreme Court of Ohio has reaffirmed that principle and held that “in Ohio, a criminal defendant has the right to representation by counsel or to proceed pro se with the assistance of standby counsel. However, these two rights are independent of each other and may not be asserted simultaneously.” State v. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d
227, paragraph one of the syllabus.

{¶ 27} In the case sub judice, appellant attempted to make multiple pro se filings while he had legal representation. The trial court aptly noted that appellant had legal representation and advised counsel to review the pro se filings and file any necessary motion within 14 days with regard to any relevant issues raised in the pro se documents. Once again, Ohio courts need not address pro se motions when the defendant enjoys the benefit of counsel. See State v. Smith, 4th Dist. Highland No. 09CA29, 2010-Ohio-4507, ¶ 100 [“The trial court indicated that it would refuse to consider motions filed by Smith because the court was appointing counsel to represent him. We are satisfied that the trial court did not err as, although a defendant ‘has the right either to appear pro se or to have counsel, he has no corresponding right to act as co-counsel on his own behalf.’”]; State v. Smith, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-160836 and C-160837, 2017-Ohio-8558; State v. Greenleaf, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2005-P-0017, 2006-Ohio-4317. “When a criminal defendant is represented by counsel and counsel does not join the defendant’s pro se motion or otherwise indicate a need for the relief sought by the defendant pro se, the trial court cannot properly consider the defendant’s pro se motion.” Smith at ¶ 32, citing State v. Davis, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 05AP-193, 2006-Ohio-5039, ¶ 12; State v. Pizzaro, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94849, 2011-Ohio-611, ¶ 7 [“One who is represented by counsel and who does not move the court to proceed pro se, may not ‘act as co-counsel on his own behalf.’”, quoting Greenleaf at ¶ 70].

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
346-Vance,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is directed against the trial court for failing to properly notify the appellant about the discretionary term of post-release control and for omitting this notification from the sentencing entry.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 28} Appellant, however, argues that State v. Keene, 4th Dist. Washington No. 16CA10, 2017-Ohio-7058, mandates a different result. In Keene, the defendant, prior to the scheduled sentencing hearing, sent two letters to the trial court, without counsel’s assistance, and sought to withdraw his guilty pleas. Although the trial court held a hearing and ruled on the defendant’s pro
se motion in spite of counsel's representation, the court was not required to do so. Once again, the Supreme Court of Ohio has established that a defendant has either the right to representation by counsel or the right to proceed pro se, but has no right to hybrid representation. *Martin*, paragraph one of the syllabus.

{¶ 29} Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons we overrule appellant’s first assignment of error.

II.

{¶ 30} In his second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court: (1) failed to properly notify him at the sentencing hearing that he is subject to a discretionary term of up to three years of post-release control, and (2) omitted from the sentencing entry the notification regarding post-release control. Appellant asserts that these failures violate his constitutional rights as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution.

{¶ 31} In the case sub judice, appellant was convicted of aggravated murder and tampering with evidence. The tampering with evidence charge carries an additional three-year term of post-release control. At sentencing, the trial court stated: “If you are placed on Post-Release Control under the Authority of the Adult Parole, you could be returned to Prison for up to nine months for each violation of rule if your stated Prison term equals or exceeds eighteen months. Otherwise, the longest single Prison sanction, you (unintelligible) half of your stated Prison term. You can be returned to Prison for up to fifty percent of your Prison Sentence for all violations committed. If convicted of a new Felony while on Post-Release Control, in addition to being punished for the new offense, the Court can add an additional consecutive Prison term of one year, however, whatever part
remains of the Post-Release Control term; whichever is greater.”

{¶ 32} The state concedes that the post-release control language did not state that the term would be three years. The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that the failure to properly impose post-release control renders the post-release control portion of the sentence void. State v. Fischer, 128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, 942 N.E.2d 332, ¶ 26. The remedy for this error is a new sentencing hearing, limited to the proper imposition of the post release control sanction. Id. at ¶ 29.

As we previously mentioned, the state concedes this issue and we hereby sustain appellant's second assignment of error.

{¶ 33} Accordingly, we find merit to appellant's argument and we remand this matter to the trial court for proceedings consistent with R.C. 2929.191 to properly impose the term of post-release control.

Answer:"
346-Vance,"No. The text describes an assignment of error by the appellant (defendant) against the trial court, not the prosecutor. The allegation is that the trial court's sentence does not comport with the purposes of felony sentencing, specifically that the trial court's refusal to consider the appellant's mental health issues and impose a term of life without parole fails to comply with the requirements and purpose of R.C. 2929.11.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 34} In his third assignment of error, appellant, citing the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. 2929.11, asserts that the trial court’s sentence does not comport with the purposes of felony sentencing. In particular, appellant argues that the trial court's refusal to consider appellant’s mental health issues and impose a term of life without parole, which will not provide appellant with an opportunity for parole or future mental health services, fails to comply with the requirements and purpose of R.C. 2929.11.

{¶ 35} Appellant cites State v. Marcum, 146 Ohio St.3d 516, 2016-Ohio-1002, 59 N.E.3d 1231, for the proposition that an appellate court may vacate or modify any sentence that is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law only if the appellate court finds, by clear and convincing evidence,
that the record does not support the sentence. Counsel argues that appellant self-medicated with alcohol and drugs and had no access to professional mental health services. The state counters that *Marcum* dealt with sentencing for a classified felony, not for aggravated murder. *Id.* at ¶ 22-23. The state points out that *Marcum* relied on R.C. 2953.08 for the statutory authority to review a felony sentence, however, R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) makes clear, “[a] sentence imposed for aggravated murder or murder pursuant to sections 2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code is not subject to review under this section.” (Emphasis added.)

{¶ 36} The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that “R.C. 2953.08(D) is unambiguous. ‘A sentence imposed for aggravated murder or murder pursuant to section 2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code is not subject to review under this section’ clearly means what it says: such a sentence cannot be reviewed.” *State v. Porterfield*, 106 Ohio St.3d 5, 2005-Ohio-3095, 829 N.E.2d 690, ¶ 17. Moreover, this court has held “[i]t is evident that the General Assembly intended to treat sentencing on aggravated murder and murder convictions differently from other felony sentences.” *State v. Hawkins*, 4th Dist. No. 13CA3, 2014-Ohio-1224, ¶ 15., citing *State v. Porterfield* at ¶ 17-18.

We wrote: “we find pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(D)(3), we lack statutory authority to review Hawkins’ sentence on an evidentiary basis.” *Id.*

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
346-Vance,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors are directed at the trial court's sentencing decisions and the lack of specific findings in the sentencing entry.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 37} Appellant also contends that the trial court’s sentence did not comport with due process and is excessive. However, our review of the record reveals that, although the trial court expressed concern and acknowledged appellant’s mental health issues, and allowed competency evaluations and forensic reviews and pondered how better treatment earlier in life might have affected appellant, the court concluded that the aggravating factors nevertheless outweighed appellant’s mental health concerns: “You know, we’ve talked about the failures of the mental health
system. We’ve talked about the dramatic cuts to that system. Maybe if we had a system that was properly funded, Mr. Vance may have received appropriate treatment. But, those are all ‘what ifs.’ I don’t know. The reality that I have to deal with is that Mr. Vance is a dangerous individual. He has committed a savage crime.” The court further noted the injury to the victim, his family, and appellant’s criminal history, including a prior violent offense.

¶ 38 Consequently, after our review, we conclude that (1) appellant’s aggravated murder sentence is not subject to appellate review, and (2) appellant's sentence for tampering with evidence comported with due process and is not excessive. Accordingly, we overrule appellant’s third assignment of error.

IV.

¶ 39 In his final assignment of error, appellant asserts that at the sentencing hearing the trial court sentenced him to serve (1) life in prison without parole for the aggravated murder conviction, and (2) thirty-six months on the tampering with evidence charge. Appellant argues, however, that the court failed to specify its consecutive sentencing findings in its entry as R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) requires. The court stated: “[t]hat will be consecutive punishment as necessary to protect the public. The punishment is not disproportionate to the crime, and your criminal history demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary.” The court's December 6, 2016 sentencing entry recited the statutory language of R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) - including the subsections (a), (b), and (c). However, the entry provides lines next to the restatements of these subsections, presumably, as the state contends, as a check-off. Based on the trial court’s remarks at sentencing, subsection (c) - “the offender’s history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender” should have been initialed or checked, but it
does not appear that the court did so.

¶ 40 The state maintains that this error may be corrected with a nunc pro tunc entry. However, in view of our resolution of appellant’s second assignment of error, the trial court may address this issue when, on remand, it addresses the imposition of post-release control as referenced in appellant’s second assignment of error.

¶ 41 Accordingly, we sustain appellant’s fourth assignment of error and remand the matter to the trial court to include the findings to support consecutive sentencing.

V.

¶ 42 In conclusion, we (1) overrule appellant’s first and third assignments of error, (2) find appellant’s second and fourth assignments of error to be well-taken, and (3) remand this cause to the trial court to address the post-release control term for tampering with evidence the and the findings for consecutive sentences.3

Answer:"
346-Vance,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
3Appellant’s pro se brief contends that the trial court abused appellant’s First Amendment rights when it referred to appellant as Muslim. However, our review finds no such reference. Appellant also asserts that he consistently stated that he had been attacked on November 29, 2013. Thus, he appears to attack the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. However, the state presented ample competent, credible evidence so that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of aggravated murder and tampering with evidence proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury heard appellant’s version of the events and did not find his testimony credible. Appellant also asserts that the trial court erred by failing to replace the jury after (1) one juror revealed she participated in an event in support of the county prosecutor, and (2) another juror shared outside information to the jury. However, the trial court properly questioned the first juror and concluded that she could be impartial. Later, during deliberations, the second juror revealed to several jurors that she disputed the victim’s daughter’s (M.C.) age. After the trial court conducted a hearing and questioned the jurors, the court dismissed the second juror, brought in an alternate, and retained the other jurors who stated that the comments did not influence their deliberations. Appellant also asserts that his trial counsel failed to (1) use certain evidence, (2) investigate and subpoena witnesses, (3) remove jury members, (4) defend appellant, and (5) that he should have been granted new counsel. However, appellant’s claims are undermined by the fact that the jury found appellant not guilty of five of the eleven charges. Additionally, after the trial court discussed appellant’s representation, the court asked appellant if he was satisfied with defense counsel, and appellant agreed. Here, counsel’s representation did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.
PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
JUDGMENT ENTRY

It is ordered that the judgment be affirmed in part, reversed in part, and cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Appellant and Appellee shall split the costs.

The Court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.

It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this Court directing the Jackson County Common Pleas Court to carry this judgment into execution.

If a stay of execution of sentence and release upon bail has been previously granted, it is continued for a period of sixty days upon the bail previously posted. The purpose of said stay is to allow appellant to file with the Supreme Court of Ohio an application for a stay during the pendency of the proceedings in that court. The stay as herein continued will terminate at the expiration of the sixty-day period.

The stay will also terminate if appellant fails to file a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio in the forty-five day period pursuant to Rule II, Sec. 2 of the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Additionally, if the Supreme Court of Ohio dismisses the appeal prior to the expiration of said sixty days, the stay will terminate as of the date of such dismissal.

A certified copy of this entry shall constitute that mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.

STATE OF OHIO

PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE

vs.

ZACHARY JOHNSON

DEFENDANT-APPELLANT

JUDGMENT:
APPLICATION DENIED

Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas
Case No. CR-16-608678-A
Application for Reopening
Motion No. 519237

RELEASE DATE: December 19, 2018
MARY EILEEN KILBANE, P.J.:

{¶1} On July 12, 2018, the applicant, Zachary Johnson, pursuant to App.R. 26(B), applied to reopen this court’s judgment in State v. Johnson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105612, 2018-Ohio-1389, in which this court affirmed his convictions for aggravated murder, murder, attempted murder, discharging a firearm at or near a prohibited premises, two counts of having a weapon while under disability, and four counts of felonious assault. Johnson now argues that his appellate counsel should have argued: (1) there was insufficient evidence of prior calculation and design to support the conviction of aggravated murder, (2) the indictments failed to give sufficient notice of the charges, and (3) trial counsel was ineffective for failing to argue that the cell-phone evidence violated his Fourth Amendment Rights, based upon Carpenter v. United States, 585 U.S. _____, 138 S.Ct. 2206, 201 L.Ed.2d 507 (2018), which was decided on June 22,
2018. On July 30, 2018, the state of Ohio filed its brief in opposition. For the following reasons, this court denies the application.

{¶2} App.R. 26(B)(1) and (2)(b) require applications claiming ineffective assistance of appellate counsel to be filed within 90 days from journalization of the decision unless the applicant shows good cause for filing at a later time. This court issued its decision on April 12, 2018, and Johnson filed his application one day late on July 12, 2018 (18 (remaining days in April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 12 (July) = 91). Thus, this application is untimely. Johnson did not proffer any explanation to show good cause.

Answer:"
069-Johnson,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is related to the denial of an application to reopen, and it discusses the strict enforcement of a 90-day deadline for filing, the lack of good cause for missing the deadline, and the denial of the application due to its untimeliness. There is no mention of any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶3} The Supreme Court of Ohio in State v. Lamar, 102 Ohio St.3d 467, 2004-Ohio-3976, 812 N.E.2d 970, and State v. Gumm, 103 Ohio St.3d 162, 2004-Ohio-4755, 814 N.E.2d 861, held that the 90-day deadline for filing must be strictly enforced. In those cases the applicants argued that after the court of appeals decided their cases, their appellate counsel continued to represent them, and their appellate counsel could not be expected to raise their own incompetence. Although the Supreme Court agreed with this latter principle, it rejected the argument that continued representation provided good cause. In both cases, the court ruled that the applicants could not ignore the ninety-day deadline, even if it meant retaining new counsel or filing the applications themselves. The court then reaffirmed the principle that lack of effort, imagination, and ignorance of the law do not establish good cause for complying with this fundamental aspect of the rule. As a corollary, miscalculation of the time needed for mailing would also not state good cause. State v. Winstead, 74 Ohio St.3d 277, 1996-Ohio-52, 658 N.E.2d 722, is particularly instructive. Winstead sought to file his App.R. 26(B) application to reopen and hired an overnight courier to deliver it. However, the courier filed it a day late. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the denial of the application as untimely,
because the courier’s delay was not good cause and because there was no denial of due process or equal protection in applying a rule applicable to all appellants.  See also State v. Agosto, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87283, 2006-Ohio-5011, reopening disallowed, 2007-Ohio-848; State v. Ellis, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 91116, 2009-Ohio-852, reopening disallowed, 2009-Ohio-2875; State v. Peyton, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 86797, 2006-Ohio-3951, reopening disallowed, 2007-Ohio-263 (App.R. 26(B) application to reopen denied as untimely because it was filed two days late).

{¶4} Accordingly, this court denies the application to reopen.

085-Vance,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors are all directed towards the trial court's actions or inactions.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
This is an appeal from a Jackson County Common Pleas Court judgment that denied a request for postconviction relief filed by Lewis Vance, defendant below and appellant herein. Appellant assigns the following errors for review:

FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:

“THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY NOT HOLDING A HEARING TO REVIEW VANCE’S POSTCONVICTION EVIDENTIARY HEARING REQUEST WITHIN THE JUDGMENT ENTRY FILED NOVEMBER 1, 2017 AND THE
ORDER DENYING HIS POSTCONVICTION BRIEF WITH FINDINGS OF FACTS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW ALSO FILED NOVEMBER 1, 2017 AND ALSO IN THE MAGISTRATES [SIC.] ORDER FROM OCTOBER 30, 2017.”

SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:

“THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY FAILING TO APPOINT APPELLANT VANCE COUNSEL FOR HIS POSTCONVICTION IN A CASE OF AGGRAVATED MURDER WHEN THE COURT RULED VANCE IS NOT ENTITLED TO THE APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL FOR HIS HEARING OR APPEAL. FILED JANUARY 31, 2018”

THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:

“THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT APPOINT EFFECTIVE TRIAL COUNSEL OR COUNSEL FOR HIS POSTCONVICTION TO PROPERLY DEFEND DEFENDANT-APPELLANT LEWIS VANCE IN PROCEEDINGS OF THE COURT TO SUPPORT HIS SELF-DEFENSE WITHIN THE HOME AND PROPERTY IN TRIAL COURT CASE NO. 14-CR-0118.”

FOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:

“THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY NOT GRANTING APPELLANT VANCE HIS MOTION FOR DISCOVERY TO ALLOW HIM EVIDENCE NEEDED FOR THE POSTCONVICTION EVIDENTIARY HEARING HE REQUESTED AS OF JANUARY 31, 2018.”

FIFTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:

“THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT CONTINUED TO RULE WITH ADVERSE RULINGS, EVEN ERRONEOUS ONES.”

Answer:"
085-Vance,"Yes, the text describes an allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor. The appellant argued that there were irregularities in the court proceedings, including ""jury and prosecutorial misconduct.""","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 2 In 2016, a jury found appellant guilty of: (1) Count 1 aggravated murder R.C. 2903.01(D), (2) Count 2 murder R.C. 2903.02(A), (3) Count 3 murder R.C. 2903.02(B), (4) Count 4
felonious assault R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), (5) Count 5 felonious assault R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), and (6) Count 9 tampering with evidence R.C. 2921.12(A). The jury also found appellant not guilty of: (1) Count 6 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), (2) Count 7 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), (3) Count 8 attempted rape R.C. 2923.02(A)/2907.02(A)(2), (4) Count 10 abduction R.C. 2905.02(A)(2), and (5) Count 11 kidnapping R.C. 2905.01(B)(2). The trial court sentenced appellant to serve life in prison without parole on count one (aggravated murder), and thirty-six months on count 9 (tampering with evidence). The court further ordered that the sentences be served consecutively to one another. At that point, appellant filed a pro se Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial and argued that (1) irregularities existed in the court proceedings, including jury and prosecutorial misconduct, and (2) new evidence supported his self-defense claim. Appellant also filed a Crim.R. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal. On direct appeal, this court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the cause to the trial court to include findings, if appropriate, to support consecutive sentences.\(^1\) While his appeal was pending, appellant also filed various pro se motions, including his March 18, 2017 pro se petition for postconviction relief and his June 30, 2017 pro se petition to vacate or set aside the judgment of conviction and motion for expert assistance (a forensic scientist). The trial court denied the postconviction relief petition and indicated that appellant did not attach materials to support his petition and that no substantive grounds for relief exists. In addition, on November 1, 2017, the trial court issued an entry that chronicled and denied all 21 of appellant’s motions. The court determined that it either lacked jurisdiction to consider certain motions, certain motions did not set forth a request that the court could grant, or certain motions are nonsensical. Thus, the trial court denied the postconviction relief request and concluded that appellant is not entitled to relief as

085-Vance,No. The error is not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor. The allegation is against the trial court for failing to hold a hearing to consider the appellant's postconviction relief request.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 3 The postconviction relief process is a collateral civil attack on a criminal judgment rather than an appeal of the judgment. State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999). Postconviction relief is not a constitutional right; instead, it is a narrow remedy that gives the petitioner no more rights than those granted by statute. Id.; State v. Betts, 4th Dist. Vinton No. 18CA710, 2018-Ohio-2720, ¶ 11. This process is a means to resolve constitutional claims that cannot be addressed on direct appeal because the evidence supporting the claims is not contained in the record. State v. McDougald, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 16CA3736, 2016-Ohio-5080, ¶ 19-20, citing State v. Knauff, 4th Dist. Adams No. 13CA976, 2014-Ohio-308, ¶ 18; Betts, supra. “[A] trial court’s decision granting or denying a postconviction petition filed pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 should be upheld absent an abuse of discretion; a reviewing court should not overrule the trial court’s finding on a petition for postconviction relief that is supported by competent and credible evidence.” State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 390, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, ¶ 58; State v. Black, 4th Dist. Ross No. 15CA3509, 2016-Ohio-3104, ¶ 7. “A trial court abuses its discretion when its decision is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.” State v. Rinehart, 4th Dist. Ross No. 17CA3606, 2018-Ohio-1261, ¶ 10, citing State v. Knauff at ¶ 19.

I.

¶ 4 In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to hold a hearing to consider appellant’s postconviction relief request. Appellant appears to refer to his motion titled “Motion for Evidentiary Hearing Request; Supplemental of Record.” The trial court denied this motion, inter alia, without a hearing by entry dated November 1, 2017.

¶ 5 R.C. 2953.21(D) provides: “Before granting a hearing on a petition filed under division
(A) of this section, the court shall determine whether there are substantive grounds for relief. In making such a determination, the court shall consider, in addition to the petition, the supporting affidavits, and the documentary evidence, all the files and records pertaining to the proceedings against the petitioner, including, but not limited to, the indictment, the court's journal entries, the journalized records of the clerk of the court, and the court reporter's transcript.”

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
085-Vance,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is directed at the trial court's decision to deny the petition for postconviction relief without conducting a hearing, and it does not mention any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 6 Because a motion for postconviction relief is not an appeal, but rather a collateral civil attack on a judgment, a criminal defendant who seeks to challenge a conviction through a petition for postconviction relief is not automatically entitled to a hearing. State v. Cole, 2 Ohio St.3d 112, 443 N.E.2d 169 (1982); Black at ¶ 9, citing Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d at 282. Rather, before granting an evidentiary hearing on the petition, R.C. 2951.21(C) requires that a trial court find substantive grounds for relief. “Substantive grounds for relief exist and a hearing is warranted if the petitioner produces sufficient credible evidence that demonstrates the petitioner suffered a violation of the petitioner’s constitutional rights.” In re B.C.S., 4th Dist. Washington No. 07CA60, 2008-Ohio-5771, ¶ 11. Furthermore, in order to merit a hearing, the petitioner must show that the claimed “errors resulted in prejudice.” Id., quoting Calhoun at 283; Betts, supra.

¶ 7 In the case sub judice, the trial court denied all 21 pending pro se motions and denied appellant’s petition for postconviction relief. The court wrote: “R.C. 2953.21(C) provides that prior to granting a hearing the Court shall determine if there are substantive grounds for relief. The Defendant has not attached materials in support of his petition. The Court has reviewed the entire file concerning this case. Based upon the review of the record, the Court finds that there are no substantive grounds for relief as set forth in the petition. The Defendant is not entitled to relief as provided in R.C. 2953.21. Therefore, the Court denies the petition.”
“[A] petitioner who does not submit any evidence will have necessarily failed to submit enough evidence to demonstrate substantive grounds for relief.” State v. Hicks, 4th Dist. Highland No. 09CA15, 2010-Ohio-89, ¶ 17. Thus, in the case sub judice, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing appellant’s petition for postconviction relief without conducting a hearing. Appellant did not submit evidence to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
085-Vance,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignments of error are directed at the trial court's actions regarding the appointment of counsel for postconviction proceedings and the doctrine of res judicata.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
In his second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by failing to appoint counsel for his postconviction proceedings. However, “[A]n indigent petitioner has neither a state nor a federal constitutional right to be represented by an attorney in a postconviction proceeding.” State v. Crowder, 60 Ohio St.3d 151, 152, 573 N.E.2d 652 (1982), citing Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987). Moreover, “appointed counsel is not required for the initial burden of preparing and presenting petitions for postconviction relief.” State v. Barnes, 7 Ohio App.3d 83, 86, 454 N.E.2d 572 (1982). If a court finds that a petitioner’s allegations do not merit an evidentiary hearing, that petitioner is not entitled to the appointment of counsel. State v. Slagle, 4th Dist. Highland No. 11CA22, 2012-Ohio-1936, ¶ 22.

Consequently, because the trial court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing appellant’s petition without a hearing, appellant was not entitled to counsel. We therefore overrule appellant’s second assignment of error.

III.

In his third assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred when it “did not appoint effective trial counsel or counsel for his postconviction to properly defend” appellant “in
proceedings of the court to support his self-defense within the home and property in trial court.” As we held above, however, appellant is not, at this juncture, entitled to the appointment of counsel for his postconviction proceedings. With regard to his claim that he did not receive effective assistance of trial counsel, the doctrine of res judicata bars this issue from consideration. Res judicata applies to proceedings involving postconviction relief. Black at ¶ 10, citing State v. Szefcyk, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 95, 671 N.E.2d 233 (1996). “Under the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.” State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967). “Therefore, ‘any issue that could have been raised on direct appeal and was not is res judicata and not subject to review in subsequent proceedings.’” Black at ¶ 10, citing State v. Segines, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99789, 2013-Ohio-5259, ¶ 8, quoting State v. Saxon, 109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, 846 N.E.2d 824, ¶ 16.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
085-Vance,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignments of error are directed against the trial court and the defense attorney.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 12} Although appellant pursued his postconviction petition pro se, counsel represented him at trial. Moreover, appellant had a different counsel for his direct appeal. Thus, appellant’s direct appeal should have addressed the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. See State v. Vance, 4th Dist. Jackson No. 16CA11, 2018-Ohio-1313.

{¶ 13} Accordingly, we overrule appellant’s third assignment of error.

IV.

{¶ 14} In his fourth assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by not granting his “motion for discovery, Crim.R. 16, Discovery and Inspection.”
This court has held that “[a] postconviction relief petitioner is not entitled to discovery to help the petitioner establish substantive grounds for relief.” State v. LaMar, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 98CA23, 2000 WL 297413 (March 17, 2003), *7. More recently, the Tenth District addressed this issue with respect to other appellate districts: “Ohio appellate courts, including this district, have routinely rejected granting postconviction relief petitioners the right to obtain discovery to help him or her establish substantive grounds for relief. State v. Gulertekin, 10th Dist. No. 99AP–900 (June 8, 2000). ‘Ohio law is clear that discovery is not available in the initial stages of a postconviction proceeding.’ State v. Cunningham, 3d Dist. No. 1–04–19, 2004–Ohio–5892, ¶ 69, citing State v. Byrd, 145 Ohio App.3d 318, 332 (1st Dist.2001).” State v. Montgomery, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-1091, 2015-Ohio-500 at ¶ 8. Accord State v. Wesson, 9t Dist. Summit No. 25874, 2012-Ohio-4495, ¶ 111.

Accordingly, in the case sub judice appellant is not entitled to discovery during the initial stage of postconviction relief. Therefore, we overrule appellant’s fourth assignment of error.

V.

In his final assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion “when it continued to rule with adverse rulings, even erroneous ones.” Our review reveals that appellant has filed multiple pro se motions and, as the state observes, has failed to explicitly state which motion or motions he is addressing in his assignment of error. App. R. 12(A)(2) provides: “The court may disregard an assignment of error presented for review if the party raising it fails to identify in the record the error on which the assignment of error is based or fails to argue the assignment separately in the brief, as required under App. R. 16(A).” App.R. 16(A) outlines the requirements for the appellant’s brief, stating that it shall include:
(3) A statement of the assignments of error presented for review, with reference to the place in the record where each error is reflected.”

(7) An argument containing the contentions of the appellant with respect to each assignment of error presented for review and the reasons in support of the contentions, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and parts of the record on which appellant relies. The argument may be preceded by a summary. (Emphasis added)

¶ 18 Here, appellant asserts that the trial court would not rule on appellant’s pro se motions “because he authored them.” However, our review reveals that the trial court did, in fact, rule on appellant’s motions and, as the state highlights, many of the filings are apparently questions for potential witnesses rather than actual motions. Thus, because appellant fails to adequately set forth a plausible argument, we overrule his final assignment of error and affirm the trial court’s judgment.

JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
JUDGMENT ENTRY

It is ordered that the judgment be affirmed and that appellee recover of appellant the costs herein taxed.

The Court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.

It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this Court directing the Jackson County Common Pleas Court to carry this judgment into execution.

If a stay of execution of sentence and release upon bail has been previously granted by the trial court or this court, it is temporarily continued for a period not to exceed sixty days upon the bail previously posted. The purpose of a continued stay is to allow appellant to file with the Supreme Court of Ohio an application for a stay during the pendency of proceedings in that court. If a stay is continued by this entry, it will terminate at the earlier of the expiration of the sixty day period, or the failure of the appellant to file a notice of appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio in the forty-five day appeal period pursuant to Rule II, Sec. 1 of the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Additionally, if the Supreme Court of Ohio dismisses the appeal prior to expiration of sixty days, the stay will terminate as of the date of such dismissal.

A certified copy of this entry shall constitute that mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.

FIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT OF OHIO
HAMILTON COUNTY, OHIO

STATE OF OHIO, Respondent-Appellee,

vs. 

JOHN LONG, Petitioner-Appellant.

APPEAL NO. C-170529
TRIAL NO. B-0402803

O P I N I O N.

Criminal Appeal From: Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas
Judgment Appealed From Is: Reversed and Cause Remanded
Date of Judgment Entry on Appeal: October 17, 2018

Joseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Philip R. Cummings, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for Plaintiff-Appellee,

John W. Long, pro se.
Per Curiam.

{¶1} Petitioner-appellant John Long appeals the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court’s judgment denying his “Request for Leave to Request Public Records Pursuant to ORC 149.43(B)(8) and * * * State ex rel. Caster v. City of Columbus.” We reverse the court’s judgment.

{¶2} Long was convicted in 2004 of murder. We affirmed his conviction on direct appeal. State v. Long, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-040643 (Oct. 26, 2005), appeal not accepted, 108 Ohio St.3d 1489, 2006-Ohio-962, 843 N.E.2d 794. And after remanding for correction of his sentence in 2010, see State v. Long, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-100285, 2010-Ohio-6115, we affirmed the denial of postconviction petitions filed between 2012 and 2014. See State v. Long, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-140420 (Mar. 20, 2015); State v. Long, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-130566 and C-130605 (June 13, 2014), appeal not accepted, 140 Ohio St.3d 1466, 2014-Ohio-4629, 18 N.E.3d 446; State v. Long, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-120521 (Apr. 24, 2013), appeal not accepted, 136 Ohio St.3d 1476, 2013-Ohio-3790, 993 N.E.2d 779.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
100-Long,"No. The error is not alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is alleging that the trial court erred in denying Long's ""Request for Leave to Request Public Records.""","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶3} In 2015, Long again filed with the common pleas court a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to R.C. 2953.21 et seq., seeking relief from his conviction on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In his 2015 postconviction petition, Long asserted that evidence outside the trial record, in the form of a stranger’s unsolicited letter to him and a written report submitted to his trial counsel by an investigator assigned to his case, revealed the existence of statements made by eyewitnesses to law enforcement that exonerated him in the murder. He sought relief from his conviction on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct, in failing to disclose that exculpatory evidence in discovery, and ineffective assistance of counsel, in failing to discover the evidence and present it in his defense.
Then, in 2016, in an effort to gain access to information contained in public records to support his pending postconviction claims, he filed with the common pleas court his “Request for Leave to Request Public Records.” The court denied the request upon its determination that Long “failed to demonstrate under R.C. 149.43(B)(8) that he is entitled to the records.”

In this appeal, Long advances a single assignment of error contending that the common pleas court erred in denying his “Request for Leave to Request Public Records.” We agree.

**Jurisdiction**

We determine, as a preliminary matter, that the common pleas court’s entry denying Long an R.C. 149.43(B)(8) justiciable-claim finding constituted a final appealable order, because it was entered in a special proceeding and affects a substantial right. See R.C. 2505.03(A); 2505.02(B)(2). Accord State v. Heid, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 14CA3655, 2014-Ohio-4714, ¶ 4-6.

**An Inmate’s Access to Public Records**

Ohio’s Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43 (“the Act”), mandates that public records be made accessible and available upon request. R.C. 149.43(B)(1). Courts are to construe the Act’s provisions liberally in favor of broad access, resolving any doubt in favor of disclosure of public records. State ex rel. McCaffrey v. Mahoning Cty. Prosecutor’s Office, 133 Ohio St.3d 139, 2012-Ohio-4246, 976 N.E.2d 877, ¶ 16.

The Act’s grant of broad access to public records does not, however, extend to a convicted inmate seeking public records pertaining to his prosecution or the investigation leading to his prosecution. Under R.C. 149.43(B)(8),

A public office or person responsible for public records is not required to permit a person who is incarcerated pursuant to a criminal conviction * * * to inspect or to obtain a copy of any public record
concerning a criminal investigation or prosecution * * *, unless the request to inspect or to obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose of acquiring information that is subject to release as a public record under this section and the judge who imposed the sentence or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the judge's successor in office, finds that the information sought in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be a justiciable claim of the person.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
100-Long,No. The text above is not describing an assignment of error. It is discussing the legal interpretation of a statute and the process for a convicted inmate to access public records. The allegation is not against the prosecutor but rather against the trial court for denying a request for a justiciable-claim finding.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
See State ex rel. Russell v. Thornton, 111 Ohio St.3d 409, 2006-Ohio-5838, 856 N.E.2d 966, ¶ 14 (construing similarly-worded former R.C. 149.43(B)(4) to declare that R.C. 149.43(B)(8) evinces the General Assembly's “public-policy decision to restrict a convicted inmate's unlimited access to public records in order to conserve law enforcement resources”).

A Justiciable Claim

{¶9} Under the Act, a convicted inmate is entitled to access to information pertaining to his investigation or prosecution only after he has secured from his sentencing judge or the judge's successor a “finding * * * that ‘the information sought in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be a justiciable claim’.” Thornton at ¶ 16. Long's “Request for Leave to Request Public Records,” filed with the common pleas court before which his postconviction petition is pending, can only be read as a request, preliminary to a public-records request, for a justiciable-claim finding. And the court, in denying that request, must be said to have determined that Long failed to demonstrate that he was entitled to that finding. We disagree with that conclusion.

{¶10} While the Act itself does not define a “justiciable claim,” Ohio courts have described a “justiciable claim” as one that is “properly brought before a court of justice for relief.” See State v. Askew, 2017-Ohio-1512, 89 N.E.3d 55, ¶ 11 (11th
Dist.); State v. Seal, 4th Dist. Highland No. 13CA10, 2014-Ohio-4168, ¶ 8; State v. Rodriguez, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2013-11-011, 2014-Ohio-2583, ¶ 14; State v. Wilson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23734, 2011-Ohio-4195, ¶ 9; see also State v. Dowell, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102408, 2015-Ohio-3237, ¶ 7 (holding that a “justiciable” claim is a claim that is “capable of affording appropriate relief”). The statute’s requirement may be satisfied by “identifying ‘a pending proceeding with respect to which the requested documents would be material.’ ” Wilson at ¶ 5, quoting State v. Gibson, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 06-CA-37, 2007-Ohio-7161, ¶ 14. Accord Dowell at ¶ 7; Seal at ¶ 8; Rodriguez at ¶ 14; see also Askew at ¶ 11-12 (holding that a “justiciable claim” may be demonstrated by, but need not be, a pending claim).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
100-Long,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it discusses Long's postconviction petition, which includes claims of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective counsel. The error being assigned is related to the trial court's denial of Long's request for access to allegedly exculpatory eyewitness statements, not an allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶11} Long filed his “Request for Leave to Request Public Records” with the common pleas court in connection with his pending 2015 postconviction petition. In his request, he sought leave to request access to allegedly exculpatory eyewitness statements to law enforcement that had not been disclosed in discovery or presented at trial. Those statements were material to the prosecutorial-misconduct and ineffective-counsel claims advanced in his petition.

{¶12} And his prosecutorial-misconduct and ineffective-counsel claims were cognizable under R.C. 2953.21 et seq. The claims sought relief from his murder conviction based on alleged constitutional violations during the proceedings leading to that conviction. See R.C. 2953.21(A)(1). The claims were not subject to dismissal under the doctrine of res judicata, because they depended for their resolution upon evidence outside the trial record. See State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph nine of the syllabus.

{¶13} Further, R.C. 2953.23(A)(1) provides jurisdiction to entertain a late or successive postconviction petition if the petitioner demonstrates that he had been unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts upon which his postconviction
claim depends, and that the alleged constitutional error was outcome-determinative. In his petition, Long invoked the jurisdiction conferred under R.C. 2953.23 to entertain a late and successive postconviction petition by alleging outcome-determinative constitutional errors and by arguing that the R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(c) exception to public-records access had precluded his access to necessary records until 2016, when the Ohio Supreme Court held that the exception did not extend past the completion of the criminal procedure for which the requested information had been gathered. See State ex rel. Caster v. Columbus, 151 Ohio St.3d 425, 2016-Ohio-8394, 89 N.E.3d 598, ¶ 47, overruling in part State ex rel. Steckman v. Jackson, 70 Ohio St.3d 420, 639 N.E.2d 83 (1994), and State ex rel. WLWT–TV5 v. Leis, 77 Ohio St.3d 357, 673 N.E.2d 1365 (1997).

We Reverse

¶14 We, therefore, hold that the common pleas court erred in denying Long’s request for, because he had established an entitlement to, a finding for purposes of R.C. 149.43(B)(8) that “the information sought in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be a justiciable claim.” This is not a statement on whether we believe that information exists, on whether it is in the possession of any agency from which Long might seek it, or on the underlying merits of his postconviction petition. We hold only that he is entitled to the finding required for him to make a public-records request. Accordingly, we sustain the assignment of error, reverse the court’s judgment denying that finding, and remand for an entry conforming to the requirements of the statute.

Judgment reversed and cause remanded.

APPEALS from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas

BROWN, J.

¶ 1 In these consolidated appeals, defendant-appellant, Miguel E. Neil, appeals from a decision and entry of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas denying his successive petition for post-conviction relief. By way of background, the following facts are taken from this court’s decisions in State v. Neil, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-981, 2016-Ohio-4762 (""Neil I""), following appellant’s direct appeal of his convictions for 30 counts of robbery and 6 counts of kidnapping in Franklin C.P. Nos. 12CR-5963 and 13CR-4174, and State v. Neil, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-609, 2019-Ohio-2529 (""Neil II""), following appellant’s appeal from the trial court’s denial of his first petition for post-conviction relief.
The charges against appellant ""arose from a series of robberies that occurred in 2011 and two robberies that occurred in 2012."" Neil I at ¶ 2. Appellant was indicted in case No. 12CR-5963 on ""4 counts of robbery and 6 counts of kidnapping arising out of the 2012 robberies,"" and he was indicted in case No. 13CR-4174 ""on 26 counts of robbery and 1 count of kidnapping, arising from 13 separate robberies committed in 2011."" Neil II at ¶ 3.

The trial court joined the indictments for a single trial and, following a jury trial beginning September 24, 2014, the jury returned verdicts finding appellant guilty of 4 counts of robbery and 5 counts of kidnapping in case No. 12CR-5963, and 26 counts of robbery and 1 count of kidnapping in case No. 13CR-4174. The trial court sentenced appellant by judgment entries filed October 31, 2014.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
596-Neil,"No. The assignment of error does not allege misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it alleges that police officers did not obtain a search warrant supported by probable cause for appellant's cell-site location information, and that they misleadingly and falsely presented this information in search warrants and at trial, which prejudiced and deprived appellant of a fair trial.","Context information is below.
---------------------
On November 25, 2014, appellant filed a notice of appeal in case No. 12CR-5963, and on June 17, 2015, he filed a motion for leave to file a delayed appeal in case No. 13CR-4174. This court subsequently granted appellant's motion for leave to appeal, and consolidated the two cases for appeal. In Neil I, this court affirmed the convictions in case Nos. 12CR-5963 and 13CR-4174.

On February 3, 2016, appellant filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief in case No. 12CR-5963. The state subsequently filed an answer and a motion to dismiss the petition. By decision and entry filed October 31, 2016, the trial court denied appellant's request for post-conviction relief and granted the state's motion to dismiss. The trial court, while treating appellant's petition for post-conviction relief ""as having been filed under both case Nos. 12CR-5963 and 13CR-4174, found the petition untimely, and further found appellant failed to invoke an applicable exception under R.C. 2953.23(A) in order for the court to entertain an untimely petition."" Neil II at ¶ 7.

Appellant filed a pro se appeal from the trial court's denial of his petition, raising four assignments of error in which he asserted: (1) the trial court erred in failing to serve notice of service of the judgment entry, (2) the trial court erred in dismissing his post-conviction petition as untimely, (3) the trial court erred in denying his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, fair trial and due process of law, and (4) the cumulative effect of those errors deprived him of his right to a fair trial.
In Neil II, this court found ""no abuse of discretion by the trial court in its determination the petition was untimely and that appellant failed to establish the applicability of a statutory exception that would permit the court to consider an untimely petition."" Id. at ¶ 23. This court thus concluded ""the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the petition for post-conviction relief and properly dismissed it."" Id.

On August 1, 2018, appellant filed a successive petition for post-conviction relief. On August 28, 2018, the state filed an answer and motion to dismiss the petition.

By decision and entry filed December 7, 2018, the trial court denied appellant's petition to vacate or set aside his judgment of conviction or sentence. In its decision, the trial court found appellant's second petition for post-conviction relief to be untimely as to both case Nos. 12CR-5963 and 13CR-4174, and further found none of the exceptions for an untimely petition to be applicable.

On appeal, appellant, pro se, sets forth the following five assignments of error for this court's review:

**Assignment of error one:** Appellant was deprived of his fundamental right to be free from illegal search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States and Ohio Constitution, where police officers did not obtain a search warrant supported by probable cause for appellant's cell-site location information, then misleadingly and falsely presented the CSLI in two other search warrants which also contained multiple omissions, misleading, and false statements, then presented at trial prejudicing and depriving appellant of a fair trial.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
596-Neil,"Yes, the text above is describing an assignment of error that alleges misconduct by the prosecutor. The error specifically states that the prosecutor submitted false testimony that he knew was false, which affected the judgment of the jury to convict the appellant.","Context information is below.
---------------------
**Assignment of error two:** Appellant was deprived of his fundamental right to due process and a fair trial in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States and Ohio Constitution, due to prosecutorial misconduct where the prosecutor submitted false testimony that he knew was false which clearly affected the judgment of the jury to convict appellant.

**Assignment of error three:** Appellant was deprived of his fundamental right to a fair trial in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States and Ohio Constitution when trial counsel ineffectively deprived appellant from presenting evidence and subpoenaing witnesses in his favor.
Assignment of error four: The cumulative effect of these errors deprived appellant of his fundamental right to fair trial in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States and Ohio Constitution.

Assignment of error five: The trial court erred and abused its discretion when it denied appellant's 2953.23 petition denying appellant due process and a fair trial free from false statements from law enforcement and the prosecutor that went directly towards guilt.

¶ 11 We initially address appellant's fifth assignment of error, in which he contends the trial court erred in finding inapplicable any of the exceptions to filing an untimely petition for post-conviction relief under R.C. 2953.23. More specifically, appellant argues the trial court erred in its determination that a recent decision of the United States Supreme Court, Carpenter v. United States, ___ U.S. ___, 138 S.Ct. 2206 (2018), did not apply retroactively to his case on collateral review.

¶ 12 Under Ohio law, ""[a] postconviction proceeding is not an appeal of a criminal conviction, but, rather, a collateral civil attack on the judgment."" State v. Steffen, 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410 (1994). An appellate court applies an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a trial court's denial of a petition for post-conviction relief. State v. Sowell, 10th Dist. No. 07AP-809, 2008-Ohio-1518, ¶ 12, citing State v. Campbell, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-147, 2003-Ohio-6305.

¶ 13 In accordance with R.C. 2953.21(A)(2), a petition for post-conviction relief ""shall be filed no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the date on which the trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals in the direct appeal of the judgment of conviction or adjudication."" In the event no appeal is taken, ""except as otherwise provided in section 2953.23 of the Revised Code, the petition shall be filed no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the expiration of the time for filing the appeal."" R.C. 2953.21(A)(2).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
596-Neil,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is related to the timeliness of the petition and the applicability of a new federal right recognized by the United States Supreme Court in the case of *Carpenter*.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 14 Under Ohio law, ""a court may not entertain an untimely petition unless defendant initially demonstrates either (1) he was unavoidably prevented from discovering facts necessary for the claim for relief, or (2) the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons in defendant's situation."" State v. Sidibeh, 10th Dist. No. 12AP-498, 2013-Ohio-2309, ¶ 11, citing R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a). Further, if a defendant satisfies ""one of those two conditions, R.C.
2953.23(A) requires he also must demonstrate that, but for the constitutional error at trial, no reasonable fact finder would have found him guilty of the offenses of which he was convicted."" *Id.*, citing R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b).

¶ 15 On appeal, appellant does not contend his successive petition was timely under R.C. 2953.21(A)(2). In addressing the issue of timeliness, the trial court noted the trial transcripts in appellant's direct appeal in case No. 12CR-5963 were filed February 2, 2015 and, therefore, appellant's petition ""should have been filed no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the filing of the trial transcript in the Court of Appeals, which is February 2, 2016."" (Dec. 7, 2018 Dec. & Entry at 4.) Because the petition was not filed until August 1, 2018, the court found the petition to be untimely. We agree.

¶ 16 With respect to case No. 13CR-4174, the court found the petition ""should have been filed no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the expiration of his time for filing his appeal, which was December 1, 2015."" (Dec. 7, 2018 Dec. & Entry at 5.) As such, the court found the petition filed on August 1, 2018 to be untimely. Again, we agree with the trial court's determination.

¶ 17 As noted, appellant does not challenge the trial court's finding that his petition was untimely. He argues, however, the United States Supreme Court has recognized a new federal and state right that applies to persons in his situation. Specifically, appellant relies on the United States Supreme Court's recent decision in *Carpenter*, in which the Supreme Court held the government's acquisition of cell-site location information (""CSLI"") records constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment, thereby requiring a warrant in the absence of an exception such as exigent circumstances.

¶ 18 Appellant similarly argued before the trial court that the Supreme Court's decision in *Carpenter* was applicable to his case and, therefore, constituted a timeliness exception under R.C. 2953.23. In addressing this issue, the trial court held that, because appellant's case ""was not on direct appeal when the Supreme Court issued its decision, the *Carpenter* case is not applicable to Defendant's case and may not be considered an exception for an untimely or successive petition."" (Dec. 7, 2018 Dec. & Entry at 6.)

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
596-Neil,"No. The text above is not describing an assignment of error. It is discussing the retroactivity of a Supreme Court decision (Carpenter) and the application of that decision in criminal cases. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor, the trial court, or the defense attorney.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 19 In general, ""[a] new rule issued by the United States Supreme Court is not retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review unless the United States Supreme Court expressly holds it to be retroactive."" *State v. Jackson*, 8th Dist. No. 2017-T-0041,
2018-Ohio-2146, ¶ 33, citing Tyler v. Cain, 533 U.S. 656, 663 (2001). As recently noted by one federal court, the Supreme Court ""did not explicitly state"" that Carpenter was retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. In re Baker, 11th Cir. No. 18-15095-C (Jan. 9, 2019).

¶ 20 In accordance with its decision in Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), the United States Supreme Court has held that ""the retroactivity of our criminal procedure decisions turn on whether they are novel. When we announce a 'new rule,' a person whose conviction is already final may not benefit from the decision in a habeas or similar proceeding."" Chaidez v. United States, 568 U.S. 342, 347 (2013). Rather, ""[o]nly when we apply a settled rule may a person avail herself of the decision on collateral review."" Id. There are, however, ""two narrow exceptions"" to the rule in Teague. Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 486 (1990). Specifically, ""[a] new rule applies retroactively in a collateral proceeding only if (1) the rule is substantive or (2) the rule is a 'watershed rule of criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding."" Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007), quoting Saffle at 495, quoting Teague at 311.

¶ 21 Courts addressing the holding in Carpenter have held that the Supreme Court's decision ""states a new rule."" United States v. Davis, D.C.M.D.Pa., No. 1:13-cr-28 (Apr. 12, 2019) (holding that ""[t]he Carpenter decision clearly carves out a new understanding of the Fourth Amendment, as it applies to wireless data,"" and that the Supreme Court ""did not merely apply prior case law to the facts before it,"" but rather ""stated a new principle on the type of conduct that constitutes a search""); United States v. Williams, D.C.E.D.Mich. No. 2:17-cr-20758-VAR-DRG (Aug. 2, 2018) (holding that the Supreme Court in Carpenter ""announced a new rule that the Government obtaining CSLI constituted a search and can only be legally obtained with a search warrant,"" and therefore ""[g]oing forward, law enforcement * * * will need to demonstrate probable cause"").

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
596-Neil,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The fifth assignment of error is about the retroactive application of the *Carpenter* decision and the jurisdiction of the trial court to consider the petition for post-conviction relief.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 22 Courts have further held that ""[a]lthough Carpenter announced a new rule of law, the Supreme Court did not make the case retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review."" United States v. Marquez, D.C.W.D.Ok., No. CR-12-233-R (Aug. 13, 2018). See also Davis (new rule stated in Carpenter does not apply retroactively on
collateral review; exceptions in *Teague* do not apply as ""the new rule is plainly procedural"" and ""simply does not rise"" to the level of a watershed rule of criminal procedure); *In re Symonett*, 11th Cir. No. 19-12232-F (July 9, 2019) (""The Supreme Court *** has not held that *Carpenter* is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, nor does any combination of cases necessarily dictate its retroactivity.""); *People v. Cutts*, 62 Misc.3d 411, 414 (N.Y.2018) (analyzing *Carpenter* under retroactivity principles of *Teague* and holding that ""defendants whose convictions became final prior to *Carpenter* cannot benefit from its holding"").

{¶ 23} Based on the above authorities, which we find persuasive, we agree with the trial court’s determination in this case that *Carpenter* does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding appellant did not meet the requirements of R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(a) to bring an untimely petition for post-conviction relief. Because appellant did not meet the requirements of R.C. 2953.23, the trial court was without jurisdiction to consider the petition. *State v. Simms*, 8th Dist. No. 83583, 2004-Ohio-3955, ¶ 22.

{¶ 24} Appellant’s fifth assignment of error is not well-taken and is overruled.

{¶ 25} In light of our disposition of the jurisdictional issue under the fifth assignment of error, the issues raised under appellant’s first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error, all addressing the merits of the petition, are moot. See *State v. Dugger*, 10th Dist. No. 06AP-887, 2007-Ohio-1243, ¶ 10.

{¶ 26} Accordingly, appellant’s fifth assignment of error is overruled, his first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error are rendered moot, and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is hereby affirmed.

*Judgment affirmed.*

JUDGMENT: APPLICATION DENIED
RELEASED AND JOURNALIZED: April 9, 2021

Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas
Case No. CR-17-620465-A
Application for Reopening
Motion No. 544984

Appearances:

Michael C. O’Malley, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting
Attorney, and Tasha L. Forchione, Assistant Prosecuting
Attorney, for appellee.

Dazelle Newman, pro se.

EILEEN T. GALLAGHER, P.J.:

¶ 1 On March 16, 2021, the applicant, Dazelle Newman, pursuant to
App.R. 26(B) and State v. Murnahan, 62 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204 (1992),
applied to reopen this court’s judgment in State v. Newman, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.
107944, which this court dismissed as untimely on October 22, 2019. Newman now argues that his appellate counsel should have raised the following issues: (1) The trial court erred in proceeding to trial without holding a hearing or obtaining an evaluation as to Newman’s competency to represent himself. (2) There was insufficient evidence to convict Newman of attempted murder; the evidence could only allow simple assault and vehicular assault. (3) The kidnapping convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. (4) His convictions generally were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. (5) His convictions were the result of police and prosecutorial misconduct. (6) The trial judge had predetermined Newman’s guilt. (7) The photo lineup was unduly suggestive. For the following reasons, this court denies the application to reopen.¹

¹ In State v. Newman, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 109182, 2020-Ohio-5087, this court granted Newman a delayed appeal and on October 29, 2020, affirmed his convictions for attempted murder, kidnapping, aggravated robbery, aggravated burglary, grand theft, aggravated menacing, having weapons while under disability, and criminal damaging. His appellate counsel argued the following assignments of error: (1) The trial court committed error when it abused its discretion by permitting a likely incompetent person to be a pro se litigant and (2) Newman’s convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.
does not proffer good cause, but states in the first paragraph of his application that this motion is being made within 90 days of the October 29, 2020 decision in *State v. Newman*. This is insufficient to provide good cause.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
237-Newman,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is related to the timeliness of the application to reopen and the length of the application, not any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Moreover, the Supreme Court of Ohio in *State v. LaMar*, 102 Ohio St.3d 467, 2004-Ohio-3976, 812 N.E.2d 970, and *State v. Gumm*, 103 Ohio St.3d 162, 2004-Ohio-4755, 814 N.E.2d 861, held that the 90-day deadline for filing must be strictly enforced. In those cases, the applicants argued that after the court of appeals decided their cases, their appellate lawyers continued to represent them, and their appellate lawyers could not be expected to raise their own incompetence. Although the Supreme Court agreed with this latter principle, it rejected the argument that continued representation provided good cause. In both cases, the court ruled that the applicants could not ignore the 90-day deadline, even if it meant retaining new counsel or filing the applications themselves. The court then reaffirmed the principle that lack of effort, lack of imagination, and ignorance of the law do not establish good cause for failure to seek timely relief under App.R. 26(B). Accordingly, this court denies the application as untimely.

Moreover, Newman’s application consists of 71 pages of single-spaced hand-printed pages. Thus, it exceeds the ten-page limit established by App.R. 26(B)(4). This defect provides independent reason for dismissing the application.

---

2 This court notes that the envelope in which the application came is postmarked March 11, 2021.
State v. Peeples, 71 Ohio St.3d 349, 652 N.E.2d 717 (1994), and State v. Stadmire, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 88735, 2011-Ohio-921.

Accordingly, this court denies the application to reopen.

Judgments Appealed From Are: Affirmed
Date of Judgment Entry on Appeal: April 15, 2020

Joseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Alex Scott Havlin,
Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for Plaintiff-Appellee,

Ayinde Khamsi, a.k.a. Ayinde Khamisi, pro se,

Jelani Khamisi, pro se,

Kimberly Khamisi, pro se,

Kaia Khamisi, pro se.
Defendants-appellants Ayinde Khamsi, a.k.a. Ayinde Khamisi, Jelani Khamisi, Kimberly Khamisi, and Kaia Khamisi (collectively “the Khamisis”) appeal convictions for theft under former R.C. 2913.02(A)(3) and tampering with records under R.C. 2913.42(A)(1). Because they were tried together and have filed nearly identical briefs, we have sua sponte consolidated their appeals. We affirm their convictions.

I. Factual Background

Evidence presented at a jury trial showed that the Khamisis had engaged in schemes to steal real property from its rightful owners by filing fraudulent documents. The Khamisis justified their actions by claiming that the properties were abandoned and that they were in the process of establishing ownership through adverse possession.

A. 3610 Washington Avenue

Property located at 3610 Washington Avenue was the former site of the Zion Nursing Care Center. Dr. William Poole was the last remaining member of the board of directors of the nursing home and was attempting to sell the property. Dr. Poole had been devoted to the nursing home and had taken numerous actions to keep it open. He had taken a mortgage on the property in 2008, which was still valid at the time of trial.

When Dr. Poole discovered “squatters” on the property, he called an attorney, Michael Gray. According to Gray, Dr. Poole “forgot to file a statement of continuation with the secretary of state” which caused the organization, Zion
Nursing Care Center, to go “inactive.” Gray discovered that the Hamilton County auditor showed an entity that Dr. Poole did not recognize as the owner of the property. Prior to trial, Dr. Poole passed away. But both his son and Gray testified that although the nursing home was closed and the building was vacant, the property had never been abandoned.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The allegations are against the Khamisis and their actions, including filing false documents, occupying properties, and filing lawsuits without proper registration or authorization.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶5} The Khamisis created an entity with a name similar to and using the same address as the Zion Nursing Care Center by filing paperwork with the secretary of state. Those documents were signed by Kimberly, Ayinde, and Jelani. Jelani was named as the statutory agent. They filed additional documents, including a quit-claim deed, in the Hamilton County recorder’s office that purported to transfer ownership of the property to other entities they had created. They also filed liens on the property. A representative of the Ohio attorney general’s office testified that the Khamisis never registered these alleged charitable entities with the attorney general’s office.

{¶6} Detective Cynthia Alexander of the Cincinnati Police Department began investigating the Khamisis. She discovered several organizations that the Khamisis used in an attempt to gain control of the property at 3610 Washington Avenue.

{¶7} Kimberly filed a quiet-title action against “Zion Nursing Home, Inc.” and “Zion Care Center, Inc.” alleging that she had rightful possession of the property. The trial court in that case determined that Kimberly and her associated entities had no interest in the property and ordered the Hamilton County recorder’s office to strike the quit-claim deed.
B. 215 Mitchell Avenue

Property at 215 Mitchell Avenue was owned by Ruby Red Services, LLC, a business incorporated by Melissa Meade. Meade later died in a car accident, and the house was vacant. Visio Mortgage Services held a mortgage on the property and began foreclosure proceedings. Claiming the property was abandoned, Jelani occupied the property. Subsequently, he and Kimberly filed multiple documents asserting an interest in the property, including a quit-claim deed. Several of the documents were filed after a court had refused to let them intervene in the foreclosure proceedings.

C. 453 Sheffield Road

The Anderson family owned property located at 453 Sheffield Road. Marsha Anderson testified that it was her parents’ house, in which she had been raised. When her mother passed away, she left the property to Marsha and her siblings. Marsha moved out of the home in 2010, leaving it vacant, but continued to make mortgage payments on the home.

Claiming the property was abandoned, Jelani occupied the property. In 2017, he filed a quiet-title action naming all the Anderson siblings as the defendants. A notice about the lawsuit was sent to Marsha’s brother, Michael, who was deceased, at the Sheffield Avenue address. Jelani’s complaint was dismissed when he failed to appear for trial.

Marsha did not know about the action until Detective Alexander notified her about it. She testified that the property was not abandoned and that the quiet-title action was hurtful because the property had belonged to her parents, and she and her sister had taken care of their parents there.
When he filed the quiet-title action, Jelani also filed an affidavit of indigency, in which he claimed had no income. In reality, he was employed by Stepping Stones, a nonprofit agency. He earned $18,979 in 2015, $22,591 in 2016, and $22,574 in 2017.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It provides context about several property disputes involving quiet-title actions, where individuals filed claims against property owners, and the owners' responses to these claims. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor in the provided text.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Melissa Sherrod owned the property located at 533 Glenwood Avenue. Melissa's husband, Shareef Sherrod, testified that he was a real estate broker and investor who bought and rehabbed vacant properties, mostly single-family homes. The properties were put in his wife's name because it was easier for her to get financing, but he was the one who operated the business. He and his wife purchased the property in 2011 with the intent to renovate it and then rent it. He had contractors come out to look at the property for bids. Shereef made sure that the grass was cut every two to three weeks. He secured the property with a lockbox, sealed the windows, and had a neighbor watch out for trespassers.

Ayinde occupied the property, and filed a quiet-title action naming Melissa as a defendant, in which he contended that he had an interest in the property. He also filed an affidavit of indigency. Ayinde's complaint was eventually dismissed for want of prosecution.

The Sherrods had no notice of the action. They only learned of it when Detective Alexander contacted them. Shareef hired an attorney and paid her $500. He testified that he never gave anyone permission to take the property, and he had not abandoned it. He eventually sold the property and received the proceeds.
E. 4945 Paddock Road

{¶16} Terrence Davis owned property located at 4945 Paddock Road. Davis owned a construction company and bought the property to remodel either as a daycare or “living units.” The property was vacant when he bought it. He sealed it with a steel door that could not be entered.

{¶17} Davis had not yet started working on the property, but roofing material had been delivered and was sitting on the roof, when he saw one man and two women walking about the property and looking in the windows. Subsequently, he began the process of cleaning out the property and putting on a new roof.

{¶18} Kaia filed a quiet-title action, naming Davis as a defendant, along with an affidavit of indigency. He received notice of the action in his post-office box. Davis hired an attorney and filed an answer. His attorney made some phone calls and learned of the police’s investigation into similar transactions. He testified that no one had his consent to come onto the property and that it was not abandoned. Kaia’s complaint was eventually dismissed for want of prosecution.

F. 200 Clinton Springs

{¶19} Brenda Willis owned property located at 200 Clinton Springs, which used to be her parents’ house. On January 6, 2017, Kimberly filed a quiet-title action naming as defendants Brenda and her husband, Charles Willis, although only Brenda’s name was on the deed. Kimberly also filed an affidavit of indigency.

{¶20} Brenda stated that her siblings were living in the house until January 2018, and that none of the claims in Kimberly’s complaint were true. She and her husband both filed answers, after which Kimberly dismissed her complaint. Brenda
also stated that the property was not abandoned, and she had never given anyone permission to enter the property.

**G. 3944 Vine Street**

{¶21} Kimberly filed a quiet-title action for property located at 3944 Vine Street, along with an affidavit of indigency. She claimed that the property was abandoned, and she was the possessor of the property. Anchor Holdings, LLC, was the property’s owner. The quiet-title action was dismissed because Kimberly never obtained service on Anchor Holdings. Detective Alexander was unable to locate a representative for the company.

Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors described are related to the convictions of Kimberly, Jelani, Ayinde, and Kaia, and the dismissals of quiet-title actions, but there is no mention of any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.

{¶22} Michael West incorporated 4 Kennedy, LLC, a real estate business, to make money to pay for his daughter’s college tuition. He bought property at 1595 Summit Road in 2015 and began renovations. Kimberly filed a quiet-title action alleging that the property was abandoned and that she had entered the property and claimed title to it.

{¶23} West did not find out about the action until Detective Alexander contacted his wife. He stated that he had not abandoned the property and that he believed that “somebody was trying to steal [his] property.” The quiet-title action was dismissed when Kimberly failed to show up for court. Detective Alexander stated that at that time, Kimberly was aware that the Cincinnati Police Department was investigating the Khamisis.
I. 10508 Toulon Drive

{¶24} James and Imogene Bronson had owned property at 10508 Toulon Drive. The Bronsons passed away, and the survivor identified in the deed was Michelle Reed. Wells Fargo Bank had initiated a foreclosure proceeding. Kimberly filed a quiet-title action against the Bronsons, Reed, and Wells Fargo, along with an affidavit of indigency. She claimed that the property was abandoned and that she was in possession. She also claimed that Wells Fargo did not have a valid mortgage. The case was dismissed for want of prosecution.

J. The Convictions

{¶25} Kimberly was convicted of three counts of tampering with records and three counts of theft. She was sentenced to three years in prison. Jelani was convicted of three counts of tampering with records and three counts of theft. He was sentenced to one year in prison. Ayinde was convicted of two counts of tampering with records and two counts of theft. He was sentenced to two years in prison. Kaia was convicted of one count of tampering with records and one count of theft. She was sentenced to one year in prison. These appeals followed.

II. Structural Error

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The text describes an assignment of error alleging that the trial court committed a structural error, not the prosecutor. The Khamisis are contending that the trial court created a fatal variance between the grand jury's indictment and the bill of particulars and evidence, which they argue failed to give them adequate notice of the alleged criminal conduct, was not supported by sufficient facts, and was falsely procured by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶26} The Khamisis each present four identical assignments of error for review. In all of these assignments of error, they contend that the trial court committed structural error. A structural error is a constitutional defect that affects the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than being an error in the trial process itself. State v. Clinton, 153 Ohio St.3d 422, 2017-Ohio-9423, 108 N.E.3d 1, ¶ 198; State v. Jones, 2018-Ohio-4754, 124 N.E.3d 439, ¶ 19 (1st Dist.). Because a
structural error is deemed prejudicial per se, it requires an automatic reversal. *State v. Davis*, 127 Ohio St.3d 268, 2010-Ohio-5706, 939 N.E.2d 147, ¶ 22; *State v. Furr*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170046, 2018-Ohio-2205, ¶ 3. Most constitutional errors are not structural, and structural errors have been recognized only in limited classes of cases. *State v. Perry*, 101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, ¶ 18; *Furr* at ¶ 4; *Jones* at ¶ 20.

{¶27} In determining whether an error is structural, the threshold inquiry is whether the error involves deprivation of a constitutional right. *State v. Fisher*, 99 Ohio St.3d 127, 2003-Ohio-2761, 789 N.E.2d 222, ¶ 18; *Jones* at ¶ 21. “[T]he trial-error/structural-error distinction is irrelevant unless it is first established that constitutional error has occurred.” *Jones* at ¶ 21, quoting *State v. Esparza*, 74 Ohio St.3d 660, 662, 660 N.E.2d 1194 (1996).

**III. Indictment**

{¶28} In their first assignments of error, the Khamisis contend that the trial court committed structural error “by Creating a Fatal Variance Between the Grand Jury’s Indictment and the Bill of Particulars and Evidence***.” They argue that the indictments failed to give them adequate notice of the alleged criminal conduct with which they were charged, that they were not supported by sufficient facts, and that they were falsely procured by the prosecutor. These assignments of error are not well taken.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it discusses the sufficiency of the indictments and the bills of particulars provided to the accused, and it concludes that there was no error in the process.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶29} Under the United States and Ohio Constitutions, an individual accused of a felony is entitled to an indictment setting forth the “nature and cause of the accusation.” *State v. Sellards*, 17 Ohio St.3d 169, 170, 478 N.E.2d 781 (1985); *State v. Lukacs*, 188 Ohio App.3d 597, 2010-Ohio-2364, 936 N.E.2d 506, ¶ 41 (1st Dist.).
The government must aver all material facts constituting the essential elements of the offense so that the accused has adequate notice and an opportunity to defend. *Sellards* at 170; *Lukacs* at 41. But the indictment need not contain a recitation of the evidence supporting the various facts. *Lukacs* at ¶ 41; *State v. Gingell*, 7 Ohio App.3d 364, 366, 455 N.E.2d 1066 (1st Dist.1982). Generally, the requirements of an indictment may be met by reciting the language of the criminal statute. *State v. Childs*, 88 Ohio St.3d 194, 199, 724 N.E.2d 781 (2000).

{¶30} In this case, the indictments tracked the language of the applicable statutes. Therefore, the Khamisis can demonstrate no error. See *State v. Skatzes*, 104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, ¶ 26; *State v. Murphy*, 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 583, 605 N.E2d 884 (1992).

{¶31} Further, each of the Khamisis was supplied with a bill of particulars. The accused can obtain more specific details by requesting a bill of particulars as provided in Crim.R. 7(E). But the bill of particulars need not provide the accused with specifications of the evidence or serve as a substitute for discovery. *Sellards* at 171; *Lukacs* at ¶ 43; *Gingell* at 367. The indictments and the bills of particulars together were sufficient to apprise the Khamisis of the charges against them. Therefore, they did not give rise to any error, much less structural error. See *State v. Roberts*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-040575 and C-050005, 2005-Ohio-4848, ¶ 9, reversed on other grounds, *In re Criminal Sentencing Statutes Cases*, 109 Ohio St.3d 313, 2006-Ohio-2109, 817 N.E.2d 1174.

Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The Khamisis' arguments are directed at the validity of the indictments and the evidence supporting them, not at any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶32} The Khamisis claimed throughout trial that they had no notice of the offenses with which they were charged. The record shows that they were provided with discovery, and that their claims that they had no notice were trial tactics. They were well aware of the factual basis of the charges against them. They took great
offense that the bill of particulars described them as “squatters,” and they argue that squatting is not necessarily illegal. The purpose of the bill of particulars is to provide notice. The use of the word is not improper, but even if it were, its use did not affect the validity of the notice.

{¶33} The Khamisis also argue that the indictments were not supported by sufficient and credible evidence. The grand jury, in inquiring into crimes and offenses returning indictments, does not exercise a judicial function. An indictment and subsequent proceedings based on that indictment are not rendered invalid on the ground that illegal and incompetent testimony was heard by the grand jury. Villasino v. Maxwell, 174 Ohio St. 483, 484-485, 190 N.E.2d 265 (1963); State v. Cunningham, 1st Dist. Warren No. 54, 1975 WL 181079, *4 (Dec. 29, 1975); Wickline v. Alvis, 103 Ohio App. 1, 9-10, 144 N.E.2d 207 (10th Dist.1957).

{¶34} Thus, an indictment valid on its face is not subject to challenge on the ground that the grand jury acted on the basis of inadequate or incompetent evidence. United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 344-345, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974); State v. Blalock, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 80419 and 80420, 2002-Ohio-4580, ¶ 24. “An indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury, like an information drawn by a prosecutor, if valid on its face, is enough to call for the trial of the charge on the merits.” Villasino at 485; Blalock at ¶ 24.

{¶35} In this case, the indictments were valid on their faces. Therefore, the Khamisis cannot challenge the evidence supporting the indictments. It appears they are actually trying to challenge the weight and sufficiency of the evidence at trial, but they have not raised assignments of error to that effect. Because they failed to raise assignments of error challenging the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, we need
not address those issues. See State v. Harris, 2017-Ohio-5594, 92 N.E.3d 1283, ¶ 43 (1st Dist.).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The text above describes an assignment of error by the Khamisis against the trial court, not the prosecutor. The Khamisis are alleging that the trial court committed misconduct by denying them the right to represent themselves.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶36} Finally, under these assignments of error, the Khamisis argue that their not-guilty pleas were entered against their wishes. Crim.R. 11(A) provides that if a defendant refuses to plead, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty on behalf of the defendant. A not-guilty plea does not admit any facts and does not waive any of the defendant's rights, including the right to have the prosecution prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Schaeffer, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA92-04-038, 1993 WL 106146, *1 (Apr. 12, 1993). Because the Khamisis refused to enter pleas, the court could do so on their behalf and they were not prejudiced by the application of this rule. See Cleveland Metroparks v. Sferra, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106341, 2018-Ohio-3169, ¶ 22. Consequently, we overrule the Khamisis' first assignments of error.

IV. Self-Representation

{¶37} In their second assignments of error, the Khamisis argue that the court committed structural error by denying them the right to represent themselves. Both the United States Supreme Court and the Ohio Supreme Court have recognized a criminal defendant's right to represent himself or herself at trial without counsel when the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily chooses to waive counsel. See Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 819-820, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975); State v. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, ¶ 23-24; Furr, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170046, 2018-Ohio-2205, at ¶ 6. The right to represent oneself is “thwarted when counsel is forced upon an unwilling defendant, who alone bears the risks of a potential conviction.” State v. Obermiller, 147 Ohio
The record does not show that the Khamisis were denied their rights to represent themselves. Originally, the trial court had recognized their rights to represent themselves and had advised them it was bad idea. Subsequently, the Khamisis refused to sign written waivers of counsel, although they had indicated that they wished to represent themselves. The trial court, believing that a written waiver was required, told them they would be appointed lawyers.

Crim.R. 44 governs the procedure for waiver of counsel in “serious offense” cases. A “serious offense” includes any felony. Crim.R. 2(C). Under Crim.R. 44(A), when a defendant is unable to obtain counsel, counsel must be assigned to represent the defendant in all stages of the proceedings, unless the defendant, after being fully advised of his right to counsel, knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waives his right to counsel. Furr at ¶ 7. The waiver must be made in open court and must be in writing. Crim.R. 44(C).

Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors and issues described in the text are related to the trial court's handling of the case and the Khamisis' self-representation, not the actions of the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
But, the written waiver is not constitutionally required, so a trial court needs only to substantially comply with Crim.R. 44. Martin, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, at ¶ 38; Furr, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170046, 2018-Ohio-2205, at ¶ 8. A court substantially complies with Crim.R. 44 when it makes a sufficient inquiry to determine whether the defendant fully understands and intelligently relinquishes the right to counsel. Martin at ¶ 39; Furr at ¶ 8.

At the next hearing, the trial court stated that it had made a mistake because only substantial compliance with Crim.R. 44 was required. It then informed the Khamisis of the nature of the charges, the range of allowable punishments, possible defenses to the charges and “the other facts essential to a broad
understanding of the whole matter.” See State v. Gibson, 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 377, 345 N.E.2d 399 (1976); Furr at ¶ 9. It also explained the disadvantages of self-representation and that they would be required to follow the same rules and procedures that normally govern the conduct of a trial. See Furr at ¶ 9; State v. Murphy, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170390, 2018-Ohio-1063, ¶ 6. The court then determined that they knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily waived their rights to counsel.

¶42 The Khamisis then represented themselves throughout the trial. Many of the issues of which they now complain were the result of their inexperience and lack of counsel. A defendant who elects to represent himself cannot complain about the quality of his own defense. Faretta, 422 U.S. at 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562, fn. 46.

¶43 One of the Khamisis’ complaints involves an order the trial court journalized early in the proceedings. The court ordered the clerk of courts to remove the case completely from display on the clerk’s website. It also stated that all parties had to seek leave of court before obtaining copies of any filings in the case. The record shows that the court made that order because the Khamisis had attempted to evade arrest, and they were not all arrested at the same time.

¶44 The case was later assigned to a visiting judge. When the Khamisis argued that the order prevented them from defending themselves, the court said that “my interpretation was that some documents were being attempted to be filed in this case while one or more of you had an outstanding warrant; that was the rationale that I thought for the issuance of that order.” The court agreed to rescind the order, which was vacated less than four months after it was journalized.
The court also offered to grant a continuance. The Khamisis initially refused and argued about the alleged lack of notice and jurisdiction. After a lot of back-and-forth, the court granted a continuance. In fact, the court went to great lengths to ensure that the Khamisis received transcripts of the various hearings and had access to the internet at the jail. Thus, they were not prevented from preparing a defense.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The error is not alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The text states that the prosecutor merely told the potential jurors during voir dire that the defendants had the right to not appear in jail garb, and that was their choice. The Khamisis were not prejudiced by this statement.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Next, the Khamisis argue that because they represented themselves they were forced to appear in front of the jury in jail garb. Courts have recognized that a defendant may be prejudiced by appearing in jail clothing, but a defendant may purposefully elect, as a matter of trial strategy, to stand trial in that attire. See Estelle v. Williams, 425 U.S. 501, 504-505, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976); State v. Gandy, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-050804, 2006-Ohio-6282, ¶ 4. There is no rule requiring all convictions in which the defendant has worn jail clothing be overturned. Instead, the inquiry focuses on whether the accused's appearance before the jury was compelled. Gandy at ¶ 4.

The Khamisis raised the issue about the same time that they were arguing about the order removing the case from the clerk of court's website, which did not allow the parties to file any documents at that time without leave of court. Kaia said that she had asked her caseworker about wearing regular clothing, and the caseworker had said they could not “do anything” without an order from the trial court. The trial court stated, “See, this is one of the major disadvantages you have by not having an attorney, because the attorney would immediately ask that you be permitted to wear civilian clothes.” Then a public defender who was involved in the case said that his office had a bank of clothes and “we can try to get them in civilian clothes if they are interested.” They all said they were not interested.
Thus, they were not compelled to appear before the jury in jail clothing. They chose to do so. Further, the court said that it would instruct the jury that it should not hold the fact that they were wearing prison garb against them. The Khamisis said they didn’t want the instruction as they were preparing their own jury instructions.

The Khamisis further argue that the prosecutor addressed the issue even though he was instructed not to, which is untrue. Moreover, the prosecutor merely told the potential jurors during voir dire that “[t]he State and the Court have also offered these defendants [the] right to not appear in jail garb as well; that was their choice to do that, and you will not hold that against them, will you?” Therefore, the Khamisis were not prejudiced.

Next, the Khamisis argue that their family member, Kijai, was denied the right to advise them and to file documents on their behalf. They also argue that she was imprisoned for three days without probable cause. The record shows that the trial court found her in contempt for giggling and laughing in the court room and interrupting the court. Nothing in the record shows that that finding of contempt was improper. Moreover, the Khamisis lacked standing to raise the issue of the validity of that contempt finding. Litigants may assert their own rights, not the rights of third parties. Util. Serv. Partners, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., 124 Ohio St.3d 284, 2009-Ohio-6764, 921 N.E.3d 1038, ¶ 49; In re K.C., 2017-Ohio-8383, 99 N.E.3d 1061, ¶ 5 (1st Dist.).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed any misconduct. The errors alleged are against the trial court, including denying the right to an impartial judge, ignoring jurisdiction, denying the right to represent themselves, setting excessive bail, and misstating the law and facts.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Further, while the Khamisis had the right to represent themselves, they did not have the right to have a nonattorney advise them or file anything on their behalf. Only a licensed attorney may file pleadings on behalf of another in
court. R.C. 4705.01; State ex rel. Army of Twelve Monkeys v. Warren Cty. Ct. of Common Pleas, 156 Ohio St.3d 346, 2019-Ohio-901, 126 N.E.3d 1113, ¶ 5.

{¶52} Finally, the Khamisis make numerous references to excessive bail. Habeas corpus is the proper remedy to raise a claim of excessive bail in pretrial-release cases. Chari v. Vore, 91 Ohio St.3d 323, 325, 744 N.E.2d 763 (2001); State v. Towns, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 88059, 2007-Ohio-529, ¶ 20. After conviction, any error concerning pretrial bail is moot, and the issue cannot be raised on direct appeal. State v. Knisley, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22897, 2010-Ohio-116, ¶ 25; Towns at ¶ 20. Consequently, we overrule the Khamisis’ second assignments of error.

V. Impartial Judge/Jurisdiction

{¶53} In their third assignments of error, the Khamisis argue that the trial court committed structural error by denying their right to an impartial judge. They argue that the trial court was biased against them, ignored jurisdiction, denied their right to represent themselves, set excessive bail, and misstated the law and the facts. These assignments of error are not well taken.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
890-HARDING,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is focused on the trial judge's potential bias and the Khamisis' arguments regarding the fairness of the trial.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶54} First, as a general rule, a direct appeal is not the proper place to raise an argument that the trial judge was biased. The proper avenue for redress when a party believes that a trial judge is biased is the filing of an affidavit of bias and prejudice with the Supreme Court of Ohio as provided for in R.C. 2701.03. Gandy, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-050804, 2006-Ohio-6282, at ¶ 22. The Khamisis filed affidavits of bias and prejudice against the original trial judge, which the Ohio Supreme Court denied.
But even if we address the merits of the issue, the Khamisis’ arguments still fail. A trial before a judge who is not impartial results in structural error that would require reversal without a harmless-error analysis. *State v. Sanders*, 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 278, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001); *State v. Buck*, 2017-Ohio-8242, 100 N.E.3d 118, ¶ 82 (1st Dist.). The Ohio Supreme Court has described judicial bias as “a hostile feeling or spirit of ill will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and facts.” *Buck* at ¶ 83, quoting *State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt*, 164 Ohio St. 463, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956), paragraph four of the syllabus.

A trial court is presumed to be fair and impartial. *In re Disqualification of Kilpatrick*, 47 Ohio St.3d 605, 606, 546 N.E.2d 929 (1989); *Gandy* at ¶ 23. The Khamisis have failed to overcome this presumption relating to the original trial judge or the visiting judge. The judges’ failure to provide the relief to which the Khamisis believe they were entitled does not establish actual bias. See *State v. Jackson*, 149 Ohio St.3d 55, 2016-Ohio-5488, 73 N.E.3d 414, ¶ 40. Further, the fact that the Khamisis had filed litigation against the judges or that the judges had presided over the civil quiet-title actions, without more, does not establish bias. See *In re Disqualification of Pokorny*, 135 Ohio St.3d 1268, 2013-Ohio-915, 986 N.E.2d 993, ¶ 4; *In re Disqualification of Bryant*, 117 Ohio St.3d 1251, 2006-Ohio-7227, 885 N.E.2d 246, ¶ 4.

Answer:"
890-HARDING,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors alleged are against the trial court and the visiting judge.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
The Khamisis argue that both judges ignored their motions. Both judges simply refused to reconsider the same motions they had already ruled on that the Khamisis continued to raise time and again. When a court fails to rule on a
pending motion, we presume that the court elected to overrule it. *State v. Smith*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-180439 and C-180604, 2019-Ohio-5350, ¶ 13.

{¶58} Next, the Khamisis contend that the visiting judge imposed his own morality upon the proceedings. The remarks about which they complain occurred at the sentencing hearing where the judge asked how they could morally justify taking other people's property. This is a proper consideration at sentencing. *See State v. Arnett*, 88 Ohio St.3d 208, 221-222, 724 N.E.2d 302 (2000); *State v. Brown*, 11th Dist. Geauga No. 2003-G-2504, 2004-Ohio-1843, ¶ 35; *State v. Golson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 17707, 2001 WL 227372, *7* (Mar. 9, 2001).

{¶59} The Khamisis argue that even though the visiting judge tried the case, they were prejudiced because the bailiff was the original trial judge's sister, which they did not learn until after trial. Much of this argument involves matters outside the record on appeal, which we cannot consider. *See State v. Ishmail*, 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 405-406, 377 N.E.2d 500 (1978); *State v. Dieterle*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-070796, 2009-Ohio-1888, ¶ 49. Nothing in the record shows that the bailiff influenced the jury or acted in a way to deny the Khamisis a fair trial.

{¶60} Finally, the Khamisis argue that both judges ignored their lack of jurisdiction, which was actually the crux of their arguments throughout the proceedings. They fail to understand the nature of subject-matter jurisdiction. Subject-matter jurisdiction involves a court's power to hear a case. *State v. Mbodj*, 129 Ohio St.3d 325, 2011-Ohio-2880, 951 N.E.2d 1025, ¶ 10.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The text above describes the Khamisis' assignments of error against the trial court, not the prosecutor. The allegations are against the trial court for denying their rights to a public trial, a jury of their peers, and a fair trial, as well as for ignoring jurisdiction, denying them the right to represent themselves, setting excessive bail, misstating the law and facts, and failing to be impartial. There are no allegations of misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶61} Section 4(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution provides that “[t]he courts of common pleas and divisions thereof shall have such original jurisdiction over all justiciable matters and such powers of review of proceedings as may be provided by law.” R.C. 2931.03 provides that jurisdiction over all crimes and
offenses is vested in the court of common pleas, general division, unless jurisdiction is specifically and exclusively vested in other divisions of the court or in the lower courts. *State ex rel. McMinn v. Whitfield*, 27 Ohio St.3d 4, 5, 500 N.E.2d 875 (1986). Moreover, “[a]bsent a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court with general subject-matter jurisdiction may determine its own jurisdiction.” *State ex rel. Brown v. Luebbers*, 137 Ohio St.3d 542, 2013-Ohio-5062, 1 N.E.3d 395, ¶ 12. The court had jurisdiction to hear the case, and the fact that it did not agree with the Khamisis’ arguments does not mean that the court lacked jurisdiction.

{¶62} In sum, nothing in the record shows that the trial court violated its duty of impartiality or behaved in a way that deprived the Khamisis of a fair trial. *See State v. Brewster*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-030024 and C-030025, 2004-Ohio-2993, ¶ 68-69; *State v. Johnson*, 140 Ohio App.3d 385, 391-392, 747 N.E.2d 863 (1st Dist.2000). Consequently, we overrule the Khamisis’ third assignments of error.

**V. Public Trial/Jury Issues**

{¶63} In their fourth assignments of error, the Khamisis contend that the trial court committed structural error by denying their rights to a public trial, a jury of their peers, and a fair trial. They argue that the trial court ignored jurisdiction, denied them their rights to represent themselves, set excessive bail, misstated the law and facts, and failed to be impartial. These assignments of error are not well taken.

{¶64} Some of arguments the Khamisis make under these assignments of error are a rehash of arguments we have already rejected. As to the right to a public trial, the United States and Ohio Constitutions guarantee an accused the right to a public trial. *Waller v. Georgia*, 467 U.S. 39, 46, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31
The violation of the right to a public trial is considered structural error and not subject to the harmless-error analysis. *Waller* at 49-50; *State v. Drummond*, 111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.3d 1038, ¶ 50.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
890-HARDING,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is related to the trial court's decision regarding the exclusion of spectators during the voir dire process and the potential denial of the defendant's right to a public trial.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶65 The right to a public trial is not absolute, and in some instances, must yield to other interests. The trial court has broad discretion to exercise control over the proceedings. The court may order the exclusion of spectators as long as it does not inappropriately deny the defendant’s right to a public trial. *Drummond* at ¶ 51; *State v. Curtis*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150174, 2016-Ohio-1318, ¶ 17.

¶66 The record does not show that the trial court closed the courtroom. Prior to voir dire, the Khamisis claimed that they were told that nobody, with the exception of Kimberly’s mother and her “counselor,” would be able to attend. The trial court indicated that it had concerns about the lack of space for potential jurors. It stated that “[w]ell, that was for purposes of voir dire, and that’s just a matter of we’ve got no place to put anybody.” It went on, “I have no problem with anybody being in here as long as they don’t pose a security risk. * * * I don’t care if you fill up with your community or other people or the general public.”

¶67 The Khamisis complained that “[i]t wasn’t relayed that way” and “it’s too late, because it’s now the jury selection process and my community is not here that’s too late for that one.” The court replied that “as soon as we get the jury, hopefully one of your people can let the community know that they’re welcome to be here.”

¶68 Federal courts have held that exclusion of a defendant’s friends or family members because of a lack of space does not deprive the defendant of the right to a public trial. *See Bunn v. Lopez*, E.D.Cal. No. 2:11-cv-1373, 2016 WL
Moreover, the record is inconclusive as to whether any one was actually excluded from the courtroom at any time. We cannot hold, without more, that the Khamisis were denied the right to a public trial. See State v Williams, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26014, 2012-Ohio-5873, ¶ 10.

Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it discusses the Khamisis' argument that they were denied a jury of their peers because none of the jurors were aware of the doctrine of adverse possession. The focus is on the composition of the jury, not the actions of the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Next, the Khamisis argue that they were denied a jury of their peers because none of the jurors were aware of the doctrine of adverse possession. A jury of one’s peers means a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community. Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 527, 95 S.Ct. 692, 42 L.Ed.2d 690 (1975); State v. Seymour, 5th Dist. Richland No. 03-CA-37, 2004-Ohio-3835, ¶ 53. A defendant is entitled to a qualified panel of citizens “selected by the best method that thoughtful men, who are cognizant of the practicalities of selection and the inherent problems involved, have been able to develop.” State v. McCarter, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-830823, 1984 WL 6715, *2 (July 25, 1984), quoting State v. Strodes, 48 Ohio St.2d 113, 115, 357 N.E.2d 375 (1976), vacated on other grounds, 438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1978).

Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error, but it does not allege that the prosecutor (the state) committed misconduct. The error is directed at the trial court for not instructing the jury on the issue of adverse possession.","Context information is below.
---------------------
To establish a violation of this requirement, the defendant must prove, among other things, that the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community. State v. Fulton, 57 Ohio St.3d 120, 566 N.E.2d 1195 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus; State v. Ford, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014CA00145, 2015-Ohio-4093, ¶ 19. People aware of adverse possession are not a distinctive group in the community. A criminal defendant has no affirmative right to a jury of a particular racial, gender or age composition, much less one aware of certain legal doctrines. See Seymour at ¶ 54. Thus, the Khamisis have to failed show that they were not tried by a jury of their peers.
Finally, the Khamisis argue that they were denied a fair trial because the jury was not instructed on the issue of adverse possession. The trial court must fully and completely give all jury instructions that are relevant and necessary for the jury to weigh the evidence and to discharge its duty as the trier of fact. *State v. Comen*, 50 Ohio St.3d 206, 553 N.E.2d 640 (1990), paragraph two of the syllabus; *State v. Robinson*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-060434, 2007-Ohio-2388, ¶ 18. A trial court must give a defendant’s requested instructions to the jury if they are correct, pertinent statements of law and are appropriate under the facts of the case. *State v. Lessin*, 67 Ohio St.3d 487, 493, 620 N.E.2d 72 (1993); *Brewster*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-030024 and C-030025, 2004-Ohio-2993, at ¶ 58.

The Khamisis’ defense at trial was that the properties were abandoned and they were in the process of establishing adverse possession of the properties. The trial court instructed the jury regarding whether property was abandoned, but refused to give an instruction on adverse possession because the evidence did not warrant it. We agree with the trial court’s decision.

Adverse possession is disfavored in the law, as it is in contravention of the ideals set forth in the Constitution protecting life, liberty and property. *Houck v. Bd. of Park Commrs. of the Huron Cty. Park Dist.*, 116 Ohio St.3d 148, 2007-Ohio-5586, 876 N.E.2d 1210, ¶ 29; *Grace v. Koch*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-950802, 1996 WL 577843, *2-3 (Oct. 9, 1996), affirmed, 81 Ohio St.3d 577, 692 N.E.2d 1009 (1998). Title is strictly construed in favor of the person holding legal title and against the adverse claimant. *Grace* at *3.

Answer:"
890-HARDING,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on adverse possession, and it is not directed at the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
A person seeking to establish adverse possession must show exclusive possession that is open, notorious, continuous, and adverse for 21 years. *Evanich v. Bridge*, 119 Ohio St.3d 260, 2008-Ohio-3820, 893 N.E.2d 481, ¶ 7; *Grace* at *3. The
Khamisis, by their own admission, had not been in possession of any of the properties for 21 years. Therefore, an instruction on adverse possession was not supported by the evidence.

{¶75} Despite their attempts to justify their conduct, the record is clear that they were never anything but trespassers and had no legal interest in the properties at all. They cannot show that they were entitled to the properties by adverse possession. “A claim for continuing trespass may be brought at any time until the claim has ripened into a presumptive right by adverse possession, which takes 21 years.” Reith v. McGill Smith Punshon, Inc., 163 Ohio App.3d 709, 2005-Ohio-4852, 840 N.E.2d 226, ¶ 50 (1st Dist).

{¶76} Simply put, attempting to establish adverse possession is not a defense to a charge of theft or tampering with records. The trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury on adverse possession. The Khamisis were not denied their rights to a fair trial, and we overrule their fourth assignments of error.

VI. Summary

{¶77} In sum, we find no merit in any of the Khamisis’ assignments of error. They have not demonstrated that the trial court committed reversible error, much less structural error. Therefore, we overrule all of their assignments of error, and we affirm the trial court’s judgments.

Judgments affirmed.

FIFTH APPELLATE DISTRICT

STATE OF OHIO : Hon. W. Scott Gwin, P.J.

For Defendant-Appellant
KOLT HUNT PRO SE
#A759551
Belmont Correctional Institute
68158 Bannock Road
St. Clairsville, OH 43950
Appellant Kolt L. Hunt appeals the August 20, 2020 judgment entry of the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas denying his petition for post-conviction relief. Appellee is the state of Ohio.

Facts & Procedural History

In 2019, appellant was found guilty by a jury of two counts of child endangering, one violation of R.C. 2919.22(B)(1) and (E)(2)(d), a felony of the second degree, and one violation of R.C. 2919.22(A) and (E)(2)(c), a felony of the third degree. Appellant appealed his convictions and sentence to this Court, arguing: his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence; his convictions were based upon insufficient evidence; ineffectiveness of trial counsel for failing to object to Dr. Benton’s testimony regarding the pain the child would have experienced during and after appellant beat him; and prosecutorial misconduct, amounting to the denial of due process. In State v. Hunt, 5th Dist. Tuscarawas No. 2019 AP 07 0023, 2020-Ohio-1124, this Court overruled appellant’s assignments of error and affirmed appellant’s convictions and sentence. Appellant filed an application for reconsideration. This Court denied his application for reconsideration on January 6, 2021.

On August 3, 2020, appellant filed a petition to vacate or set aside conviction and sentence, arguing he was denied due process of law, denied effective assistance of counsel, and subject to cruel and unusual punishment. Appellee filed an objection to the petition on August 10, 2020.

On August 20, 2020, the trial court issued a judgment entry denying the petition. The trial court stated it, “reviewed the petition of the Defendant and the
objections set forth by the State of Ohio.” Further, the trial court found, “that the petition to vacate or set aside judgment of conviction or sentence is not well taken and should be denied.”

Appellant appeals the August 20, 2020 judgment entry of the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas and assigns the following as error:

“I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING PETITIONER HUNT AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING IN REGARD TO HIS PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF.

Answer:"
268-Hunt,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error against the trial court, not the prosecutor. The error alleges that the trial court erred in denying the petition for post-conviction relief without making the required findings of fact and conclusions of law as per R.C. 2953.21.","Context information is below.
---------------------
“II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ISSUING INADEQUATE AND ERRONEOUS FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW IN REGARD TO PETITIONER HUNT’S PETITION FOR POST-CONVICTION RELIEF.”

II.

We first address appellant’s second assignment of error because it is dispositive of appellant’s appeal. Appellant argues in his second assignment of error that the trial court erred in denying his petition for post-conviction relief without making findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by R.C. 2953.21. We agree.

R.C. 2953.21(H) states, “if the court does not find grounds for granting relief, it shall make and file findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall enter judgment denying relief on the petition.” If a court fails to do so, the decision is subject to reversal on appeal. State v. Reese, 5th Dist. Muskingum No. CT2017-0017, 2017-Ohio-4263; State ex rel. Penland v. Dinkelacker, -- N.E.3d ----, 2020-Ohio-3774.

The findings of fact and conclusions of law should be explicit enough to give the appellate court a clear understanding of the basis of the trial court’s decision and
enable it to determine the grounds on which the trial court reached its decision. *State v. Jacks*, 5th Dist. Licking No. 99 CA 113, 2000 WL 329740 (Feb. 29, 2000), citing *State v. Lester*, 41 Ohio St.2d 51, 322 N.E.2d 656 (1975). The purpose of requiring the trial court to include findings of fact and conclusions of law in its judgment entry is to sufficiently apprise both the petitioner and the potential appellate court of the grounds for its decision. *State v. Staats*, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2015CA00207, 2016-Ohio-2921.

{¶11} The Supreme Court has held that a trial court “need not issue findings of fact and conclusions of law when it dismisses an untimely [post-conviction-relief] petition.” *State ex rel. Kimbrough v. Greene*, 98 Ohio St.3d 116, 2002-Ohio-7042, 781 N.E.2d 155. If a petition for post-conviction relief is untimely, the trial court had no clear duty to issue findings of fact or conclusions of law. *Dillon v. Cottrill*, 5th Dist. Muskingum No. CT2014-0053, 2015-Ohio-1785. Further, a trial court “has no duty to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law on successive * * * petitions for post-conviction relief.” *State ex rel. George v. Burnside*, 118 Ohio St.3d 406, 2008-Ohio-2702, 889 N.E.2d 533.

Answer:"
268-Hunt,No. The text above is not describing an assignment of error alleging misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the timing of the filing of the post-conviction petition and the application of a state of emergency declaration that tolled the deadline.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶12} This is the first post-conviction petition appellant filed and is therefore not a successive petition. Appellee contends the trial court was not required to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law because appellant’s petition was not timely filed. Appellant filed a direct appeal of his sentencing entry. Pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(A)(2), a petition for post-conviction relief must be filed no later than 365 days after the date on which the trial transcript is filed with the court of appeals in the direct appeal of the judgment of conviction. In this case, the transcript in appellant’s direct appeal was filed on July 30, 2019. Thus, pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(A)(2), appellant’s petition had to be filed by July 29, 2020. Appellant filed his petition on August 3, 2020.
However, on March 9, 2020, the Governor of the State of Ohio issued Executive Order 2020-01D and declared a state of emergency in Ohio in response to COVID-19. On March 27, 2020, the Governor of Ohio signed into law Am.Sub.H.B. No. 197, which immediately tolled, retroactively to March 9, 2020, all statutorily established statutes of limitations, time limitations, and deadlines in the Ohio Revised Code and Administrative Code until July 30, 2020. In re Tolling of Time Requirements Imposed by Rules Promulgated by Supreme Court & Use of Technology, 158 Ohio St.3d 1447, 2020-Ohio-1166, 141 N.E.3d 974. The Ohio Supreme Court determined that this tolling order applied to all filing deadlines within the applicable period. Id. The deadline for appellant’s petition in this case fell within the emergency period. Because the deadline falls within the emergency period, it is tolled effective March 9, 2020. 223 days had already passed before the deadline was tolled. Once the emergency period ended, appellant had 142 days left after July 30, 2020, to file his petition. Accordingly, appellant’s petition was timely.

Appellee also contends appellant failed to submit substantive grounds for relief and that his claims are barred by res judicata. However, this analysis is relevant to whether appellant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing, not to a determination of whether findings of fact and conclusions of law in the trial court’s judgment entry are sufficient to apprise the petitioner and this Court of the grounds for its decision. State v. Atkinson, 5th Dist. Muskingum No. CT2019-0055, 2019-Ohio-3122; R.C. 2953.21(D); R.C. 2953.21(H).

268-Hunt,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the trial court's failure to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, and denying the petition for post-conviction relief without stating reasons.","Context information is below.
---------------------
In this case, the trial court did not make any findings of fact and conclusions of law, and denied the petition for post-conviction relief without stating its reasons for denying the petition. We therefore sustain appellant’s second assignment of error and
reverse and remand this matter to the trial court to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. We will not address appellant’s first assignment of error, as it is moot based upon our disposition of appellant’s second assignment of error. Further, appellant filed a motion on January 20, 2021 regarding leave to file additional pages to his brief and leave to add an additional assignment of error to his brief. We also find this motion moot based upon our disposition of appellant’s second assignment of error.

¶16 Based on the foregoing, the August 20, 2020 judgment entry of the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas is reversed and remanded to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Attorney for Defendant-Appellant
Adam L. Jones appeals from the trial court’s denial of his petition for post-conviction relief following an evidentiary hearing.

In his sole assignment of error, Jones contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying his petition, which alleged that his trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance by, among other things, failing to retain an expert witness to rebut the prosecution’s case at trial.

I. Procedural and Trial Factual Background

The record reflects that a jury convicted Jones on one count of child endangering, a second-degree felony. The 2014 conviction stemmed from a head injury sustained by “Marianne,” the four-year-old daughter of Jones’ girlfriend, while the child was in his care. On August 5, 2010, the child’s mother and Jones put the child down for a nap in an upstairs bedroom of the house where they were living with friends and the friends’ children. The mother then left the house, and Jones was the only remaining adult with Marianne and the friends’ children. Jones said he then went downstairs and watched the friends’ children play a video game. Within about 20 minutes, he said he went back upstairs and found Marianne lying on her side on the floor. He testified that her eyes were rolled back in her head, and she was gurgling. Jones carried the child to a neighbor’s house and called for help. A paramedic arrived and transported the child to Upper Valley Medical Center (UVMC). Her mother also responded to the hospital. She testified that at UVMC the child had a large knot on the left side of her forehead and bruising on the left

ear, neither of which was there when she left the child at home with the appellant. Marianne’s mother testified that the remains of the knot were also visible in State’s photo Exhibits 11 and 12, taken several days after the incident, which depict an obvious abrasion on the left forehead. At UVMC, the child was unconscious, had a CAT scan performed, had a ventilator with a breathing tube applied, and then was care-flighted to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.

340-Jones,No. The text above is not describing an assignment of error. It is a detailed description of the medical procedure performed by Dr. Charles Stevenson during the surgery on the child's brain. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor in this text.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 4 In Cincinnati, Dr. Charles Stevenson, a pediatric neurosurgeon, confirmed the existence of a large blood clot, or hematoma, in the subdural space over the left side of the child’s brain. Due to the size of the hematoma in the confined skull, pressure had pushed the brain dramatically, about three-quarters of an inch [2 cm], to the right. Dr. Stevenson performed surgery “to remove the [left] side of the skull and take it off as one large piece.” (T-2, 15). He saw an active hemorrhage. At trial, he explained:

[S]o we open up, we widely open up the membrane that’s containing the clot. And then at that point in time you can see the clot. It is large, it is red, it’s under significant pressure, and once you release it, it normally starts to extrude itself; the brain starts to extrude it out towards you. And so what we very quickly do then is use gentle irrigation and instruments to remove

2 We perceive the more current and common term is “CT” scan, and the UVMC report refers to “CT Head C.” But because the transcript generally refers to the test as a “CAT” scan, we often use that term.

3 The transcripts of the three-day jury trial are designated Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3, but the pages for each volume serially begin at number 1. Consequently, we refer to the jury trial transcript as T-1, T-2 and T-3 and then by page number of that volume. The post-conviction evidentiary hearing transcripts also are designated Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3, and are serially numbered beginning at 1 for each volume, and there is the separate deposition of Dr. Kenneth Monson. We refer to these as T-PCR-1 T-PCR-2, and T-PCR-3 and Monson Depo., and then by page number.
all of this clot off the surface of the brain. And as you do that, you can see the underlying surface of the brain, * * * *

This then continues for several minutes, because you want to be able to remove all of the clot or as much as you safely can, and typically what happens is at some point, when you remove some bit of the clot, you’re going to find the underlying blood vessels that are actually responsible for the bleeding, all right, those blood vessels that were injured that started bleeding to cause the hematoma.

And in this case, we definitely found that. There are very large set of veins at the top of all of our brains that run in the center and just off to each side. And she had significant amount of active hemorrhage from these, which I was able to identify as soon as I removed the clot in that region. I then spent several minutes stopping this bleeding.

When asked if this was “fresh blood,” Dr. Stevenson stated:

Yes. The vast majority of this blood that was either forming clot in various stages, that was either a few hours old or there were some just liquid blood that was so fresh that it had not yet had time to clot off. Especially near the regions of the veins that she had bleeding, there was just active spurting of blood that was pooling and had not yet clotted off.

Q. Okay. So there’s fresh blood that had collected and then still active bleeding-

A. Yes.

(T-2, 16-17).
The only documentary evidence introduced at trial regarding the UVMC CAT scan—two photocopies of CAT scan image slices (State’s Exhibits 15 and 16)—had been referred to on direct examination of Dr. Stevenson. Upon cross examination, defense counsel referred to these exhibits as follows:

---------------------
Q. Okay and you had indicated that the bright white part is new blood, okay. But that brown, or the darker layer could be several different things, okay. One of the things that you had indicated that it could be old blood. Correct? Okay. If a person suffered a minor subdural hematoma, okay, where there was bleeding, okay, but we didn’t remove the blood, okay, and there are those cases, correct?

A. Yes there are.

***

Q. Okay. All right. With this, it's possible is it not doctor that the darker images there [Exhibit 15 or 16] reflect that there has been prior bleeding in this brain?

A. Based purely off the CAT scan images, that’s always a consideration, yes.

(T-2, 32) (Emphasis added). And upon further questioning, Dr. Stevenson reiterated:

Q. Okay in looking at this CAT scan, is it possible that this could be an acute [new or fresh] on chronic [old]?

A. Based purely off of the CAT scan, there is a chance that that could be the case yes.
On re-direct examination, Dr. Stevenson testified that he did not note any indication of a prior subdural hematoma in his report, but if during surgery he had visually observed what he believed to be indication of a prior “minor” subdural hematoma he would have noted it:

* * * because it would make a difference in terms of what was done procedurally, and what the patient’s prognosis would be expected to be.

Q. And there was nothing in – correct me if I’m wrong, there was nothing in your review of the scans from July 25th or the previous nasal injury to suggest that there was any sort of minor subdural hematoma?

A. Not to the best of my knowledge, no.

Q. When you performed this surgery, and you actually had the opportunity to look at this child’s brain, is there – was there anything there to you that was suggesting – did you believe this to be an old injury, or did you believe this to be a fresh injury?

A. Well the injury that we were treating emergently was absolutely fresh injury. She had a very large clot, only some of which is actually depicted on these images that we had here. The volume of the clot was quite extensive. The clot itself was new, organizing blood, and she had active bleeding, active hemorrhage out into the operative field, pooling there. So all of that was absolutely new.

Q. Okay. And does a – if a – although you didn’t see any evidence of a minor subdural hematoma, does a small subdural hematoma cause a
large, acute subdural hematoma like you saw in [Marianne] when you treated her?

A. No it does not.

Q. So there would have to have been some separate event that caused the acute subdural hematoma that you witnessed?

A. Yes.

(T-2, 44-45). Dr. Stevenson’s testimony also included that subdural hematomas almost always are caused by traumatic injuries including, for example, motor-vehicle collisions or falls from a significant height such a second-story window or, possibly, the top of a bunk bed.

{¶ 6} Fortunately, within days of the surgery, the child made a “dramatic recovery” and was able to open her eyes, breathe on her own, and begin talking.

{¶ 7} In Jones’ defense, through Dr. Stevenson and other witnesses, his attorney asserted that Marianne was a medically-fragile child who suffered from a rare condition known as VATER Association.4 As a result of that condition, she had undergone approximately 25 surgeries, including multiple abdominal organ transplants. Defense counsel also cross examined the State’s medical experts about a fall that Marianne had experienced about three weeks earlier on July 17, 2010. On that occasion, Marianne tripped in the kitchen and fell face-first onto the floor, hitting her nose. A few days later, a doctor examined the child during a regularly-scheduled visit and concluded that her nose

---

4 This condition is now more accurately known as VACTERL Association due to the recognition of additional potential defects. It typically refers to the presence of at least three of a recognized group of birth defects tending to have a non-random occurrence. Because the numerous transcript references use the term “VATER,” we use it here.
was fine. In the days following the fall, the child was not lethargic and she engaged in normal activities. On July 25, 2010, however, the child awoke with a bruised, swollen nose and yellow drainage. The child's mother took her to the hospital, where a CAT scan revealed two nasal fractures. Marianne underwent emergency surgery to treat an infection behind the fractures, and she remained hospitalized until August 3, 2010 while receiving intravenous antibiotics.

Defense counsel theorized at trial that the large subdural hematoma Marianne experienced two days later on August 5, 2010 may have been related to the child's complex medical condition, the fracture she experienced when she fell on July 17, 2010, and the resulting infection she suffered. In particular, defense counsel suggested that Marianne's fall on July 17, 2010 may have caused a small hematoma that re-bled and became larger when the child jumped or fell from her bed on August 5, 2010. Dr. Stevenson, the treating pediatric neurosurgeon, agreed that such a scenario ""theoretically"" could occur if there was an older, minor subdural hematoma followed by ""a repeat trauma to the exact, same place."" He added, however, that he had never seen such a situation and did not see evidence of an older, minor hematoma when treating Marianne. There was no evidence from any witness that she had reinjured her nose. Dr. Stevenson also testified that he had seen the facial CAT scan that had been taken earlier, which had revealed the broken nose, and although it only shows limited images of the brain, there was no indication of a prior clot and no indication of a shift of the brain from left to right. Finally, Dr. Stevenson found no connection between Marianne's serious injury and either her VATER Association or her recent nasal fracture. As indicated in testimony previously quoted, he testified there was nothing to suggest a prior minor chronic
hematoma.

Answer:"
340-Jones,No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It is a description of Dr. Kathi Makoroff's testimony and her explanation of the cause of Marianne's subdural hematoma. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor in the provided text.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Dr. Kathi Makoroff, who was called by the State, is a pediatrician who specializes in child abuse and is board certified in that field. She has been practicing in that capacity at Cincinnati Children’s Medical Center for 17 years. At the time of her March 2014 testimony, she said she was the chair of the Ohio Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect, and president of the Ray Helfer Society, an honorary society for physicians practicing in the area of child abuse. She was a consultant in Marianne’s treatment, and ruled out causes of the child’s subdural hematoma other than a traumatic injury involving “a great bit of force.” She explained: “We do see these types of injuries in kids who have severe car accidents and are ejected from the car or [in] very severe accidents. Kids who have very severe falls, like falling out of the—out of a window, you know, not on the first floor of the house but subsequent floors of the house, and we also see it in children with inflicted injury or abusive head trauma when they come in and they have injuries similar to—to—to what we see on [Marianne’s] CAT scan.” (T-2, 65). Dr. Makoroff ruled out as a possible cause of Marianne’s injury a jump or a fall from the child’s bed:

So I could also rule out that history of a—of a roll off of a bed or even a jump off a—off of a bed from something so small, you know, thirteen inches off of the floor and onto carpet, which, you know, obviously has some padding to it; the carpet itself has—has some padding properties to it. And so I’m left with inflicted injury or abusive head trauma.

*** Right so it goes back to your question about the amount of force required. So even though we can’t give you—we can’t give you a number
of the amount of force, it certainly lies between kids who, and you know, most people know someone—know a child and maybe some of the Jurors were that child who, you know, went down the steps on a skateboard because it was fun, or was klutzy or climbed a lot and had lots of falls, and those kids don’t end up like this. Those kids don’t come into the emergency room emergently and then require surgery to evacuate the blood. So even though those kids are either klutzy or very sort of rambunctious and often doing things and—and hitting their head requiring sutures or staples, you know, to—because they’re hitting their head and getting—and getting lacerations, they still don’t—they still don’t cause these types of injuries. But the really more forceful types of mechanisms, like a car accident, do. So the answer to your question is even the rambunctious child who is maybe jumping on the bed and even hits their head in the room, just—just—it’s not—it’s not enough injury to cause this type of subdural.

* * * So again, I can’t rule out there wasn’t an impact to her head; I mean she doesn’t have a skull fracture, but just because there isn’t a skull fracture doesn’t mean she wasn’t impacted especially if she was impacted onto a soft surface. That may be enough of an impact to cause injury, but not enough of an impact, or an impact onto the wrong type of surface to cause a skull fracture. Or certainly a shaking; if she was picked up and shaken violently, that would cause these types—this type of subdural, these types of injuries. And of course there’s no impact there; she wasn’t actually impacted onto a hard or soft surface, which would go along with her not
having a skull fracture.

(T-2, 72-78).

{¶ 10} Dr. Makoroff stated that even a prior minor subdural hematoma, followed by “a trivial fall like falling out of a bed thirteen inches” high, would not have caused Marianne’s injury. She opined that the child’s injury was caused by “abusive head trauma,” which she explained is the current terminology for what previously was known as “shaken-baby syndrome.” Dr. Makoroff testified that “shaken-baby syndrome” is an “old term” that means the “same exact thing” as “abusive head trauma.” In essence, Dr. Makoroff used the process of elimination to conclude that Marianne’s injuries were not accidental.

{¶ 11} Dr. Makoroff also rejected the scenarios proposed by defense counsel. Her opinion ruled out the possibility that a “short fall” could have caused Marianne’s subdural hematoma on August 5, 2010. She testified that a “short fall” potentially could “cause a subdural” but not a large one like this child suffered:

[Y]es, injury – a fall, and I have seen these – these cases my – myself, many of them, where a fall does cause a – a subdural. In those cases, there is frequently a skull fracture, and then there is a small amount of subdural blood underneath the skull fracture, and no damage to the surrounding brain at all. So I just want to be clear that I would answer your question yes, a short fall can cause a subdural, but no a short fall wouldn’t cause a subdural like [Marianne] suffered.

(T-2, 92).

{¶ 12} Dr. Makoroff also rejected the idea that the hematoma on August 5, 2010
was a “re-bleed” of a prior hematoma that resulted from the child’s earlier fall and nasal fracture. She explained:

Answer:"
340-Jones,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The text discusses the testimony of Dr. Makoroff and the defense attorney's cross-examination, but it does not mention any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
So first of all I can rule that out with [Marianne]. Now to be very clear, when she had a CAT scan for her nose, they didn’t image all of her brain; they imaged a good part of it in looking at the note, but they didn’t do a brain CT, they did a facial CT on her, so they did see a good bit of her brain in that it all looked normal. So for your theory to work, she would have had—had to of had a large enough subdural initially, and they would have picked it up on that CAT scan. So I can feel confident saying no for that reason. I can feel confident also saying no because if [Marianne] suffered a re-bleeding, she would not have been symptomatic the way she was. She—she was not really conscious, and her brain was being affected by the re-bleed, and that’s never really been described in re-bleeding, and she required neurosurgery to take out the blood. And so that’s why I can rule that out.

I can also rule it out because Dr. Stevenson, and I talked to Dr. Stevenson after the surgery and read his operative report, would have seen this within the hematoma. He would have seen a bunch of older, trying to heal blood, with new blood as well. And he did not see that.

(T-2, 94-95). Also in response to defense cross examination, she stated:

So as you pointed out, I wasn’t there, you weren’t there, so I – I don’t know what happened, you don’t know what happened, but I can tell you what didn’t happen. So it wasn’t related to any of her past medical history.
It – it wasn’t a direct cause of her nasal fracture from – from July, and it
didn’t happen from her falling off of a bed or even jumping off of her bed
and jumping into something in her room, if that in fact happened.

(T-2, 100-101).

¶ 13 Dr. Makoroff was also cross examined in regard to a study in which a short
fall resulted in a subdural hemorrhage. She expressed ample familiarity with the study of
Dr. John Plunkett regarding falls from playground equipment, which some have used to
support that a subdural hematoma, and even death, can result from a short fall. Ultimately
though, her testimony was as we previously quoted, “a short fall wouldn’t cause a
subdural like [Marianne] suffered.” (T-2, 92).

¶ 14 On re-direct examination, Dr. Makoroff also testified that very few accidental
falls in children “result in retinal hemorrhages” and that the retinal hemorrhages Marianne
experienced were larger and “more diffused throughout the whole retina” than what might
occur in a short fall. Dr. Makoroff added:

*** So when we see retinal hemorrhages we don’t—we—we—we—we—
we, you know, again, it’s a very sort of short list of medical causes; many of
them the same as subdursals that can cause retinal hemorrhages, none of
them [Marianne] had. And so then if we are left with injury, same thing as
what I just testified to. Short household falls, even if we say they can cause
retinal hemorrhages, which is rare, they don’t cause retinal hemorrhages to
the degree of which [Marianne] had.

(T-2, 116).

Answer:"
340-Jones,No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The allegation is against the trial court for imposing an eight-year prison sentence and the defense attorney for not calling experts to rebut the prosecution's experts.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 15 Dr. Michael Gray, a pediatric ophthalmologist at Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital, testified that the retinas of both of Marianne’s eyes had many and diffuse multi-layered retinal hemorrhaging. He said there could be several causes for this, and he looks for bleeding problems, infection in the eye, or a history of trauma. Regarding trauma he testified “generally it's to cause hemorrhages or bleeding in the retina, it would have to be severe trauma; usually head trauma.” (Id. at 124). He also testified that swelling of the brain, “brain edema by itself does not lead to retinal hemorrhages.” (Id. at 135).

¶ 16 As indicated, Jones’ defense at trial consisted primarily of his attorney cross examining the State’s witnesses about Marianne’s multiple medical problems, the possibility of re-bleeding of an old hematoma, whether a short fall could cause a subdural hematoma, and the several possible causes of retinal hemorrhage. Counsel was able to obtain several admissions regarding the possibility of the defense theories though not sufficient for the State’s witnesses to alter their opinions. Defense counsel called no experts to rebut the prosecution’s experts. The only defense witness was Jones. He testified that he went upstairs and found Marianne on the floor, limp and non-responsive. He denied striking, throwing, or shaking the child. He also denied becoming angry or frustrated with the child. He testified that he had no idea how her injuries occurred.

¶ 17 In closing argument, the prosecutor stressed that “no doctor or any other witness ever said there is an old injury that’s related to the injury [Marianne] suffered on August 5, 2010.” The prosecutor described Jones’ “story” as “simply inconceivable” and argued that it “defies medical evidence[.]”

¶ 18 After considering the evidence presented, the jury found Jones guilty on one count of child endangering. The trial court imposed an eight-year prison sentence. This court affirmed on direct appeal, rejecting arguments challenging the manifest weight
and legal sufficiency of the State's evidence and an argument alleging prosecutorial misconduct. With regard to the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, this court reasoned:

In the case before us, the circumstantial evidence is compelling that Jones physically abused Marianne, and thereby caused her serious physical harm. When Marianne was left in his care, she did not have the brain injury that she had after she was in his care. He was the only adult in her presence. By his admission, the three other children in the house were on another floor, playing a video game.

Drs. Stevenson and Makoroff ruled out possible causes of Marianne's injury other than physical abuse, either in the form of impact to Marianne's head against a soft surface, or severe shaking. Under the circumstances, a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that Jones was the person who caused Marianne's injury, if not intentionally, at the very least recklessly, since a reasonable person would know that the impact to Marianne's head or the severe shaking necessary to cause her injury would likely cause her serious physical harm.

Answer:"
340-Jones,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is not directed at the prosecutor but rather at the trial court's decision to deny post-conviction relief. The text discusses the evidence presented by both the defense and the state, but it does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 19 In December 2014, Jones filed an R.C. 2953.21 petition for post-conviction relief with supporting evidentiary materials. (Doc. #43). Those materials included an affidavit and report from Dr. Robert Rothfeder, a board-certified emergency room physician with more than 30 years of experience in emergency medicine involving all
varieties of adult and pediatric trauma, including brain-injury cases. The materials also included an affidavit from Kenneth Monson, a PhD associate professor in mechanical engineering and an adjunct assistant professor in bioengineering at the University of Utah, and an affidavit from Dr. Marvin Miller of Dayton Children’s Hospital addressing the proper terminology for VATER Association. Finally, the materials included an affidavit from Jones’ trial counsel, Andrew Wannemacher, who explained that he knew he needed the assistance of an expert witness and that his failure to obtain one was not a “strategic move.”

¶ 20 One of the documents attached to the post-conviction submission was the first page of an apparent two-page UVMC “CT Head C” scan report which, appellant points out, stated: “[T]here is a left hemispheric acute on chronic subdural hematoma.” What appellant does not reference is that the document also states: “Given the acute on chronic nature of this finding, nonaccidental trauma must be suspected.” (Petition, Exhibit E). The trial court scheduled the post-conviction petition for an evidentiary hearing.

¶ 21 The trial court held a three-day hearing on Jones’ petition in May and June 2015. Jones presented testimony from Dr. Rothfeder and attorney Wannemacher as well as the videotaped deposition testimony from Monson. The State countered with testimony from its own expert, Dr. Robert Shapiro from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.

¶ 22 Dr. Rothfeder, also a lawyer, trained as an internist and practiced as an emergency-room physician for more than 30 years, a discipline in which he was board certified in 1996. He treated adults and children and estimated that about half were children. He left emergency-room practice in 2006. He said he continued with a part-time, about one-half, clinical practice until he retired from patient care at the end of 2013. He
has not had a practice dedicated specifically to pediatrics, and he is not a neurologist. He said that over the past ten years he has developed a focused interest in child abuse and infant brain injury. He spends the vast majority of his professional time consulting on medical issues most of which are child abuse head-injury cases. In the last ten or fifteen years, he has testified only for the defense. He estimated he has testified between one and two hundred times on this topic.

{¶ 23} Based on his review of the case, including Marianne’s extensive medical records, Dr. Rothfeder opined that the child’s serious medical problems related to VATER Association made her more “fragile” and vulnerable to the injury she sustained in this case. Dr. Rothfeder has encountered only a “couple” VATER Association patients in his career, but his treatment of them was for something peripheral. He acknowledged he has no clinical experience working with children with this association. (T-PCR-1, 23). Yet he opined that she was generally a “fragile” child who was “more vulnerable to injury of any type. * * * I mean what she’s made of just isn’t as strong and viable as the tissue would be in a normal individual.” (Id. at 41).

Answer:"
340-Jones,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is being assigned to the defense attorney for failing to call the treating physicians and radiologists as witnesses.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 24} Dr. Rothfeder explained that he had reviewed a CAT scan of the serious subdural hematoma taken after the incident. Although he was not specifically qualified as a radiologist or neurologist, he opined that the scan revealed the presence of “new” blood and older blood, signifying the existence of a “chronic subdural” and an “acute subdural”

* * * [W]hen you look at the scan there’s—there’s mixed density in the hematoma. In other words, the—the—the tissue and the blood products that are seen on the scan look different in terms of the white and black densities depending on the composition of the fluid and in this scan there
was a mixed density which indicated that the subdural consisted of a chronic subdural, that is blood which had been present for a period of time which was not new and which had been present for at least a number of weeks and possibly longer, perhaps months even. And within that there was acute bleeding. So there was new bleeding into the chronic subdural and that—that's a phenomenon that we refer to as re-bleeding of a chronic subdural and something that's seen not uncommonly with chronic subdural

(T-PCR-1, 26-27). Notably, however, the CAT scan itself was not separately introduced into evidence. Nor was the original radiologist's report, the first page of which we indicated was attached to the petition, otherwise entered as an exhibit. Nor was the radiologist called by Jones' counsel in post-conviction proceedings even though the petition argued, in “Ground III” of the incidents amounting to ineffective assistance of counsel, that Jones’ trial counsel was deficient “when his attorney failed to call the Upper Valley Medical Center treating physicians and radiologists as witnesses.” (Petition at 38).

{¶ 25} When asked, Dr. Rothfeder did not render an opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to the cause of what he surmised was a chronic subdural hematoma, and he could not indicate when it originated. Rather, he indicated that “one of the possibilities” was Marianne’s fall on July 17, 2010, which resulted in the nasal fracture and infection. He added:

*** However, it's entirely possible that you know other unwitnessed head trauma that the child might have had at some point in the past could have caused it or medical condition that’s—that complicated things could have caused it. For instance, when the nasal hematoma and the result[ing]
infection occurred, a potential complication of an infection in the head like that would be clotting or thrombosis in one of the veins inside the head that—that feeds the dura or that drains the dura and it's known among other things that—what we call cortical venous thrombosis. Thrombosis of one of those veins can be a cause of subdurals. So a variety of possibilities are—are in play and the—the only one that I can really identify specifically as potentially causative would relate to the—the trauma that caused the nasal fracture ten days or a couple of weeks preceding the August event.

T-PCR-1, 30.

{¶ 26} With regard to the acute subdural hematoma that led to Jones’ conviction, Dr. Rothfeder testified:

* * * The way that chronic subdurals can re-bleed relates to the specific anatomy and pathology of the subdural. Once a chronic subdural forms, a membrane forms over the subdural and the membrane contains tiny little immature blood vessels and those—those vessels are subject to re-bleeding and it’s thought that re-bleeding in these instances, in these small blood vessels in the membrane of a subdural can—it’s thought that those things—that re-bleeding of these things can occur in the absence of trauma, spontaneously or with mild trauma which might otherwise be incidental.

It's not the kind of thing that physicians have a perfect handle on. So everything I'm talking about
remains in a – a state of incomplete understanding as – as medicine presently exists.

(T-PRC-1, 31-32).

{¶ 27} Dr. Rothfeder further testified that one of the underlying bases for his opinions was that “on top of that [his chronic re-bleed possibility] one thing we haven’t discussed but I believe is contributory is the fact that on top of everything else, blood testing when she was admitted to Cincinnati Children’s indicated that the state of her blood coagulation was not normal at that point in time.” (Id.) (Emphasis added). In more than three pages of transcript testimony, he specifically described this poor coagulation and how “it would have contributed to the expansion of the new bleed.” That testimony is similar to the portion of Dr. Rothfeder’s affidavit, submitted with the petition, where he was critical of Dr. Makoroff’s trial testimony to the effect that Marianne’s coagulation was normal. He went on to expound upon how the abnormal coagulation made this case “as complex in terms of many different things going on as any I’ve seen,” (Id. at 33). And, he testified her coagulation “was not safe.” (Id. at 36). But he was wrong. On cross examination, it was pointed out that he had incorrectly referred to the coagulation testing from 9:16 p.m. in the evening of admission, after the intensive medical intervention of a two-hour brain surgery with multiple medications, and not the coagulation testing at the time of admission at 4:40 p.m. in the afternoon. He had to admit that he was incorrect and, contrary to his affidavit and hearing testimony, that her coagulation studies were normal upon admission when the hematoma had already formed.

Answer:"
340-Jones,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The focus of the text is on the testimony and opinions of Dr. Rothfeder regarding the cause of Marianne's injury and the diagnosis of abusive head trauma. There is no mention of any misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 28} Dr. Rothfeder did acknowledge that what looks like “new” blood and “old” blood when analyzing a hematoma on a CAT scan can be new blood that’s moving. In
his opinion, formed from review of only the CAT scan, “that did not appear to me to have been the case with this mixed density [blood].” When Rothfeder was cross examined about Dr. Stevenson’s testimony that Stevenson saw no old blood upon surgically viewing Marianne’s brain, Dr. Rothfeder testified he relies on “what I’ve been told by neurosurgeons” (Id. at 49) that it is entirely possible that evacuation of an acute hematoma wouldn’t allow visualization of old blood somewhere else in the subdural space. So, in Dr. Rothfeder’s estimation, the absence of old blood doesn’t rule out its presence. However, his direct testimony about his own reading of the CAT scan had been that the old blood and new blood was in the same place. After describing what he believed was a chronic subdural, he said that “within that [his suspected chronic subdural] there was acute bleeding. So there was new bleeding into the chronic subdural ** * *.” (Id. at 27).

¶ 29 With regard to the cause of Marianne’s injury on August 5, 2010, Dr. Rothfeder opined: “** * * I mean this is the farthest thing from a—a simple case to attempt to analyze and—and draw conclusions from and—and I think that—that really explains the—you know the opinions that I’m attempting to express here in saying that I don’t believe it’s—it’s really possible to draw definite conclusions in terms of the cause of that acute subdural with any reasonable certainty.” (Id. at 33). In his ultimate conclusion, Dr. Rothfeder stated: “I don’t think that given everything I’ve discussed that it’s possible to—to conclude that those injuries were the result of child abuse.” (Id. at 37). A fair evaluation of his testimony is that he does not believe in the diagnosis of abusive head trauma because one cannot divine intent from an unobserved mechanism of injury. He agrees the diagnosis is accepted by the majority of pediatricians and the position papers of the
number of organizations that support the diagnosis, which he gratuitously referred to as “the political statements that derive from those organizations.” (Id. at 54).

¶ 30 On cross examination, Dr. Rothfeder expressed his belief that a biomechanical engineer would be better suited than Dr. Makoroff to assess whether a short fall could have caused Marianne’s injury. While acknowledging that biomechanical engineers typically do not work in emergency rooms, he explained: “Well, the—if the—the kinematics and so forth of an injury were rarely—were really rarely contributory to what I was doing in the emergency room. I mean for instance if—if someone comes in you know with a history of a particular injury, my job is to diagnose and treat the injury.” Concerning Dr. Makoroff’s opinion, and consistent with his rejection of the abusive head trauma diagnosis, he added:

* * * [W]e’re not dealing with an issue of medical treatment. Dr. Makoroff’s role in this case didn’t involve contributing to the treatment in this case. It involved coming to a medical legal conclusion and I think that physicians have nothing more than anecdotal experience to attempt to conclude for instance whether a you know a—a particular short fall could have caused a given injury. That's why I'm critical. (Id. at 46).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
340-Jones,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors being discussed are related to the opinions of the expert witnesses and the medical diagnosis, not the actions of the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 31 With regard to the alleged “abusive head trauma” at issue, Dr. Rothfeder opined that “the medical diagnosis really is head trauma” and that “whether it’s abusive or not is a medical legal conclusion.”

¶ 32 Dr. Rothfeder additionally maintained that the presence or absence of retinal hemorrhages in this case had no diagnostic value to him, partially because he
believed they could have been caused by the “presence of an expanding subdural hematoma” (Id. at 52) itself, which in his opinion had an uncertain cause. Rothfeder was not qualified as an ophthalmologist, and the foregoing opinion was directly contrary to the previously quoted testimony of Dr. Gray, the only ophthalmologist who testified in this record. Finally, he disputed whether severe shaking ever can damage bridging veins in the brain and result in a subdural hematoma.

¶ 33 Jones’ other expert witness, Kenneth Monson, testified via video deposition. Monson, who holds a doctorate in mechanical engineering, also did three years of post-doctoral work in conjunction with the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of California San Francisco. There he collaborated with neurosurgeons in studying the application of force and resulting trauma. In addition, he filled a research position at a brain and spinal injury center. His doctoral thesis involved “mechanical and failure properties of human cerebral blood vessels.” The study concerned “the response of the cerebral blood vessels to head trauma.”

¶ 34 Monson testified that, based on his experience and study, the acceleration levels from shaking someone are too low to produce a head injury such as bleeding on the brain. According to Monson, the lowest level of G-forces that might injure a six-month-old child is 50Gs, whereas a subdural hematoma might be expected to result at around 85Gs. Monson testified, however, that the peak accelerations associated with shaking are around 15Gs. He stated that these numbers are peer reviewed and generally accepted. He testified that greater G-forces would be required to injure an older child.

¶ 35 Monson also discussed “short falls” that might occur inside a residence. He recognized that a multitude of variables must be considered to assess whether the force
involved could produce a given injury. They include the height of the fall, whether the head impacted, what part of the head impacted, the characteristics of the floor, whether anything broke the fall, any physical acceleration before the fall (such as jumping or running), etc. With regard to Marianne's specific injury at issue, Monson, who admits he is not trained in medicine (Monson Depo. at 51), opined:

So, if—if she had been standing on the bed, for example, and somehow managed to get herself to the point of the floor, whatever that was—I don't know what the distance from the bed was where she was found, so I don't know if that's feasible.

But if she were standing on the bed and fell and hit her head, there would be—and I should say, if it were an unprotected fall—if she struck her head squarely on the floor without any protection, then that would produce a significant acceleration that would potentially be in the ballpark of what we have been talking about for injury thresholds.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
340-Jones,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The discussion is focused on the medical expert's opinions regarding the cause of the child's injury and the likelihood of different scenarios leading to that injury. There is no mention of any misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
If we—if we talk about—and I should say this is all for a healthy infant—or for a healthy child. There—there aren't really any data out there suggesting that—that the child has previous—a pre-existing condition like chronic bleeding, chronic subdural—I think that, based on my review of the records, there was actually mixed density blood in the CT scan suggesting that there was blood before, you know, that would have been present days before this particular incident.

But, anyway, so that matters, but falling off the bed if she is standing on it is different from if she is standing in the middle of the floor and
somehow fell down, which is also different from if she is lying on the bed and rolls off the bed.

Clearly, those different scenarios in order of decreasing height become less and less severe and—to the point where I don’t think you could achieve the levels of acceleration required to produce injury from that—from rolling off that 13-inch bed.

(Id. at 40-41).

¶ 36 In Monson’s opinion, depending on how such a fall occurred, the range of possibility of a serious injury would go from “almost impossible to do it to it could happen.” More specifically, he explained that “the accelerations could range from, you know, significantly over 100Gs down to 0, basically.” Monson stated that he was unaware of any observed case in which shaking had produced a subdural hematoma. He was aware of an observed case in which a “short fall” had produced such an injury.

¶ 37 On cross examination, Monson conceded that serious injuries from short falls are “pretty rare” and “quite unlikely.” (Id. at 67). He also stated that he could not draw a conclusion in the present case as to whether a short fall in fact produced Marianne’s injury. Monson recognized that if Marianne had been shaken and then “slammed” against something causing an impact, the slamming would significantly increase the acceleration and deceleration levels. He reiterated, however, that “the accelerations associated with shaking are very low compared to the thresholds for injury * * * like a subdural hematoma[.]” (Id. at 82). Finally, when asked whether the injury in this case was from a short fall he said “I can’t actually draw an opinion on what - - what caused it.” (Id. at 68).

Answer:"
340-Jones,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is focused on the defense attorney's failure to obtain an expert witness and the trial court's requirements for obtaining such an expert.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 38 Jones’ final witness, Andrew Wannemacher, testified about his efforts as
defense counsel at trial. Specifically, he discussed his cross examination of the State's medical experts. Wannemacher also admitted realizing, at the outset of his involvement, that “there needed to be an expert for the defense to not only explain the medical documentation that had been provided by the State, but also to counteract Dr. Makoroff's shaken baby syndrome or abusive head trauma” theory. Wannemacher explained that he did file a motion for a medical expert. He recalled the trial court required him first to get a medical opinion that an expert would be helpful to the defense and to provide a fee estimate. To do that, Wannemacher contacted a Dr. Miller at Dayton Children’s Hospital, who agreed to review the documentation but refused to participate as a trial witness. Wannemacher testified that Dr. Miller never followed up, or indicated whether he had reviewed any materials. Wannemacher never received an opinion from him. Wannemacher contacted other doctors but concluded on his own that their fees were beyond what the trial court would authorize. As a result, he never obtained an expert witness to assist with the defense. He also never consulted a medical or biomechanical expert to determine whether a short fall could have produced Marianne’s injury. Wannemacher testified that he reviewed approximately 2,000 pages of medical records himself but did not “adequately understand what they meant.” He testified that his failure to obtain the assistance of an expert witness was not a strategic decision. After the first case against Jones was nolled, and then refiled, Wannemacher did not refile his motion for an expert witness because he assumed that he would not be able to get one. According to Wannemacher, he would have called a medical expert to testify if he had one.

{¶ 39} The only other witness at the hearing was Dr. Robert Shapiro, a child-abuse
pediatrician from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, who was called to testify by the State. Dr. Shapiro is the director of the Mayerson Center for Safe and Healthy Children at the hospital, is an attending physician there, and is board certified in both pediatrics and child abuse pediatrics. He has been practicing pediatrics for over thirty years in Ohio and previously for seven years in New York. He has testified in court in those fields about twice a month for the last 25 years and estimated the totals would be between 400 and 500 times. Although he said he almost always testifies on behalf of the prosecution, he did serve as an expert for the Baltimore Public Defender’s Office. He has reviewed “lots and lots of cases for the defense” (T-PCR-2, 38), but if he made a determination that child abuse was not warranted, “the case doesn’t go,” so he has only testified in court a couple of times for the defense. (Id. at 38-39).

Answer:"
340-Jones,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The discussion is focused on the opinions of Dr. Shapiro and Dr. Rothfeder regarding Marianne's medical condition and the cause of her injuries.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 40 Based on his review of the records in this case, Dr. Shapiro agreed that Marianne was a “very complex medical patient” (T-PCR-2, 19). But he rejected Dr. Rothfeder’s opinion that the child’s VATER Association or any other existing medical complications predisposed her to, or contributed to, the injury she suffered on August 5, 2010. He observed that her liver was functioning well, which is critical because that is responsible for many aspects that keep a child from bleeding (T-PCR-2, 15). He also disagreed with Dr. Rothfeder’s opinion that a short fall could have produced a subdural hematoma like Marianne experienced that day. According to Dr. Shapiro, the child’s injuries were consistent with abuse rather than a short fall. Dr. Shapiro also opined that biomechanical engineering studies cannot accurately assess the forces generated from different traumatic events involving children. With regard to the latter, he explained:

I would tell you that the biomechanical studies are flawed right now
and too limited to be abuse (sic) [of use] to making a diagnosis and understanding cause and effect. That's not to say that I don't have hope one day that biomechanical studies will be more informative in this area and they are still undergoing but it's a remarkably difficult thing to study. The head is far more complex than a lake. We barely have biomechanical studies to understand what happens when a child falls. It's way too complicated in terms of mass of the child, size of the bone, angle that the bone strikes, the manner that the child fell, how the bone ends up, what parts of the other parts of the body, so we're beginning to understand a little bit more about what type of all, stair falls might result to what type fractures. The head is unbelievably more complex than a femur. And we have – we probably actually have – will never have any way to understand why type of angular and other forces are required to cause a bridging vein to rupture and what different individual factors are involved, so do I actually have hope that biomechanical engineers will actually be able to tell us what actually happens? No, I actually don't. Maybe they will. I can tell you that we have lots of data and lots of experience from accidental falls, from witnessed falls, we have lots of experimental data that tells us about children who we know have been abused because of a multitude of other reasons who have injuries exactly like [Marianne] has and we have lots of experience knowing what kinds of injuries happen to kids who fall. So that's the data that we have. That's good data. It's not biomechanical data.

(T-PCR-2, 51-52).
Dr. Shapiro compellingly contradicted Dr. Rothfeder regarding whether Marianne had an older, chronic subdural hematoma and a newer, acute subdural hematoma, i.e., “old” blood and “new” blood, giving four distinct reasons why Rothfeder’s supposition is incorrect.

Answer:"
340-Jones,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The discussion is focused on the interpretation of medical imaging and the timeline of events related to a child's condition, with no mention of any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
* * *A number of reasons. So the radiographic appearance actually shows as you correctly said mixed densities on the CT Scan. And what the CT Scan shows is the radiographic appearance from the computed tomography scan of what is inside the cranium. And there is – there is fluid between the brain and the skull, that’s within a particular space that is correctly referred to as a subdural compartment, subdural space and it shows a mixed density. [Rothfeder] is correct about that. The interpretation of what those mixed densities are cannot be determined with any reliability based upon the CT Scan alone. One explanation is exactly as he states, that it’s old blood with new blood bleeding into that space and mixing with the old blood. That is one possibility. Then the other possibility is that this is all new blood that shows different densities because what we believe is movement of the blood, in other words active bleeding. So an informed radiologist cannot make that determination and I am aware that many radiologists are – are not current and they believe that they know and they’re – they don’t, they’re wrong. So that’s number one. Number two, in this particular instance, [Marianne] had a CT Scan of her sinuses for evaluation of the nasal fracture and there was less than two weeks, I don’t forget- I don’t remember the exact number of days, maybe ten, eleven days
apart. That CT Scan shows us the space between the brain and the skull, the subdural space. We don’t see the entire subdural space but we see the frontal lobes and there is no fluid in there. So in terms of chronic or even – chronic blood on top of old blood well it would have been there, should have been there at the time and there was no evidence that it was there. So in this case, although radiographically we can't say whether this is new blood on old or all new, we do have the benefit of a fairly recent CT Scan and the blood was not there. So that’s a powerful argument to suggest that this is not new on top of chronic but it’s all new. And then lastly, not lastly, number three, this child had surgery and the neurosurgeon opened the child's skull and looked at what was in there and saw no evidence of chronic subdural. So we wouldn’t expect chronic subdural and the neurosurgeon didn’t see any chronic subdural. And then number four, we recognize that there is a possibility that children who have abnormal subdural space, which would be chronic subdural fluid in the space, that they might re-bleed, they might have bleeding on top of that chronic fluid with minimal impact. This is area-actually a area of study that we are still learning about. We – we know a limited amount. Some people actually don’t believe that this predisposes children. I have – I happen to be somebody who does believe that it – it does predispose to bleeding. However, the bleeding that it predisposes to has nothing to do with the kind of bleeding and life threatening event that [Marianne] had. So, I would tell you that beyond a reasonable degree of medical certainty this is new blood and we had absolutely no reason to
believe there’s old blood in there and we have some evidence to suggest that there was no old blood in there.

---------------------
{¶ 42} Dr. Shapiro also rejected Dr. Rothfeder's opinion that Marianne's retinal hemorrhages had no diagnostic value. Dr. Shapiro agreed that retinal hemorrhaging is not “pathogonomic” (meaning a definitive diagnostic sign indicative of a particular condition) but he testified it was irresponsible to ignore it. Dr. Shapiro also disagreed with Dr. Rothfeder's opinion that the existence of the subdural hematoma itself may have caused the retinal hemorrhages in this case. He stated: “It doesn’t cause hemorrhaging like we saw in [Marianne].” (Id. at 30).

{¶ 43} Dr. Shapiro testified that he disagreed with Dr. Rothfeder's suggestion in his report that a short fall could have caused Marianne's injury.

* * * He is right, and I agree, that short falls can at times cause unexpected intracranial injury including bleeding and we – I recognize this. Sometimes remarkably minimal impact results in intracranial bleeding. The – the types of bleeding that occurs from a short fall is not the type of bleeding and not the scenario that we see in [Marianne]. Typically, short fall bleedings – bleeding from short falls will be directly on the site of impact. [Marianne]'s was in the classic distribution that we see in kids who have suffered shaken injuries. And children who have trauma and head injury from short falls will, at most, have very minimal retinal hemorrhaging. Typically, they will have no retinal hemorrhages, that's bleeding behind the eyes. When they do have bleeding behind the eyes, it's limited to a small
part of the retina. [Marianne] had bleeding in multiple layers and devastating bleeding. So, this is frankly as a physician it would be irresponsible for me to suggest that [Marianne’s] intracranial injury was a result of a short fall.

***

*** I’ve certainly seen kids who have unexpected injury from such minor falls as falling back on the back of the head. These are unusual, they can happen, but they don’t look like [Marianne]’s injuries. So, it’s my experience includes kids who fall off of couches, fall off of beds, fall off of changing tables, fall off of bunk beds, kids who fall off the swings, kids who fall in playgrounds, kids who get their heads knocked in sporting injuries, these are all bread and butter pediatric emergency medicine type findings and they don’t look anything like the injuries that [Marianne] presented with.

***

(Id. at 16-18).

¶ 44 With regard to whether abusive head trauma or shaken baby syndrome is widely accepted, Shapiro testified it is widely accepted in a large number of medical fields. In regard to those who do not believe in the diagnosis, he said:

*** It’s a tiny fraction of the medical community that speaks a very loud voice. There’s broad acceptance and concurrence among neurosurgeons, neurologists, radiologists, pediatricians in the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome. We have no debate. There is no debate in the medical field, except for a small handful of individuals who, for whatever reasons, feel that they need to speak very loudly about a so-called debate.
The debate is trumped up and doesn't exist. (Id. at 33).

¶ 45 In conclusion, Dr. Shapiro opined that Marianne’s injury was inconsistent with an accident and was indicative of abusive head trauma. On cross examination, he elaborated on that opinion: “* * * But you've got retinal hemorrhages in multiple layers, you've got terrible intracranial bleeding, you got no serious trauma. So as a responsible physician, the—any diagnosis other than child abuse would be rather difficult to come up with.” (Id. at 55).

The trial court decision

Answer:"
340-Jones,"No. The text above does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is focused on the trial court's decision and the effectiveness of the defense attorney's representation, not on any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 46 Based on the evidence presented, the trial court overruled Jones’ post-conviction relief petition in an October 2016 decision and judgment entry. (Doc. #68). It held that attorney “Wannemacher’s representation of the defendant was not objectively unreasonable, the defendant was not prejudiced by counsel's performance, and the defendant has failed to show that the result of the trial would not [sic] have been different but for counsel's representation.” The trial court reasoned that Wannemacher had engaged in effective cross examination of the State’s experts. It discounted Monson’s expert testimony, pointing out that no biomechanical studies ever have been performed measuring the effect of forces on the brains of live humans. The trial court additionally found “little support” for Jones’ “re-bleed” theory.

¶ 47 With regard to Wannemacher’s failure to secure any expert witnesses, the trial court concluded that counsel’s failure to do so “does not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel, since the defendant has not shown a reasonable probability that the testimony of additional experts would change the outcome of this case.” The trial court
found that Dr. Rothfeder’s testimony about short falls and retinal hemorrhages was “called into question” by the contrary opinions of Dr. Makoroff and Dr. Shapiro, who the trial court found more credible largely because Dr. Rothfeder lacked “clinical experience” to testify about a child with Marianne’s “complicated and unusual medical conditions.” The trial court also credited Dr. Shapiro’s testimony that the nature of Marianne’s retinal hemorrhages and extensive subdural hematoma were inconsistent with a short fall. In addition, the trial court found no credible evidence of any “acute on chronic” re-bleeding.

¶ 48 As for Monson, the trial court noted that his experience is laboratory in nature and that hospitals do not employ biomechanical engineers. The trial court determined that his testimony was not “particularly probative of the issues” in this case. The trial court also pointed out that Monson had discounted confessions involving injuries to shaken babies because the confessions might have been false or the defendants might have both shaken and struck the victims. The trial court then reasoned:

Dr. Makoroff’s testimony at trial was that [Marianne] suffered abusive head trauma, the likes of which are consistent with shaking and impact with a soft surface. The defendant was not prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to call an expert to testify on his behalf. [Marianne’s] complex medical history causes Dr. Rothfeder to erroneously conclude she is chronically fragile and that must be why she was so badly injured. Dr. Makoroff and Dr. Shapiro, whose entire careers have exclusively involved the care and treatment of children, have the necessary medical training and clinical experience to know, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that [Marianne] suffered abusive injuries, consistent with their experience with
both abuse injuries and accidental short falls. The proposed expert testimony would not have discredited Dr. Makoroff or Dr. Stevenson’s testimony and would not have affected the outcome of the case.

Finally, the trial court found no ineffective assistance of counsel based on Wannemacher’s failure to call witnesses from Upper Valley Medical Center to testify about the UVMC CT scan reference to an acute-on-chronic subdural hematoma or his failure to impeach Dr. Makoroff with UVMC records on that issue. The trial court reasoned that Wannemacher had conducted effective cross examination and that there was “little medical support” for the acute-on-chronic theory.

Answer:"
340-Jones,"No. The text above is describing the standard of review for a trial court's denial of post-conviction relief, not an assignment of error. It does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Jones has appealed from the trial court's denial of post-conviction relief. The governing statute, R.C. 2953.21, provides that “[a]ny person who has been convicted of a criminal offense * * * and who claims that there was such a denial or infringement of the person’s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States * * * may file a petition in the court that imposed sentence, stating the grounds for relief relied upon, and asking the court to vacate or set aside the judgment or sentence or to grant other appropriate relief.” R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a).

We review a trial court’s denial of post-conviction relief for an abuse of discretion. State v. Sapp, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2015-CA-43, 2017-Ohio-1467, ¶ 6. An abuse of discretion implies an arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable attitude on the part of the trial court. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). “A decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process that would support
that decision."" *Parrett v. Wright*, 2017-Ohio-764, 85 N.E.3d 1067, ¶ 13 (2d Dist.). Moreover, we have previously indicated that we defer to the trial court's finding with regard to credibility in post-conviction proceedings. *State v. Hathaway*, 2015-Ohio-5488, 55 N.E.3d 634, ¶ 21 (2d Dist.). We have recognized that during an evidentiary hearing on a post-conviction relief petition, the trial court serves as the trier of fact and is charged with assessing the credibility of the witnesses. *State v.

340-Jones,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is being raised against the trial counsel (defense attorney) for failing to reasonably investigate and challenge the medical records in the case.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 52} Jones' petition alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, which can constitute grounds for post-conviction relief. *State v. Robinson*, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2013-CA-33, 2014-Ohio-1663, ¶ 20. He claimed ineffective assistance based on, among other things, Wannemacher's failure to retain one or more expert witnesses to assist in his defense. A defendant is deprived of effective assistance of counsel when (1) counsel's performance is deficient and (2) that deficient performance prejudices the defendant. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To establish prejudice, a defendant must do more than show that counsel's deficient performance had a conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding. *State v. Hathaway*, 2015-Ohio-5488, 55 N.E.3d 634, ¶ 12 (2d Dist.), quoting *Strickland* at 693. For ineffective assistance of counsel to cause prejudice, such a result does not have to be shown by a preponderance of the evidence. ""The defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome."" *Id.*, at 694.
Grounds asserted in the post-conviction petition.

¶ 53 Specifically, in his petition, Jones raises four distinct grounds as a bases for relief. We review these grounds and the trial court’s disposition of them in an order that facilitates our analysis. The first raised ground is that trial counsel “failed to reasonably investigate and challenge the medical records in the case.” (Doc. #43 at 32). The focus of this contention is that counsel should have done more to challenge Dr. Makaroff’s opinions. Jones asserts that Marianne “did, in fact have a bleeding disorder” (Id. at 33), that a short fall could not be ruled out as a cause of the injury because Monson said a short fall is of much higher acceleration than shaking, and that Makaroff’s elimination of a re-bleed possibility went unchallenged. Essentially, this ground of the petition claims the medical records demonstrate Dr. Makaroff was wrong on the issues of “bleeding disorder, short fall, and acute on chronic subdural hematoma.” (Id. at 35). The trial court reasonably found no support for this ground, and we agree.

¶ 54 With regard to the medical records supporting the notion that Marianne had a “bleeding disorder,” the trial court concluded that contention was based on a “misstatement,” which we characterize as a plain mistake, by the medical expert Jones presented. No further consideration of a failure to present evidence of a non-existent bleeding disorder is warranted.

Answer:"
340-Jones,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors are being assigned to the trial court and the defense attorney.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 55 With regard to injury from a short fall, a term for which there is no apparent accepted definition, the trial court noted that the essence of Monson’s testimony was only that impact from a short fall would produce larger accelerations than shaking. We believe in addition that Monson’s testimony also supports a biomechanical opinion that shaking alone would not cause Marianne’s subdural hematoma. But, in any event, we agree with
the trial court that Monson’s testimony was “not particularly probative of the issues involved” in the post-conviction proceeding and would have had “negligible probative value.” We note that although Dr. Makaroff testified that such an injury could result from being “shaken violently,” her opinion of abusive head trauma included the potential of an “impact to her head” (T-2, 78) or slamming onto a soft or hard surface (Id. at 87). Her testimony that this type of injury “requires a great bit of force” (T-2, 63) is not inconsistent with Monson’s. The inconsistency between Monson’s testimony and that of Dr. Makaroff’s is Monson’s opinion that shaking alone does not result in sufficient G-force to result in an injury like Marianne’s. We also note from the testimony that we have quoted, Monson’s admission that he could not say Marianne’s injuries were from a short fall (Monson Depo., 68) and that such results are “pretty rare.” (Id. at 67). The trial court also considered the post-conviction testimony of Dr. Shapiro to the effect that Marianne’s injury was not the result of a short fall. In sum, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the post-conviction evidence about the possibility of a short fall would not have made any difference.

¶ 56 In his petition, Appellant argues that “Dr. Stevenson admitted that he would not have been able to see the old blood because of the active bleeding in [Marianne’s] brain at the time.” (Doc. #43 at 34). We believe that argument is inconsistent with the entirety of Dr. Stevenson’s testimony. Dr. Stevenson concluded there was no evidence of a prior subdural hematoma. We have also quoted Dr. Shapiro’s testimony on the subject, which we referred to as compelling. On this record, no reasonable juror would conclude that Marianne had a prior subdural hematoma or a re-bleed thereof.

¶ 57 Ground III of the petition asserts that counsel was ineffective when he “failed
to call the Upper Valley Medical Center treating physicians and Radiologists as witnesses.” (Doc. #43 at 38). We observe that if this ground were sufficient to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, a conclusion we do not embrace, current counsel has repeated it. Those potential witnesses were not called to the post-conviction hearing. Consequently, petitioner has presented no evidence that calling those witnesses would have made any difference. On this ground, the trial court wrote that “there is little medical support that there was an acute on chronic subdural hematoma that caused [Marianne’s] hematoma. The CT scan from UVMC alone is not sufficient to make that determination. The CT scan reveals the possibility of mixed-density blood but that is not substantiated by the prior facial CT scan from her nasal fracture showing no subdural hematoma at all or Dr. Stevenson's observation of [Marianne] during brain surgery.” (Doc# 68 at14). We do not find the trial court was unreasonable in rejecting this ground for relief in the petition.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
340-Jones,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors are alleged against the defense attorney (Wannemacher) for failing to retain an expert and for not impeaching Dr. Makaroff with medical records.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Enumerated Ground IV of the petition states that trial counsel was ineffective when he “failed to impeach Dr. Makaroff with medical records that were readily available”. (Doc.# 43, 40) The medical records specifically itemized are a) the UVMC records to contradict that there was no evidence of an acute on chronic subdural hematoma and b) the Children’s Hospital records regarding a bleeding disorder. Petitioner argued that introduction of these records would have impeached Dr. Makaroff’s testimony. In reverse order, there is no record that demonstrates a bleeding disorder at the time of admission to Children’s. And, there is no reasonable possibility the UVMC CT scan record we have discussed at length would have had any influence on Dr. Makaroff’s testimony let alone the speculation that it would have impeached her testimony. There is no reasonable probability that this ground would have impacted the trial whatsoever.
Ground II, failure to retain an expert

¶ 59 The remaining Ground II for relief is that Jones' counsel was ineffective “when his attorney failed to retain an expert to provide trial testimony”. (Doc. #43 at 35). In our opinion, because trial counsel did not sufficiently exhaust attempts to obtain the assistance of or the testimony of an expert witness, and he was therefore not in a position to make an informed decision whether or not to call an expert to testify, we conclude the trial court's decision finding no deficient performance by Wannemacher was unreasonable. Nonetheless, on this record, given the trial and post-conviction evidence, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding there is not a reasonable probability of a different result and denying the post-conviction motion for relief.

A. Deficient Representation

¶ 60 We find it unreasonable to conclude that Wannemacher provided non-deficient representation by failing to engage an expert to assist in the defense and to allow counsel to be able to make an informed decision whether to have that expert testify. We do not dispute that Wannemacher himself prepared for the issues in the trial. A summary of Jones' contentions in his post-conviction evidence is that 1) Marianne was a complex patient, a fact that contributed to her injury, 2) there is a possibility of an acute-on-chronic hematoma, 3) a short fall can cause a subdural hematoma, 4) Marianne had a bleeding disorder, and 5) a retinal hemorrhage is not diagnostic. We eliminate the bleeding disorder because it did not exist. With regard to each of the other post-conviction contentions, Wannemacher's cross examination at trial and his testimony at the post-conviction-relief hearing both reflect significant preparation to show he was familiar with and inquired about each of the contentions raised in post-conviction, and he was able to
obtain several concessions from the State's witnesses.

Answer:"
340-Jones,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is being assigned to the defense attorney for failing to retain an expert and to call an expert to testify at trial.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 61 In the case of *Flick v. Warren*, 465 Fed.Appx. 461 (6th Cir. 2012), the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals indicated in a 1998 shaken-baby death case that it was not ineffective assistance of counsel to decide not to further seek an expert after counsel received unfavorable responses from three doctors he had contacted for help. Under those circumstances, “effective assistance of counsel does not require counsel to continue contacting experts until he has found one.” *Id.* at 464. On the other hand, here we conclude Wannemacher’s efforts to obtain an expert were simply insufficient to demonstrate that he made a strategic choice to proceed without an expert. “Strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation. In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.” *Strickland* at 690-691.

¶ 62 On this record, we see no sound reason for Wannemacher’s admitted failure to retain an expert to assist with medical issues, and to put counsel in a position to make a strategic decision whether that expert should be called to testify. That failure was not “objectively reasonable” and was deficient. The evidence established that Jones and the child’s mother had put the child down for a nap shortly before the injury. Jones testified in his own defense and claimed subsequently to have found the child on the floor unresponsive. The State’s experts ruled out any other cause and opined that Marianne’s condition must have been the result of abuse by Jones. At that point, although there were concessions about other potential causes of Marianne’s injury, Jones should have been
in a position to decide whether to call an expert in his defense. Due to defense counsel's failure to retain an expert, he had little beyond Jones' own testimony to offer. We do not, and need not, resolve the question of whether Wannamaker, armed with the experts who testified in post-conviction, could have made a strategic decision not to call them after he had obtained some concessions on each of the medical issues called into question.

B. Prejudice

¶ 63 The remaining issue is whether Jones was prejudiced by defense counsel's failure to retain an expert and/or to call an expert to testify at trial to rebut the State's experts. The trial court found no prejudice to Jones based largely on its evaluation of the credibility of the competing experts. With regard to defense experts Dr. Rothfeder and Monson, the trial court found that the nature of their experience made them less credible than the prosecution's experts. It reasoned:

The court found the testimony of defendant's experts, Dr. Rothfeder and Dr. Monson, to have negligible probative value in evaluating their criticisms of and differences with the testimony of Dr. Makoroff and Dr. Stevenson. This conclusion is based in no small part on the vast difference in clinical experience between [Marianne's] treating physicians at Cincinnati Children's Hospital and Dr. Rothfeder, and, in the case of Dr. Monson, the absence of clinical experience. The testimony of the defendant's experts does not demonstrate to this court a probability that the jury would have reached a different verdict.

Answer:"
340-Jones,No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is not directed at the prosecutor but rather at the trial court's handling of the expert witnesses' testimony. The text discusses the trial court's decision to find the prosecution experts' testimony more credible and the strength of their opinions.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 64 The trial court also found more credible the prosecution experts' testimony about retinal hemorrhages, the ""re-bleed"" dispute, the inability of a short fall to cause
Marianne’s injuries, and abusive head trauma actually causing the child’s injury. We recognize that “expert witnesses in criminal cases can testify in terms of possibility rather than in terms of a reasonable scientific certainty or probability.” State v. Lang, 129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, ¶ 77. “The treatment of such testimony involves ‘an issue of sufficiency, not admissibility.’ ”Id., quoting State v. D’Ambrosio, 67 Ohio St.3d 185, 191, 616 N.E.2d 909 (1993). But when experts testify about a variety of possibilities or about underlying suppositions that are unsupported by the weight of the evidence, the strength of their opinions has less weight than those expressed to a reasonable medical certainty.

¶ 65 As set forth above, Dr. Rothfeder opined that it would be impossible “to draw definite conclusions in terms of the cause of [Marianne’s] acute subdural with any reasonable certainty” and that it would be impossible “to conclude that those injuries were the result of child abuse.” (T-PCR-1, 17). But a fair reading of his entire testimony is that he would testify to that effect regardless of the medical aspects of this case because there was no witness to or admission about the mechanism of injury and in those circumstances he does not believe in the abusive head trauma/shaken baby diagnosis at all. (T-PCR-1, 37). The potential contributing causes Dr. Rothfeder identified were re-bleeding of a prior, chronic subdural hematoma, a complex patient with ongoing infection related to the earlier nasal fracture, a “short fall,” and his mistaken bleeding disorder, none of which did he specify was the probable or reasonably certain cause of Marianne’s injury. We previously indicated Appellant complains that in closing argument, the prosecutor seized on the

Answer:"
340-Jones,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is being assigned to the trial court for discrediting Monson's testimony and to the defense attorney for not calling Dr. Rothfeder at trial.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
5 A more cogent reason for allowing criminal-case experts to testify about “possibilities” is that the defense has no burden to prove what happened, but may raise reasonable doubt about what possibly may not have happened.
absence of any competing expert testimony at trial and “emphasized that ‘no doctor or any other witness ever said there is an old injury that’s related to the injury [Marianne] suffered’.” (Appellant’s Merit Brief at 6). Even if Jones’ post-conviction medical expert had testified at trial, the preceding closing argument could still accurately and correctly have been made because that defense expert testified in terms of possibilities rather than certainty or probability. For instance, regarding the existence of a chronic hematoma, he stated: “So a variety of possibilities are in play * * *.” (T-PCR-1, 30). And with regard to the possibility of spontaneous or mild trauma as a cause of re-bleeding, he said: “[W]hat I’m talking about now is not the type of phenomenon that is now well understood or completely understood or has been you know historically clarified over time. It’s not the kind of thing that physicians have a perfect handle on. So everything I’m talking about remains in a – a state of incomplete understanding as – as medicine presently exists.” (Id. at 32). Moreover, had the defense called Dr. Rothfeder at trial, his mistaken testimony about Marianne’s non-existent bleeding disorder, which he said contributed to his analysis, likely would have resulted in further loss of credibility with the jury.

{¶ 66} The trial court additionally discredited Monson’s testimony because he lacks clinical experience, biomechanical studies have not been performed measuring the effect of impact forces on the brains of live humans, and Monson’s experience is laboratory in nature and hospitals do not employ biomechanical engineers. In our view, taking Monson’s testimony at face-value leads to the conclusion that an intensely forceful event occurred in Marianne’s bedroom, which is consistent with the opinions of Drs. Stevenson, Makaroff, Gray, and Shapiro and contrary to the opinions of Dr. Rothfeder.

Answer:"
340-Jones,No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is not directed at the prosecutor but rather at the trial court's credibility analysis and its conclusion regarding the post-conviction evidence.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 67} To be sure, we recognize that there are those, including Jones’ post-
conviction experts, who reject the diagnosis of abusive head trauma. Our research, and the evidence in this case, supports a belief that acceptance of the diagnosis is by far the prevailing view. See, e.g., Sandeep Narang, M.D., J.D., A Daubert Analysis of Abusive Head Trauma/Shaken Baby Syndrome, 11 Hous. J. Health L. & Pol'y 505-633 (2011). Criticism is often fostered by the legal defense community adopting the minority medical opinion. See, e.g., Deborah Tuerkheimer, The Next Innocence Project: Shaken Baby Syndrome and the Criminal Courts, 87 Wash. U. L.Rev. 1, 27 (2009). Some courts have also joined the fray by doing their own literature analysis to support a conclusion for one side or the other. See, e.g., Cavazos v. Smith, 565 U.S. 1, 132 S.Ct. 2, 181 L.Ed.2d 311 (2011) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (citing biomechanical and other studies raising doubt about shaken baby syndrome, most particularly whether it can be caused by shaking alone). But our function and duty is not to weigh in or vote for one side or the other, let alone solve any disagreement of some in the medical community. Nor is it our position to substitute how we might have ruled on the petition if we had considered it in the first instance. Our review is to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in its ruling.

¶ 68 Having painstakingly reviewed the record, we conclude that the trial court’s credibility analysis was not unreasonable and did not in itself constitute an abuse of discretion. We also determine that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that the post-conviction evidence, in the context of the entire record, would not support a reasonable probability of a different result. Finally, Jones’ post-conviction evidence is not sufficient to undermine our confidence in the outcome of his trial.

IV. Conclusion
Based on the reasoning set forth above, we overrule Jones’ assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the Miami County Common Pleas Court.

TUCKER, J., concurs.

FROELICH, J., dissenting;

I would hold that the trial court acted unreasonably in finding that there is not a reasonable probability that, had the defense called experts, the result would have been different. This does not mean that the Appellant probably would have been found not guilty with “evidence to support his story,” only that it is not unreasonable to so conclude.

Marianne slept in the same room as her mother and Appellant and the injury happened during a “window” when the child was not connected to any medical support equipment. (T-1, 202) Although the prosecutor speculated in closing that there were incidents that might have angered the Appellant and caused him to momentarily “step too far over that cliff” (T-3, 9), there was no testimony or evidence that the Appellant had ever been abusive to Marianne or anyone prior to the day of the injury; nor was there any evidence that he had a quick temper or was prone to fits of anger or was anxious, overwhelmed, or upset on the day of the injury.

Answer:"
340-Jones,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it discusses the State's arguments and the evidence presented, and it criticizes the trial court's rejection of certain testimony. The allegation is against the trial court for its handling of the evidence and the expert testimony.","Context information is below.
---------------------
The State argued that motive is not an element and that Appellant’s testimony that “I don’t know what happened to her,” “just doesn’t cut it in the face of the medical evidence that we have in this case.” (T-3, 4). “If he asks you to believe something, which he did, there has to be evidence to support it. And the medical evidence does not
support his story” (emphasis added) (T-3, 11). “No matter what defense counsel tells you, use your collective memory; no doctor or any other witness ever said there is an old injury that’s related to the injury she suffered on August 5, 2010 ...” (T-3, 11); the evidence, the prosecutor argued, “doesn’t support” any of those “theoretical possibilities” suggested by defense counsel. “It defies medical evidence that it- this injury could have been caused by a non-event, which is what the Defendant would have you believe” (T-3, 31), but rather it had to be “shaking her or hitting her against a soft surface.” (T-3, 37).

{¶ 73} The State’s arguments were based on the only evidence the jury heard; and the jury’s verdict was, as we held on direct appeal, not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The State concluded that “… you can follow the medical evidence and the expert testimony and the vast experience on this particular topic, or you can follow what the Defendant said…” (T-3, 30). In other words, in the absence of any medical explanation to the contrary, the jury should believe the unrebutted scientific, medical testimony the State produced and not the denial of a person with no “evidence to support it” and with an obvious reason not to tell the truth. As in Ceasor v. Ocwieja, 655 Fed.Appx. 263 (6th Cir. 2016), “The expert is the case.” (Emphasis in original and internal citations omitted.) 6

{¶ 74} The trial court’s wholesale rejection of Monson’s bio-mechanical-based testimony and its total discounting of Rothfeder’s testimony, based on his different

6 In Ceasor, a federal habeas corpus case, the state court had denied an appeal of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim without holding a hearing where the defendant could introduce his own experts’ testimony on what they would have said at trial. Here, the trial court held the hearing and, as stated above, found there was no reasonable probability of a different result. In neither case did the defense call any experts and the convictions were dependent on the State’s experts alone.
professional experiences than the State's physicians, deprived Appellant of the right to have the jury make such credibility decisions.\textsuperscript{7} I appreciate that in a PCR hearing, the court may sometimes make such judgments. However, in this entirely circumstantial case without any other inferentially-supportive evidence of the Defendant's actions, and where competent evidence exists that is not a “theoretical possibility,” confidence in the fairness of the proceeding and the outcome of the case is undermined.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO
EASTERN DIVISION

JAMES GUY,
Petitioner, : Case No. 2:20-cv-5459

- vs -

WARDEN,
Ross Correctional Institution

Defendant. :

Judge Sarah D. Morrison
Magistrate Judge Michael R. Merz

OPINION AND ORDER

This habeas corpus action, brought pro se by Petitioner James Guy under 28
U.S.C. § 2254, is before the Court on Petitioner’s Objections (ECF No. 31) to the
Magistrate Judge’s Report and Recommendations recommending that the Petition
be dismissed with prejudice. (ECF No. 28).

A litigant who objects to a Magistrate Judge’s Report on a dispositive matter
such as the merits of a habeas corpus petition is entitled to a de novo review of
those portions of report to which substantial objection is made. The Court has
conducted that de novo review; its conclusion is embodied in this Opinion and
Order.

Summary of the Report

In his Petition, Guy pleaded Grounds for Relief A through L. Then in his
Traverse he voluntarily abandoned all claims that he did not argue in that pleading
and re-numbered his claims. (Traverse, ECF No. 27, PageID 2616). The Report
concluded Guy’s actual innocence claim had been abandoned and his insufficiency of the evidence claim was without merit. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2650.) The Magistrate Judge found Guy’s claim of constitutional error in failing to excuse a biased juror (Ground D/Four) was procedurally defaulted by failure to make a contemporaneous objection. (Id. at PageID 2657.) Guy claimed the trial judge impermissibly allowed evidence of his religion (Ground F/Six) which the Magistrate Judge recommended be dismissed as without merit. (Id. at PageID 2662.) The Report concluded that Guy’s claim that he was unconstitutionally denied a new trial (Ground Ten/J) did not state a constitutional claim on which habeas corpus relief could be granted. (Id. at PageID 2662.)

In Ground Thirteen/K(a)(1) Guy asserted he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel when his appellate attorney failed to plead as an assignment of error that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to grant a continuance or impose sanctions on the prosecution due to untimely disclosure of discovery material. Petitioner had raised this claim in an application to reopen his appeal and the Ohio Tenth District Court of Appeals rejected it on the merits. (Id. at PageID 2664-66, quoting the Tenth District’s opinion which appears in the State Court Record. (ECF No. 18, Ex. 38, PageID 633-35).) The Report concluded this decision was entitled to deference under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). (ECF No. 28, PageID 2667.)
I. Petitioner’s Objections Outside the Scope of the Report

Aside from his objections on the merits of the Report, Petitioner raised two objections to pre-Report orders.

A. Objection to Transfer Order


---------------------
Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.
Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
285-Guy,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the transfer of the Magistrate Judge reference and the exclusion of a personal recorder, both of which are administrative and procedural issues.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Petitioner objects “strongly” to the transfer of the Magistrate Judge reference in this case from Magistrate Judge Vascura to Magistrate Judge Merz. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2683). That transfer occurred August 16, 2021 and was entered by Judge Vascura with Judge Merz’s consent (ECF No. 4). Because it was a pre-trial decision on a non-dispositive matter, Petitioner had the right to object within fourteen days of service of the order, or not later than August 30, 2021. Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a). However, Petitioner made no objection to the Transfer Order until filing his instant Objections on November 5, 2021. Rule 72(a) expressly provides “[a] party may not assign as error a defect in the order not timely objected to.” Petitioner’s objection to the Transfer Order is overruled because it is untimely.

This Objection is also overruled on the merits. Litigants obviously have no right to choose the judges to whom their cases are assigned. By the same token, they have no right to prevent transfer of cases within the Court when judges find such transfers useful “to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination” of a case. Quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. Magistrate Judge Merz is serving this Court on recall and has particularly encouraged other Magistrate Judges to transfer habeas corpus cases to him. All the District Judges of this Court have permitted Magistrate
Judges to transfer cases among themselves upon mutual consent. Litigants do not have standing to object to such transfers.

B. Objection to Exclusion of Personal Recorder

Petitioner also objects to Magistrate Judge Merz’s Order (ECF No. 26) denying Petitioner’s “Motion to Accept Personal Recorder to Correct Current/False Transcript Record on File.” (ECF No. 14).

Petitioner’s Motion advised the Court that he personally recorded his second trial because he believed the record of his first trial, which ended in a mistrial, had been falsified. He now seeks to correct the record by substituting his recording for a portion of the official record. The Magistrate Judge denied this motion because it had never been submitted to the Ohio courts, despite a provision for correcting the record on appeal (ECF No. 16, PageID 2623, citing Ohio R. App. P. 11(E)).

Petitioner objects, essentially arguing the merits of the substitution he wishes to make. He makes no response to the Magistrate Judge’s conclusion that he defaulted on this claim by never presenting it to the Ohio courts. Nor does he dispute the rationale behind the Magistrate Judge’s ruling: because anyone can record anything that happens in an Ohio courtroom, failure to enforce Ohio R. App. P. 11(E) could easily lead to endless litigation about “what really happened” at the trial.

Accordingly, Petitioner’s objection on this issue is OVERRULED on the merits and also because it is untimely. Any objection to the Magistrate Judge’s Order on this issue should have been filed by September 13, 2021.
II. Petitioner’s Objections to the Report Itself

A. Failure to Excuse a Biased Juror (Ground Four/D)

Turning to substantive objections, Petitioner first objects to the recommended dismissal of his claim that a biased juror should have been excused. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2672-74).

Answer:"
285-Guy,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is being assigned to the trial court for not allowing a timely objection to a juror and to the defense attorney for not making a contemporaneous objection.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Petitioner claims a particular juror should have been excused because (1) the juror was the mother-in-law of a good friend of the judge and (2) the same juror's son was best friends with an undercover police officer who had been convicted and imprisoned based on actions he took in his official capacity. During an in-chambers conference at which Petitioner was present, no one expressed any concern about the juror's remaining, but the next day Guy, who was representing himself, asked that she be replaced.

The Respondent asserted this biased juror claim was procedurally defaulted because Guy failed to make a contemporaneous objection to her after he knew all the relevant facts. The Magistrate Judge upheld this defense, noting that Ohio does have a procedural rule requiring contemporaneous objection which the trial judge had enforced by refusing to substitute an alternate and the Ohio Tenth District Court of Appeals had enforced by reviewing this assignment of error only for plain error. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2651-57).

Petitioner objects that the Ohio contemporaneous objection rule does not apply when an objection is eventually made at a time when it can be dealt with by the trial court without prejudice to the parties. (ECF No. 31, PageID 2672). However, he cites no Ohio case law to that effect and this position is plainly
inconsistent with his admission on appeal that he had failed to timely object and the standard of review was therefore plain error. (Appellant’s Brief, State Court Record, ECF No. 18, Ex. 24, PageID 367-68.)

The question of whether an objection is “contemporaneous enough” is a question of Ohio, not federal, law. In deciding habeas corpus cases, federal courts are bound by state court decisions of what the state law is. Railey v. Webb, 540 F.3d 393 (6th Cir. 2008), citing Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U.S. 74, 76 (2005) (“We have repeatedly held that a state court’s interpretation of state law, including one announced on direct appeal of the challenged conviction, binds a federal court sitting in habeas corpus.”), Maldonado v. Wilson, 416 F.3d 470 (6th Cir. 2005); Vroman v. Brigano, 346 F.3d 598 (6th Cir. 2003). In this particular case, the Ohio Tenth District Court of Appeals essentially held that Guy’s objection, made a day after he had said he had no objection, was not timely. That is the Ohio law of contemporaneous objection as it applies to this case. To put it another way, there is no clearly established federal constitutional law requiring a state to review on the merits an objection to a sitting juror which is made a day after a defendant says he has no objection.

In a Supplement to his Objections, Petitioner criticizes the Report’s analysis of Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103 (1990). Noting Guy’s citation to Osborne, the Magistrate Judge reasoned “In Osborne, supra, where the Supreme Court upheld

1Although Guy represented himself at trial, he was represented by counsel on appeal. Guy is bound by the concession made on his behalf.
application of the contemporaneous objection rule, the error was in jury instructions to which no objection was made. There is no indication in the opinion that a later objection would have saved the claim.” (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2656).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
285-Guy,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it discusses the procedural rules and the decisions of the Supreme Court and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the sufficiency of objections and the enforcement of state procedural rules in the context of federal constitutional claims.","Context information is below.
---------------------
In the portion of Osborne quoted in the Objections, the Supreme Court is explaining its prior decision in Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415 (1965) when it states:

We followed [in Douglas] “our consistent holdings that the adequacy of state procedural bars to the assertion of federal questions is itself a federal question” and stated that “[i]n determining the sufficiency of objections we have applied the general principle that an objection which is ample and timely to bring the alleged federal error to the attention of the trial court and enable it to take appropriate corrective action is sufficient to serve legitimate state interests, and therefore sufficient to preserve the claim for review here.” [quoting Douglas, 380 U.S. ] at 422, 85 S.Ct., at 1078. Concluding that “[n]o legitimate state interest would have been served by requiring repetition of a patently futile objection,” we held that the Alabama procedural ruling did not preclude our consideration of the defendant's constitutional claim. Id., at 421–422, 85 S.Ct., at 1078–1079.

496 U.S. at 125.

Contrary to Petitioner’s argument, the Report does not contradict Osborne. As the Report noted, there are several issues involved in deciding whether a claim has been procedurally defaulted. Once the Warden has raised the procedural default defense, the habeas court must decide if the State has a relevant procedural rule and whether the State courts have enforced that rule in the case in suit.

(Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2654, citing, inter alia, Maupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986)). Those are questions of state law. Then the habeas court must decide if the state rule is an ""adequate and independent"" state ground on
which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim. 

*Maupin.* As *Osborne* teaches, this is a question of federal law. Unlike the repetitive objection rule in *Douglas* discussed in *Osborne*, however, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has repeatedly held that Ohio’s contemporaneous objection rule is an adequate and independent procedural rule. *Wogenstahl v. Mitchell*, 668 F.3d 307, 334 (6th Cir. 2012), citing *Keith v. Mitchell*, 455 F.3d 662, 673 (6th Cir. 2006); *Goodwin v. Johnson*, 632 F.3d 301, 315 (6th Cir. 2011); *Smith v. Bradshaw*, 591 F.3d 517, 522 (6th Cir. 2010); *Nields v. Bradshaw*, 482 F.3d 442 (6th Cir. 2007); *Biros v. Bagley*, 422 F.3d 379, 387 (6th Cir. 2005).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
285-Guy,No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The allegations are against the trial court and the defense attorney.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Indeed as the Report notes, Guy admitted in his Traverse that the Sixth Circuit had repeatedly upheld this rule as adequate and independent. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2655, citing Traverse, ECF No. 27, PageID 2617.) The combined citations given in the Report and those admitted by Petitioner conclusively demonstrate that Ohio’s contemporaneous objection rule is an adequate and independent state procedural ground of decision, consistent with the analysis in *Osborne, supra*.

Because he found this Ground for Relief procedurally defaulted, the Magistrate Judge did not address the merits. While the Court finds the procedural default analysis correct, it is also true that the biased juror claim is without merit. The factual basis of the claim is (1) the juror in question was the mother-in-law of a good friend of the judge and (2) the same juror's son was best friends with an undercover police officer who had been convicted and imprisoned based on actions
he took in his official capacity. Guy’s argument that these facts show he was deprived of an impartial jury is completely conclusory. Assume the juror, rather than her mother-in-law, was friends with the judge. Why does that make her biased? Ohio judges are elected officials. In some smaller Ohio counties judges who have been in office for some time probably get friends or acquaintances as jurors on a regular basis, but the Supreme Court has never held this creates a biased jury. In a large county like Franklin, this probably happens rarely, but the Constitution was written for counties of all sizes.

As the Tenth District noted on appeal, there was never any evidence of actual bias. Rather the argument was that the juror was potentially biased and the trial judge, considering all the evidence, found no basis for disqualification. Whether or not a juror is disqualified by bias is a question of fact on which we are bound by state court findings unless a petitioner shows the finding is in error by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1). Petitioner has presented no evidence of actual bias, so his Fourth Ground for Relief fails on the merits, as well as being procedurally defaulted.

B. Ground Six/F: Prejudicial Evidence of Petitioner’s Religion

In his Sixth Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims the trial judge improperly allowed evidence of his Muslim religion. The Warden argued this claim was procedurally defaulted because it had been presented to the Tenth District solely as an issue of relevance under Ohio R. Evid. 402. While the Magistrate Judge provided
some analysis of the fair presentation claim, he ultimately recommended this claim be denied on the merits. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2658-62.

The Report found that evidence of Petitioner’s religion was in a recorded jail call in which he admitted he was a member of the Black P. Stone organization and that was why he became a Muslim. While his religion was irrelevant, his membership in Black P. Stone was a key factor in identifying him as the perpetrator of the crime in suit and the state courts found, after attempting redaction, that the Muslim and Black P. Stone admissions could not be separated. The Magistrate Judge recommended deference to that state court fact finding.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
285-Guy,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is directed at the trial court for allowing the prosecutor to argue that Guy's affiliation with Black P. Stone supported the inference that the use of the nickname ""Stone"" during the crime proved Guy was the perpetrator.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Petitioner objects that the prosecutor was allowed to argue that Guy’s affiliation with Black P. Stone supported the improper inference that the use of the nickname “Stone” during the crime proved Guy was the perpetrator. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2675). To show the inference was improper, he argues that the State’s expert witness testimony about conduct of members of the organization was “bogus” and then offers his own statements of fact to contradict the expert. Id.

Arguments about the validity of expert testimony and of inferences are questions for the jury. There was no constitutional violation in allowing the State to attempt to prove Guy was the perpetrator of this crime by introducing his admission of membership in the Black P. Stone organization and then showing members often call one another “Brother Stone” which had happened during the crime. The fact that Guy stated in the same breath that he was a Muslim was his own doing. The State made no argument at all relying on his religious
identification. And Petitioner’s statement of fact in the Objections are not under oath and cannot be considered because they were not offered in the trial court.

*Cullen v. Pinholster*, 563 U.S. 170 (2011).

**C. Ground Eight/H: Insufficient Evidence**

In his Eighth Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts there was insufficient evidence introduced at trial to support a conviction. The Tenth District Court of Appeals decided this claim on the merits and the Magistrate Judge concluded that decision had applied the governing precedent, *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307 (1979), applying that precedent reasonably. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2644-50, quoting *State v. Guy*, 2018-Ohio-4836 (Ohio App. 10th Dist. Dec. 6, 2018).

Petitioner objects that the State conflated evidence from the controlled buy on October 16, 2014, with evidence seized pursuant to search warrant on October 17, 2014. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2677). As can be seen from reviewing those portions of the Tenth District’s decision on this issue, Petitioner made separate claims of insufficiency as to the two dates. For October 16 he claimed the State had not shown enough to prove kidnapping and drug trafficking, but there was evidence he brandished a firearm in complicity with his brother’s sale of heroin to an undercover officer. The search that occurred on October 17 found him in the same place, 72 South Wheatland, where the prior day’s offenses had occurred. The police also found heroin and drug packaging paraphernalia. The Tenth District applied the usual rule that circumstantial evidence is sufficient for conviction. *State v. Guy*, supra, ¶¶ 44.
It is true that evidence of offenses on both days was presented in one trial. But it is also true that circumstantial evidence from each of the two days supported each of the convictions. Petitioner did not raise as an assignment of error that these cases were tried together, even though he sought severance pre-trial.

Answer:"
285-Guy,"Yes, the text above is describing an assignment of error, and the error is alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct. The specific allegations against the prosecutor include submitting inadmissible evidence despite the trial judge's exclusion and improperly impeaching the petitioner's alibi witness.","Context information is below.
---------------------
He also argues the State did not prove he possessed the drugs that were found on October 17, asserting they were in the constructive possession of another individual. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2677). He particularly refers the Court to the testimony of Daniel Guy at PageID 2193 where the witness testifies there was a room at 72 South Wheatland for Andrew Naus, referred to in the transcript as “Drew,” which Drew usually kept locked when he wasn’t there. Guy apparently intends this as conclusive proof that he did not have access to the drugs found in that room.

However, a jury is not required to believe everything it hears. Daniel Guy testified he was the brother of the two Guys on trial. (Transcript, State Court Record, ECF No. 18-2, PageID 2188.) He testified he remembered “a little bit” about the day of the search. Id. at PageID 2191. Daniel answered “yes” to James’s leading questions whether Drew was working “with us in our company at that time,” whether we were all working together, and whether Daniel would consider Drew a member of the Guy family. Id. at PageID 2191-92. The house at 72 South Wheatland was being fixed up by the Guy family so that Drew could move in, but he never paid them for their help. Id. at PageID 2194-95. Given this testimony, most of which was elicited by leading questions from the Defendant’s brother, the jury
might well have discredited the testimony as biased. Certainly, Daniel never testified that any drugs at the house were locked up in Drew’s room and no one else had access.

Petitioner also asserts the State violated *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), by suppressing a Sheriff’s Detail Call Sheet (Exhibit K(a)) which is alleged to identify two other suspects in the 72 South Wheatland residence before the raid. (Objections, ECF No. 31, PageID 2678). Petitioner made no *Brady* claim in the Petition and thus no such claim is before the Court.

**D. Ground Ten/J: Denial of a New Trial**

In his Tenth Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for new trial. The Report rejected this claim on the grounds there is no federal constitutional right to a new trial. (ECF No. 28, PageID 2662).

Petitioner objects that a new trial is constitutionally required when denial of a new trial would leave a defendant convicted at a fundamentally unfair trial. (ECF No. 31, citing *Fleming v. Metrish*, 556 F.3d 520, 535 (6th Cir. 2009). He argues that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by submitting inadmissible evidence despite the trial judge’s having excluded it and improperly impeaching Petitioner’s alibi witness. *Id.* at PageID 2679. In the Motion for New Trial, Guy labels as misconduct the submission of a Facebook page in which Guy used the racial slur “Honkies.” He also claims that the only proper way to impeach an alibi witness is by cross-
examination and the prosecutor did so by attempting, unsuccessfully,\(^2\) to introduce a phone call allegedly coming from the alibi witness.

Answer:"
285-Guy,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it discusses the failure of the appellant (Guy) to present two instances of prosecutorial misconduct in his brief.","Context information is below.
---------------------
The trial judge denied the Motion for New Trial summarily. (Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 18, Ex. 20). On appeal Guy argued this as his Ninth Assignment of Error. (Appellant’s Brief, State Court Record, ECF No. 18, PageID 392, et seq.) In the course of his Brief, Guy never presented the two instances of prosecutorial misconduct he relies on here. Nor did he make any constitutional argument, relying instead on Ohio Revised Code § 2945.79 and an abuse of discretion standard. To the extent, then, that Guy makes a constitutional argument about denial of new trial in this case, he has procedurally defaulted that claim by failing to present it as a constitutional claim to the Tenth District Court of Appeals.

The motion for new trial claim is also subject to procedural default because it was untimely. In dealing with the Ninth Assignment of Error, the Tenth District wrote:

\(^{65}\) James did not assert there was newly discovered evidence in his motion for new trial; therefore, it was required to be filed within 14 days after the verdicts were rendered. The jury rendered their verdicts in this case on March 2, 2017. James did not file his motion for new trial until March 23, 2017. Thus, his motion was untimely and failed to establish that he was unavoidably prevented from filing within the time set forth in the rules. Moreover, the motion for new trial was based on alleged irregularities in the proceedings and a claim that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury's verdicts. These were largely the same claims asserted in his appeal to this court. As explained above, we find no merit to these arguments and cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion by denying the motion for new trial.

\(^2\)Even though the phone call was excluded, Guy claims the jury heard it anyway.
State v. Guy, supra.

E. Ground Thirteen/K(a)(1): Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel

In his Thirteenth Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel when his appellate attorney failed to plead as an assignment of error that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to grant a continuance or impose sanctions on the prosecution due to untimely disclosure of discovery material.

The Report notes that Petitioner raised this claim as part of an Application to Reopen his Appeal under Ohio R. App. P. 26(B) and the Tenth District decided it on the merits, concluding the omitted assignment of error would not likely have been successful if it had been pleaded. (Report, ECF No. 28, PageID 2664-65, quoting State v. Guy, supra.) Concluding this decision was neither contrary to nor an objectively unreasonable application of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), the Magistrate Judge recommended it be dismissed. Id. at PageID 2667.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
285-Guy,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the trial court's denial of a continuance and the defense attorney's failure to correct the record or raise a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Petitioner objects that, contrary to the express finding of the Tenth District, he did request a continuance, but can only prove that by admission of the personal recording he made of the trial. The official trial record shows he did not. As noted in the Magistrate Judge’s denial of admission of the personal recorder, Petitioner had a remedy for inaccuracies in the record under Ohio R. App. P. 11(E). His appellate attorney could have moved under that rule to correct the record but did not. If failure to do so was ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, Guy could have
included that claim in his 26(B) Application but did not. Guy has not demonstrated that the Tenth District’s finding that he did not request a continuance is contradicted by the record.

The Objections note that Ohio R. Crim. P. 16 allows a continuance as a sanction for untimely discovery. That is true. But even assuming that the corrected record would show that Guy requested a continuance, the rule left the choice of sanction up to the trial judge. Guy has not shown there was an abuse of discretion in denying a continuance, assuming he requested one. Indeed, the Tenth District found he was not prejudiced because of the nature of the late discovery.

Guy has not persuaded this Court that failure to complain of denial of a continuance on direct appeal was ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.

III. Conclusion

Having reviewed de novo those portions of the Magistrate Judge’s Report to which substantial objection has been made, the Court finds the Objections are not well-taken and they are hereby OVERRULED. The Report is ADOPTED, and the Clerk is directed to enter judgment dismissing the Petition with prejudice. Because reasonable jurists would not disagree with this conclusion, the Petitioner is denied a certificate of appealability and the Court certifies to the Sixth Circuit that any appeal would be objectively frivolous and should not be permitted to proceed in forma pauperis.

Plaintiff-Appellee

v.

BRANDON CHARLES CARR

Defendant-Appellant

Appellate Case No. 28360

Trial Court Case No. 2016-CR-745/2

(Criminal Appeal from
Common Pleas Court)

OPINION

Rendered on the 10th day of January, 2020.

MATHIAS H. HECK, JR., by SARAH E. HUTNIK, Atty. Reg. No. 0095900, Assistant
Prosecuting Attorney, Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office, Appellate Division,
Montgomery County Courts Building, 301 West Third Street, Dayton, Ohio 45422
Attorney for Plaintiff-Appellee

BRANDON CHARLES CARR, Inmate No. 742-713, Warren Correctional Institution, P.O.
Box 120, Lebanon, Ohio 45036
Defendant-Appellant, Pro Se

WELBAUM, P.J.
This matter is before the court on the pro se appeal of Defendant/Appellant, Brandon Carr, from a trial court judgment denying his request for public records. In a single assignment of error, Carr contends that the trial court violated his due process rights by denying his request for public records under R.C. 149.43(B)(8), when he has justiciable claims.

We conclude that the trial court did not err in denying Carr’s records’ request. Carr failed to identify a pending proceeding to which the records would be material, and he did not indicate how the records would be material to any justiciable claim. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.

I. Facts and Course of Proceedings

This case involves a post-judgment order in a criminal action initially brought against Brandon Carr in March 2017. On March 23, 2017, an indictment was filed charging Carr with twelve offenses related to the February 2016 death of Brittany Russell. Russell’s body had been found inside her car, which was parked at a Dayton, Ohio, apartment complex. Russell had bullet wounds in her head; her infant daughter was found in the car’s back seat, unharmed. State v. Carr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-3802, ¶ 2. In April 2017, a re-indictment filed in the case charged Carr also with possession of heroin. Id. at ¶ 3.

During pretrial proceedings, Carr filed a motion to dismiss the charges due to the pre-indictment destruction of Russell’s car, together with any evidence it contained.

Answer:"
893-CARR,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error described in the text is related to the trial court's handling of a motion for reconsideration and the subsequent sentencing of Carr. There is no mention of any misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
1 Case No. 28193 was an appeal from a post-judgment order issued by the trial court, not the direct appeal of Carr’s conviction.
The trial court overruled the motion from the bench on January 22, 2018, but did not file a written decision. *Id.* at ¶ 4. On January 27, 2018, Carr filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision on the motion to dismiss, which the court then considered during trial. *Id.* On February 6, 2018, the court filed a formal entry reflecting its initial decision on the motion to dismiss. However, the court did not specifically state that it was denying the motion to reconsider as well, although the court had overruled that motion after hearing trial testimony. July 12, 2018 Order at p. 3.

{¶ 5} Following a jury trial, Carr was found guilty of aggravated murder, murder (purposeful), murder (proximate result) (two counts), kidnapping (two counts), felonious assault (two counts), tampering with evidence (two counts), endangering children, and possession of heroin. *Carr*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-3802, at ¶ 3 and 6. The trial court tried a charge of having weapons under disability and found Carr guilty of that charge as well. *Id.* at ¶ 6. After merging some counts, the court sentenced Carr to life without parole, plus a total of 34 additional years. *Id.*

{¶ 6} On April 6, 2018, Carr appealed to our court, and his direct appeal of his conviction was docketed as Montgomery App. No. 27960. That appeal is still pending. While the appeal was pending, Carr filed a pro se motion in the trial court, asking the court to journalize its decision on the motion for reconsideration. On July 12, 2018, the court

Carr again filed a notice of appeal, and this appeal was docketed as Montgomery App. No. 28193. Id. at ¶ 10. These motions involved the following matters: “a motion to stay the restitution award included in [Carr’s] judgment of conviction; * * * a motion pursuant to R.C. 149.43(B)(8) for copies of the jury verdict forms; and * * * a motion for grand jury testimony from his case, purportedly to support a petition for postconviction relief.” Carr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-3802, at ¶ 9. On September 20, 2019, we affirmed the trial court’s decision on all these matters. Id. at ¶ 42.

¶ 8 In the meantime, Carr filed an additional post-judgment motion on February 27, 2019, seeking release of public records under R.C. 149.43(B)(8). On March 27, 2019, the trial court denied that motion as well, and Carr filed a notice of appeal on April 23, 2019. This appeal was docketed as Montgomery App. No. 28360, and is the appeal now under consideration.

Records Request Under R.C. 149.43(B)(8)

Answer:"
893-CARR,No. The text above describes an assignment of error alleging that the trial court abused its discretion and violated Mr. Carr's due process rights by denying his request for public records under R.C. 149.43(b)(8). The error is not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
The Trial Court Abused Its Discretion and Violated Mr. Carr’s Due
Process Rights by Denying Mr. Carr’s Request Pursuant to R.C. 149.43(b)(8) to Obtain Forms Pertaining to Policy and Procedure of Dayton Police Department Handling Evidence When Mr. Carr Has Justiciab le Claims.

¶ 10 Under this assignment of error, Carr contends that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his R.C. 149.43(B)(8) request for public records because he has a justiciab le claim. Carr further asserts that he has numerous appeals pending in our court and the Supreme Court of Ohio, as well as a pending petition for post-conviction relief. In this regard, Carr notes that he filed a mandamus action in the Supreme Court of Ohio and ultimately received a copy of the City of Dayton Police Department’s General Order 1.06-1, concerning the policy and procedure for evidence and impounded property. Allegedly (according to his appellate brief), Carr reviewed the policy and discovered that it was not followed with respect to the murder vehicle. Having received this information, Carr then filed a motion with the trial court, requesting public records.

¶ 11 Specifically, Carr made the following request (quoted verbatim):

Thus, Mr. Carr request [sic] this court to have access to all documents related to the crime scene vehicle that was suppose [sic] to be towed to the EPOD North Evidence Garage as required by the Dayton Police Department policy General Order 1.06-1 pertaining to Evidence and impounded Property.

In particular, any chain of custody documents, along with Evidence Processing Request Form VIA MOT and on any Complaint Memorandum directed to the Investigations-Administrative Services Division
Commander's Office. Also all or any emails.

Doc. #1, Motion Pursuant to R.C. 149.43(B)(8), pp. 1-2.

¶ 12 In denying the motion, the trial court held that Carr's assertions of having numerous pending appeals in our court and the Supreme Court of Ohio, as well as a pending petition for post-conviction relief, were not sufficient to support a justiciable claim.

Doc. #3, Order Denying Motion Pursuant to R.C. 149.43(B)(8), p. 2.

¶ 13 We review trial court orders on disclosure of public records for an abuse of discretion. State v. Morris, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26949, 2017-Ohio-1196, ¶ 29. An abuse of discretion “‘implies that the court's attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.’” (Citations omitted.) Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). “[M]ost instances of abuse of discretion will result in decisions that are simply unreasonable, rather than decisions that are unconscionable or arbitrary.” AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.2d 597 (1990). “A decision is unreasonable if there is no sound reasoning process that would support that decision.” Id.

¶ 14 As pertinent here, R.C. 149.43(B)(8) provides that:

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
893-CARR,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is related to the trial court's decision regarding a public records request by an inmate, Carr, and the appeals process. The text discusses the inmate's pending appeals and the trial court's role in handling the public records request, but it does not mention any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
A public office or person responsible for public records is not required to permit a person who is incarcerated pursuant to a criminal conviction * * * to obtain a copy of any public record concerning a criminal investigation or prosecution * * * unless the request to inspect or to obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose of acquiring information that is subject to release as a public record under this section and the judge who imposed the sentence or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the judge's
successor in office, finds that the information sought in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be a justiciable claim of the person.3

¶ 15 This statute “sets forth heightened requirements for inmates seeking public records, and requires an incarcerated criminal defendant to demonstrate that the information he is seeking pursuant to R.C. 149.43 is necessary to support a justiciable claim or defense.” State v. Gibson, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 06CA37, 2007-Ohio-7161, ¶ 13. A justifiable claim does not exist where an inmate fails to identify “any pending proceeding with respect to which the requested documents would be material * * *.” State v. Atakpu, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25232, 2013-Ohio-4392, ¶ 9, citing Gibson at ¶ 14.

¶ 16 In his R.C. 149.43(B)(8) motion, Carr mentioned that he had “numerous pending appeals in the 2nd District and Ohio Supreme Court along with his post conviction relief hearing * * *.” Doc. #1 at p. 1. Carr’s motion was filed in the trial court on February 27, 2019. At that time, the appeals mentioned above (Case Nos. 27960, 28080, and 28193) were pending in our court. The first two appeals were direct appeals of Carr’s convictions and sentence. The law is well-settled that “[a] reviewing court cannot add matter to the record before it, which was not a part of the trial court's proceedings, and then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter.” State v. Ishmail, 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 377 N.E.2d 500 (1978), paragraph one of the syllabus. As a result, nothing outside the record, like evidence discovered post-trial, would be material to those proceedings.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
893-CARR,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it discusses issues related to the trial court's handling of evidence and witness testimony, as well as a mandamus action filed by Carr against the Dayton Police Department. The only mention of misconduct is in relation to the prosecutor adding a heroin charge after the first indictment was filed, but this is not the main focus of the text.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Carr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-3802, at ¶ 13, 19, 22, and 32-33.  The first two issues bear no potential relation to police handling of evidence, and the third issue involved alleged inconsistent witness testimony and alleged prosecutorial misconduct in adding a heroin charge after the first indictment was filed.  Id. at ¶ 26.  We see no possible way in which the requested material would be material to those issues.  The evidence would also be outside the record in relation to that case, as the trial court action had already been decided.

¶ 18 In Case No. 28193, Carr raised a further issue about the July 12, 2018 Order (the nunc pro tunc entry), but that, again, would have been limited to the matters already in the record.  Id. at ¶ 36.  In any event, Case No. 28193 has been decided, and Carr did not elect to further appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio.

¶ 19 Likewise, the case pending in the Supreme Court of Ohio was, as Carr suggests, a mandamus action filed by Carr against the Dayton Police Department.  See State of Ohio ex rel. Brandon Carr v. Dayton Police Dept., No. 2018-1631, 03/05/2019 Case announcements, 2019-Ohio-761.  The mandamus action was dismissed at Carr’s request on March 5, 2019.  Id.  Although the mandamus action was still pending when Carr filed his current public records request on February 27, 2019, Carr received his requested relief (disclosure of the Dayton Police Department’s policy on preserving and handling evidence) as a result of the mandamus proceeding.  See Mandamus Complaint filed in Case No. 2018-1631 on November 15, 2018, and Relator Brandon Carr’s Voluntary Motion to Dismiss, filed on March 1, 2019.  Accordingly, Carr’s current public records request would be moot if it concerned that matter.
Furthermore, unless the evidence sought in the current case was relevant to the mandamus proceeding, it would not be material to a pending proceeding for purposes of R.C. 149.43(B)(8). There is no relevance, however, because the relief being sought differs. Specifically, in the case before us, Carr seeks various documents pertaining to how the evidence was actually handled, not evidence of the policy itself. The evidence being sought is also evidence that was not presented at trial. A post-conviction proceeding is a situation where evidence outside the record can be presented. E.g., State v. Kinley, 136 Ohio App.3d 1, 7, 735 N.E.2d 921 (2d Dist.1999); State v. Grimm, 2d Dist. Miami No. 96-CA-37, 1997 WL 200550, *2 (Apr. 25, 1997).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
893-CARR,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the trial court's handling of post-judgment motions and the denial of a public records request.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
The judgment entry imposing Carr's sentence was filed on March 13, 2018, and Carr promptly appealed on April 6, 2018. Although Carr filed numerous post-judgment motions, the trial court denied all pending motions on October 11, 2018, and Carr again appealed on November 1, 2018. After that point, no post-judgment motions were filed in the trial court before the current motion was filed on February 27, 2019, and no post-conviction proceedings were filed thereafter before the court denied the motion. Thus, both when Carr filed his R.C. 149.43 motion and when the trial court dismissed it, no post-conviction proceedings were pending in the trial court. Consequently, no justifiable claims existed with respect to any pending proceeding. Atakpu, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25232, 2013-Ohio-4392, at ¶ 9.

Finally, even if any proceedings had been pending, Carr failed to articulate how the requested information “would be material to any justiciable claim he may have.” Carr, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28193, 2019-Ohio-3802, at ¶ 23. While Carr has made some comments in his appellate brief, at the trial court level, he merely asked for
documents to be produced without explaining why.

{¶ 23} We note that Carr did file motions for post-conviction relief in the trial court in May 2019, June 2019, and July 2019. However, those motions were not pending when his public records request was filed, nor were they pending when the trial court denied the request on March 27, 2019. As a result, they cannot be considered for purposes of our discussion.4

{¶ 24} Based on the preceding discussion, Carr's sole assignment of error is overruled.

III. Conclusion

{¶ 25} Carr's assignment of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

Mason Somers appeals the decision of the Muskingum County Court of Common Pleas denying his motion for post-conviction relief based upon the doctrine of res judicata, failure to address issues on direct appeal and lack of meritorious claims.

STATEMENT OF FACTS AND THE CASE

Ernest Dilley was sitting in his home when there was a knock at his front door. Mr. Dilley opened the door believing it to be his daughter returning home from work, but instead it was a man holding a gun, with a bandana covering part of his face. Mr. Dilley noticed the man was around six feet tall and had tattoos on his arms and on the hand holding the gun. The man charged into the house and pushed Mr. Dilley through the threshold area of the home, into the living room, until Mr. Dilley was on his couch. The man pointed the gun at Mr. Dilley and demanded all of Mr. Dilley's money. Mr. Dilley told the intruder his money was at the bank. The intruder then picked up a lid from a glass candy jar and struck Mr. Dilley in the face. The intruder grabbed Mr. Dilley's cell phone off the coffee table and ran out of the house. Mr. Dilley followed the intruder to the front porch area. Once outside, Mr. Dilley noticed the glass candy dish lid had been dropped in his yard. On top of the broken glass lid was a flashlight.

Answer:"
611-Somers,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is against the trial court and the defense attorney.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Mr. Dilley ran to the neighbor's house and asked him to call the police. When the police arrived, they searched the area and found Dilley's cell phone in the middle of his yard and returned it to him. The police also found the flashlight and a pistol bullet cartridge that had not been fired and both were submitted for DNA testing. The DNA discovered on the flashlight came back as a one in one trillion match to Appellant Mason Somers. The test of the bullet was inconclusive.
Appellant was indicted on one count of Aggravated Burglary, a felony of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2911.11 1(A)(2), one count of Aggravated Robbery, a felony of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), one count of Kidnapping with a gun specification, a felony of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(1), and one count of Felonious Assault, a felony of the second degree, in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2).

At trial, the jury heard testimony from Ernest Dilley, Deputy Andrew Murphy, Detective Amy Thompson, BCI forensic scientist Michael Monfredi, and Detective Brad Shawger.

Mr. Dilley testified as to the events that took place on August 23, 2017, as set forth above. He further testified that the perpetrator's height and tattoos on his hands and arms were consistent with that of Appellant's height and tattoos on his hands and arms. Mr. Dilley also testified that the flashlight found in the yard had not been there previously because if it had been, he would have picked it up.

The state presented two audio recordings of Appellant from a phone call and a visit. In the recordings, Appellant comments on the facts of the case and concludes that he should get a “sweet deal” as a result of the lack of any egregious actions during the offense. Appellee argued the statements were made prior to the state responding to Appellant’s discovery requests, suggesting that Appellant had knowledge of the facts that only the perpetrator would know. Appellee’s trial counsel cross-examined the officer who introduced the tapes, suggesting during those questions and in his closing argument that there were alternative sources for the information the Appellant described, such as the complaint, trial counsel, or other individuals. Appellant’s trial counsel chose not to have his client testify and avoided subjecting him to cross examination, which, according to
Appellant’s brief, would disclose a prior drug offense and, based upon the record, may have been of little material assistance.

{¶8} The jury found Appellant guilty of all counts and firearm specifications and the trial court sentenced Appellant to serve 25 years in prison and pay court costs.

{¶9} Appellant, through appointed counsel, filed a timely appeal assigning as error that the conviction was based upon insufficient evidence and against the manifest weight of the evidence, that consecutive sentences were unconstitutional and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. This court rejected his assignments of error and affirmed the decision of the trial court on November 18, 2018.

Answer:"
611-Somers,No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The allegation is against the trial court for denying the post-conviction relief petition without a hearing and for failing to issue facts and conclusions of law as required by R.C. 2953.21.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶10} Appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief on February 25, 2019, asking that the trial court grant a hearing on the petition and, ultimately, a new trial. Appellant alleged that his constitutional rights were violated as a result of prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In support of his motion, Appellant supplied multiple references to transcripts of hearings before the trial court as well as his affidavit recounting his conversations with trial counsel before and during the hearings.

{¶11} On March 8, 2019, the trial court denied Appellant’s petition finding that the Defendant failed to raise these claims in his direct appeal, that he failed to present any meritorious claims and that his motion was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. On March 25, 2019 Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal, listing three assignments of error:

{¶12} “I. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT’S POST-CONVICTION RELIEF PETITION WHEN APPELLANT HAD SHOWN ESSENTIAL OPERATIVE FACTS IN(SIC) SUPPORTING EVIDENTIARY(SIC) QUALITY MATERIALS DEHORS THE RECORD IN VIOLATION OF THE OHIO AND U.S. CONSTITUTIONS.”
“II. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT’S POST-CONVICTION PETITION WITHOUT A HEARING WHEN THE COURT FILES, RECORD, AND DOCUMENTATION SUPPORTED SUCH A HEARING.”

“III. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED AND ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN IT FAILED TO ISSUE FACTS AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AS REQUIRED BY R.C. 2953.21.”

STANDARD OF REVIEW

The appropriate standard for reviewing a trial court's decision to dismiss a petition for post-conviction relief, without an evidentiary hearing, involves a mixed question of law and fact. State v. Durr, 5th Dist. Richland No. 18CA78, 2019-Ohio-807. This court must apply a manifest weight standard in reviewing a trial court's findings on factual issues underlying the substantive grounds for relief, but we must review the trial court's legal conclusions de novo.

Answer:"
611-Somers,"Yes, the text above describes an assignment of error alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The Appellant contends that prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel support his first assignment of error.","Context information is below.
---------------------
With regard to Appellant’s assertion he was entitled to a hearing, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that “[i]n post-conviction cases, a trial court has a gatekeeping role as to whether a defendant will even receive a hearing.” State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77. A petition for post-conviction relief does not provide a petitioner a second opportunity to litigate his or her conviction, nor is the petitioner automatically entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the petition. State v. Wilhelm, 5th Dist. Knox No. 05-CA-31, 2006-Ohio-2450, citing State v. Jackson, 64 Ohio St.2d 107, 413 N.E.2d 819 (1980). Pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(C), a defendant’s petition may be denied without a hearing when the petition, supporting affidavits, documentary evidence, files, and records do not demonstrate that the petitioner set forth sufficient
operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief.” State v. Adams, 11th Dist. No.2003–T–0064, 2005–Ohio–348, ¶ 36 quoting State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 282, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999).

¶17 We also note that the trial court’s entry referred to the lack of “meritorious” claims, when R.C. 2953.21 obligates the trial court to review the petition for “substantive grounds for relief.” R.C. 2953.21(D). In the context of this case, we accept the trial court’s cite to “meritorious claims” as referencing “substantive grounds for relief.”

I.

¶18 Appellant contends that prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel supports his first assignment of error in which he argues the trial court abused its discretion by denying the petition. He concludes his argument by characterizing the facts he describes as “outside the trial court’s record” but the record requires the opposite conclusion. The facts Appellant relies upon were clearly part of the record and thus available for presentation and argument at trial and at a direct appeal of any alleged error.

Answer:"
611-Somers,"Yes, the text above is describing an assignment of error, and the error is alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct. The specific allegation is that the prosecutor acted inappropriately by arguing that the Appellant knew the facts of the case before receiving the state’s discovery response and that guilt could be implied from that fact.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶19 Appellant first contends that the prosecutor acted inappropriately by arguing that Appellant knew the facts of the case before Appellant received the state’s discovery response and that guilt could be implied from that fact. Appellant refers to the Arraignment Hearing Transcript, the prosecutor’s opening statement and recordings of Appellant’s telephone conversations while Appellant was in custody. Appellant contends the prosecutor’s comments on the evidence were improper because he knew or should have known that Appellant was informed of the facts prior to and during the November 11, 2017 arraignment hearing. He states in his petition that “The prosecutor in this case knew that
he was not going to get a conviction based upon the testimony of the victim and BCI forensic scientist, thus choose to result(sic) to conduct clearly prohibited by the professional rules of conduct by telling the jury that defendant committed the crimes because he had information about the crimes before defendant should have known it, resulting in prosecutorial misconduct.” (Defendant Mason Somers Timely Motion for Postconviction Relief Pursuant To Ohio Revised Code Section 2953.21, February 25, 2019, Docket # 47).

{¶20} The alleged prosecutorial conduct was part of the record in this case. The prosecutor referenced Appellant's foreknowledge in his opening and closing statements, contending that Appellant had information about the crime long before the state responded to Appellant's discovery request. The state presented two recorded conversations of Appellant in support of its contention that the Appellant had committed the crimes described in the complaint because appellant had knowledge of the facts. Appellant's trial counsel addressed this issue in cross examination and closing, arguing that Appellant could have received the same information from other sources and the state had failed to rule out those alternatives.

{¶21} Appellant had the opportunity to raise the claim of prosecutorial misconduct that he now sets forth in the instant appeal at trial and in a direct appeal. Such claims, therefore, are barred under the doctrine of res judicata. State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 180, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967). The Perry court explained the doctrine as follows: “Under the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars the convicted defendant from raising and litigating in any proceeding, except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial which resulted in that judgment of conviction or on an appeal
from that judgment."" *Id.* at paragraph 8 of the syllabus. A defendant who was represented by counsel is barred from raising an issue in a petition for post-conviction relief if the defendant raised or could have raised the issue at trial or on direct appeal. *State v. Szefcyk*, 77 Ohio St.3d 93, 96, 671 N.E.2d 233 (1996).

{¶22} Appellant had the opportunity to raise the issue of the prosecutor's conduct at trial and a direct appeal thereafter, but failed to do so. This portion of the first assignment of error is overruled.

{¶23} Appellant argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to withdraw and request appointment of new counsel in the second part of his first assignment of error.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
611-Somers,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is related to the defense attorney's failure to withdraw from the case and testify, which is considered a strategic decision rather than misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Where ineffective assistance of counsel is alleged in a petition for postconviction relief, the defendant, in order to secure a hearing on his petition, must proffer evidence which, if believed, would establish not only that his trial counsel had substantially violated at least one of a defense attorney's essential duties to his client but also that said violation was prejudicial to the defendant.

*State v. Cole*, 2 Ohio St.3d 112, 114, 443 N.E.2d 169 (1982).

{¶24} Appellant's argument is based upon a contention that his trial counsel had the obligation to withdraw from the case so he could be called as a witness and testify as to his conversations with his client regarding the facts of the case, in an effort to rebut the prosecutor's contention that Appellant had foreknowledge of the facts. In support of his argument, Appellant offers his own affidavit describing his conversations with counsel regarding the facts of the case and references to the record of the case.
The decision whether to call any witness falls within the purview of trial tactics. *State v. Adkins*, 144 Ohio App.3d 633, 646, 761 N.E.2d 94 (12th Dist.2001); *Lakewood v. Town*, 106 Ohio App.3d 521, 527, 666 N.E.2d 599 (8th Dist.1995). Had Appellant’s counsel testified, it is likely that he would have waived attorney client privilege and subjected himself to prejudicial cross examination by the state. Appellant discloses an example of the potential prejudicial information in his petition when he admits his trial counsel warned him that his prior conviction of possession of drugs, if disclosed to the jury, would have a negative effect.

Appellant’s trial counsel addressed the state’s allegation regarding Appellant’s knowledge of facts by cross examination of the officer that identified the recordings and by suggesting to the jury the existence of alternative sources for the information in his closing argument. Trial counsel’s failure to withdraw and act as a witness in this case is not evidence of ineffective assistance, but part of a prudent trial strategy and “[w]e will not second-guess the strategic decisions counsel made at trial even though appellate counsel now argue that they would have defended differently.” *State v. Post*, 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 388, 513 N.E.2d 754 (1987) as cited in *State v. Mason*, 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 169, 1998-Ohio-370, 694 N.E.2d 932. Consequently, even if the trial court believed Appellant’s allegations, he has not provided evidence of a substantial violation of trial counsel’s duties.

We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding that the Appellant’s allegations were barred by res judicata or did not provide substantive grounds for relief. The first assignment of error is denied.

Answer:"
611-Somers,"No. The text above describes an assignment of error against the trial court and the defense attorney, not the prosecutor. The allegation is that the defense attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by advising the appellant not to testify.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶28} Appellant revisits his allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel in his second assignment of error, arguing his trial counsel violated an essential duty by advising him not to testify. “The advice provided by counsel to his or her client regarding the decision to testify is “a paradigm of the type of tactical decision that cannot be challenged as evidence of ineffective assistance.” State v. Winchester, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 79739, 2002–Ohio–2130, ¶ 12, quoting Hutchins v. Garrison, 724 F.2d 1425, 1436 (C.A.4, 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1065, 104 S.Ct. 750, 79 L.Ed.2d 207 (1984). See also, Jones v. Murray (C.A.4, 1991), 947 F.2d 1106, 1116, fn. 6. Nonetheless, a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel may be successful if the record demonstrates the defendant's decision whether or not to testify was the result of coercion. Id, citing Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 52–53 (1st Cir.1993).

{¶29} Nothing in the record suggests Appellant's decision to not testify was the result of coercion. Appellant has not shown that his decision to not testify was not of his own free will, and he therefore cannot challenge his decision to not testify as ineffective assistance of counsel.

{¶30} Appellant has admitted that at least one reason for counsel’s advice was his prior conviction for drug possession. As noted in our review of the first assignment of error, trial counsel employed a strategy that allowed him to attack the evidence without putting his client on the witness stand and exposing to cross examination.

{¶31} Even if the trial court accepted the assertions in Appellant’s affidavit as true, the trial court would not have abused its discretion by finding that the allegations did not state substantive grounds for relief as the facts as stated by Appellant do not support a claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.
Appellant’s second assignment of error is overruled.

III.

In his third assignment of error, Appellant claims the trial court failed to include findings of fact and conclusions of law in its entry denying the petition. Findings of fact and conclusions of law are mandatory if the trial court dismissed the petition without hearing as they are necessary “to apprise petitioner of the grounds for the judgment of the trial court and to enable the appellate courts to properly determine appeals in such a cause.’ Jones v. State, 8 Ohio St.2d 21, 22, 222 N.E.2d 313 (1966)

The exercise of findings and conclusions are essential in order to prosecute an appeal. Without them, a petitioner knows no more than he lost and hence is effectively precluded from making a reasoned appeal. In addition, the failure of a trial judge to make the requisite findings prevents any meaningful judicial review, for it is the findings and the conclusions which an appellate court reviews for error.

Answer:"
611-Somers,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is related to the trial court's entry and the lack of findings of fact and conclusions of law, not any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
We hold that the journal entry in this case satisfies the policy considerations announced by the Supreme Court of Ohio in Mapson, supra. The trial court did not label its entry as findings of fact and conclusions of law, but that is what its words import. State ex rel. Carrion v. Harris, 40 Ohio St.3d 19, 20, 530 N.E.2d 1330 (1988). We have previously held that “As long as the basis for the court's ruling can be gleamed from the entry, R.C. 2953.21 has been complied with.” State v. Wells, 5th Dist. Licking No. 94 CA 113, 1995 WL 495308, *1. In State v. Rouse, 5th Dist. Muskingum No. CT2013-0043, 2014-Ohio-483, ¶ 20, we found that an entry stating that the court found that the claims
were barred by res judicata was sufficient. The entry in the case sub judice contains that reference as well as a reference to the absence of “meritorious claims” and failure to address the arguments during the direct appeal. Appellant does not claim any prejudice from the alleged failure to provide findings of fact or conclusions of law and it is clear that Appellant was aware of the trial court’s rational as he presented argument, on pages 18 and 19 of his brief, that “res judicata is inapplicable here” and that “there are enough facts provided to verify Appellants (sic) claims and to grant relief.”

{¶35} Appellant’s third assignment of error is denied.

{¶36} The decision of the Muskingum County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO
EASTERN DIVISION AT COLUMBUS

JAVIER H. ARMENGAU,

Petitioner, : Case No. 2:19-cv-1146

- vs -

WARDEN, London
Correctional Institution,

: Respondent.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This habeas corpus case is before the Court for decision on the merits on the Amended Petition (ECF No. 70), the State Court Record (ECF No. 72 (Exhibits 1-44), 72-1 (Exhibits 45-112, and 72-2 (Trial Transcript)), the Return of Writ to the Amended Petition (ECF No. 73), and Petitioner’s Reply (ECF No. 77) and Summary of Reply (ECF No. 81).

Litigation History

On May 13, 2013, a Franklin County, Ohio, grand jury indicted Petitioner on three counts of kidnapping in violation of Ohio Revised Code § 2905.01)(Counts 1, 5, and 14), one count of public indecency in violation of Ohio Revised Code § 2907.09) (Count 2), three counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of Ohio Revised Code § 2907.05) (Counts 3, 7, and 8), six counts of rape in violation of Ohio Revised Code § 2907.02) (Counts 4, and 9-13), and five counts of sexual battery in
violation of Ohio Revised Code § 2907.03) (Counts 6, and 15-18). (Indictment, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Exhibit 1).

The case was tried from June 19 until July 7, 2014, when the trial jury found Petitioner guilty as to Count 2 (public indecency), Counts 3 and 8 (gross sexual imposition), Count 10 (rape), Count 14 (kidnapping), and Counts 15-18 (sexual battery)(State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Exhibit 5). Petitioner was acquitted on Counts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13 (Judgment Entry, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 5).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignments of error are related to the trial court's sentencing decisions and the merger of counts, not any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
On August 26, 2014, the trial court found that Counts 10 (rape) and 15 (sexual battery) merged under Ohio Revised Code § 2945.71 for the purposes of sentencing, with the State electing sentencing on Count 10. Armengau was then sentenced to concurrent sentences of fifteen months each in prison for Counts 3 and 8, nine years in prison for Count 10, four years in prison for Count 14, and thirty months each in prison for Counts 16, 17, and 18. Counts 10 and 14 were ordered to be served consecutively with all other sentences to be served concurrently, for an aggregate sentence of thirteen years in prison. Id. Petitioner was also sentenced to thirty days on the public indecency misdemeanor and credited with time served.1

Through new counsel, Petitioner appealed to the Ohio Tenth District Court of Appeals. That court overruled his first, second, fourth through seventh, and ninth assignments of error, sustained his third and eighth assignments of error, and remanded for re-sentencing on Counts 10, 14, 15, and 17. State v. Armengau, 2017-Ohio-4452 (Ohio App. 10th Dist., Jun. 22, 2017)(copy at State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 11, sometimes cited by Petitioner as 14AP-679)(“Armengau I”), appellate jurisdiction declined, 151 Ohio St. 3d 1511 (2018).

From its review of the trial record, the Tenth District Court of Appeals made the following findings:

1 Because Petitioner’s custody on Count 2 ended before he filed his Petition, any claims regarding that count are no longer cognizable in habeas corpus. Maleng v. Cook, 490 U.S. 488 (1989).
I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

¶ 2 During the period of the indicted offenses, appellant was an attorney licensed in Ohio, with a central Ohio general practice that over time became focused on criminal defense work. The women who accused him of sexual misconduct were clients or relatives of clients; two of the accusers also worked in appellant's law offices.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
284-Armengau,"Yes, the text describes an assignment of error alleging that the prosecutor (the state) committed misconduct. The specific misconduct alleged is that the prosecutor verbally amended the indictment during trial to conform to certain testimony, over the objection of the defense.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 3 Columbus police began investigating appellant in 2013 after one of the accusers, C.C., hired appellant to represent her son in criminal proceedings and complained of appellant's unwanted physical advances. After appellant's arrest at the termination of that investigation, other accusers began coming forth, leading to an 18-count indictment issued by the Franklin County Grand Jury alleging crimes victimizing five different women: Counts 1, 2, and 3 alleged kidnapping, public indecency, and gross sexual imposition involving accuser C.C., all occurring on or about April 4, 2013. Counts 4 and 5 alleged rape and kidnapping involving accuser L.G., arising out of a single incident occurring between August 1 and August 31, 2008. Counts 6 and 7 alleged sexual battery and gross sexual imposition involving accuser A.C., occurring between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2010. Count 8 alleged gross sexual imposition involving accuser K.R., occurring between August 8 and September 17, 2008. Counts 10 through 13 alleged rape involving accuser L.M. Count 14 alleged kidnapping involving L.M. in connection with one of the rape counts. Counts 15 through 18 alleged sexual battery against L.M. All the counts involving L.M. alleged conduct occurring between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. All counts involving all accusers alleged that the criminal conduct occurred in Franklin County, Ohio.

¶ 4 The state provided a bill of particulars on June 1, 2014, amended it on the eve of trial on June 6, 2014, and further amended it at the close of the state's case on June 22, 2014. The state, over objection, also verbally amended the indictment during trial to conform to certain testimony. The specifics of these amendments are more extensively developed below in connection with appellant's first and sixth assignments of error (emphasis supplied).

II. TRIAL PROCEEDINGS

¶ 5 The prosecution relied chiefly on the testimony of the five accusers. In addition, three other similarly situated women testified as other-acts witnesses regarding events that did not give rise to further criminal charges. Two of these described appellant's conduct
in connection with consensual sexual relationships, and one testified regarding appellant's offensive conduct or statements towards her.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It provides a detailed account of the events leading up to and during the trial, including the testimony of witnesses and the actions of the appellant. There is no mention of an assignment of error or any allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 6 The first accuser that testified at trial was C.C. She stated that she hired appellant to represent her son in a criminal matter, and met with appellant at his office on South High Street in Columbus. On April 4, 2013, C.C. received a call from appellant's secretary asking her to come to appellant's Columbus office to discuss the upcoming trial. During the course of their interview, appellant retrieved a legal file and sat next to C.C., brushing up against her. Appellant then opened the file, C.C. testified, and when the file fell to the floor, he gripped C.C.'s left arm firmly and put his right arm down her shirt, pulling her bra away from her breasts. C.C. testified that she was unable to move during this episode because of appellant's physical restraint. C.C. then attempted to readjust her clothing, and realized that appellant had stood up and unzipped his pants, placing his penis before her face. C.C. was offended, and quickly left the office, calling a friend to pick her up. She later called her sister, K.C., to complain of the episode.

¶ 7 K.C. herself testified to confirm the phone call from C.C. She described her sister as frantic during the call, which prompted K.C. to advise C.C. to call the police.

¶ 8 After C.C. reported the incident to the Columbus police, investigators contacted C.C. and asked her to set up further meetings with appellant that could be recorded as evidence. She exchanged several recorded phone calls with appellant and eventually met him at a restaurant, where their conversation was recorded and observed by police. During this meeting, appellant again made unwanted advances towards C.C. by repeatedly putting his hand on her thigh, and did not deny his prior conduct during their meeting at his office. In the course of C.C.'s testimony, these recordings were played for the jury in open court.

¶ 9 Officer Jeffrey Cain, of the Columbus Division of Police, testified that he went to C.C.'s apartment on April 4, 2013, to take the report of a sexual assault.

¶ 10 Corporal Jeff Zech, of the Franklin County Sheriff's Office, testified regarding the technical aspects of the audio recording process used for the restaurant meeting between C.C. and appellant.

¶ 11 Detective Jason Sprague, of the Columbus Division of Police, testified regarding the preparations for the restaurant meeting between C.C. and appellant. He was in the vicinity during
the meeting but had difficulty picking up the conversation because recording sound was poor. After appellant's arrest upon leaving the restaurant, Detective Sprague participated in a recorded interview with appellant at the police station.

¶ 12 During Detective Sprague's testimony, the recording of appellant's post-arrest interview was played in open court. In this interview, appellant described in detail his recent meeting with C.C. at his office regarding her son's case. He denied any inappropriate conduct on his part towards C.C. on that or any other occasion. He professed to be baffled by some of C.C.'s text messages and phone calls that contained flirtatious or sexual references, and stated that he had previously asked her to refrain from such comments.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It provides context and details about the case, including the testimonies of Detective Jeffery Ackley, C.C., and the appellant. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor in the provided text.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 13 Detective Jeffery Ackley, of the Columbus Division of Police, testified about his participation in the investigation. He acted as security backup and an observer during the restaurant meeting. His visual observations corroborated C.C.'s testimony regarding appellant's physical actions, although the ambient noise prevented him from overhearing their conversation directly. He was able to make a partial video recording of the meeting using his personal recording device, and this was later transferred to CD by investigators. The video was partially played for the jury but did not include any of appellant's alleged physical advances.

¶ 14 On cross-examination of C.C., defense counsel played a video recording made in Columbus police facilities during a telephone conversation between C.C. and her incarcerated son, who was awaiting trial for aggravated murder and other charges. In the recorded conversation, C.C. several times assured her son that, due to the developing conflict with appellant, the son would receive not only new defense counsel but a different prosecutor and judge for his case. Upon further questioning, C.C. testified that she felt that these changes would benefit her son, because she was dismayed by the harsh 43-year sentence offered to her son in plea discussions, and doubted whether appellant had obtained the best available result.

¶ 15 In his testimony at trial regarding C.C.'s accusations, appellant denied any inappropriate conduct towards C.C. He described his representation of her son against several extremely serious charges, including aggravated murder. Appellant testified that his primary contact was with other family members or his jailed client via telephone, because C.C., after two brief initial meetings, made herself unavailable. While other family members came to various court hearings, C.C. did not. After several months, in April
2013, the trial date approached and appellant advised his client that the prosecution's 43–year offer was preferable to trial and a life sentence. Appellant felt that the state had put together a very solid investigation and his client would have little chance in front of a jury, and a plea to the indictment without an agreed sentence would result in more time.

¶ 16 Appellant testified that prior to the April 4 meeting, he instructed his assistant to contact C.C. and arrange a meeting to update C.C. regarding the case. The meeting was arranged for April 4, and C.C. arrived as agreed. Her behavior struck him as odd. He asked about an individual that she had previously introduced to him as her husband, and she laughed and stated that she had this individual arrested. They then discussed her son's case, and C.C. expressed extreme disappointment with the plea offer. Appellant explained the situation to her and showed her some of his case notes. He denied sitting next to her on the office couch or touching her in any way. He was taken aback when C.C., on leaving the office, asked if he would like to have dinner some time.

¶ 17 Appellant testified that the next day he learned from his client, C.C.'s son, that the client no longer wanted to accept the plea deal. C.C. then called him, and, in one of the conversations that he later learned was recorded by her at police request, asked for a dinner meeting to further discuss her son's plea. During the phone call, C.C. made several flirtatious or sexually charged remarks, which appellant deflected. He was not particularly put off by this because he considered C.C. to be somewhat unstable or unpredictable, and in any case he had experienced flirtatious comments from other clients and could usually steer such conversations back to business without difficulty. Appellant then described the meeting with C.C. at the restaurant, and denied putting his hand on her thigh or touching her inappropriately.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It provides context and testimony from witnesses in a trial, but it does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 18 The defense called S.K., C.C.'s former roommate. She testified that, in March 2013, C.C. approached her about blackmailing appellant. C.C. appeared frustrated by appellant's representation and the poor plea offer made by the state in her son's murder case. C.C. was also upset about the amount of money she had paid appellant for her son's representation. C.C. told S.K. that she had lied regarding the sexual incident so that she could sue appellant and get a new attorney for her son. She promised to give S.K. a car if S.K. would participate in the blackmail scheme. S.K. refused to participate when she learned that appellant had been arrested, whereupon C.C. kicked S.K. out of their shared apartment.
¶ 19 The second accuser to appear at trial was A.C. She testified that she began working for appellant in the late 1990's, during the time that appellant represented her in a custody dispute. Appellant's principal office at the time was in Marion, Ohio. A.C. worked for appellant for over seven years, and she eventually resided in one of his rental properties. Early in the working relationship, A.C. testified appellant approached her when she was working in his Marion office, rubbed her shoulders, put his hands down her shirt, and eventually requested that she perform oral sex. She acquiesced. These incidents went on for some time, including an incident when she was in his Columbus office during 2005 or 2006. She could provide no specific dates for any of the incidents except for one occurring on September 11, 2001. On direct and cross-examination, A.C. agreed that she has a lengthy history of disabling mental illness and experienced many civil and criminal legal difficulties as a result. She stated that the sexual activity with appellant was “to an extent” consensual, but that at the time she felt she had little choice but to comply with his demands. (Tr. at 834.)

¶ 20 Appellant testified that he first met A.C., as she had testified, during representation of her in a custody matter in 1999. He agreed that she had worked for him off and on over the years and had rented a home from him. Appellant denied having any sexual relationship of any kind with A.C. He represented her on numerous legal matters, some arising from her mental health issues, which often led to run-ins with police. This legal representation ended when A.C. complained that appellant was taking too long obtaining a dissolution for her.

¶ 21 The third accuser to testify was L.G., who testified that she met appellant in 2006 or 2007 when she retained appellant to represent her son in a legal matter. Their interactions began professionally, but she claimed appellant soon began acting inappropriately. She claimed that at one point, appellant demanded oral sex in exchange for a promise to help her son. On several occasions he stripped naked in front of her in his office and masturbated. Later, on the eve of her son's court appearance in September or October 2007, she went to appellant's office for a meeting. Appellant and another man were drinking in the office. L.G. claimed appellant offered her a drink and suggested that if she performed oral sex on both men, her son's case would have a better outcome. L.G. refused and left the office.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It provides context and testimony related to a case involving allegations of sexual misconduct by an attorney (appellant) against a witness (L.G.). The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 22 L.G. testified that next day, while in court attending her son's sentencing hearing, she realized that the man she had seen the night before with appellant was, in fact, the judge in her son's case. She
was extremely upset when the judge imposed the maximum sentence on her son at this hearing. After the hearing, L.G. claimed appellant forced her to perform oral sex on him in an attorney conference room in the courthouse, physically restraining her from leaving. She claimed that after this, she was violently ill as she rejoined her family outside. L.G. testified that she had made a police report about the incident in 2009 and refiled it in 2013 when learning of appellant's arrest.

¶ 23 Prosecution witness S.W. testified that she was L.G.'s aunt and had observed interaction between L.G. and appellant. She advanced some funds for appellant's fees in the defense of L.G.'s son and later took L.G. to retrieve paperwork from appellant's office after L.G. had terminated the attorney-client relationship on behalf of her son. S.W. observed a heated confrontation between L.G. and appellant, prompted in part by appellant's refusal to return the son's case file. At some point in the conversation, L.G. called appellant a rapist. From appellant's office, they drove to the Columbus police department, where L.G. went inside for at least two and one-half hours while S.W. remained in the car. On previous occasions, S.W. had accompanied L.G. for case conferences, and felt that appellant was upset that L.G. was not alone and would not come up to his office alone.

¶ 24 Prosecution witness J.B. testified that she was L.G.'s de facto mother-in-law, as L.G. had lived with her son for 24 years even though the two were not married. She attended a meeting with L.G. at appellant's office in 2009 and observed an argument or scene in which L.G. called appellant a rapist. Thereafter, she rode in the car with L.G. and S.W. to the police station, and testified that L.G. was in the police station only 15 or 20 minutes. On another occasion, J.B. attended a hearing for her grandson at the courthouse and waited outside in the hall during proceedings. J.B. testified that, at some point, L.G. emerged from the courtroom and became violently ill. When J.B. asked what was the matter, L.G. replied “if you only knew.” (Tr. at 1291.)

¶ 25 On cross-examination of L.G., the defense offered the dates and results of L.G.'s son's criminal cases, and the dates of appellant's representation in those cases, to impeach her testimony. In particular, the defense introduced court records indicating that her son had received only community control, rather than prison, in his appearance before the trial judge she identified as associating with appellant.
¶ 26 In his testimony regarding his contact with L.G., appellant agreed that he had represented her son in a criminal case. He also noted that he had represented her personally in several criminal cases in 2006, as well as her other son during the same period. Appellant denied all allegations by L.G. regarding sexual conduct. He testified that his representation of her son ended when the son received probation in the cases on which appellant worked, but that she asked him to appear at sentencing involving the son's other case. On that occasion, appellant spoke briefly with L.G. before leaving after the son's current counsel, a public defender, arrived.

¶ 27 Attorney Emily Huddleson testified for the defense regarding L.G.'s accusations. She stated that she was the public defender who represented L.G.'s son at the sentencing hearing in question. She testified that after sentencing, she and L.G. walked out in the lobby together, were met by an older woman, and the three discussed the sentence and the reasoning behind it for 20 or 30 minutes. Despite the fact that Huddleson was assigned counsel for all four cases involving L.G.'s son that day, L.G. complained to Huddleson that she had paid appellant a lot of money and felt he should still be there. Huddleson testified that appellant was initially present at the hearing but not there for the conclusion when the judge imposed a prison sentence on L.G.'s son. Huddleson described L.G. as furious after her son received prison time. Huddleson did not observe L.G. crying, being sick to her stomach, or going into a courthouse conference room with appellant or anyone else after the hearing.

¶ 28 The fourth accuser to testify was K.R. K.R. testified that appellant represented K.R.'s boyfriend in a case in which he had been accused of domestic violence against K.R. Despite being the victim of the domestic violence at issue, K.R. met with appellant to pursue dropping the charges. Appellant subsequently represented K.R. in a criminal matter of her own. Before her trial in September 2008, K.R. testified they met in appellant's Marion office, where he offered her a drink, rubbed her shoulders, and began feeling her breasts. K.R. refused to have sex with appellant, whereupon appellant began masturbating in front of her. K.R. told her mother about the incident, and reported the incident to the bar association, police, and a judge of the Marion County common pleas court. After the incident, she obtained new representation. Despite the statement that she gave to police and court, she heard nothing more from local authorities. Her own criminal case concluded with a guilty plea and a one-year sentence in prison. The Columbus Bar Association referred her complaint to the Supreme Court of Ohio, and a representative of the Supreme Court interviewed her regarding her allegations. To her knowledge, nothing came of the matter. After
learning of appellant's 2013 arrest involving similar allegations, she contacted a detective with the Columbus police to renew her allegations in the matter.

¶ 29} Regarding K.R., appellant testified that he recalled representing her in 2008, when they disagreed about a plea offer from the prosecution. She terminated representation when he refused to seek a continuance on what he felt were unwarranted medical grounds. He was later summoned to court for a pretrial and was requested by the prosecution and the judge to arrive early. When he arrived, the judge and prosecutor informed him that K.R. had reported a sexual assault. He withdrew from her case, and a new lawyer was appointed. Appellant denied any sexual misconduct with K.R.

¶ 30} The final accuser to testify was L.M., who described a long history of coerced sexual relations with appellant. Her testimony with regard to dates was generally vague, and often established only by reference to the age of her young daughter, born in 1997, during the various incidents described.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It is a narrative of events involving L.M. and her attorney, appellant, and does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 31} L.M. described her background as an immigrant from Venezuela with limited English. She came to America with her Venezuelan fiancé, and after they married in Florida he took a job in Ohio. She testified that she first retained appellant in late 1998 or early 1999 to represent her in divorce proceedings. She selected him based on his ability to communicate in Spanish. She also had difficulties with her immigration status, which was solely based on her then-husband's student visa, and appellant advised her to delay the divorce while dealing with these immigration issues. As a result, the divorce action went on for a considerable time, and L.M. met many times with appellant. She traveled from her home in Groveport, in southeast Franklin County, to appellant's office in Marion for these meetings, which appellant usually scheduled for Friday afternoon or Saturday. At first she brought her infant daughter along, but approximately three months after taking the case appellant requested that she not bring the child to meetings.

¶ 32} The first incident she claimed occurred about four or five months after she retained appellant. She testified that during an office conference at appellant's Marion office, appellant offered L.M. a cup of coffee, and thereafter she lost consciousness. She awoke alone on appellant's office couch with her clothes in disarray and indications that she had experienced sexual intercourse. She felt confused, as if drugged or drunk. After a short time, appellant
returned to the room and told her she had fainted. As a result of this incident, L.M. avoided seeing appellant for the next two months.

¶ 33 L.M. resumed contact with appellant after a series of phone calls from him in which he advised that she was at risk of deportation and would lose custody of her daughter. Around this time in 1999, appellant provided a tenant reference that helped L.M. move from Groveport to an apartment in Dublin, in northern Franklin County and thus closer to Marion. She claimed that she met again with appellant in his Marion office at this time, and another assault occurred. After briefly discussing her case, appellant suddenly approached her and pulled down his pants. Appellant threatened a poor result in her legal matters if she did not perform oral sex. He placed his hands behind her head, thereby “restraining [her] head against his penis,” told her to “do it,” and forced his penis into her mouth. (Tr. at 1483.)

¶ 34 L.M. testified that after that incident sexual conduct between appellant and L.M. was frequent over approximately the next three years, always under the implied threat that if he dropped her case she would lose her immigration status and custody of her daughter. These events first took place at appellant's Marion office, where appellant eventually hired her to do office work to help pay her legal bills. Later appellant kept a residential apartment in Marion and took her there. Some incidents also took place at her apartment in Dublin, where appellant would ask L.M. to lock her daughter in another room. Although L.M.’s testimony did not provide details of any specific instances for most of the abuse occurring after the two specific incidents described above, she did testify in more detail about later events that formed the basis for two of the rape charges: sometime in 2000 or 2001, appellant drove L.M. in a white truck from his Marion office to a rural field where he forced her to have vaginal sex. Six months later, he repeated the offense.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The misconduct is alleged against the appellant, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 35 L.M. testified that around the time that her daughter was three and one-half or four years old, L.M. became pregnant by appellant and appellant insisted that she have an abortion. The last time she claimed she had sexual contact with appellant was 2003. This was the year in which she obtained her permanent U.S. residency, and with her immigration status settled she no longer felt compelled to submit to appellant's demands.

¶ 36 L.M. learned of appellant's arrest in 2013 when her daughter emailed a link to a newspaper story. From this she learned that she was not the only person who claimed to suffer appellant's advances. After discovering this, L.M. called appellant to tell him that she was
glad that the arrest would prevent him from taking advantage of other women. L.M. then contacted the Columbus police detective named in the news story to complain of the past incidents.

¶ 37 On cross-examination, L.M. denied that appellant had ceased representing her in her divorce case by 2001. Defense counsel offered docket items to establish that a different attorney appeared on her behalf in the domestic action after that time. L.M. responded that many attorneys had represented her in different matters through this time, but she felt certain that appellant continued to act on her behalf. She acknowledged that her original divorce action was dismissed and she eventually divorced under a new case filed in 2003 by another attorney. She also acknowledged that, despite her professed hatred for appellant arising from past abuse, she had often approached appellant for informal assistance with legal or practical matters over the years during and after the abusive conduct. She stated that she viewed this assistance as repayment for past abuse: “I wanted to take advantage of him because he abused me so—for so long. * * * So he abusing [me] so long, so he has to do it for me.” (Tr. at 1645.)

¶ 38 Generally, appellant testified that he had a long-standing professional relationship with L.M., beginning when L.M. approached him for representation in a divorce matter. Even after his representation of her in her divorce matter terminated in approximately 2001, appellant testified L.M. repeatedly sought his assistance in several legal and non-legal matters. Regarding the duration of his legal representation, appellant testified that he filed L.M.’s divorce paperwork in December 1999 and withdrew from representation in 2001. Other attorneys took her case thereafter. In 2004, appellant and his wife separated briefly, and appellant and L.M. dated for about two weeks. Appellant denied ever having any type of sexual contact with L.M. at any other time during their relationship. Their brief dating relationship ended abruptly when L.M. told appellant she was pregnant, and appellant, who had undergone a vasectomy, understood that she had been seeing other men. He denied arranging an abortion for her.

¶ 39 The next witness was L.L., who was not the object of any indicted offenses, but testified as to appellant's conduct when he represented her in 2009 as she faced a murder charge. The defense objected unsuccessfully to this “other acts” evidence.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not describe an assignment of error. It provides context and details about the testimony of witnesses in a trial, including statements made by the appellant and other witnesses. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor in the provided text.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 40 L.L. testified that during one of her pre-trial meetings with appellant in a jailhouse conference room, appellant illustrated his views on witness credibility by stating that “he could rape [her] in
the room and it would be [her] word against his and nobody would be the wiser.” (Tr. at 1794.) Appellant also stated on that occasion that L.L. could crawl under the table and perform oral sex on him because there were no correction officers around, and it would be only her word against his if she complained.

¶ 41 In his testimony, appellant denied making any such comments to L.L.

¶ 42 M.H. was another witness offered by the prosecution for “other acts” testimony, again over objection. M.H. testified that appellant represented her as her attorney for over a decade, beginning when she was 17 years old and incarcerated in the juvenile detention facility. Upon initial release, she and appellant met at his Marion office, went to dinner, and went back and had sex in his office. Over the ensuing 12 years, appellant represented M.H. on multiple cases but she never paid him. They continued to have sex during this time, and M.H. accompanied appellant on a vacation to Florida.

¶ 43 Appellant testified that he met M.H. at the very beginning of his legal career, when he substituted for an attorney who had failed to appear at the Marion County Juvenile Center. M.H. was 17 and charged with a felony. She later approached appellant for representation in a divorce. Rather than going on a dinner date followed by sex, as described by M.H., appellant recalled that they had dinner with M.H.'s stepfather and mother, and he left that dinner meeting alone. Appellant adamantly denied ever having sex with M.H. He agreed that he continued to represent her in various criminal matters for 12 years after the initial case.

¶ 44 C.P. testified over objection as the third and final “other acts” witness. She testified that she met appellant about handling her divorce. He did not do so because she eventually proceeded with a dissolution in another state. She then retained him to represent her boyfriend in a criminal case. C.P. acted as a liaison between the boyfriend and appellant while the boyfriend was incarcerated. During one jail call, which was recorded, C.P. told the boyfriend that appellant had slapped her buttocks while she was leaving appellant's office one day. Appellant learned of this conversation and told her he was upset about this both because it would create friction with his client and because he knew that all jailhouse calls were recorded. Later, after appellant was removed from the boyfriend's case because he was a potential witness, C.P. and appellant began a consensual sexual relationship. This continued intermittently until just prior to appellant's trial.
¶ 45} Appellant's testimony with respect to C.P. denied any sexual conduct between them. He testified that in the course of his criminal defense practice, his office routinely obtained and reviewed audio discs of recorded jailhouse phone conversations involving many of his clients. After reviewing the recorded jailhouse phone call in which C.P. told her boyfriend that appellant had slapped or groped her buttocks, appellant asked for a meeting to explain why she would make such a false statement to his client. She stated that she was upset by reports of the boyfriend's past infidelity and merely wished to make the boyfriend jealous. He then advised her to be cautious with such conversations.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it describes the appellant's testimony that the accusations against him were the result of a coordinated campaign by the Franklin County Prosecutor's Office, the Attorney General, and the Columbus police to remove him from the practice of law because of his effective advocacy in criminal cases.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 46} In addition to his testimony addressing the specific accusations presented by the state's witnesses, appellant testified in his case-in-chief regarding his background. He stated that he graduated from Capital Law School in 1998 as an older, non-traditional student with a growing family. He clerked with an experienced criminal defense attorney in Marion, Ohio, during law school, and shared space in that office for one year after passing the bar. He then secured his own space and began his own practice in Marion and, eventually, in Columbus, Mansfield, and Cleveland. His practice, general at first, eventually focused on criminal defense with a smaller proportion of domestic and civil litigation. He testified that he believed the accusations against him were the result of a coordinated campaign by the Franklin County Prosecutor's Office, the Attorney General, and the Columbus police to remove him from the practice of law because of his effective advocacy in criminal cases.

¶ 47} The defense presented testimony from several current or former female employees and clients of appellant's practice. These witnesses testified that they had never experienced or witnessed any misconduct by appellant. The defense also sought to attack the credibility of the accusers by introducing testimony, photographs, and documentary evidence that conflicted with the accuser's descriptions of appellant's office locations and interior furnishings.

¶ 48} With respect to the charges involving L.M., the jury returned guilty verdicts on Count 10 of the indictment (rape), Count 14 of the indictment (kidnapping), and Counts 15, 16, 17, and 18 of the indictment (sexual battery). The court merged Counts 15 and 10 of the indictment for sentencing purposes, and the prosecution elected to sentence on Count 10 of the indictment for rape. The court declined to merge any other counts involving L.M., in particular,
finding that the rape and kidnapping counts, although arising out of the same transaction, were driven by a separate animus.

¶ 49 The jury returned a guilty verdict on Count 2, public indecency, involving C.C. The trial court addressed this in a separate misdemeanor sentencing entry imposing 30 days jail time with full credit for time served.

Armengau I, supra.

Under 28 U.S.C. 2254(e)(1) as enacted by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214)(the ""AEDPA""), these findings of fact by the Tenth District are presumed to be correct by this Court unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. Warren v. Smith, 161 F.3d 358, 360-61 (6th Cir. 1998).

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors and issues discussed in the text are related to the trial court's decisions, the state court's rulings, and the application of legal principles such as the Pinholster decision. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
In evaluating state court findings of fact, this Court is limited to considering the evidence that was before the state courts. Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170 (2011). On the basis of the Pinholster decision, the Magistrate Judge has excluded a number of exhibits tendered by Petitioner, all of them portions of indictments in other cases, which were not presented to the Ohio courts (See ECF Nos. 54, 55, 63, 71). Petitioner has objected (ECF No. 78), but Chief Judge Marbley has not yet resolved those Objections. Having reviewed the Objections, the Magistrate Judge notes that they argue Petitioner’s case on the merits, but do not address the Pinholster bar. Petitioner offers the distinction that “Pinholster dealt with the petitioner's personal records that weren't demonstrative or comparative but rather related directly to the personal defense of the petitioner that would have been admissible in trial through testimony.” However, the rule in Pinholster is not limited to the particular kinds of extra-record facts Pinholster tried to introduce in habeas, but applies broadly to all extra-record evidence.

In the course of these proceedings, Petitioner has often referred to the dissent of Judge Gary
Tyack\(^2\) in *Armengau I*. The Magistrate Judge notes that Judge Tyack dissented on issues of law and not from any of these findings of fact.

On August 7, 2015, Petitioner filed a motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial (State Court Record, ECF No. 77, Ex. 22). The trial court denied leave on a finding that Petitioner had not shown he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the new evidence he wished to present. *Id.* at Ex. 25. The Tenth District affirmed and the Supreme Court of Ohio denied review. *Id.* at Exs. 33, 36.

On September 19, 2017, Petitioner filed another motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial. *Id.* at Ex. 55. The trial court denied the motion, the Tenth District again affirmed, and the Supreme Court of Ohio again denied review. *Id.* at Exs. 58, 62, 65.

On January 16, 2018, prior to re-sentencing on remand, Petitioner moved to dismiss Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 29, arguing that he was convicted of crimes that were never presented to a grand jury and that he was actually innocent. (Presentence Motion for Dismissal, State Court Record, ECF No. 72-1, Ex. 70, PageID 9204-15). The trial court denied the motion. *Id.* at Ex. 72. The Tenth District affirmed.\(^3\) *State v. Armengau*, 2019-Ohio-101 (10th Dist. Mar. 21, 2019)(“*Armengau II*”), appellate jurisdiction declined, 157 Ohio St.3d 1405 (2019).

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error being discussed is related to the trial court's sentencing decision and the doctrines of res judicata and law of the case, not any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
On March 27, 2018, pursuant to the Tenth District’s remand, the trial court found that Counts 14 (kidnapping) and 17 (sexual battery) merged with Count 10 (rape) for the purposes of sentencing. The trial court imposed a four-year prison term for Count 15 (sexual battery) to run consecutively with Count 10. Armengau’s previously imposed concurrent sentences of fifteen months each in prison for Counts 3 and 8, and thirty months each in prison for Counts 16 and 18 were ordered to remain in full force and effect. *Id.* at Ex. 77.

\(^2\) The Return points out that Gary Tyack is now the elected prosecutor of Franklin County, Ohio. He will, however, be referred to in this Report as “Judge Tyack,” the capacity in which he was involved with this case.

\(^3\) The panel on Armengau’s first direct appeal were Judges Klatt, Sadler, and Tyack (dissenting); the panel on this second appeal were Judges Dorrian, Brown, and Luper Schuster.
On appeal, the Tenth District overruled Armengau’s second assignment of error and determined that Armengau’s third assignment of error was barred by the doctrines of res judicata and law of the case. The appellate court sustained Armengau’s first assignment of error and remanded the matter to the trial court for resentencing on Count 15. *State v. Armengau*, 2020-Ohio-3552 (Ohio App. 10th Dist., Jun. 30, 2020) (*Armengau II*), appellate jurisdiction declined, 2020-Ohio-4811 (2020). That re-sentencing remains pending, but Magistrate Judge Deavers earlier decided that did not prevent the case from being ripe (ECF No. 40).

Petitioner avers he placed his Petition in the prison mailing system on March 14, 2019 (Petition, ECF No. 1, PageID 126). This counts as the filing date. *Houston v. Lack*, 487 U.S. 266 (1988); *Cook v. Stegall*, 295 F.3d 517, 521 (6th Cir. 2002). Petitioner filed of right an Amended Petition on April 11, 2019 (ECF No. 7), and a Second Amended Petition with court permission on June 13, 2021 (ECF No. 70).

**Positions of the parties:**

**The Second Amended Petition**

In his Second Amended Petition (ECF No. 70), Petitioner pleads the following grounds for relief:

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"Yes, the text is describing an assignment of error that alleges misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is specifically against the prosecutor for adding unindicted and uncharged allegations to the indictment mid-trial, changing the locations of the alleged crimes, and failing to present evidence supporting the indictment.","Context information is below.
---------------------
**Ground One:** Petitioner was denied his Constitutional Rights to Due process and Fundamental Fairness when he was convicted, sentenced and resentenced upon insufficient evidence and convicted and resentenced for unindicted and uncharged alleged conduct in Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 in violation of the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and contrary to the United States Supreme Court's holding in *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307 (1979) and the Ohio Supreme Court's holdings in *State v. Hampton*, 2012-Ohio-5688 [footnote omitted; official citation 134 Ohio St.3d 44], *Knight v. State*, 54 Ohio St. 365 (1896), and *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St. 3d 259.
Supporting Facts: Petitioner was indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged incidents that occurred in Columbus, Ohio (Franklin County) on unknown dates but sometime between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2008. During trial Petitioner established that he did not commit the indicted crimes. Prosecutors then, mid-trial, added three (3) years of unindicted and uncharged allegations to the indictment by amendment to circumvent the defense. After adding three (3) years to the indictment, Petitioner was able to establish that he could not have committed any of the indicted alleged crimes because by the relevant part of the expanded time frame, Petitioner had never been to the locations where the ""victims"" first claimed the indicted crimes occurred. Prosecutors then, mid-trial, changed the locations to Marion, Ohio, to circumvent the defense. No evidence was presented as to the elements of the factual incidents supporting the indictment.

Ground Two: Petitioner was denied his right to due process of law and notice of the specific offenses (charges) for which he was required to defend and for which he was convicted, sentenced and resentenced in Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Petitioner's Constitutional rights under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution were further violated where the charging document/instrument failed to adequately inform him of the specific crime for which he was indicted and for which he would be tried, convicted, sentenced and resentenced in Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"Yes, the error is alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The text describes several instances of misconduct by the prosecutor, including adding unindicted allegations to the indictment, changing locations of alleged incidents mid-trial, and introducing evidence that was not part of the original charges.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Supporting Facts: Petitioner was indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged incidents that occurred in Columbus, Ohio on unknown dates but sometime between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. During trial Petitioner established that he did not commit the indicted crimes. Prosecutors then added three (3) years of unindicted allegations to the indictment to circumvent the defense. After adding three years to the indictment, Petitioner was able to establish that he could not have committed any of the indicted alleged crimes because by the relevant part of the expanded time frame, Petitioner had never been to the locations where the alleged victims initially claimed the incidents occurred. Prosecutors then changed the locations to Marion, Ohio, mid-trial, to circumvent the defense. The indictment, jury instruction nor the verdict forms identify any specific factual basis for conviction. During trial prosecutors were substituting 404(B) and ""other act"" evidence for the charged crimes that were never mentioned prior to trial. Petitioner was ultimately being tried for factual bases that were not part of the indictment. During resentencing the trial court didn't know what factual basis was applied by prosecutors to any of the counts subject to resentencing and couldn't determine what incidents the jury considered and thereafter resentenced Petitioner to
prison for alleged incidents that never resulted in conviction and which even prosecutors never asked the jury to consider. The Court of Appeals in 14 AP 679 confirmed that the alleged crimes for which Petitioner has supposedly been convicted were not the crimes for which he was indicted (¶ 56-61, June 22, 2017 decision). With regard to Counts 2 and 3, evidence was introduced which if believed allowed the jury to convict for an allegation that was ""other-act"" evidence. This alleged incident was not noticed in the indictment or bills of particulars. That claim was alleged to have occurred on April 10, 2013, at a different location. The probability that for Count 2 and 3 the jury considered the unindicted other-act of April 10, 2013 is supported by several facts. The jury acquitted Petitioner of the kidnapping with respect to the April 4th incident.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it discusses issues related to the indictment, the trial process, and the jury's verdict, but it does not specifically accuse the prosecutor of any misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Although legally not dispositive, logically and factually, the acquittal rendered the conviction for the April 4th alleged Gross Sexual Imposition an impossibility as the acquittal for the kidnapping negated the proof beyond a reasonable doubt required for ""force"" or ""threat of force"". In light of this fact, Petitioner's testimony, Jennifer Young's testimony, Leslie Todd's testimony and Shirley Koval's testimony, acknowledging that the alleged ""victim"" admitted her claims were untrue, the jury may have rejected the April 4th alleged incident and considered the April 10th allegation where the alleged ""victim"" testified that Petitioner squeezed her thigh several times and where Detective Jeff Ackley testified to witnessing and video-taping the incident. Ackley testified that while he video-taped the entire incident, due to a malfunction, the part where Petitioner was supposedly touching the alleged ""victim"" was not recorded. The indictment in Petitioner's case informed him of alleged offenses that he would not have to defend. Another fact that confirms the lack of constitutionally required notice, lack of unanimity, and violation of Petitioner's Sixth Amendment Apprendi claim is the material disagreement between what the Court of Appeals claims are the facts supporting Count 16 and the facts prosecutors assert support Count 16. The Court of Appeals claims that Count 16 is an alleged unspecified incident that occurred in Franklin County and prosecutors who indicted and tried the case assert that the incident supporting Count 16 occurred in Marion County, Ohio.

**Ground Three:** Petitioner was denied his right to due process of law and protections against double jeopardy as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when the court allowed the state to constructively amend the indictment to add unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed conduct and where the trial court refused a requested unanimity instruction and failed to instruct the jury that the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard had to be applied to one factual incident and where after resentencing, Petitioner remains unable to plead a conviction or acquittal to Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 and where the factual basis for
conviction cannot be determined as decided by the jury and where Petitioner has been resentenced for alleged crimes with which he was never charged and in several counts with crimes for which he wasn't even convicted.

284-Armengau,"Yes, the text describes an assignment of error alleging that the prosecutor (the state) committed misconduct. The specific allegations against the prosecutor include:

1. Adding unindicted allegations to the indictment to circumvent the defense.
2. Changing the locations of the alleged crimes from Columbus, Ohio to Marion, Ohio to circumvent the defense.
3. Substituting other-act evidence for the charged crimes during the trial.
4. Arbitrarily reassigning counts and changing the factual basis for conviction.
5. Failing to provide a specific factual basis for conviction in the indictment, jury instructions, or verdict forms.
6. Continuously amending the indictment and bill of particulars mid-trial to circumvent the defense.

These actions are attributed to the prosecutor and are described as misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
**Supporting Facts:** Petitioner was indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged incidents that occurred in Columbus, Ohio on unknown dates but sometime between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. The alleged ""victim"" in Counts 9-18 couldn't provide a date, week, month or year for any alleged assault. During trial Petitioner established that he did not commit the indicted crimes. Prosecutors then added three (3) years of unindicted allegations to the indictment to circumvent the defense. After adding three (3) years to the indictment, Petitioner was able to establish that he could not have committed any of the indicted alleged crimes because by the relevant part of the expanded time frame, Petitioner had never been to the locations where the ""victim"" initially claimed the indicted crimes occurred. Prosecutors then changed the locations to Marion, Ohio, rather than Columbus, Ohio, to circumvent the defense. The indictment, jury instructions nor the verdict forms identify any specific factual basis for conviction. During trial prosecutors were substituting other-act evidence for the charged crimes. The Court of Appeals confirmed that Petitioner was ultimately being tried for factual bases that were not part of the indictment. As Petitioner was able to present facts to defend the accusations, prosecutors simply kept amending the indictment and bill of particulars mid-trial to circumvent the defense. After trial and even after resentencing, Petitioner does not know what alleged facts resulted in conviction for any count for which Petitioner is imprisoned, according to the jury's findings. The Court of Appeals confirmed that the crimes for which Petitioner was convicted were not the alleged crimes for which he was indicted or charged. Petitioner was acquitted on Count 11, which is an identical charge to Count 10; Count 14 was indicted as the restraint involved in Count 9. The Court of Appeals confirmed that no evidence was presented of the indicted Count 9 and Count 14 incident. The trial court permitted prosecutors to arbitrarily reassign the Count 14 kidnapping to Count 10. Petitioner was not indicted with any kidnapping related to Count 10. The indictment in Petitioner's case informed him of alleged offenses that he would not have to defend. At resentencing on March 27, 2018, the trial court sentenced Petitioner on Count 15 to a consecutive term of imprisonment while Count 15 was represented by prosecutors to the jury in closing and the instructions as being the same incident as Count 18 for which the sentence had already been fully completed. After the serial amendments, the alleged victim in Counts 9-18 was still unable to assign a date, week, month, or even year to any of her allegations. The alleged ""victim"" in Counts 9-18, who first claimed to being raped repeatedly in Columbus, Ohio, between 2002 and 2008 (3 times per week for years), then changing her story mid-trial to being raped in Marion, Ohio, in 1998, 1999, or 2000, after being confronted with her
own emails conceded she was initiating contact with Petitioner throughout the years and after moving to California in 2010, contacted Petitioner to provide him with her updated contact information.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
284-Armengau,"Yes, the text is alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is specifically stating that the prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by changing the date range and locations of the alleged crimes to circumvent the defense, and by presenting unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed evidence to intentionally circumvent the defenses to the actually indicted alleged crimes.","Context information is below.
---------------------
The alleged victim in Counts 9-18, in 2012 requested Petitioner go [to] California and offered for Petitioner to stay at her residence. Petitioner respectfully declined all of Ms. Melean's offers. On Count 8, the alleged victim was forced to change her initial story and the accusation to Marion, Ohio, rather than as indicted.

**Ground Four:** Petitioner was denied his right to due process of law and protections against double jeopardy as guaranteed under the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when the court failed to instruct the jury that the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard had to be applied to one factual incident and the jury instructions were constitutionally defective as they permitted the jury to consider and convict Petitioner of alleged crimes for which he was never charged, indicted or noticed [other-act] and where due to the defective instructions the trial court has resentenced Petitioner for alleged crimes for which no factual basis can be determined but that were clearly unindicted and in several counts for alleged crimes for which Petitioner wasn't even convicted.

**Supporting Facts:** When Petitioner established that he did not commit any of the indicted crimes, prosecutors mid-trial changed not only the date range of the indictment to circumvent the defense, but then changed the locations to completely different locations after Petitioner established that he could not have committed the indicted alleged crimes because by the newly argued time frame, Petitioner had never been to the locations where the alleged crimes were supposedly committed according to the initial accounts provided by their ""victims."" As Petitioner was able to present facts to defend the accusations, prosecutors simply kept amending the indictment and bill of particulars to circumvent the defense. After trial and even after resentencing, Petitioner does not know what alleged facts resulted in conviction for any count for which Petitioner is imprisoned. Whatever they may have been, the Court of Appeals confirmed that the crimes for which Petitioner was convicted were not the alleged crimes for which he was indicted or charged. While the trial court may have invoked jurisdiction for the specific offenses contained in the indictment for Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, none of the specific crimes in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, for which it obtained jurisdiction were ever presented to the jury. The trial court denied a requested unanimity instruction and the instructions allowed a non-unanimous verdict and a verdict upon uncharged alleged conduct.

**Ground Five:** Petitioner was denied his rights to due process of law in violation of his state and federal constitutional rights as guaranteed to him by the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when he was denied a fundamentally fair trial due
to prosecutorial misconduct and where he was tried, convicted, and resented for convictions upon the admission of other-act evidence that was unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed prior to trial and which was presented by prosecutors to intentionally circumvent the defenses to the actually indicted alleged crimes.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"Yes, the text is describing an assignment of error that alleges misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by changing the date range and locations of the indictment, inserting unindicted and uncharged allegations, and failing to provide clear information about the facts supporting the counts in the indictment.","Context information is below.
---------------------
**Supporting Facts:** When Petitioner established that he did not commit the indicted crimes, prosecutors mid-trial changed not only the date range of the indictment to circumvent the defense but then changed the locations to completely different locations after Petitioner established that he could not have committed the indicted alleged crimes because by the newly argued time frame Petitioner had never been to the locations where the alleged victims claimed initially claimed the assaults were supposedly committed. As Petitioner was able to present facts to defend the accusations, prosecutors simply kept amending the indictment and bill of particulars throughout trial. Prosecutors continuously inserted allegations that were never disclosed, never indicted, or charged and allegations they confirmed in trial they never heard of until two weeks into trial. At one point in trial prosecutors advised the court and defense counsel that Petitioner would not have to defend a certain charge and later, after failing to present evidence on what they indicted, claimed the incident they acknowledged Petitioner didn't have to defend, was in fact one of the counts for consideration. After trial and even after resentencing, Petitioner does not know what alleged set of facts resulted in conviction for any crime for which Petitioner is imprisoned. None of the jury instructions identify or are confined to one factual incident. The jury instructions are devoid of any identifying fact for the jury to determine which alleged incident pertained to any count. The Court of Appeals confirmed prosecutors were substituting unindicted and uncharged allegations for alleged crimes that were indicted. To this day, prosecutors are unable to determine the alleged incidents for which Petitioner is imprisoned. In closing argument, prosecutors told the jury that Counts 15 through 18 were ""alternate"" theories of other counts. In their sentencing memorandum prosecutors told the jury the court that they ""did not rely on a single act to support multiple convictions."". The conflicting statements confirms their inability to determine the alleged incident pertaining to any count and due to the prosecution’s need to plug-in unindicted allegations to convict Petitioner, Petitioner was denied a fair trial as guaranteed under the United States Constitution as his counsel did not know what facts supported the counts in the indictment. Counsel repeatedly moved for a mistrial and advised the trial court that he was unprepared to defend any allegation prior to 2002 for Counts 9-18.

**Ground Six:** Petitioner was denied his rights to due process of law as guaranteed to him under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when he was tried and convicted for crimes for which he was never charged or indicted or noticed and for
which the court failed to obtain subject matter jurisdiction for alleged crimes that were never presented to the grand jury and that were never presented to Petitioner in any charging document.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"Yes, the text is describing an assignment of error that alleges misconduct by the prosecutor (the state). The specific allegations against the prosecutor include:

1. **Mid-trial Insertion of New Allegations:** The prosecutor introduced new allegations of incidents that occurred at different times and places than those initially charged, which were not known to the grand jury or the petitioner until mid-trial.
2. **Amendment of Indictment:** The prosecutor amended the indictment to add three years of unindicted and uncharged conduct, which is impermissible.
3. **Conceding Lack of Knowledge:** The prosecutor conceded that the alleged crimes for which the petitioner was convicted were unknown to them until after the case was indicted.

These actions are alleged to have violated the petitioner's rights to equal protection and due process.","Context information is below.
---------------------
**Supporting Facts:** Petitioner was specifically indicted in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 for specific alleged crimes that specifically occurred in Columbus, Ohio. Petitioner was not indicted or charged with any crime occurring anywhere else. As of the start of trial Petitioner was defending allegations that occurred in Columbus, Ohio, between 2002-2008. Once Petitioner proved he did not commit any of the charged and noticed crimes, prosecutors mid-trial inserted never alleged allegations of incidents each occurring at a different time and place than those indicted. The grand jury never heard of any of the alleged incidents for which Petitioner is imprisoned and Petitioner was never charged by any instrument for the alleged crimes for which he is now imprisoned. The indictment contained and informed Petitioner of specific offenses that he would not have to defend. The Court of Appeals confirmed the indicted offenses were not the offenses for which Petitioner stood trial and was convicted. Prosecutors midtrial conceded with respect to several counts that the alleged crimes they would later argue for conviction were unknown to them until after the case was indicted.

**Ground Seven:** Petitioner was denied his right to Equal Protection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution when the Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court intentionally disregarded the law set by their respective courts and the United States Supreme Court in order to affirm the convictions and for which now after resentencing Petitioner is imprisoned for crimes for which he never committed and was never charged or noticed until midway through his trial and in several counts for which he wasn't even convicted.

**Supporting Facts:** The state failed to prove that the crimes occurred in the County and State as alleged in the indictment for Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, which is a required element to be proven for conviction under Ohio law. The state did not prove that the alleged crimes occurred ""within the time frame alleged in the indictment"" which is also a requirement under Ohio law. State statutes and case-law set the elements to be proven and then the state is required to prove each of those elements. The state also changed the dates and locations of the charges after Petitioner established that he could not have committed the crimes for which he was indicted. The trial court failed to instruct the jury that they had to agree on one specific set of alleged facts for each count, notwithstanding counsel requesting the instruction. Prosecutors amended the indictment to add three (3) years of unindicted and uncharged conduct which is impermissible. Due to the Equal Protection challenge, Petitioner must reference at least in this section that state law and federal law as applied to other defendants
under identical facts has never allowed what has been permitted to occur in Petitioner's case. The holdings and rulings in Petitioner's case are contrary to established precedent. Any court that allows a defendant to be imprisoned for alleged crimes with which he was never charged or for which he was never convicted must violate a defendant's rights to equal protection as a matter of law.

**Ground Eight:** Petitioner, an actually innocent prisoner, is imprisoned as a result of violations of state and federal law and his rights guaranteed by the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitutions.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"Yes, the text is describing an assignment of error that alleges misconduct by the prosecutor (the state). The specific allegation is that the prosecutor introduced evidence of uncharged incidents (other-act evidence) that were not part of the original indictment and used them to substitute for the unproven indicted crimes. This misconduct is alleged to have occurred in the context of Counts 2, 3, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.","Context information is below.
---------------------
**Supporting Facts:** Regarding Counts 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, Petitioner was indicted for specific and then identifiable alleged crimes that occurred in Columbus, Ohio, between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2008. For every single referenced count, the state at trial presented absolutely no evidence related to the accusations identified in the indictment. Under the facts of Petitioner's case, Petitioner believes that when evidence of a specific crime that is identified in the indictment cannot be produced at trial, the failure to present any evidence of each indicted and charged crime must represent an accused's actual innocence. With regard to Counts 2 & 3, prosecutors inserted a second alleged incident that was unrelated to any alleged conduct occurring at a different location and at a different time after they realized that their corroborating witness, Shirley Koval, decided to testify for the defense. Based on the jury instructions, it cannot be determined which set of facts the jury elected to apply to Counts 2 and 3. This is not a case where the indictment reflected typographical errors or clerical mistakes. The Court of Appeals confirmed the state was permitted to substitute other-act 404(B) evidence for the indicted crimes they couldn't prove.

**Ground Nine:** Petitioner was denied his right to a unanimous jury verdict in Counts 2, 3, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 when the trial court denied a requested jury instruction on unanimity and thereafter instructed the jury in a manner where individual jurors could select different alleged incidents for conviction that were uncharged and were admitted as other-act evidence. Unanimity independently affected Petitioner's resentencing as Petitioner has now been resentenced to prison for alleged crimes for which the jury never convicted and for which prosecutors didn't even request of the jury that it consider.

**Supporting Facts:** Prosecutors were permitted to introduce without limitation as many other-act allegations as they needed and then select what ""other-acts"" they wished to apply to any count for which they were unable to prove the factual bases for the indicted crimes. Count 9 and Count 14, for example, were indicted as one factual incident. The Court of Appeals confirmed that no evidence was presented of the entire alleged incident. With no evidence presented at all of the indicted
incident, Petitioner must be legally and factually innocent of that specific charge. Prosecutors mid-trial claimed that Count 9 was a never before mentioned ""drugging rape"". When defense counsel objected, the Court sustained the objection. At that juncture, prosecutors advised the Court that the ""drugging"" rape was not part of the indictment and was other-act evidence. Prosecutors notified the Court and defense counsel that the defense did not need to defend that charge. However, later in trial, when they were unable to procure any testimony of the underlying indicted incident for Count[s] 9 and 14, the trial court allowed prosecutors to then substitute the ""drugging"" rape incident, that prosecutors already acknowledged was not part of the indictment and Petitioner did not need to defend, for the count they couldn't prove based upon the evidence upon which Petitioner was indicted. With Count 10, the Court of Appeals confirmed that no factual incident was provided in the indictment.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it discusses issues related to the factual basis for various counts in the indictment, the lack of clarity in the trial court's resentencing, and the disagreement between the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors regarding the factual basis for certain counts. The text does not specifically accuse the prosecutor of any misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
The only facts regarding Count 10 were that the factual incident occurred in Franklin County and during 2002 and 2008. The Court of Appeals confirmed the factual basis for Count 10 changed from whatever had been indicted to an alleged incident in Marion, Ohio in either 1998, 1999, or 2000. The Court of Appeals confirmed Petitioner was not convicted of what originally supported Count 10. During resentencing on March 27, 2018, the trial court could not determine from the trial transcripts, opening, closing, jury instructions or verdict forms, which factual incidents applied to the respective counts for which Petitioner was being resentenced. The trial court actually resentenced Petitioner on Counts 15 and 18, for two incidents, when prosecutors argued to the jury in closing that Counts 15 and 18 were one incident. On Count 15 and 18, the trial court resentenced Petitioner for two incidents, supposedly occurring in Marion, Ohio, for which Petitioner was never convicted. In fact, prosecutors never requested of the jury that it consider the alleged incidents the court used to resentence Petitioner. A review of the indictment, opening statement, closing argument, jury instructions and verdict forms, the only parts of the record to which the jury had access, will confirm for this court that the factual incident(s) used by the Court to resentence Petitioner appear nowhere. Petitioner was resentenced on Count 10 for what the Court of Appeals confirmed was an uncharged factual basis. Comparing Counts 10 and 11, the jury may have acquitted Petitioner for whatever factual basis anyone believes resulted in conviction for Count 10. For Count 16, a review of the indictment, opening, closing, jury instructions and verdict forms confirms that prosecutors never even assigned an actual factual basis to that count. Perhaps confirming Petitioner's unanimity and due process argument, the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors don't agree on what facts support Count 16. The Court of Appeals believes that Count 16 was a factual incident that occurred in Franklin County while prosecutors believe Count 16 is a different incident that occurred in Marion County. Petitioner respectfully suggests that when the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors who are the ones who indicted
and tried the case can't agree on what factual basis supports any count, there is clearly a due process, sufficiency, notice, double jeopardy, fair trial, and unanimity problem. A review of the same documents will further confirm that for Count 17, whatever the jury elected to apply to that count cannot be determined with any degree of certainty. The lack of unanimity impacted Petitioner's resentencing, notwithstanding any effort by the state courts to find that the jury's verdicts were unanimous. With Counts 8 through 18, Petitioner was indicted only with alleged crimes that occurred in Franklin County, Ohio, between 2002 and 2008. After what Court of Appeals coined ""Serial Amendments"", prosecutors then sought conviction for alleged ""other-acts"" that occurred in Marion County, Ohio, between 1998 and 2001. Defense counsel repeatedly sought a mistrial as he acknowledged being unprepared to defend any allegation prior to 2002 in Marion, Ohio. Petitioner had witnesses under subpoena for the locations and time frames identified in the indictment. Then Court of Appeals Judge Gary Tyack [footnote omitted] during oral arguments stated:

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"Yes, the text is describing an assignment of error, and the error is alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Specifically, the allegation is that the prosecutor introduced four (4) years of additional allegations mid-trial, which prevented the defendant from adequately preparing an alibi defense and contradicting the prosecution's evidence.","Context information is below.
---------------------
""So, that's part of what ties in here. Counsel has to prepare for a major trial based on what's in the indictment and bills of particulars. And, in this particular situation, all of a sudden you're mid-trial and the prosecution is throwing four (4) years of additional allegations in front of the jury and then arguing that the mere number of allegations is why this guy should be guilty of something . . . part of what you run into is you have no chance to create, to even investigate an alibi defense . . . for times that aren't alleged in the whole thing, you don't have a chance to tie down and bring in other witnesses . . . to contradict these folks. You just all of a sudden, you're in the middle of trial and the name of the game has changed . . . "". (Oral Arguments, August 23, 2016, 14 AP 679).

**Ground Ten:** Petitioner was denied his right to trial by jury guaranteed under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution whereby facts forming the basis for conviction [footnote omitted] and sentence must be conclusively determined by a trial jury and where in Petitioner's case those facts were determined by trial and appellate judges.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it describes the actions of the prosecutor in introducing evidence and arguing the case, which the petitioner argues were improper or misleading. The main focus of the text is on the trial court's inability to determine the factual incidents for resentencing and the prosecutor's actions in introducing and arguing ""other-act"" evidence.","Context information is below.
---------------------
**Supporting Facts:** Prior to Petitioner's resentencing on March 27, 2018, Petitioner filed a motion with the trial court in advance of the proceedings requesting of the court that it confirm the factual incidents pertaining to the counts for which Petitioner was to be resentenced (10, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18). The Court denied the motion. Since resentencing was to address allied offenses, Mr. Benton made the same request prior to the start of the hearing since in order to argue allied offenses the defense needed to know what facts the trial court was considering for each count. The court again denied the request. The court then resentenced Petitioner to
prison for counts where the court could not determine the facts decided by the jury. Ultimately, the court sentenced Petitioner to prison for alleged crimes that were never even presented to the jury for conviction. Prosecutors were permitted to introduce without limitation as many other-act allegations as they needed and then select what ""other-acts"" they wished to apply to any count for which they were unable to prove the factual bases for the indicted crimes. Count 9 and Count 14, for example, were indicted as one factual incident. The Court of Appeals confirmed that no evidence was presented of the entire alleged incident. Prosecutors mid-trial claimed that Count 9 was a never before mentioned ""drugging rape"". However, earlier in trial, when defense counsel objected to that evidence, the Court sustained the objection.

Prosecutors notified the Court and defense counsel that the defense did not need to defend that charge. Later in trial, when they were unable to procure any testimony of the underlying indicted incident for Count 9 and 14, the trial court allowed prosecutors to then substitute the ""drugging"" rape incident, that prosecutors already acknowledged was not part of the indictment for what they couldn't prove. With Count 10, the Court of Appeals confirmed that no factual incident was provided in the indictment. The only facts regarding Count 10 were that the factual incident occurred in Franklin County and during 2002 and 2008.

In fact, the record confirms that prosecutors never requested of the jury that it consider the alleged incidents the court used to resentence Petitioner. A review of the indictment, opening statement, closing argument, jury instructions and verdict forms, the only parts of the record to which the jury had access, will confirm for this court that the factual incident(s) used by the Court to resentence Petitioner appear nowhere. Petitioner was resentenced on Count 10 for what the Court of Appeals confirmed was an uncharged factual basis.

Comparing Counts 10 and 11, the jury may have acquitted Petitioner for whatever factual basis anyone believes resulted in conviction for Count 10. For Count 16, a review of the indictment, opening, closing, jury instructions, and verdict forms confirms that

Perhaps confirming Petitioner's unanimity, *Apprendi* and due process argument, the Court of Appeals and the prosecutors don't agree on what facts support Count 16.

Second Amended Petition, ECF No. 70, PageID 7639-62.

**The Warden’s Return**

**Non-Cognizable Claims**

**Venue**

The Warden asserts that, to the extent Petitioner is complaining of the venue of trial (Franklin County), his claim is not cognizable under the United States Constitution (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13877-80). In this same section, the Warden argues “Armengau had no federal constitutional right to prove [sic] ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ that the crimes for which he was convicted were committed in Franklin County, Ohio.” *Id.* at PageID 13879.

**Other Acts Evidence**

To the extent Petitioner claims “other acts” evidence was improperly admitted against him,
the Warden asserts this claim is also not cognizable. *Id.* at PageID 13880-81.

**Improper Indictment**

Answer:"
284-Armengau,No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The allegation is that the trial court committed error in instructing the jury.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
The Warden notes Petitioner’s claim in Grounds Two and Six that the indictment in this case “failed to inform him of the nature of the charges, and the trial court failed to obtain subject matter jurisdiction for crimes were never presented to the grand jury or in any charging instrument.” (ECF No. 73, PageID 13881, quoting Second Amended Petition, ECF No. 70, PageID 8641-42 and 7651-52). Noting that the Fifth Amendment’s grand jury guarantee does not apply to the States, the Warden asserts this claim is non-cognizable. (ECF No. 73, PageID 13881, citing *Hurtado v. California*, 110 U.S. 516, 537-538 (1884); and *Branzburg v. Hayes*, 408 U.S. 665 (1972)).

**Lack of Specificity in the Indictment**

The Warden asserts Petitioner’s claim of lack of specificity in the indictment is also not cognizable (ECF No. 73, PageID 13883-87).

**Jury Instruction Error**

The Warden notes Petitioner claims in his Fourth Ground for Relief that the trial court committed error in instructing the jury and asserts jury instruction error is not ordinarily cognizable in habeas (ECF No. 73, PageID 13887-89).

**State Law Claims**

The Warden notes “In his seventh ground for relief, Armengau alleges an equal protection violation when the Ohio courts “intentionally disregarded the law set by their respective Courts.”
(ECF No. 73, PageID 13889, quoting Second Amended Petition, ECF No. Doc. No. 70, PageID 7653-54). The Warden argues this claim is also not cognizable in habeas. *Id.* at PageID 13889-90.

**Actual Innocence**

The Warden asserts Petitioner’s actual innocence claim in Ground for Relief Eight is not cognizable in habeas. *Id.* at PageID 13890-91.

**Affirmative Defenses**

**Procedural Default**

The Warden asserts Armengau has procedurally defaulted claims in Ground One related to Counts 2 and 16 because they were not fairly presented to the state courts as federal constitutional claims (ECF No. 73, PageID 13896). He makes the same assertion as to Ground Two respecting Counts 2, 3, and 8. Regarding “other acts” evidence, the Warden asserts that claim was presented to the state courts as a trial court error, but is presented here as a prosecutorial misconduct claim. *Id.*

The Warden further asserts Armengau’s jury instructions claim in Ground Four is procedurally defaulted for failure to make a contemporaneous objection. *Id.* at PageID 13898-902.

Petitioner asserts he raised Grounds One through Seven and Ground Nine in his postconviction motion for dismissal. The Tenth District held these claims were barred, at least in part, by Ohio’s doctrine of *res judicata* in criminal cases. The Warden asserts this procedural default as a bar (ECF No. 73, PageID 13902-04).

284-Armengau,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The allegations are against the trial court and the defense attorney.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
As to Ground Nine on jury unanimity, the Warden asserts it is procedurally defaulted by Armengau’s failure to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio from denial of the claim by the Tenth
District (ECF No. 73, PageID 13904-05).

Respondent reads Ground Ten as alleging “that the facts purporting to form the factual basis for his conviction and sentence were determined by judicial fact-finding and not by the jury.” (ECF No. 73, PageID 13906, citing ECF No. 70, PageID 7661-62). Respondent asserts this claim is also barred by res judicata. Id.

The Warden also responds on the merits to Petitioner’s first, seventh, ninth, and tenth grounds for relief (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13907-21).

**Petitioner’s Reply**

**Fair Presentation**

Petitioner first argues that he has fairly presented all his claims to the Ohio courts (ECF No. 77, PageID 13929-32). As relevant precedent for what constitutes “fair presentation,” he relies repeatedly on *Gartrell v. Lynaugh*, 833 F. 2d 527 (5th Cir. 1987). There is, however, published precedent from the Sixth Circuit which is thirty years newer than *Gartrell* and holds a claim is fairly presented if the petitioner

(1) relied upon federal cases employing constitutional analysis; (2) relied upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis; (3) phrased the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional right; or (4) alleged facts well within the mainstream of constitutional law.

*Hand v. Houk*, 871 F.3d 390, 418 (6th Cir. 2017).

Petitioner complains that the record is incomplete:

---

4 Petitioner timely filed his Reply on July 27, 2021 (ECF No. 77). Because of its extraordinary length (226 pages), the Court granted Petitioner leave to file a summary which he did on August 2, 2021 (ECF No. 81). These two documents will be read together as Petitioner’s Reply.
the docket (PageID 6914-6921) establishes that Petitioner filed multiple Notices of Supplemental Authority and Motions for Leave to File Supplemental Authority, all which were granted. From what Petitioner has received, none of those documents are in the record filed with this Court.

(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13928, n. 2). Magistrate Judge Deavers’ Order for Answer required the Warden to file an answer conforming to the requirements of Rule 5 of the Rules Governing § 2254 Cases (ECF No. 8, PageID 239). Rule 5 does not require the Respondent to file in the habeas court a copy of everything filed in the state courts. To the extent that something is omitted which a petitioner believes is necessary for decision of the case, a petitioner may move to expand the record under Habeas Rule 7.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is related to the Petitioner's failure to provide record references for his assertions in the Statement of Facts, which violates the Magistrate Judge's order.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Petitioner complains that “several documents from the record appear not to have been filed or provided to Petitioner pursuant to this Court's May 27th and/or 28th, 2021 Order (Doc. 61, 62).” Actually ECF No. 61 strikes the appearance of attorney John Gonzalez who purported to be appearing in a capacity not permitted by this Court’s Local Rules. Petitioner cites a number of additional documents he says he has not received (ECF No. 77, PageID 13929), but the record had not been ordered expanded to include those documents as of the time the Reply was filed. Regarding these documents, the Magistrate Judge has ordered either that the record be expanded to include them or that Respondent provides reference to where they appear (ECF No. 86) and the Warden has responded as ordered (ECF No. 92).

**Petitioner’s Statement of Facts**

The Reply next contains a Statement of Facts, which appears to be an argumentative summary of the evidence from Petitioner’s perspective (ECF No. 77, PageID 13932-46). With
respect to findings of fact, this habeas Court is bound by state court findings, including those made by the Tenth District Court of Appeals, unless Petitioner shows those findings to be in error by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e). That showing must be made from evidence already of record in the state court proceedings. Pinholster, supra. That is to say, this habeas court cannot make a de novo determination of the facts.

Repeatedly in his Statement of Facts, Petitioner makes assertions of fact with no record reference. This violates Magistrate Judge Deavers’ Order for Answer which requires “All papers filed in the case thereafter [after filing of the State Court Record] by each party shall include record references to the PAGEID number.” (ECF No. 8, PageID 240). At PageID 13935-36, Petitioner purports to repeat comments made to the media by a Major Randy Caryer of the Marion Police. At PageID 13937, n.8, he purports to present facts that occurred September 17, 2008, in a court in Marion, Ohio, involving accuser K.R. At PageID 13938, n. 11, he asserts that “[d]uring multiple pretrial hearings prosecutors repeatedly affirmed that all the alleged incidents with regards to these counts occurred in Petitioner's Columbus Office.” On the same page he asserts that accuser L.M.’s account of her referral to him is incorrect. At PageID 13939, he asserts accuser L.M. “was charged criminally for beating her young daughter in 2003 (Trial Exhibit H-5, Case No. 2003 CRB 8472, Domestic Violence Case Number).” Whether this is a reference to a trial exhibit in this case or in the domestic violence case, the exhibit is not in the record. Petitioner also relies on an affidavit by a Diane Caldwell attached to his Petition (ECF No. 1, Ex. D. This Affidavit was not part of the State Court Record and this Court is therefore barred from considering it by Pinholster.
Non-Cognizable Claims

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is directed at the state court's decision on the sufficiency of the evidence claim, which was treated as a venue issue, and the magistrate judge's decision regarding the exhibits.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Petitioner asserts that he submitted his sufficiency of the evidence claim on direct appeal and the Tenth District elected instead to decide that claim as if it were about venue. Petitioner argues his case “represents an unreasonable application of federal and state law and an unreasonable determination of facts based on the record. 28 U.S.C. §2254 (d)(1) and (d)(2)” (ECF No. 77, PageID 13949). That is not the correct standard. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), the state courts’ decisions on claims of federal constitutional violations are entitled to deference unless they are contrary to or objectively unreasonable applications of United States Supreme Court precedent. On the other hand, we do not sit as an appellate court to decide whether any state court committed an error of state law. Instead, we are bound by state court determinations of state law. Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U.S. 74 (2005).

Petitioner then, under this heading of Non-Cognizable Claims argues the merits of his Grounds for Relief for 159 pages as follows: Ground One at PageID 13948-14005; Ground Two at PageID 14005-36; Grounds Three and Six, argued together at PageID 14036-81; Ground Four at PageID 14081-86; Ground Seven at PageID 14087-91; Ground Eight at PageID 14091-95; Ground Nine at PageID 14095-104; and Ground Ten at PageID 14105-07.

5 Throughout these 50+ pages, Petitioner repeatedly cites to the exhibits attached to ECF No. 54. The Magistrate Judge has twice held these exhibits cannot be added to the record (ECF Nos. 64 and 71, based on Pinholster, supra.) Petitioner has objected to both of those decisions. S. D. Ohio Civ. R. 72.3 provides “When an objection is filed to a Magistrate Judge’s ruling on a non-case dispositive motion, the ruling remains in full force and effect unless and until it is (1) stayed by the Magistrate Judge or a District Judge, or (2) overruled by a District Judge.” Since the Magistrate Judge’s Pinholster ruling remains in effect, the exhibits will not be considered in rendering this Report.
Exhaustion, Procedural Default, and Waiver

Petitioner argues that he has exhausted all available state court remedies and that he has neither procedurally defaulted nor waived any of his claims (ECF No. 77, PageID 14107-33).

Resentencing

Petitioner contends that “whatever may have been used to determine the facts for the counts upon which Petitioner was resentenced, was obtained from uncharged other-acts” (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14133).

It appears that the trial court at resentencing considered facts for each count that were different from the facts considered by the Court at the time of sentencing and which were different than the facts considered by the jury for conviction. A court is without jurisdiction to impose a sentence for an offense not charged in the indictment. United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625 [(2002)].

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The text states that the petitioner asserts claims of ""Fair Trial, Prosecutorial Misconduct, or constructive amendment of the charging document,"" but it does not specify that the prosecutor is the one who committed misconduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
At resentencing on March 27, 2018, the defense requested the Court provide the parties with the underlying factual basis for each count for which Appellant was convicted so that the defense could properly argue the respective sentencing issues (Doc. 28-3, PageID 6541, Tp. 15). The trial court refused the request and failed to provide the facts underlying each count.

Id. at PageID 14142.

Claims and Issues Assertedly Not Challenged or Addressed by Respondent

Petitioner asserts there are some claims he has made which Respondent has not addressed. “Aside from some general reference Respondent does not appear to provide any specific analysis
to Petitioner's claims of Fair Trial, Prosecutorial Misconduct, or constructive amendment of the charging document.” (ECF No. 77, PageID 14147).

**Analysis**

The following table sets forth the relationships, as the Magistrate Judge understands them, between accusers, counts of the Indictment and the verdicts.

| Accuser | Counts Charged | Verdict |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| CC      | 1, 2, 3        | Guilty on Count 2 – sentenced to time served Acquitted on Counts 1 & 3 |
| LG      | 4, 5           | Acquitted |
| AC      | 6, 7           | Acquitted |
| KR      | 8              | convicted |
| LM      | 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 | Guilty on 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 & 18 (5 & 10 merged) ¶ 48 Acquitted on 9, 11, 12, 13 |

**Ground One: Conviction on Insufficient Evidence**

In his First Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he was convicted on insufficient evidence on Counts 2, 3, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. As noted above, because Petitioner’s custody on Count 2 ended before he filed his Petition, any claims regarding that count are no longer cognizable in habeas corpus and Count Two will not be considered further. *Maleng v. Cook*, 490 U.S. 488 (1989).

An allegation that a verdict was entered upon insufficient evidence states a claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307 (1979); *In re Winship*, 397 U.S. 358 (1970); *Johnson v. Coyle*, 200 F.3d
987, 991 (6th Cir. 2000); Bagby v. Sowders, 894 F.2d 792, 794 (6th Cir. 1990)(en banc). In order for a conviction to be constitutionally sound, every element of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship, 397 U.S. at 364.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text above is not describing an assignment of error alleging misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it discusses the standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case, particularly in the context of habeas corpus petitions under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The text outlines the legal principles and deference required when reviewing the evidence presented at trial and the decisions made by the state courts. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor in the provided text.","Context information is below.
---------------------
[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt . . . . This familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.

Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. at 319; Smith v. Nagy, 962 F.3d 192, 205 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Jackson). This standard “must be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.” Id. (quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 324). This rule was recognized in Ohio law at State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St. 3d 259 (1991). Of course, it is state law which determines the elements of offenses; but once the state has adopted the elements, it must then prove each of them beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship, supra.

In cases such as Petitioner’s challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and filed after enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214)(the “AEDPA”), two levels of deference to state decisions are required:

In an appeal from a denial of habeas relief, in which a petitioner challenges the constitutional sufficiency of the evidence used to convict him, we are thus bound by two layers of deference to groups who might view facts differently than we would. First, as in all sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges, we must determine whether, viewing the trial testimony and exhibits in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979). In doing so, we do not reweigh the evidence, re-evaluate the credibility of witnesses, or substitute our judgment for that of the jury. See United States v. Hilliard, 11 F.3d 618, 620 (6th Cir. 1993). Thus, even though we might have not voted to convict a defendant had we participated in jury deliberations, we must uphold
the jury verdict if any rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty after resolving all disputes in favor of the prosecution. Second, even were we to conclude that a rational trier of fact could not have found a petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, on habeas review, we must still defer to the state appellate court's sufficiency determination as long as it is not unreasonable. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2).

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text above is not describing an assignment of error alleging misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it discusses the legal standards and deference given to the trier-of-fact's verdict in sufficiency of the evidence habeas corpus cases, as well as the role of the federal courts in reviewing such cases. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor in the provided text.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Brown v. Konteh, 567 F.3d 191, 205 (6th Cir. 2009). In a sufficiency of the evidence habeas corpus case, deference should be given to the trier-of-fact's verdict under Jackson v. Virginia and then to the appellate court's consideration of that verdict, as commanded by AEDPA. Tucker v. Palmer, 541 F.3d 652 (6th Cir. 2008); accord Davis v. Lafler, 658 F.3d 525, 531 (6th Cir. 2011)(en banc); Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. 37, 43 (2012).

We have made clear that Jackson claims face a high bar in federal habeas proceedings because they are subject to two layers of judicial deference. First, on direct appeal, ""it is the responsibility of the jury -- not the court -- to decide what conclusions should be drawn from evidence admitted at trial. A reviewing court may set aside the jury's verdict on the ground of insufficient evidence only if no rational trier of fact could have agreed with the jury."" Cavazos v. Smith, 565 U. S. 1, ___, 132 S. Ct. 2, 181 L. Ed. 2d 311, 313 (2011) (per curiam). And second, on habeas review, ""a federal court may not overturn a state court decision rejecting a sufficiency of the evidence challenge simply because the federal court disagrees with the state court. The federal court instead may do so only if the state court decision was 'objectively unreasonable.'"" Ibid. (quoting Renico v. Lett, 559 U. S. ___, ___, 130 S. Ct. 1855, 176 L. Ed. 2d 678 (2010)).

Coleman v. Johnson, 566 U.S. 650, 651, (2012)(per curiam); Parker v. Matthews, 567 U.S. 37, 43 (2012) (per curiam). The federal courts do not make credibility determinations in reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims. Brooks v. Tennessee, 626 F.3d 878, 887 (6th Cir. 2010). Thompson v. Skipper, 981 F.3d 476 (6th Cir., 2020). “To evaluate a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim, we consider ‘whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.’ Smith v. Nagy, 962 F.3d 192, 205 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Jackson v. Virginia,
443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979)). This standard “must be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.” Id. (quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 324).”

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is being raised against the state court's decision, specifically the Tenth District Court of Appeals, for allegedly ignoring the sufficiency issue raised by the petitioner regarding the location of the offenses.","Context information is below.
---------------------
The state court’s application “must be ‘objectively unreasonable,’ not merely wrong; even ‘clear error’ will not suffice.” Nagy, 962 F.3d at 199 (quoting White v. Woodall, 572 U.S. 415, 419 (2014)). In other words, “relief is available under § 2254(d)(1)’s unreasonable-application clause if, and only if, it is so obvious that a clearly established rule applies to a given set of facts that there could be no ‘fairminded disagreement’ on the question.” Woodall, 572 U.S. at 427 (quoting Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 103 (2011)).

Together, Jackson and AEDPA’s two layers of deference dictate that “a federal court’s ‘review of a state-court conviction for sufficiency of the evidence is very limited.’” Tackett v. Trierweiler, 956 F.3d 358, 367 (6th Cir. 2020) (quoting Thomas v. Stephenson, 898 F.3d 693, 698 (6th Cir. 2018)).

A habeas court cannot consider post-trial evidence in deciding a Jackson v. Virginia claim. McDaniel v. Brown, 558 U.S. 120 (2010).

In order to demonstrate that the state court's decision was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts under § 2254(d)(2), a petitioner must both establish the ""unreasonable determination"" and show ""that the resulting state court decision was 'based on' that unreasonable determination.""

Titlow v. Burt, 680 F.3d 577, 585 (6th Cir. 2012)(rev’d on another issue Burt v. Titlow, 571 U.S. 12, 20 (2013). quoting Rice v. White, 660 F.3d 242, 250 (6th Cir. 2011).

Petitioner does not state in the Second Amended Petition itself what elements of the convicted crimes were not supported by sufficient evidence. However, in his Reply he claims the State failed to prove that the location of the offenses with which he was charged was in Franklin
County, Ohio, as alleged in the Indictment (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13949). He asserts the Tenth District Court of Appeals, in order “to avoid reversing the convictions, . . . simply ignored the sufficiency issue raised by Petitioner.” Further, he claims, the “location of the crime charged is a material ""fact"" that the state is required to prove.” *Id.* citing *Knight v. State*, 54 Ohio State 365 (1896) [the location of the crime is an essential fact and essential element that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt because it is the place of the commission of the offense charged].

Petitioner correctly notes that it is state law which determines the elements of a crime which must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to satisfy the *Jackson* standard (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13950, citing *In re Winship*, 397 U.S. 358 (1970)).

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text describes an assignment of error alleging that the trial court erred in denying the defendant's Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, and that the state (prosecutor) failed to present evidence to support venue for the crimes as charged in the indictment. The allegation is against the state, not the trial court or defense attorney.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Petitioner asserts he presented this location-of-the-crime claim to the Tenth District on direct appeal, but that court decided a different claim, a location-of-the-trial claim (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13950-52).

On appeal Armengau presented the relevant sufficiency of the evidence claim as Assignment of Error VI:

[VI.] The trial court erred in denying Javier Armengau's Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal, and violated his rights to due process and a fair trial when, in the absence of sufficient evidence, it convicted him of counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18.

*Armengau I* at ¶ 53, quoting Armengau’s appellate brief (State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 8).

The Brief sets forth the following Issue Presented for Review as to this Assignment of Error: “Is a conviction based upon insufficient evidence when venue is not proved beyond a reasonable doubt as charged in the indictment?” *Id.* at PageID 7730. Thus Petitioner himself (through counsel) characterized the issue presented as one of “venue.”

In arguing Assignment of Error VI, Petitioner made it clear that his objection was that the State had presented no evidence that the offenses alleged in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18
were committed in Franklin County as alleged in the indictment. *Id.* at PageID 7857. That was because, he claimed, ""'Venue'"" has two applications-locale and element. Locale venue is governed by R.C. 2901.12. But that statute has no impact on element venue. Element venue is controlled by the indictment and the evidence,"" *Id.* at PageID 7859, relying on *State v. Hampton*, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, ¶¶ 23-24 (2012).

The Tenth District decided Assignment of Error VI as follows:

**Venue**

¶ 104 Appellant's sixth assignment of error asserts that appellant's convictions under Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the indictment must be reversed because the state failed to present evidence to support venue for those crimes as charged in the indictment, and the trial court accordingly erred in denying appellant's Crim.R. 29 motion made after the state rested. We disagree.

¶ 105 Under Crim.R. 29(A), a court “shall order the entry of a judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses * * * if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.” Because a Crim.R. 29 motion questions the sufficiency of the evidence, “[w]e apply the same standard of review to Crim.R. 29 motions as we use in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence.” *State v.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
284-Armengau,No. The text above is not describing an assignment of error. It is providing context and legal principles regarding venue in criminal prosecutions. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor (the state) in the provided text.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 106} Venue commonly refers to the appropriate place of trial for a criminal prosecution within a state. “[J]urisdiction and venue are not the same, as the former denotes the power of the court to hear the case and the latter denotes the situs of trial.” State v. Giffin, 62 Ohio App.3d 396, 403, 575 N.E.2d 887 (10th Dist. 1991), citing State v. Loucks, 28 Ohio App.2d 77, 274 N.E.2d 773 (4th Dist. 1971). Proper venue insures that “the state [does not] indiscriminately [seek] a favorable location for trial or [select] a site that might be an inconvenience or disadvantage to the defendant.” State v. Meridy, 12th Dist. No. CA2003-11-091, 2005-Ohio-241, 2005 WL 123993, ¶ 12, quoting State v. Gentry, 61 Ohio Misc.2d 31, 34, 573 N.E.2d 220 (1990). The fact that venue is not a restriction on territorial jurisdiction is underscored by the provisions of Crim. R. 18(B) and R.C. 2901.12(K), which provide for a change of venue if the trial court finds that a fair and impartial jury cannot be seated in the court where the action is pending.

{¶ 107} Because venue is neither a jurisdictional nor a material element of a criminal offense, the indictment is only required to contain an allegation that the offense was committed within the jurisdiction of the court. State v. Andrews, 148 Ohio App.3d 92, 772 N.E.2d 167 (10th Dist. 2002). Even when multiple offenses are alleged in an indictment, an indictment is not rendered invalid where the “place has been stated once therein.” State v. Williams, 53 Ohio App.3d 1, 557 N.E.2d 818 (10th Dist. 1988). While venue is not a material element of the offense as charged, it is a fact that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt unless waived by a criminal defendant. State v. Hampton, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, 2012-Ohio-5688, 983 N.E.2d 324, ¶ 22; State v. Birt, 2013-Ohio-1379, 5 N.E.3d 1000, ¶ 27. “Venue need not be proven in express terms; it may be established either directly or indirectly by all the facts and circumstances of the case.” State v. Jackson, 141 Ohio St.3d 171, 2014-Ohio-3707, 23 N.E.3d 1023, ¶ 144.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text describes an assignment of error alleging that the state (prosecutor) failed to prove venue for several counts of the indictment, as it introduced no evidence that the crimes occurred in Franklin County. The error is not against the trial court or the defense attorney.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 108} The indictment in the present case alleged for each count that the criminal conduct occurred “within the county of Franklin.” (May 20, 2013 Indictment, Counts 1 through 18.) Appellant argues that for all but three of the counts for which he was convicted, the state failed to prove venue because it introduced no evidence at all that the crimes occurred in Franklin County: for Counts 8 (gross sexual imposition, K.R.), 10 (rape, L.M.), 14 (kidnapping, L.M.),
and 15, 17, and 18 (sexual battery, L.M.), the only evidence heard placed the offenses in Marion County. In contrast, for Counts 2 and 3 (public indecency and gross sexual imposition, C.C.), and Count 16 (sexual battery, L.M.), appellant concedes on appeal that the evidence supported venue in Franklin County. At the close of the state's case, the defense moved, unsuccessfully, for a Crim.R. 29 acquittal for those incidents for which the evidence established the location as Marion County. Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his Crim.R. 29 motion.

¶ 109 The state responds that any deficiency in the indictment was cured by subsequent amendment of either the indictment or the bill of particulars. We disagree. It is the language of the indictment that defines the venue for which the state bears the burden of proof. Hampton, supra, at ¶ 23. As stated above, the original indictment specified Franklin County as venue for all crimes. The state never amended the venue allegation in the indictment. Therefore, the state had to prove that venue was proper in Franklin County.

¶ 110 The state also argues that all crimes took place as part of a course of criminal conduct across several jurisdictions, including Franklin County, establishing venue in Franklin County under the course of criminal conduct terms of R.C. 2901.12(H). We conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence to prove venue under the course of criminal conduct provisions in R.C. 2901.12(H).

2. Venue and Course of Criminal Conduct–R.C. 2901.12(H)

¶ 111 When an offender, as part of a course of criminal conduct, commits offenses in different jurisdictions, the offender may be tried for all of those offenses in any jurisdiction in which one of those offenses or any element of one of those offenses occurred. R.C. 2901.12(H). To establish a course of criminal conduct, the statute provides in relevant part:

(H) * * * Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the course of criminal conduct, any of the following is prima-facie evidence of a course of criminal conduct:
(1) The offenses involved the same victim, or victims of the same type or from the same group.
(2) The offenses were committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, or capacity, or relationship to another.
(3) The offenses were committed as part of the same transaction or chain of events, or in furtherance of the same purpose or objective.
(4) The offenses were committed in furtherance of the same conspiracy.
(5) The offenses involved the same or a similar modus operandi.
(6) The offenses were committed along the offender's line of travel in this state, regardless of the offender's point of origin or destination.

R.C. 2901.12(H).

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it discusses the legal basis for the grand jury's authority to indict offenses that occurred in other counties as part of a course of criminal conduct. The focus is on the interpretation of Ohio's statutes and the Supreme Court's decision in Jackson, not on any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 112 “R.C. 2901.12(G) and (H) are statutory reflections of the modern mobility of criminals to perform unlawful deeds over vast geographical boundaries.” State v. Draggo, 65 Ohio St.2d 88, 90, 418 N.E.2d 1343 (1981). Consistent with this multi-county venue, “a grand jury of one county has authority to indict on offenses occurring in other counties provided that those offenses are part of a course of criminal conduct.” State v. Ahmed, 8th Dist. No. 84220, 2005-Ohio-2999, 2005 WL 1406282, ¶ 11. The Supreme Court of Ohio confirmed the law as stated in Ahmed when it decided Jackson at ¶ 131:

There is no constitutional or statutory provision that prohibited the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury from indicting Jackson for offenses that occurred in Erie and Lorain Counties as part of a course of criminal conduct that included crimes within Cuyahoga County. R.C. 2901.11 and 2901.12 permit a grand jury to indict an offender for offenses that occurred outside the county, provided that the offenses are part of the same course of criminal conduct that took place in the county in which the grand jury resides.

¶ 113 The present case involves a series of offenses that fit four of the criteria enumerated in R.C. 2901.12(H). The victims were “of the same type, or from the same group” under R.C. 2901.12(H)(1), because they are associated with appellant's law practice as clients, relatives of clients, or employees. The offenses were committed “in the offender's same employment, or capacity, or relationship to another” under R.C. 2901.12(H)(2), again based on the centrality of appellant's law practice in his selection of victims. The offenses involved “the same or similar modus operandi” under R.C. 2901.12(H)(5), based on the grooming and exploitation of vulnerable female clients or relatives of clients. Finally, the offenses
were committed in furtherance of the same purpose or objective (sexual gratification). R.C. 2901.12(H)(3).

¶ 114 A similar case involving abuse of clients in a professional practice is persuasively on point. In Ahmed, the defendant, a licensed obstetrician and gynecologist, operated medical offices in several counties. The grand jury in Cuyahoga County returned an indictment charging him with multiple counts of rape, sexual imposition, and sexual battery involving 37 former patients. The indictment specified that the offenses occurred at Ahmed's offices in Cuyahoga, Summit, and Geauga counties. After disposing of the preliminary question of whether the grand jury could return an indictment addressing the out-of-county crimes, the Eighth District Court of Appeals found that trial venue in Cuyahoga County for all offenses was appropriate: “The evidence at trial revealed that all of the victims were Ahmed's patients, all of the offenses occurred at his medical offices while the victims were seeking medical care from him, and while situated in a vulnerable position. Further, each victim identified the office location where the offense(s) occurred. Based on this evidence, we find that the State adequately proved that venue was proper.” Ahmed at ¶ 18.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The error is not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is alleging that the court's decision in Hampton does not allow a defendant to be convicted of a crime when the indictment asserts the criminal conduct occurred in a specific county, and does not reference R.C. 2901.12, and all evidence presented demonstrates that the crime occurred in a different county than that named in the indictment.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 115 Ahmed presented the same type of course of criminal conduct that the state alleges here. Based on this precedent and analysis of the applicable statutes governing venue, we conclude that the state proved venue was proper in Franklin County for Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the indictment.

¶ 116 Citing Hampton, appellant argues that because the indictment alleged the conduct associated with Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 occurred in Franklin County, the state could only establish venue by proving that the alleged conduct occurred in Franklin County. We do not read Hampton so restrictively. Hampton involved a situation where all of the alleged criminal conduct occurred outside the county where the case was venued. Therefore, R.C. 2901.12(H) was not applicable. Moreover, the Hampton court noted that “[t]he General Assembly has given the state considerable flexibility with respect to establishing venue,” citing R.C. 2901.12(G) as an example. Hampton at ¶ 23. See also State v. Young, 2017-Ohio-1400, 89 N.E.3d 175, ¶ 15–16 (finding no authority for proposition that an indictment must include “course of conduct” language when the state intends to proceed under R.C. 2901.12(H)). Lastly, appellant was on notice that the state would establish venue by proving the conduct occurred in Franklin County “or otherwise properly venued under R.C. 2901.12, the defendant, as part of a criminal course of conduct as defined in R.C.
2901.12(H)(1), which encompassed at least, Franklin and Marion Counties, Ohio.” (June 1, 2014 Bill of Particulars at 6.) As previously noted, the indictment alleged and the state proved, that some of the alleged criminal conduct occurred in Franklin County and that the other offenses in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 were committed pursuant to a course of criminal conduct as defined in R.C. 2901.12(H).

3. Conclusion

¶ 117 For all of these reasons, we overrule appellant's sixth assignment of error.

Armengau I, supra.

Armengau appealed to the Supreme Court of Ohio from this decision, represented by the same Assistant State Public Defender who had represented him before the Tenth District. He pleaded two relevant Propositions of Law:

First Proposition of Law: This Court's decision in Hampton does not allow a defendant to be convicted of a crime when the indictment asserts the criminal conduct occurred in a specific county, and does not reference R.C. 2901.12, and all evidence presented demonstrates that the crime occurred in a different county than that named in the indictment. RC. 2901.12; State v. Hampton, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, 2012-Ohio-5688, 983 N.E.2d 324.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the interpretation of a statute (R.C. 2901.12(H)) and its constitutionality, specifically arguing that it violates Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution. The focus is on the legal interpretation and the jurisdiction of the court, not on any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Second Proposition of Law: Revised Code 2901.12(1-1) is unconstitutional and violates Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution which requires that a criminal act be tried in the county in which it occurred. R.C. 2901.12(H); Article I, Section 10, Ohio Constitution.

(Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 13, PageID 8041).

Armengau admitted that the Ohio “intermediate appellate courts remain vexed by the import of Hampton and the precise requirements and legal effects set forth therein” and that the Tenth District had held Armengau’s argument was “too restrictive a reading of Hampton.” Id. at PageID 8046. He asked the Supreme Court of Ohio “accept this issue to determine whether an indictment that unequivocally represents a crime occurred in one county can be cured by R.C.2901.12.” As
an alternative he asked the court to declare Ohio Revised Code § 2901.12(H) as interpreted by the Tenth District to be a violation of the Ohio Constitution. *Id.* at PageID 8047-48. The Ohio Supreme Court denied review in a form entry, *State v. Armengau*, 151 Ohio St. 3d 1511 (2018). (State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 14).

Petitioner presented this issue again to a different panel of the Tenth District on appeal from denial of his Presentence Motion for Acquittal on Resentencing. The Tenth District again denied relief based on *res judicata*, law of the case, and the failure of Armengau to persuade the appellate court that its prior decision on “venue” was in error. It noted that:

{¶ 16} These are issues appellant could have raised in a motion to reconsider in *Armengau*, 2017-Ohio-4452. Appellant did not file a motion to reconsider this court's decision in *Armengau*, 2017-Ohio-4452.

{¶ 17} Appellant did, however, file an appeal with the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court did not accept his appeal for review. See *State v. Armengau*, 2018-Ohio-365. The Supreme Court also denied appellant's subsequent motion requesting reopening of appeal. See *State v. Armengau*, 2018-Ohio-1600. The Supreme Court denied another motion filed by appellant on April 30, 2018. Finally, the Supreme Court denied appellant's July 2, 2018 motion requesting the court grant motion and supplemental notice.

{¶ 18} Finally, we note appellant has made another attempt to raise the same issues raised in this appeal and in his direct appeal in his appeal of the resentencing now pending before this court in *State v. Armengau*, 10th Dist. No. 18AP-300.

*Armengau II.* To the extent Petitioner believes *Armengau I* is a misinterpretation of *Hampton*, he has offered both the Tenth District and the Ohio Supreme Court ample opportunity to accept his view, without any success. This Court is therefore bound by the Tenth District’s interpretation of *Hampton*. *Bradshaw*, supra.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it discusses the legal arguments and the court's decision regarding the venue of the offense. The error is not directed at the prosecutor but rather at the court's interpretation of the law regarding venue.","Context information is below.
---------------------
“Venue” is a term that has, in recent years, come into common usage in American English to denote where some event has occurred or will occur. Thus Americans discuss “sports venues”
or “concert venues” in common parlance. Brian Garner writes that the word in legal usage means “(1) originally the neighborhood from which a jury had to be selected; (2) the county or other territorial unit over which a trial court had jurisdiction; or (3) the proper or a possible place for the trial of a lawsuit.” Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 2nd, at 916 (Oxford Univ. Press 1995). None of these meanings fits comfortably with the claims Petitioner makes in his First Ground for Relief. Indeed, he criticizes the Tenth District for deciding what it labeled as a venue issue, but it was the same issue he had himself labeled “venue” in his appellate brief.

Instead of arguing about venue in any of these senses, Armengau is arguing about venue in the sense of location of the offense. In sum, he claims that the location of the offense as charged in the indictment is a material or substantive element which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no dispute that the conduct charged as criminal in Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 occurred (if at all\(^6\)) in Marion County, Ohio, and not in Franklin County, Ohio. Nor is there any dispute that the indictment charged this conduct occurred in Franklin County and was never amended. The State did provide an amended bill of particulars prior to trial that alleged conduct in Marion County, but did not amend the indictment.

Under *Jackson v. Virginia, supra*, the State must prove all the substantial or material elements of a charged crime by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Petitioner correctly asserts that it is state law which determines what are the elements. (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 13950, citing *Winship*).

Armengau relies principally on *State v. Hampton*, 134 Ohio St.3d 447 (2012). Hampton was indicted on charges he committed a home invasion and inflicted serious injuries in Franklin

---

\(^6\) The jury found, applying the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, that the conduct occurred. Petitioner does not concede that point and the Magistrate Judge respects his denial with the phrase “if at all.” It is not an expression of personal doubt, which would be inappropriate.
County, Ohio. During the State’s case in chief, the lead detective testified “he had just learned that these offenses had occurred in Fairfield County, not in Franklin County.” *Id.* at ¶ 5. The court took a motion for acquittal under Ohio R. Crim P. 29 under advisement, but granted it after defense rested without presenting evidence, holding the State had failed to prove “venue.” The State appealed, but the Tenth District held the State had no right to appeal a judgment of acquittal. The Supreme Court of Ohio granted review on three propositions of law proposed by the State and decided:

¶ 18 In the state's second proposition of law, the state suggests that lack of venue cannot result in an “acquittal” under Crim.R. 29 because motions under that rule are limited to claims of lack of proof of one or more material elements of the offense. Venue, the state argues, is not a material element of the offense.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it discusses the legal principles and cases related to venue in criminal trials under the Ohio Constitution and relevant statutes.","Context information is below.
---------------------
¶ 19 The Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10 provides an accused the right to “a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county in which the offense is alleged to have been committed.” We have stated, “Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution fixes venue, or the proper place to try a criminal matter * * *.” *State v. Headley*, 6 Ohio St.3d 475, 477, 453 N.E.2d 716 (1983). We have also stated, “A conviction may not be had in a criminal case where the proof fails to show that the crime alleged in the indictment occurred in the county where the indictment was returned.” *State v. Nevius*, 147 Ohio St. 263, 71 N.E.2d 258 (1947), paragraph three of the syllabus. We have also stated that “it is not essential that the venue of the crime be proven in express terms, provided it be established by all the facts and circumstances in the case, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the crime was committed in the county and state as alleged in the indictment.” *State v. Dickerson*, 77 Ohio St. 34, 82 N.E. 969 (1907), paragraph one of the syllabus.

¶ 20 Under Article I, Section 10 and R.C. 2901.12, evidence of proper venue must be presented in order to sustain a conviction for an offense. *Headley* at 477, 453 N.E.2d 716, citing *State v. Draggo*, 65 Ohio St.2d 88, 90, 418 N.E.2d 1343 (1981); *State v. Gribble*, 24 Ohio St.2d 85, 263 N.E.2d 904 (1970); *Nevius*, 147 Ohio St. 263, 71 N.E.2d 258.

¶ 21 In *Nevius*, we affirmed the decision of the court of appeals as it related to the finding of insufficient evidence relating to venue,
but we then reversed the order of the court of appeals remanding the matter for a new trial, instead ruling that the trial court should have granted a directed verdict in favor of the defendant on count four of the indictment, and we discharged the defendant accordingly on that count. *Id.* at 266–267, 287, 71 N.E.2d 258. This common-law concept of a directed verdict has now been memorialized through Crim.R. 29.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text is not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it is discussing the legal principles and precedents related to the requirement of proving venue in a criminal trial. The error being assigned is not against the prosecutor but rather against the trial court for not granting a judgment of acquittal when the evidence was insufficient to prove the venue of the offense as alleged in the indictment.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 22} In arguing that insufficient proof of venue does not justify acquittal, the state would limit application of Crim.R. 29 to situations in which the elements of the offense have not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The plain language of the rule itself does not distinguish between “material” elements and “immaterial” elements. Instead, the plain language of the rule itself simply indicates that a judgment of acquittal is appropriate when “the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.” If the state fails to produce evidence of proper venue, then the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses. But, as stated above, Crim.R. 29 does not limit itself to elements or “material” elements of the offense. The question is whether “the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense.” (Emphasis added.) Most jurisdictions place some burden upon the state to prove venue—whether it be beyond a reasonable doubt, by a preponderance of the evidence, or by some evidence—because it is a fact of the crime. See 4 LaFave, *Criminal Procedure*, Section 16.1(c), at 714 (3d Ed.2007). And Ohio has required proof of venue beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction. *Knight v. State*, 54 Ohio St. 365, 377, 43 N.E. 995 (1896); *Dickerson*, 77 Ohio St. 34, 82 N.E. 969, paragraph one of the syllabus; *Nevius*, 147 Ohio St. 263, 71 N.E.2d 258.

{¶ 23} Crim.R. 29 is clear and straightforward and does not limit its application to elements of the offense alone—the trial judge may grant an acquittal when there is a failure of proof to sustain a conviction. Nothing in the Constitution, statutes, or rules requires a defendant to raise the issue of venue before trial. The state has the obligation to ensure the proper venue within the indictment, for the indictment puts the defendant on notice and the state to its proof. The General Assembly has given the state considerable flexibility with respect to establishing venue when the state cannot determine the precise location at which the offense took place. See, e.g., R.C. 2901.12(G), which allows for an offense that was committed in any of two or more jurisdictions to be charged in any of those jurisdictions.
Over a century of well-established jurisprudence clearly mandates that a motion for judgment of acquittal must be granted when the evidence is insufficient for reasonable minds to find that venue is proper. Here, it is undisputed that all of the events in question occurred in Fairfield County, not Franklin County, as alleged in the indictment. Under Headley, Crim.R. 29, R.C. 2901.12, and the well-established common-law rule set forth in cases like Nevius, a judgment of acquittal may be entered when the state has failed at trial to prove the venue of the offense as alleged in the indictment.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it discusses the application of the Hampton case and the Ohio Revised Code § 2901.12(H) in the context of venue and the location of the offense.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Hampton conflates under the label “venue” the questions of the proper place for trial and location of the offense, but does hold location of the offense as alleged in the indictment must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. On the other hand, it does recognize the General Assembly, presumably constitutionally, “has given the state considerable flexibility with respect to establishing venue when the state cannot determine the precise location at which the offense took place.” The opinion provides no discussion of Ohio Revised Code § 2901.12(H), the statute relied on by the Tenth District in this case.

What is the proper application of Hampton to this case? That is a question of Ohio, not federal, law and on questions of state law, federal habeas courts are bound by state court rulings. Bradshaw, supra. The Tenth District plainly understood Hampton as relevant binding precedent, but did not believe the decision should be read as narrowly as Armengau insisted. It noted the Hampton court had recognized the flexibility the General Assembly had given counties in complying with the Ohio Constitution in course-of-conduct/multiple county situations and found Ohio Revised Code § 2901.12(H) applied in this case. It also noted that Hampton was a one offense indictment, not involving course of conduct, where all the charged misconduct occurred in a county other than the county of indictment.

Hampton was in part an enforcement of the Ohio Constitution, Article I, Section 10 which
provides an accused the right to “a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the county in which the offense is alleged to have been committed.” While the speedy and public trial and impartial jury requirements are embodied in the Sixth Amendment and all of these are made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, the U.S. Constitution says nothing about trial in the same county where the offenses are alleged to have occurred. Nor can Armengau’s argument be successfully construed as a federal right to grand jury indictment for state crimes, because no such right exists. The Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not applicable to the States. Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516 (1884); Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 687-88 n. 25 (1972); Gerstein v.

Petitioner has no federal due process right to have this Court enforce his Ohio Article I, § 10, right. Failure to abide by state law is not itself a constitutional violation. Roberts v. City of Troy, 773 F.2d 720 (6th Cir. 1985). Violation by a State of its own procedural rules does not necessarily constitute a violation of due process. Bates v. Sponberg, 547 F.2d 325 (6th Cir. 1976); Ryan v. Aurora City Bd. of Educ., 540 F.2d 222, 228 (6th Cir. 1976). “A state cannot be said to have a federal due process obligation to follow all of its procedures; such a system would result in the constitutionalizing of every state rule, and would not be administrable.” Levine v. Torvik, 986 F.2d 1506, 1515 (6th Cir. 1993).

There is no federal constitutional right to be tried for a crime in the same county where a grand jury charges the crime occurred. Armengau’s First Ground for Relief should be dismissed as not cognizable in federal habeas corpus.

---

7 The Vicinage Clause requires that federal criminal trials be held in the judicial district in which they are alleged to have occurred and that those districts be determined in advance.
Ground Two: Lack of Notice of Crimes Charged

In his Second Ground for Relief in the Second Amended Petition, Armengau claims he was denied due process of law when the indictment did not adequately inform him of the “specific crimes” he was charged with committing in that the prosecutors changed the date range and the location(s) of the offense(s).

In the Reply, however, Armengau labels Ground Two as being about “Notice, Defective Indictment & Other Acts” (ECF No. 77, PageID 14005). He argues

What Ohio law doesn't permit is the use of ""other acts"" to form the factual basis of any charged crime. By Respondent's own admission, the convictions in Petitioner's case cannot stand as the factual basis for each crime was established by the introduction and substitution of ""other act"" evidence.

* * *

Respondent fails to note for this Court where Petitioner was provided notice that he would have to defend allegations for Counts 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 that occurred in Marion, Ohio or that for counts 10 and 14 through 18, that he would have to defend allegations in 1998, 1999 or 2000.

Id.

Petitioner begins his argument in the Reply on this claim by alleging he was subjected to a constructive amendment of the indictment (ECF No. 77, PageID 14006). He asserts that under both Ohio law and the United States Constitution, constructive amendments are forbidden. This argument misses an important distinction. The Ohio Constitution requires a grand jury indictment for state felonies to be tried in Ohio courts. Likewise the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution requires grand jury indictment for federal felonies to be tried in federal courts. The

prohibition against constructive amendment enforces the grand jury requirement in each set of courts. However, the Fifth Amendment grand jury clause is not applicable to the States. *Hurtado v. California*, 110 U.S. 516 (1884); *Branzburg v. Hayes*, 408 U.S. 665, 687-88 n. 25 (1972); *Gerstein v. Pugh*, 420 U.S. 103 (1975); *Williams v. Haviland*, 467 F.3d 527 (6th Cir. 2006) (*Apprendi* does not change this result). Nor is the Ohio grand jury requirement enforceable in habeas corpus. Federal habeas corpus is available only to correct federal constitutional violations. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a); *Wilson v. Corcoran*, 562 U.S. 1 (2010); *Lewis v. Jeffers*, 497 U.S. 764, 780 (1990); *Smith v. Phillips*, 455 U.S. 209 (1982), *Barclay v. Florida*, 463 U.S. 939 (1983). Armengau’s constructive amendment argument is not cognizable because constructive amendments do not violate any federal right to and jury indictment in state courts.

Petitioner notes that his “other acts” argument under this Ground for Relief is not about the use of such evidence to convict a defendant by proving he has a bad character or has a propensity to crime, the usual argument against “other acts” evidence. Rather, his claim here is that “other act” evidence was substituted mid-trial for evidence of the crimes charged in the indictment (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14008-36).

Respondent asserts Armengau has procedurally defaulted in presenting Ground Two as a federal constitutional claim to the Supreme Court of Ohio (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13896). Petitioner responds that “[t]he ‘other-act’ issues were raised in Propositions III, IV, V and VI to the Ohio Supreme Court.” (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14007). Those propositions of law as pleaded are as follows:

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it discusses the defendant's (Mr. Armengau's) arguments regarding the use of ""other acts"" evidence and the impact of this evidence on his right to a fair trial, due process of law, and double jeopardy protections. The focus is on the defendant's claims and the state's response, not on any misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Sixth Proposition of Law: When the State cannot provide a defendant with accurate information regarding the timeframe in which the alleged criminal conduct occurred, where it occurred, or the conduct at issue until its witness has testified at trial, a defendant is misled and prejudiced, and is entitled to mistrial. Crim.R. 7(D).

(Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 13, PageID 8041-42). On their face, these Propositions of Law do not present federal constitutional claims. Instead, they exhibit the usual objections to other acts evidence, to wit, that it is “propensity” evidence, used to convict a defendant because of his or her bad character. All of the case law cited is Ohio case law. In the body of his Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, Armengau argued
Propositions of Law Three, Four, and Five together. *Id.* at PageID 8048-53. Nowhere in that argument does he claim the “other acts” evidence was substituted for the indicted conduct. Instead, the argument is all in terms of the propensity impact of other acts evidence. The Federal Constitution is not mentioned at all nor are any federal cases cited.

In arguing the Sixth Proposition of Law, Armengau states “[i]n his direct appeal, Mr. Armengau asserted that this course of litigation functioned to deny him his rights to a fair trial, due process of law, and double jeopardy protections.” *Id.* at PageID 8056. Nowhere else in this argument does he mention any federal right or cite any federal case law or state case law referencing the United States Constitution.

To preserve a federal constitutional claim for presentation in habeas corpus, the claim must be ""fairly presented"" to the state courts in a way which provides them with an opportunity to remedy the asserted constitutional violation, including presenting both the legal and factual basis of the claim. *Williams v. Anderson*, 460 F.3d 789, 806 (6th Cir. 2006); *Levine v. Torvik*, 986 F.2d 1506, 1516 (6th Cir.), *cert. denied*, 509 U.S. 907 (1993), overruled in part on other grounds by *Thompson v. Keohane*, 516 U.S. 99 (1995); *Riggins v. McMackin*, 935 F.2d 790, 792 (6th Cir. 1991). The claim must be fairly presented at every stage of the state appellate process. *Wagner v. Smith*, 581 F.3d 410, 418 (6th Cir. 2009).

A claim is fairly presented if the petitioner

(1) relied upon federal cases employing constitutional analysis; (2) relied upon state cases employing federal constitutional analysis; (3) phrased the claim in terms of constitutional law or in terms sufficiently particular to allege a denial of a specific constitutional right; or (4) alleged facts well within the mainstream of constitutional law.

Merely using talismanic constitutional phrases like “fair trial” or “due process of law” does not constitute raising a federal constitutional issue. *Slaughter v. Parker*, 450 F.3d 224, 236 (6th Cir. 2006); *Franklin v. Rose*, 811 F.2d 322, 326 (6th Cir. 1987); *McMeans v. Brigano*, 228 F.3d 674, 681 (6th Cir. 2000), citing *Petrucelli v. Coombe*, 735 F.2d 684, 688-89 (2nd Cir. 1984). Mere use of the words “due process and a fair trial by an impartial jury” are insufficient. *Slaughter v. Parker*, 450 F.3d 224, 236 (6th Cir. 2006); *Blackmon v. Booker*, 394 F.3d 399, 400 (6th Cir. 2004)(same). “A lawyer need not develop a constitutional argument at length, but he must make one; the words ‘due process’ are not an argument.” *Riggins v. McGinnis*, 50 F.3d 492, 494 (7th Cir. 1995).

Petitioner did not fairly present his convicted-on-other-acts evidence claim as a federal constitutional claim to the Supreme Court of Ohio. The claim is therefore procedurally defaulted and Ground Two should be dismissed.

**Ground Three: Denial of Due Process and Double Jeopardy Protection by Allowing Constructive Amendment and Refusing Unanimity Instruction**

In his Third Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he was denied due process and double jeopardy protection when the trial court allowed constructive amendment of the indictment and refused a requested unanimity instruction. Those are at least the issues on the face of Ground Three in the Second Amended Petition. In the Reply, however, Armengau argues Ground Three together with Ground Six. In the Sixth Ground for Relief he claims he was denied due process “when he was tried and convicted for crimes for which he was never charged or indicted or noticed and for which the court failed to obtain subject matter jurisdiction.” To make matters more confusing, he argues both Grounds for Relief under the label “Constructive Amendment, Double Jeopardy, Jury
Instructions, Defective Indictment & Notice” and then asserts “This issue is inextricably related to the sufficiency [of the evidence] arguments set-forth above.” (ECF No. 77, PageID 14036).

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it focuses on the trial court's failure to provide notice and the insufficiency of the bill of particulars, as well as the lack of a unanimous jury verdict and double jeopardy issues. The allegations are primarily directed at the trial court and the prosecution's charging documents, not the prosecutor's conduct.","Context information is below.
---------------------
The combined argument on these two Grounds for Relief then occupies forty-five pages of the Reply (PageID 14036-81). He begins with an argument about a criminal defendant’s entitlement to notice of the “approximate time frame and at minimum, the general location as to where the crime(s) occurred. A defendant must also be advised of what he did (conduct)” Id. at PageID 14036. Armengau asserts it is not only the indictment which is defective, but that no court has given him notice of the facts upon which he was convicted. “Petitioner has been deprived of his Constitutional right to notice before trial, during trial, during sentencing and after resentencing.” Id. at PageID 14041.

Petitioner then switches to his jury unanimity argument:

A jury has a duty to unanimously agree to a particular set of facts. United States v. Echeverry, 698 F.2d 375 (9th Cir. 1983). The U.S. Constitution does require a unanimous verdict in state prosecutions. A jury must be unanimous in what facts are being considered to determine guilt. Respondent does not dispute that as of today no one knows what ""act or incident"" constitutes any of the crimes for which Petitioner is imprisoned.

(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14042). Petitioner then argues the bill of particulars was insufficient to provide notice. Id. at PageID 14045-51. He then switches back to a jury instruction argument. At PageID 14067, et seq., he raises double jeopardy issues. Then, without any notice of a change of direction, Petitioner turns back to notice issues. Id.

Returning to the double jeopardy claim, Armengau asserts:

United States Supreme Court decisions are clear that the charging document itself must, on its face, protect a defendant from double jeopardy. Such holdings confirm that the federal constitutional requirement of double jeopardy protection is preemptive and must be reflected in the charging document.

* * *
Clearly established federal law requires the protection be provided at the inception of the filing of the criminal charge.

*Id.* at PageID 14079. However instead of citing any Supreme Court decisions, he cites instead to *State v. Freeman*, 2010-Ohio-3714 (Ohio App. 8th Dist. 2010), and *Isaac v. Grider*, 211 F.3d 1269 (6th Cir. 2000). In a single line at the conclusion of this section of the Reply, he asserts without any cited authority “The trial court in Petitioner's case never had jurisdiction for any alleged crime in Marion, Ohio[,] in 1998, 1999 or 2000 because the state never charged Petitioner with any such crime.” PageID 14081.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it discusses the sufficiency of the indictment and the lack of particularity in the charges against the defendant, which is a matter related to the prosecution's presentation of the case.","Context information is below.
---------------------
“[T]here is no constitutional right in a state prosecution to a grand jury indictment with particular specificity.” *Williams v. Haviland*, 467 F.3d 527, 534 (6th Cir. 2006) citing *Rose v. Mitchell*, 443 U.S. 545, 557, n. 7 (1979). “Due process mandates only that the indictment provide the defendant with ‘fair notice of the charges against him to permit adequate preparation of his defense.’” *Williams* at 535, quoting *Koontz v. Glossa*, 731 F.2d 365, 369 (6th Cir. 1984).

*Russell v. United States*, 369 U.S. 749 (1962), holds the sufficiency of a federal indictment is to be measured by the following criteria:

> These criteria are, first, whether the indictment ""contains the elements of the offense intended to be charged, 'and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet,'"" and, secondly, ""'in case any other proceedings are taken against him for a similar offense whether the record shows with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction.'""

369 U.S. at 763-64. While the right to grand jury indictment has not been extended to the States, the Sixth Circuit has held these criteria are applicable as a matter of due process. *Valentine v. Konteh*, 395 F.3d 626, 631 (6th Cir. 2005). In *Valentine* the defendant faced twenty carbon-copy counts of rape of a minor and twenty carbon-copy counts of gross sexual imposition. Judge Merritt wrote for the court:
The problem in this case is not the fact that the prosecution did not provide the defendant with exact times and places. If there had been singular counts of each offense, the lack of particularity would not have presented the same problem. Instead, the problem is that within each set of 20 counts, there are absolutely no distinctions made. Valentine was prosecuted for two criminal acts that occurred twenty times each, rather than for forty separate criminal acts. In its charges and in its evidence before the jury, the prosecution did not attempt to lay out the factual bases of forty separate incidents that took place. Instead, the 8–year–old victim described “typical” abusive behavior by Valentine and then testified that the “typical” abuse occurred twenty or fifteen times. Outside of the victim's estimate, no evidence as to the number of incidents was presented.

Id. at 632-33.

This is not a case like Valentine. Armengau was charged with separate incidents involving separate victims, dates, and places. Testimony at trial varied from the dates and places in the indictment. Some of the variations in date were dealt with by amendment to the indictment at trial; the difference in location had been dealt with by an amended bill of particulars. As the Tenth District noted, Petitioner was not presenting alibi or impossibility defenses which would have been defeated by date changes.9

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it discusses the use of the term ""established"" by the petitioner in their pleadings and the magistrate judge's interpretation of that term. The text also mentions the Supreme Court's holdings on the use of circuit precedent and the concept of ""clearly established federal law.""","Context information is below.
---------------------
Thus Valentine does not read directly on the indictment in this case. More importantly, Valentine is not “clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.” The Supreme Court has held, since Valentine, that a circuit court may not use circuit precedent “to refine or sharpen a general rule of Supreme Court jurisprudence into a specific rule that” the Supreme Court has not announced. Lopez v. Smith, 574 U.S. 1 (2014)(per curiam); Marshall v. Rodgers, 569 U.S. 58, 64 (2013)(per curiam). However, “an appellate panel may, in

---

9 Several times in his pleadings, Petitioner asserts he “established” during trial that he could not have committed the offenses alleged because he was not at the place or there at the time alleged. Facts are not established finally during the course of trial absent a stipulation or mid-trial dismissal. The Magistrate Judge therefore reads Petitioner’s use of the word “established” as meaning Petitioner had presented evidence which he believed was convincing on certain dates and places, forcing the prosecutors to shift focus or make amendments.
accordance with its usual law-of-the-circuit procedures, to ascertain whether it has already held that the particular point in issue is clearly established by Supreme Court precedent, see, e.g., *Tolliver v. Sheets*, 594 F.3d 900, 916, n.6 (“We are bound by prior Sixth Circuit determinations that a rule has been clearly established”); *Chambers v. McDaniel*, 549 F.3d 1191, 1199 (9th Cir. 2008); it may not canvass circuit decisions to determine whether a particular rule of law is so widely accepted among the Federal Circuits that it would, if presented to this Court, be accepted as correct. See *Parker v. Matthews*, 567 U.S. 37 (2012); *Renico v. Lett*, 559 U.S. 766, 778-779 (2010).” *Marshall*, 569 U.S. 58, 64 (2013).

The *Valentine* Court did not limit itself to the question whether the rule it adopted was clearly established by Supreme Court precedent. Instead, it opined,

> [T]he “clearly established Federal law” relevant under AEDPA encompasses “the governing legal principle or principles set forth by the Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its decision.” See *Lockyer v. Andrade*, 538 U.S. 63, 71–72, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). The Supreme Court has established a clear and consistent path for the courts regarding the due process sufficiency of criminal charges, and the Ohio Court of Appeals has strayed so far from that path as to warrant habeas relief. See id. at 72, 123 S.Ct. 1166.

*Valentine*, 395 F.3d at 638 (Emphasis supplied). This formulation is inconsistent with later Supreme Court precedent requiring a tighter fit between Supreme Court holdings and the rule sought to be enforced in habeas.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text describes an assignment of error related to the indictment and the Double Jeopardy Clause, but it does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is specifically about the indictment not providing sufficient notice and not adequately protecting against multiple punishments for the same offense.","Context information is below.

In *Valentine* itself, the court held “that a court is permitted to review the indictment, the bill of particulars, and the evidence presented at trial to determine whether any defects in the indictment are cured.” 395 F. 3d at 634.

In addition to not receiving from the indictment the notice to which he claims he is entitled, Petitioner also asserts the indictment provides insufficient double jeopardy protection. The Double
Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution affords a defendant three basic protections:

- It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.
- It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction.
- And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.

*Brown v. Ohio*, 432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977), quoting *North Carolina v. Pearce*, 395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969). The Double Jeopardy Clause was held to be applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment in *Benton v. Maryland*, 395 U.S. 784, 794 (1969). The State of Ohio has not re-indicted Petitioner for any sexual misconduct allegedly occurring within the span of years eventually covered by this prosecution; no such indictment is threatened and its content is purely speculative. It is clear that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a second trial and not just a second conviction for the same offense. *Abney v. United States*, 431 U.S. 651 (1977). For that reason, a double jeopardy claim is cognizable in federal habeas corpus prior to the “second” trial. *Justices of the Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon*, 466 U.S. 294 (1984); *Reimnitz v. State’s Attorney of Cook County*, 761 F.2d 405, 408 (7th Cir. 1985); *Malinovsky v. Court of Common Pleas of Lorain County*, 7 F.3d 1263 (6th Cir. 1993). To put it another way, a habeas petitioner with a double jeopardy claim is not required to exhaust the remedy of direct appeal from a verdict at a second trial before invoking our habeas jurisdiction. Should a new indictment be filed, a habeas court would compare both the indictment in this case and the evidence adduced at trial to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause was being violated. The Supreme Court has never held that a state indictment must be so precise as to preclude a second indictment while examining only the face of the first indictment. *Valentine*, which reaches that conclusion, is not Supreme Court precedent and has never been followed by the Sixth Circuit itself in a habeas corpus case. *Lawwill v. Pineda*, 2011 WL 1882456 (N.D. Ohio 2011).
Respecting jury unanimity, Armengau argues “[a] jury has a duty to unanimously agree to a particular state of facts . . . . A jury must be unanimous in what facts are being considered to determine guilt.” (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14042, citing United States v. Echeverry, 698 F.2d 375 (9th Cir. 1983)). At numerous points in his Reply, Petitioner argues that no court has been able to tell him what facts the jury relied upon to convict him of which offenses.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is being assigned to the trial court and defense attorney, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Petitioner is correct that the United States Constitution requires that jury verdicts in criminal cases be unanimous. Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, 140 S. Ct. 1390, 206 L. Ed. 2d 583 (2020). However Ramos does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, such as this one. Edwards v. Vannoy, 593 U.S. ___, 141 S. Ct. 1547 (2021). Prior to Ramos, the Supreme Court had held nonunanimous verdicts were permissible. Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U.S. 404 (1972). These cases, however, involved States (Oregon and Louisiana) which expressly allowed majority verdicts.

Petitioner, however, insists on something more: unanimity on the facts supporting a verdict. How would a State achieve such a result? A possibility would be to sever counts of an indictment and try them one at a time, but Petitioner does not suggest that is constitutionally required, nor does he claim he ever asked for severance in the trial court.

We instruct a jury that its verdict on each count must be unanimous and we enforce that requirement by requiring each juror to sign the verdict and allowing jurors to be polled in open court on their vote. In this case the verdicts of the jury were returned and read in open court on July 7, 2014 (Transcript, State Court Record, ECF No. 72-2, PageID 13702, et seq.). In each case the bailiff announced that the form was signed by all jurors. When the reading was complete, Petitioner’s trial counsel asked that the jury be polled and they were, all answering that the verdicts as read were verdicts they had voted for and signed. Id. Thus the usual methods of ensuring jury
unanimity were employed and the jurors affirmed their verdicts.

In *Echeverry*, the Ninth Circuit disapproved an ambiguous jury instruction in a federal conspiracy case which left the jury free to convict if they found a conspiracy existed “for some period of time” when the evidence would have permitted a finding that there had been both a December and a June conspiracy, but did not require a unanimous finding as to either one. Nothing in the case suggests that the defendant could have, after the fact, required the jury or an appellate court to tell him what facts they found unanimously. To put it somewhat differently, a state criminal trial is not like a federal civil jury trial where a jury can be required to return special verdicts. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 49. Much less can a state appellate court be compelled, in the interest of jury unanimity, to make such separate findings.

Finally, Petitioner’s jury unanimity claim is procedurally defaulted because it was not presented to the Tenth District as a federal constitutional claim. The Tenth District noted that this claim had been presented as a jury unanimity claim under Ohio R. Crim. P. 31(A).

Finally, appellant argues that the complex, and allegedly mismatched, assemblage of facts, testimony, indictment, and amendments of the bill of particulars allowed the jury to produce a “patchwork” verdict in violation of Ohio's requirement of jury unanimity, under Crim.R. 31(A). Pursuant to that rule, jurors must unanimously agree not only on the defendant's guilt, but as to proof as to each element of the crime.

Petitioner’s Third Ground for Relief should therefore be dismissed.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text describes an assignment of error by Armengau, who is alleging that the trial court denied him due process of law by not providing a requested unanimity instruction and allowing a non-unanimous verdict and a verdict upon uncharged alleged conduct. The allegation is against the trial court, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
In his Fourth Ground for Relief, Armengau asserts he was denied due process of law when the trial court “denied a requested unanimity instruction and the instructions allowed a non-unanimous verdict and a verdict upon uncharged alleged conduct.” (Second Amended Petition, ECF No. 70,
Respondent asserts this claim is procedurally defaulted. The procedural default doctrine in habeas corpus is described by the Supreme Court as follows:

In all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an adequate and independent state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause of the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law; or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.

Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991); see also Simpson v. Jones, 238 F.3d 399, 406 (6th Cir. 2000). That is, a petitioner may not raise on federal habeas a federal constitutional rights claim he could not raise in state court because of procedural default. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72 (1977); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 110 (1982). “Absent cause and prejudice, ‘a federal habeas petitioner who fails to comply with a State’s rules of procedure waives his right to federal habeas corpus review.’” Boyle v. Million, 201 F.3d 711, 716 (6th Cir. 2000), quoting Gravley v. Mills, 87 F.3d 779, 784-85 (6th Cir. 1996); Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 485 (1986); Engle, 456 U.S. at 110; Wainwright, 433 U.S. at 87.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,No. The text above is describing a legal doctrine related to federal court review of federal claims that were procedurally defaulted in state court. It does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
[A] federal court may not review federal claims that were procedurally defaulted in state court—that is, claims that the state court denied based on an adequate and independent state procedural rule. E.g., Beard v. Kindler, 558 U.S. 53, 55, 130 S.Ct. 612, 175 L.Ed.2d 417 (2009). This is an important “corollary” to the exhaustion requirement. Dretke v. Haley, 541 U.S. 386, 392, 124 S.Ct. 1847, 158 L.Ed. d 659 (2004). “Just as in those cases in which a state prisoner fails to exhaust state remedies, a habeas petitioner who has failed to meet the State’s procedural requirements for presenting his federal claims has deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address” the merits of “those claims in the first instance.” Coleman [v. Thompson], 501 U.S. [722,] 731-732, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 [(1991)]. The procedural default doctrine thus advances the same comity, finality, and federalism interests advanced by the exhaustion doctrine. See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 493, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991).
Davila v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 2058, 2064 (2017). “[A] federal court may not review federal claims that were procedurally defaulted in state courts.” Theriot v. Vashaw, 982 F.3d 999 (6th Cir. 2020), citing Maslonka v. Hoffner, 900 F.3d 269, 276 (6th Cir. 2018) (alteration in original) (quoting Davila v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 2058, 2064 (2017)).

Answer:"
284-Armengau,No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is related to the trial court's failure to give a requested jury instruction and the defense attorney's failure to object to the instruction as given.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals requires a four-part analysis when the State alleges a habeas claim is precluded by procedural default. Barton v. Warden, S. Ohio Corr. Facility, 786 F.3d 450, 464 (6th Cir. 2015), Guilmette v. Howes, 624 F.3d 286, 290 (6th Cir. 2010)(en banc); Eley v. Bagley, 604 F.3d 958, 965 (6th Cir. 2010); Reynolds v. Berry, 146 F.3d 345, 347-48 (6th Cir. 1998), citing Maupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986); accord Lott v. Coyle, 261 F.3d 594, 601-02 (6th Cir. 2001); Jacobs v. Mohr, 265 F.3d 407, 417 (6th Cir. 2001).

First the court must determine that there is a state procedural rule that is applicable to the petitioner's claim and that the petitioner failed to comply with the rule.

Second, the court must decide whether the state courts actually enforced the state procedural sanction, citing County Court of Ulster County v. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 149, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979).

Third, the court must decide whether the state procedural forfeiture is an ""adequate and independent"" state ground on which the state can rely to foreclose review of a federal constitutional claim.

Once the court determines that a state procedural rule was not complied with and that the rule was an adequate and independent state ground, then the petitioner must demonstrate under Sykes that there was ""cause"" for him to not follow the procedural rule and that he was actually prejudiced by the alleged constitutional error.

Maupin v. Smith, 785 F.2d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1986); accord, Hartman v. Bagley, 492 F.3d 347, 357 (6th Cir. 2007), quoting Monzo v. Edwards, 281 F.3d 568, 576 (6th Cir. 2002).

Petitioner’s trial counsel requested a particular instruction on unanimity which was not given.
However, he “did not object to the jury instructions as given.” *Armengau I* at ¶ 64. The Tenth District therefore reviewed Armengau’s jury instruction claims under a plain error standard. *Id.*

Petitioner does not dispute that Ohio has a procedural rule that requires a litigant to preserve an alleged jury instruction error by objecting to the instruction as given nor does he dispute the Tenth District’s factual finding that no such objection was made here. Instead he asserts the Tenth District did not enforce the rule.

Answer:"
284-Armengau,No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The error is being assigned to the trial court for not committing plain error and to the Court of Appeals for relying on the contemporaneous objection rule as a procedural bar.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Petitioner respectfully suggests to this Court that the Court of Appeals did not rely on the ""procedural bar"" and in any event, notwithstanding defense counsel's failure to lodge an objection, notwithstanding the denial of his requested instruction, the Court of Appeals proceeded to analyze the issue in the same manner it would have had an objection been made.

(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14082, citing *Keeton v. Bradshaw*, 2006 U.S. Dist.LEXIS 102076 (fn7)(N.D. Ohio, Jul. 20, 2006), adopted, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 64342 (N.D. Ohio, Sept. 8, 2006)).

In *Keeton* Magistrate Judge Veccharelli analyzed procedural default differentially as to different claims. As to the claim referenced in footnote seven, cited by Petitioner, she found the Ohio Court of Appeals had not actually enforced the relevant procedural rule. But as to Ground Three regarding excuse of jurors, she wrote:

In dismissing this claim, the Court of Appeals indicated that Keeton's trial counsel did not object to the dismissal of the prospective jurors for cause and reviewed the claim for plain error. The Court of Appeals held that the trial court did not commit plain error.

The Court of Appeals expressly relied upon and enforced the contemporaneous objection rule, a state procedural bar, to dismiss this claim. The Court of Appeals' plain error review does not excuse the court's reliance on the state procedural rule in dismissing the claims. See *Scott*, 209 F.3d at 868. Further, the Sixth Circuit has held the contemporaneous objection rule is an ""adequate and independent"" state ground. *Id.* at 869.

2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102076 *16.
In this case the Tenth District did as the appellate court had in *Keeton*: it noted the failure to object and then reviewed for plain error. *Armengau I* at ¶ 64. As Judge Veccharelli noted, the Sixth Circuit has frequently recognized that Ohio’s contemporaneous objection rule is an adequate and independent state ground of decision. *Wogenstahl v. Mitchell*, 668 F.3d 307, 334 (6th Cir. 2012), citing *Keith v. Mitchell*, 455 F.3d 662, 673 (6th Cir. 2006); *Goodwin v. Johnson*, 632 F.3d 301, 315 (6th Cir. 2011); *Smith v.

284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the jury instructions and the failure to object to them, which is attributed to the defense attorney's failure to raise the issue.","Context information is below.
---------------------
The Sixth Circuit has also held that Ohio appellate review for plain error is enforcement of the contemporaneous objection rule and not a waiver of it. *Wogenstahl v. Mitchell*, 668 F.3d 307, 337 (6th Cir. 2012); *Jells v. Mitchell*, 538 F.3d 478, 511 (6th Cir. 2008); *Lundgren v. Mitchell*, 440 F.3d 754, 765 (6th Cir. 2006); *White v.

Petitioner also asserts that the failure to object does not prevent this Court from considering his constitutional claim. (Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14083, citing *Osborne v. Ohio*, 495 U.S. 103 (1990)). In *Osborne* the Supreme Court enforced a procedural default consisting of failure to object to omission of a *sciente* instruction, but disregarded a similar default on an instruction on “lewdness” because trial counsel had sufficiently pushed the issue of overbreadth to satisfy the state interest in giving the state courts a fair opportunity to correct constitutional error. 495 U.S. at 123-24. Thus the Supreme Court found an excusable default in the factual complexities of the
Osborne case and did not announce a general rule which would apply here.

Respondent asserts Armengau further procedurally defaulted this jury instruction claim by failing to present it to the Supreme Court of Ohio as a federal constitutional claim (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13896). Petitioner responds by asserting:

With regard to Respondent's claim that the jury instruction issue was not fairly presented, a claim of defective indictment, patchwork and non-unanimous verdict and a double jeopardy claim, by necessity, implicates a jury instruction issue.

Jury instructions are directly related to the sufficiency evaluation for an indictment, evidence and corresponding notice issues and these issue [sic] were raised in Propositions I and VI to the Ohio Supreme Court (Doc. 72, PageID 8046-8047, 8053-8058, PageID 610-622). Those issues by necessity extend to the jury instructions.

(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14082-83).

The referenced Propositions of Law read:

**First Proposition of Law:** This Court's decision in Hampton does not allow a defendant to be convicted of a crime when the indictment asserts the criminal conduct occurred in a specific county, and does not reference R.C. 2901.12, and all evidence presented demonstrates that the crime occurred in a different county than that named in the indictment. RC. 2901.12; State v. Hampton, 134 Ohio St.3d 447, 2012-Ohio-5688, 983 N.E.2d 324

284-Armengau,"Yes, the text above is describing an assignment of error that alleges prosecutorial misconduct. The error is specifically against the prosecutor (or the state) for presenting unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed other-act evidence to intentionally circumvent the defenses to the actually indicted alleged crimes.","Context information is below.
---------------------
**Sixth Proposition of Law:** When the State cannot provide a defendant with accurate information regarding the time frame in which the alleged criminal conduct occurred, where it occurred, or the conduct at issue until its witness has testified at trial, a defendant is misled and prejudiced, and is entitled to a mistrial. Crim. R. 7(D).

(Memorandum in Support of Jurisdiction, State Court Record, ECF No. 72, Ex. 13, PageID 8041-42). Neither of these Propositions of Law mentions jury instructions at all or any provision of the United States Constitution. Nor do the arguments on these propositions mention jury instructions or cite any federal law.

Because Petitioner did not fairly present his jury instruction claim to the Supreme Court of
Ohio as a federal constitutional claim, it is procedurally defaulted on that basis as well.

Because Petitioner’s Fourth Ground for Relief is procedurally defaulted twice over, the Court cannot reach the merits of the claim. Davila, supra. The jury instructions claim should be dismissed as procedurally defaulted.

**Ground Five: Prosecutorial Misconduct**

In his Fifth Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts he was deprived of due process and a fair trial by prosecutorial misconduct when “he was tried, convicted, and resentenced for convictions upon the admission of other-act evidence that was unindicted, uncharged, and unnoticed prior to trial and which was presented by prosecutors to intentionally circumvent the defenses to the actually indicted alleged crimes.”

Respondent asserts this Ground for Relief is procedurally defaulted because the admission of other acts evidence claim was presented to the Tenth District as an issue of trial court error rather than prosecutorial misconduct (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13896). Petitioner’s Reply asserts that the Return did not address his claim of prosecutorial misconduct and therefore does not respond to this defense (ECF No. 77, PageID 14147).

The Magistrate Judge finds the defense well taken. The relevant Assignment of Error on appeal argued trial court error, not prosecutorial misconduct. Armengau I, ¶ 68. The Sixth Circuit has articulated the relevant standard for habeas claims of prosecutorial misconduct as follows:

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"Yes, the text is describing an assignment of error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state) committed misconduct. The error is specifically related to the prosecutor's reliance on inadmissible other acts evidence.","Context information is below.
---------------------
“In the evaluation of a claim for prosecutorial misconduct, it is not enough that the prosecutor's comments were improper, but '[t]he relevant question is whether the prosecutors' comments “so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.” ’ ” Smith, 567 F.3d [246] at 255 [6th Cir. 2009] (quoting Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986)) (quoting Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416
U.S. 637, 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)). In other words, “[i]n order to satisfy the standard for prosecutorial misconduct, the conduct must be both improper and flagrant.” Broom v. Mitchell, 441 F.3d 392, 412 (6th Cir.2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1255, 127 S.Ct. 1376, 167 L.Ed.2d 165 (2007). To determine whether improper conduct is flagrant, we consider four factors:

(1) the likelihood that the remarks of the prosecutor tended to mislead the jury or prejudice the defendant; (2) whether the remarks were isolated or extensive; (3) whether the remarks were deliberately or accidentally made; and (4) the total strength of the evidence against the defendant.

Bates v. Bell, 402 F.3d 635, 641 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 865, 126 S.Ct. 163, 163 L.Ed.2d 150 (2005).

Goff v. Bagley, 601 F.3d 445, 480 (6th Cir. 2010). See also LaMar v. Houk, 798 F.3d 405, 430 (6th Cir., 2015).

The usual claim of prosecutorial misconduct involves a prosecutor’s improper comment on evidence, presentation of perjured testimony, or failure to comply with Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny. Here the claim is the prosecutors deliberately relied on inadmissible other acts evidence. The first step in analyzing any claim of prosecutorial misconduct is to determine that the prosecutor’s conduct was improper. Bowling v. Parker, 344 F.3d 487, 512-13 (6th Cir. 2003). Here the Tenth District determined admission of the other acts evidence was not improper. It cannot be improper conduct for a prosecutor to offer admissible evidence.

Petitioner’s Fifth Ground for Relief should be denied as procedurally defaulted and without merit.
Ground Six: Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
284-Armengau,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The allegations are against the trial court and the appellate courts for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and denial of equal protection.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
In his Sixth Ground for Relief, Petitioner argues the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas never “obtained” subject matter jurisdiction to try his case (Amended Petition, ECF No. 70, PageID 7651). As noted above, Armengau combined arguments about Ground Six with his arguments on Ground Three. Other than the subject matter jurisdiction claim, these issues are dealt with above under Ground Three.

Respondent treats this claim as of a piece with Armengau’s other objections to the indictment and dismisses it with the assertion that there is no federal constitutional right to grand jury indictment in state courts (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13881, citing, inter alia, Hurtado). Other than adverting to the fact that he has alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction, Armengau does nothing in his Reply to argue the issue. Nor does it appear Armengau raised this issue on direct appeal.

Lack of subject matter jurisdiction was a basis for granting habeas corpus relief long before those bases were broadened to any constitutional error in Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443 (1953). See Ex parte Lange, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 163 (1873); Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371 (1880). However, in Ohio, the common pleas courts are the courts with subject matter jurisdiction to try felony criminal cases. See Ohio Rev. Code 2931.03; State v. Lauharn, 2012-Ohio-1572, ¶ 22, 2012 Ohio App. LEXIS 1382, **12 (2nd App. Dist. 2012); Leyman v. Bradshaw, 2015-Ohio-751, ¶ 13, 2015 Ohio App. LEXIS 699, **4 (5th App. Dist. 2015). Petitioner has not pled or proved any basis on which the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his case. Ground six should therefore be dismissed on the merits.
Ground Seven: Denial of Equal Protection

In his Seventh Ground for Relief, Petitioner claims he was denied his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws when the Tenth District Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Ohio “intentionally disregarded the law set by their respective courts and the United States Supreme Court in order to affirm the convictions.” His theory is that “[t]he holdings and rulings in Petitioner's case are contrary to established precedent.”

Respondent asserts this claim is not cognizable in federal habeas corpus, arguing “[a]lleged errors involving a state court’s interpretation of its own law or procedure are not cognizable in federal habeas corpus review (Return, ECF No. 73, PageID 13889, citing Simpson v. Jones, 238 F.3d 399, 406-07 (6th Cir. 2000); Allen v. Morris, 845 F.2d 610, 614 (6th Cir. 1988)).

Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text describes an allegation that the Ohio appellate courts, not the prosecution, discriminated against the petitioner. The error is not alleging misconduct by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432 (1985). The sine qua non of an equal protection claim is dissimilar treatment of persons similarly situated. The Equal Protection Clause embodies a general rule that States must treat like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly.

* * *

Petitioner respectfully suggests that the case law he has cited throughout his petition and this reply specifically identifies him as similarly situated to defendants who have obtained relief under identical issues and material facts and that the court system has disregarded the law they have established in order to affirm the convictions.

(Reply, ECF No. 77, PageID 14087-88). He then proceeds to discuss at length other allegedly similarly-situated defendants who have obtained relief in similar circumstances. Id. at PageID 14089-91.
It is of course fundamental to our American system of case law that like cases should be decided alike. Garner, et al., The Law of Judicial Precedent § A.1(2016). Garner’s treatise is devoted to explicating the doctrine of precedent which enables deciding like cases alike. Petitioner’s premise – that equal protection doctrine must overlay the doctrine of precedent – seems an appropriate extension of the law in both of these areas. The Magistrate Judge therefore disagrees with Respondent’s argument that only state law questions are involved. If, for example, a municipal judge intentionally applied a different standard to deciding red light cases depending on the race of the defendant, it is not difficult to see the equal protection issue involved.

At the same time, the entire doctrine of precedent cannot be constitutionalized; such a system would not be administrable. See Levine v. Torvik, supra. The Supreme Court has stated that the Equal Protection Clause ""embodies the general rule that States must treat like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly."" Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793, 799 (1997). The States cannot make distinctions which either burden a fundamental right, target a suspect class, or intentionally treat a person differently from others similarly situated without any rational basis for the difference. Id.; Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000) (per curiam); Radvansky v. City of Olmsted Falls, 395 F.3d 291, 312 (6th Cir. 2005).

Considering the general standards for establishment of an equal protection violation, Petitioner has not articulated, much less presented, a case which would support such a finding. He never presented a case to the Ohio courts for selective prosecution. Indeed, his allegation is that the Ohio appellate courts, not the prosecution, discriminated against him. He does not suggest an invidious basis such as race for deciding his case one way and other similarly-situated cases differently. Although he claims there are other similarly-situated cases, what are the similarities? Are there other men accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women who have not been
prosecuted because they were not successful criminal defense lawyers?

Answer:"
284-Armengau,No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. The allegations are against the trial court and the defense attorney.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
In sum, while the Magistrate Judge agrees that an intentional misapplication of the doctrine of precedent on an invidious basis could violate the Equal Protection Clause, Armengau did not present such a case to either the Tenth District or the Supreme Court of Ohio. As with “fair trial” and “due process,” mere recitation of the talismanic phrase “equal protection” is not an argument. Petitioner’s Seventh Ground for Relief should be dismissed as procedurally defaulted because never fairly presented to the Ohio courts. It is also without merit in the form presented to this Court.

**Ground Eight: Actual Innocence**

In his Eighth Ground for Relief, Armengau claims he is actually innocent of the crimes of which he was convicted and is entitled to habeas corpus relief on that basis. In habeas corpus parlance, this is denominated a “stand alone” actual innocence claim to distinguish it from the “gateway” actual innocence claim recognized by the Supreme Court in *Schlup v. Delo*, 513 U.S. 298 (1995).

Case law in the Sixth Circuit establishes that the Supreme Court of the United States has never recognized a free-standing or substantive actual innocence claim. *Cress v. Palmer*, 484 F.3d 844, 854 (6th Cir. 2007), citing *Zuern v. Tate*, 336 F.3d 478, 482, n.1 (6th Cir. 2003), and *Staley v. Jones*, 239 F.3d 769, 780, n.12 (6th Cir. 2001).

Even if a stand-alone claim were to be recognized, Petitioner has not submitted evidence of the quality required by *Schlup* to qualify. ""To be credible, such a claim requires petitioner to support his allegations of constitutional error with new reliable evidence -- whether it be
exculpatory scientific evidence, trustworthy eyewitness accounts, or critical physical evidence -- that was not presented at trial."" *Souter v. Jones*, 395 F.3d 577, 590 (6th Cir. 2005), citing *Schlup*, 513 U.S. at 324.

The Supreme Court has also noted that ""actual innocence means factual innocence, not mere legal insufficiency."" *Bousley v. United States*, 523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998). Having committed the acts which the jury found to be sexual misconduct in Marion County as opposed to Franklin County does not amount to a claim of factual innocence.

Petitioner’s Eighth Ground for Relief should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which habeas corpus relief can be granted.

**Ground Nine: Lack of Jury Unanimity**

This claim has been dealt with under Ground Three above.

**Ground Ten: Denial of Right to Trial by Jury**

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
284-Armengau,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it states that the specific prosecutorial misconduct claim made by the Petitioner was not presented in that form to the Tenth District, but rather as a claim of trial court error.","Context information is below.
---------------------
In his Tenth Ground for Relief, Petitioner asserts he was denied his right to trial by jury because the factual bases of his convictions were determined by the trial and appellate judges instead of the jury. As Petitioner made clear when moving to amend to add this claim, he believes he suffered from a violation of the doctrine in *Apprendi v. New Jersey*, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), where the Supreme Court held “under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that
increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”

This is not a classic Apprendi case where some punishment beyond that authorized by the statute of conviction can be imposed upon a separate finding by the trial judge. For example, in Apprendi the Supreme Court was dealing with a statute which increased the penalties for a crime if the court determined it to be a “hate” crime. Nothing of that sort happened here. Rather Ground Ten is a variant on Petitioner’s claim that facts found by the jury’s general verdicts were reassigned by the Tenth District upon resentencing. Petitioner points to no clearly established Supreme Court precedent violated by what occurred on re-sentencing. His Tenth Ground for Relief should therefore be denied on the merits.

Additional Claims

At the end of his Reply, Petitioner asserts that he has made other claims which Respondent has not addressed, to wit, fair trial, prosecutorial misconduct, and constructive amendment (Reply, ECF No. 72, PageID 14147).

As noted in the analysis of Ground Five, the Respondent did address the specific prosecutorial misconduct claim made here by noting it had not been presented in that form to the Tenth District, but rather as a claim of trial court error.

Case law prohibiting constructive amendments of indictments during trial are designed to protect a defendant’s constitutional right to grand jury indictment. A state defendant’s grand jury

---

10 Armengau was ordered to serve some sentences consecutively. However, the Supreme Court has exempted the findings which may be needed for consecutive sentences from the application of Apprendi. Oregon v. Ice, 555 U.S. 160 (2009).
right is protected by the Ohio Constitution, but violations of the Ohio Constitution do not state a claim for violating the federal Constitution, because there is no federal constitutional right to indictment in the state courts. *Hurtado, supra.* A federal defendant’s grand jury right, protected by the Fifth Amendment, is protected by forbidding constructive amendments in federal trials. All the authority relied on by Petitioner in this section of his Reply was enforcing the federal grand jury right in federal cases. Because the Fifth Amendment Grand Jury Clause has not been incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, there is no federal constitutional prohibition on constructive amendments in state trials.

Petitioner has not pleaded a separate ground for relief based on his claim of denial of a fair trial.

**Conclusion**

Based on the foregoing analysis, the Magistrate Judge respectfully recommends the Petition be dismissed with prejudice. Reasonable jurists could disagree with the proposed disposition of Grounds One (sufficiency of the evidence) and Three (double jeopardy); Petitioner should therefore be granted a certificate of appealability as to those Grounds. Because reasonable jurists would not disagree with dismissal of the other Grounds for Relief, it is also recommended that Petitioner be denied a certificate of appealability as to those Grounds. Petitioner should be permitted to proceed on appeal *in forma pauperis.*

883-BRIDGES,"No. The text does not allege that the prosecutor committed misconduct. Instead, it mentions that Bridges has argued prosecutorial misconduct in his various petitions and motions, but it does not specify any particular misconduct committed by the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
Defendant-appellant, Andrey L. Bridges (“Bridges”), appeals the denial of his postconviction motion to proceed with findings of fact and conclusions of law. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the trial court.
Prior Procedural History

Bridges has an extensive history with this court stemming from numerous appeals in regards to his 2013 conviction for murder. We have summarized that history before as follows:

In November 2013, a jury convicted Bridges of murder, felonious assault, tampering with evidence, and abuse of a corpse in relation to the death of Carl Acoff. The trial court sentenced Bridges to an aggregate term of life in prison with the possibility of parole after 18 years and six months. Bridges filed a direct appeal, arguing his convictions for murder and felonious assault were against the manifest weight of the evidence and the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction for tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse. We affirmed Bridges's convictions. State v. Bridges, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100805, 2014-Ohio-4570 (“Bridges I”); see State v. Bridges, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100805, 2015-Ohio-1447 (denying Bridges’s application for reopening his appeal).

In July 2014, Bridges filed a petition for postconviction relief, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel, his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence, and prosecutorial misconduct. While Bridges’s direct appeal was pending, the trial court denied his petition for postconviction relief without a hearing and issued findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the denial. Bridges appealed these rulings in two cases, both of which were dismissed for failure to file the record. State v. Bridges, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 101938 (Oct. 1, 2014), and 101942 (Oct. 31, 2014).

In March 2015, Bridges filed a petition to vacate or set aside his judgment of conviction or sentence, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, speedy trial violations, and prosecutorial misconduct. The trial court denied Bridges’s petition without a hearing. In May 2015, Bridges filed a motion for new trial, arguing his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence, the trial court abused its discretion by admitting prejudicial photographic evidence, and his $5 million bond was unconstitutional. The trial court denied Bridges’s motion without a hearing.

Bridges appealed these two rulings, and in December 2015, we affirmed the same. State v. Bridges, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 102930 and
103090, 2015-Ohio-5428 (""Bridges II""). In affirming the trial court’s judgment, we determined that Bridges’s motion for new trial was untimely and not based on newly discovered evidence. In addition, we concluded that the claims asserted in Bridges’s postconviction motion to vacate or set aside judgment of conviction or sentence were barred by res judicata. *Id.*

Answer:"
883-BRIDGES,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignments of error are directed against the trial court.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
In August 2015, while his appeal in *Bridges II* was pending, Bridges filed a motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial. In May 2016, Bridges filed a “motion for leave with memorandum in support to correct error R.C. 2903.02(A) conviction due to insufficient evidence” (“motion to correct error”). The trial court denied both motions without a hearing. Bridges appealed the trial court’s rulings, and in October 2016, we affirmed the trial court. *State v. Bridges*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 103634 and 104506, 2016-Ohio-7298 (""Bridges III"").

In *Bridges III*, we sua sponte consolidated Bridges’s appeal in Appeal No. 103634 and found that the journal entries from which Bridges had appealed were not final, appealable orders. *Id.* at ¶ 10-12. In affirming the trial court’s denial of Bridges’s motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial, we found Bridges failed to provide any new evidence supporting his ineffective assistance, actual innocence, and error of law claims that was not previously known or available to him during his trial or during the time period immediately following his conviction, and nevertheless, his claims are barred by res judicata. *Id.* at ¶ 24-28. Additionally, we found Bridges’s motion to correct error was barred by res judicata. *Id.* at ¶ 38.

*State v. Bridges*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106653, 2018-Ohio-4113, ¶ 2-7 (""Bridges IV"").

{¶ 3} In December 2017, Bridges filed a motion to leave to file void or voidable judgment, arguing that the trial court considered the status of the victim as transgender and this consideration rendered his sentence contrary to law. He also claimed that this consideration violated his due process rights. The trial court denied Bridges’s motion and Bridges appealed. In *Bridges IV*, we affirmed the trial court, finding that Bridges’s motion was an untimely petition for postconviction
relief, and that, even if it were not untimely, his claims were barred by res judicata.

Id.

The present case

On April 8, 2019, Bridges filed a “motion to rebut violent offender database and duties and raise factual innocence.” The trial court denied that motion on April 24, 2019. Bridges did not appeal. On June 26, 2019, Bridges filed a motion to proceed with findings of fact and conclusions of law arguing that the court was required to provide reasons for denying his April 8 motion. The trial court denied his motion for findings of fact and conclusions of law on July 16, 2019. Bridges now appeals that denial. He provides two assignments of error for our review.

Assignment of Error I

Appellant is denied his Equal Protection and Due process of Law of the 14th Amendment, to the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution and he is in fact-Factual Innocent of the Crime, Elements and Conviction

Assignment of Error II

The trial court committed error by not issuing a complete finding of fact and conclusion of law setting forth the reason why relief is denied.

Both assignments can be addressed together.

Answer:"
883-BRIDGES,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The assignment of error is related to the trial court's decision not to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law in response to a postconviction petition filed by Bridges.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶ 6} Bridges motion is a successive petition for postconviction relief; as a result, the trial court was not required to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law.

{¶ 7} Bridges titled his motion “A motion to rebut violent offender database and duties and raise factual innocence.” This is a motion to correct or vacate his sentence and should be treated as a postconviction petition as a result. “[A] vaguely titled motion to correct or vacate a sentence may be construed as a petition for post-conviction relief where the motion was filed subsequent to a direct appeal, claimed a denial of constitutional rights, sought to render the judgment void, and asked for a vacation of the judgment and sentence.” State v. Meincke, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 96407, 2011-Ohio-6473, quoting State v. Caldwell, 3d Dist. Paulding No. 11-05-07, 2005-Ohio-5375, citing State v. Reynolds, 79 Ohio St.3d 158, 679 N.E.2d 1131 (1997), syllabus. Bridges’s motion meets all four requirements.

{¶ 8} Because Bridges has filed prior petitions for postconviction relief, this petition is deemed a successive petition. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that a trial court “has no duty to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law on successive or untimely petitions for post-conviction relief.” State ex rel. George v. Burnside, 118 Ohio St.3d 406, 2008-Ohio-2702, 889 N.E.2d 533, ¶ 6; see also State ex rel. Reynolds v. Basinger, 99 Ohio St.3d 303, 2003-Ohio-3631, 791 N.E.2d 459, ¶ 6-7. As a result, the trial court acted within its discretion to not issue findings of fact and
conclusions of law. See State v. Williamson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104294, 2016-Ohio-7053.

¶ 9 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the trial court.

It is ordered that appellee recover from appellant costs herein taxed.

The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.

It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the common pleas court to carry this judgment into execution.

A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.

Defendant-Appellant, Pro Se
DONOVAN, J.

¶ 1 Defendant-appellant William Dixon appeals pro se a judgment of the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division, overruling his “motion to vacate a void sentence pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B)” and his “motion to supplement case law and standard for pending rule 52(B).” Specifically, the trial court found that Dixon’s arguments regarding the failure of the sentencing court to merge allied offenses and the imposition of consecutive sentences were barred by res judicata. Dixon filed a timely notice of appeal with this Court on April 6, 2018.

¶ 2 Initially, we note that following his original conviction in 2006, Dixon filed an unsuccessful direct appeal. Dixon has also unsuccessfully pursued post-conviction relief. See State v. Dixon, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21823, 2008-Ohio-755 (Dixon I); State v. Dixon, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23592, 2010-Ohio-2635 (Dixon II); State v. Dixon, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26873, 2016-Ohio-5538 (Dixon III); and State v. Dixon, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27652, 2018-Ohio-192 (Dixon IV).

¶ 3 Because they are interrelated, Dixon’s assignments of error will be discussed together.

---------------------
THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF FAIR TRIAL, DUE PROCESS, AND EQUAL PROTECTION WAS DEPRIVED BY PROSECUTOR MISCONDUCT, WHICH VIOLATED THE 5TH, 6TH, 8TH, AND 14TH AMENDMENTS.

¶ 4 In the instant appeal, Dixon contends that the trial court erred in failing to merge allied offenses when it sentenced him in 2006 to an aggregate 21-year prison term for complicity to commit aggravated robbery, complicity to commit aggravated burglary, and complicity to commit felonious assault, all with firearm specifications. Dixon also argues that the trial court erred when it imposed consecutive sentences. Furthermore Dixon contends that his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to properly
raise the sentencing issues at trial and on direct appeal. Dixon also argues that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to support his convictions for complicity. Lastly, Dixon argues that the State committed prosecutorial misconduct at trial.

¶ 5 Post-conviction relief is governed by R.C. 2953.21. The statute provides, in pertinent part, that:

Any person who has been convicted of a criminal offense * * * and who claims that there was such a denial or infringement of the person's rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States, * * * may file a petition in the court that imposed sentence, stating the grounds for relief relied upon, and asking the court to vacate or set aside the judgment or sentence or to grant other appropriate relief. The petitioner may file a supporting affidavit and other documentary evidence in support of the claim for relief.

R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a).

¶ 6 “A post[-]conviction proceeding is not an appeal of a criminal conviction, but, rather, a collateral civil attack on the judgment.” State v. Steffen, 70 Ohio St.3d 399, 410, 639 N.E.2d 67 (1994). See also State v. Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, 860 N.E.2d 77, ¶ 48. To prevail on a petition for post-conviction relief, the defendant must establish a violation of his constitutional rights which renders the judgment of conviction void or voidable. R.C. 2953.21. The instant appeal represents Dixon's fourth motion for post-conviction relief.

---------------------
¶ 7 Upon review, we see no error in the trial court's ruling. As we stated in Dixon IV, any allied-offense sentencing error would have rendered Dixon's sentence voidable,
not void. Thus, res judicata precludes him from raising an allied-offense issue in post-conviction proceedings when the issue could have been raised on direct appeal. * * * Consequently, challenges to the trial court’s failure to merge allied offenses are barred by the doctrine of res judicata if they could have been, but were not, raised on direct appeal.”); see also State v.

Montgomery No. 26853, 2016-Ohio-5051, ¶ 11 (“Because Dominguez could have raised the allied-offense issue in a direct appeal, the trial court correctly concluded that res judicata applied to his post-conviction motions.”). Here we see no reason why Dixon could not have raised an allied-offense argument on direct appeal, and he has not identified any such reason. Accordingly, Dixon’s allied offenses claims are barred by res judicata.

Furthermore, we find that res judicata bars Dixon’s remaining assignments of error. In Dixon I, Dixon II, and Dixon III, Dixon raised ineffective assistance claims. After initially finding no ineffective assistance in his direct appeal, we subsequently held the issue was barred by res judicata. Dixon I at ¶ 53; Dixon II at ¶ 23; and Dixon III at ¶ 34. In assignments of error I and II, Dixon argues that the trial court erred when it imposed consecutive sentences. Dixon, however, raised the same argument in his direct appeal, wherein we affirmed the trial court’s imposition of consecutive sentences. Dixon I at ¶ 18. Additionally, we find that Dixon previously raised arguments regarding
the sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence in Dixon I and Dixon II. Thus, those arguments are barred by res judicata.

¶ 9 In his fourth assignment, Dixon argues that the trial court was biased against him because it falsely believed that he was anti-Semitic based upon a statement made during sentencing; however, this issue could have been raised on direct appeal and is now barred by res judicata. Res judicata also bars Dixon’s argument regarding a sentencing disparity between himself and his co-defendants. Lastly, Dixon’s claim regarding prosecutorial misconduct was argued and thoroughly addressed by this Court in Dixon III, and is therefore barred by res judicata.

¶ 10 Dixon’s assignments of error are overruled.

¶ 11 All of Dixon's assignments of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

CASE NO. 14-21-01

Appeal from Union County Common Pleas Court
Trial Court No. 18-CR-0168

Judgment Affirmed

Date of Decision: June 7, 2021

APPEARANCES:

Jason G. Bender Appellant

Samantha Hobbs for Appellee
WILLAMOWSKI, P.J.

Although originally placed on our accelerated calendar, we have elected pursuant to Loc.R. 12(5) to issue a full opinion in lieu of a summary judgment entry. Defendant-appellant Jason G. Bender (“Bender”) appeals the judgment of the Union County Court of Common Pleas, alleging that the trial court erred in dismissing his petition for post-conviction relief. For the reasons set forth below, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.

Facts and Procedural History

On July 13, 2018, Bender was indicted on one count of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1), a felony of the second degree; one count of kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3), a felony of the first degree; one count of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), a felony of the first degree; and one count of having weapon while under disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(2), a felony of the third degree. Doc. 1. After his trial, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all of the charges against Bender on April 24, 2019. Doc. 78-81.

On May 29, 2019, the trial court sentenced Bender. Doc. 87. Bender then filed his notice of appeal on June 18, 2019. Doc. 93. On September 9, 2019, the trial transcript was filed for his direct appeal. Doc. 114. On his direct appeal, he raised three assignments of error, including an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. State v. Bender, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-19-22, 2020-Ohio-722, ¶ 6, 19. On
March 2, 2020, this Court issued a decision that overruled his assignments of error and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. *Id.* at ¶ 37.

{¶4} On December 1, 2020, Bender filed a petition for post-conviction relief *pro se*. Doc. 116. In this petition, Bender raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and a prosecutorial misconduct claim. Doc. 116. On January 20, 2021, the trial court dismissed Bender’s petition without a hearing because this petition was not timely filed. Doc. 124. Bender filed his notice of appeal on February 1, 2021. Doc. 126. On appeal, Bender raises the following assignments of error:

**First Assignment of Error**

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
213-Bender,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The errors are all directed against the trial court.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
Trial Court erred when it determined that Appellant’s Post Conviction Relief Petition was barred by the statute of limitations.

**Second Assignment of Error**

Trial Court erred by stating that Appellant’s Post-Conviction grounds for relief were addressed during direct appeal.

**Third Assignment of Error**

The denial of Appellant’s petition was principally grounded on the basis of judicial bias, and not the facts within the evidence submitted to support the petition.

**First Assignment of Error**

{¶5} Bender asserts that his petition for post-conviction relief was timely filed because the Ohio Supreme Court’s order tolling time requirements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic extended the applicable deadline.
Legal Standard

{¶6} “R.C. 2953.21 governs petitions for post-conviction relief.” State v. Wine, 3d Dist. Auglaize No. 2-15-07, 2015-Ohio-4726, ¶ 10. “Postconviction review is not a constitutional right, but is a collateral civil attack on a judgment that is governed solely by R.C. 2953.21.” State v. Keith, 176 Ohio App.3d 260, 2008-Ohio-741, 891 N.E.2d 1191, ¶ 24 (3d Dist.). R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a)(i) states that a petition for post-conviction relief may be filed by

[a]ny person who has been convicted of a criminal offense or adjudicated a delinquent child and who claims that there was such a denial or infringement of the person’s rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States[.]

R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a)(i). In general, to be timely filed, a petition for post-conviction relief must be filed with the trial court “no later than three hundred sixty-five days after the date on which the trial transcript is filed in the court of appeals in the direct appeal of the judgment of conviction * * *.” R.C. 2953.21(A)(2)(a).

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
213-Bender,"No. The text above is describing the legal requirements for a trial court to consider a petition for postconviction relief, not alleging any misconduct by the prosecutor. The focus is on the conditions under which a trial court may entertain a late or successive petition for postconviction relief, and the burden of proof on the petitioner. There is no allegation of misconduct by the prosecutor in the provided text.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶7} “A trial court lacks jurisdiction to entertain an untimely or successive petition for postconviction relief unless the petitioner establishes that one of the exceptions in R.C. 2953.23(A) applies.” State v. Cunningham, 2016-Ohio-3106, 65 N.E.3d 307, ¶ 13 (3d Dist.), quoting State v. Chavis, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 15AP-557, 2015-Ohio-5549, ¶ 14. Under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1), a trial court may consider a petition for post-conviction that was filed after timeframe set forth in R.C. 2953.21(A) if both of the following criterion apply:
[1] Either the petitioner shows that the petitioner was unavoidably prevented from discovery of the facts upon which the petitioner must rely to present the claim for relief, or, subsequent to the period prescribed in division (A)(2) of section 2953.21 of the Revised Code or to the filing of an earlier petition, the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons in the petitioner’s situation, and the petition asserts a claim based on that right.

[2] The petitioner shows by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense of which the petitioner was convicted or, if the claim challenges a sentence of death that, but for constitutional error at the sentencing hearing, no reasonable factfinder would have found the petitioner eligible for the death sentence.

R.C. 2953.23(A).

Thus, unless the defendant alleges a new federal or state right has been recognized, the defendant must prove (1) that he was unavoidably prevented from discovery of facts upon which his successive petition for postconviction relief rests and (2) that he would not have been convicted at trial by a reasonable factfinder but for the constitutional error.

State v. Workman, 3d Dist. Auglaize No. 2-17-12, 2017-Ohio-7364, ¶ 18, citing R.C. 2953.23(A)(1). A petitioner is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing simply because he or she filed a petition for post-conviction relief. State v. Lewis, 3d Dist. Logan No. 8-19-08, 2019-Ohio-3031, ¶ 11.

Answer:"
213-Bender,"No. The text above is not describing an assignment of error alleging misconduct by the prosecutor. Instead, it discusses the timing of Bender's petition for post-conviction relief and the impact of COVID-19-related legislation on statutory time requirements. The focus is on the trial court's decision to dismiss the petition without a hearing and whether this decision was an abuse of discretion.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶8} On appeal, “[w]e review the trial court’s dismissal of a post-conviction petition without a hearing for abuse of discretion.” State v. Liles, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-16-33, 2017-Ohio-240, ¶ 10, quoting State v. Jeffers, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 10AP-1112, 2011-Ohio-3555, ¶ 23. “An abuse of discretion is not merely an error
of judgment.” State v. Sullivan, 2017-Ohio-8937, 102 N.E.3d 86, ¶ 20 (3d Dist.). “Rather, an abuse of discretion is present where the trial court’s decision was arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious.” State v. Kleman, 3d Dist. Hardin No. 6-19-01, 2019-Ohio-4404, ¶ 18, quoting State v. Howton, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-16-35, 2017-Ohio-4349, ¶ 23.

Legal Analysis

{¶9} In this case, the trial transcript was filed on September 9, 2019 for Bender’s direct appeal. Doc. 114. Bender filed his petition for post-conviction relief on December 1, 2020. Doc. 116. Thus, Bender’s petition for post-conviction relief was filed more than three hundred and sixty-five days after the trial transcript was filed for his direct appeal. However, Bender asserts that his petition was, in fact, timely filed when legislation that tolled statutory time requirements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is taken into account.

[O]n March 27, 2020, the Governor of Ohio signed into law Am.Sub.H.B. No. 197, which immediately tolled, retroactive to March 9, 2020, all statutes of limitation, time limitations, and deadlines in the Ohio Revised Code and the Ohio Administrative Code until the expiration of Executive Order 2020-01D or July 30, 2020, whichever is sooner[.]

In re Tolling of Time Requirements Imposed by Rules Promulgated by Supreme Court & Use of Technology, 158 Ohio St.3d 1447, 2020-Ohio-1166, 141 N.E.3d 974, 974-975. The Supreme Court subsequently issued guidance for applying this tolling legislation that explained the following:
The legislation and Supreme Court order toll only time requirements set to expire during the emergency period. Time requirements that are set to expire after the emergency period are not tolled.

Answer:"
213-Bender,No. The text above describes an assignment of error where Bender argues that the trial court erred in determining that issues raised in his petition for post-conviction relief could have been raised in his direct appeal. The error is not alleging that the prosecutor committed misconduct.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶10} In this case, the deadline for timely filing a petition for post-conviction relief was September 9, 2020, which did not fall in between March 9, 2020 and July 30, 2020. Doc. 114. Since the deadline fell after the emergency period ended on July 30, 2020, the law tolling statutory time requirements does not apply in this situation. Thus, Bender had three hundred and sixty-five days from the date on which the transcripts were filed for his direct appeal to timely file his motion for post-conviction relief. Since he did not file his petition within this timeframe, his petition was not timely filed.

{¶11} Finally, in his petition for post-conviction relief, Bender does not establish that one of the exceptions listed in R.C. 2953.23(A) is applicable in this case. For these reasons, the trial court did not err in dismissing his petition for post-conviction relief. As such, Bender’s first assignment of error is overruled.
Second Assignment of Error

¶12 Bender argues that the trial court erred in determining that issues raised in his petition for post-conviction relief could have been raised in his direct appeal.

Legal Standard

¶13 “Although a defendant may challenge his conviction and sentence by either a direct appeal or a petition for postconviction relief, any claims raised in a postconviction relief petition will be barred by res judicata where the claim was or could have been raised on direct appeal.” State v. Schwieterman, 3d Dist. Mercer No. 10-09-12, 2010-Ohio-102, ¶ 23.

Under the doctrine of res judicata, a final judgment of conviction bars a convicted defendant who was represented by counsel from raising and litigating in any proceeding except an appeal from that judgment, any defense or any claimed lack of due process that was raised or could have been raised by the defendant at the trial, which resulted in that judgment of conviction, or on an appeal from that judgment.

State v. Perry, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 39 O.O.2d 189 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967), paragraph nine of the syllabus. In other words, “[a] postconviction relief proceeding is not to be utilized as an alternative to or substitute for a direct appeal.” State v. Lee, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-08-1207, 2008-Ohio-6177, ¶ 5.

However, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a petition for postconviction relief is only barred by res judicata where the defendant was represented by new counsel on direct appeal, and where appellate counsel was in no way enjoined from asserting ineffective assistance of trial counsel.
Legal Analysis

{¶14} In his petition for post-conviction relief, Bender raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and a prosecutorial misconduct claim. In support of these claims, Bender points to a video-recorded interview that the State disclosed to the Defense during discovery. Doc. 116. In its brief in this appeal, the State vigorously contests the merits of the arguments that Bender bases on this recorded interview. But we need not reach the merits of these arguments since both of these claims could have been raised on direct appeal.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
213-Bender,"No. The text above is describing an assignment of error alleging judicial bias, not misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is against the trial court judge, not the prosecutor.","Context information is below.
---------------------
{¶15} Because the arguments in his petition for post-conviction relief rest on evidence that the Defense had before trial, these arguments could have been raised at his trial and on direct appeal. Since these arguments were available to him at the time of his direct appeal, the claims raised in his petition for post-conviction relief are subject to res judicata. Further, as to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we note that Bender was represented by different attorneys during his trial and on his direct appeal. Doc. 107. See Schwieterman, supra, at ¶ 24. Bender even raised an unsuccessful ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his prior direct appeal. Bender, supra, at ¶ 22-25.
In conclusion, Bender could have raised both of the claims asserted in his petition for post-conviction relief during his direct appeal. Thus, even if his petition for post-conviction relief had been timely filed, these claims would still have been barred under the doctrine of res judicata. For these reasons, Bender’s second assignment of error is overruled.

Third Assignment of Error

Bender asserts that his petition for post-conviction relief was denied because of judicial bias.

Legal Standard

R.C. 2701.03(A) addresses the issue of judicial bias for a judge of the court of common pleas and reads as follows:

If a judge of the court of common pleas allegedly is interested in a proceeding pending before the court, allegedly is related to or has a bias or prejudice for or against a party to a proceeding pending before the court or a party’s counsel, or allegedly otherwise is disqualified to preside in a proceeding pending before the court, any party to the proceeding or the party’s counsel may file an affidavit of disqualification with the clerk of the supreme court in accordance with division (B) of this section.

R.C. 2701.03(A). Thus, “[t]he determination of a claim that a common pleas judge is biased or prejudiced is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio, or h[er] designee.” (Emphasis sic.) State v. Holdcroft, 3d Dist. Wyandot No. 16-10-04, 2010-Ohio-6262, ¶ 25.
However, a due process issue may still exist because a “criminal trial before a biased judge is fundamentally unfair * * *.” *State v. Wieser*, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-18-15, 2018-Ohio-3619, ¶ 23.

Judicial bias has been described by the Supreme Court of Ohio as ‘a hostile feeling or spirit of ill will or undue friendship or favoritism toward one of the litigants or his attorney, with the formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of the judge, as contradistinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.’

*Wieser* at ¶ 23, quoting *State ex rel. Pratt v. Weygandt*, 164 Ohio St. 463, 58 O.O. 315, 132 N.E.2d 191 (1956), paragraph four of the syllabus.

Query: If the text above is describing an assignment of error, is the error alleging that the prosecutor (sometimes referred to as the state)---NOT the trial court or defense attorney---committed misconduct? Respond 'No' or with a summary of the allegation against the prosecutor.
Answer:"
213-Bender,No. The text does not allege any misconduct by the prosecutor. The error is related to the trial court's dismissal of Bender's petition and the lack of evidence suggesting judicial bias or violation of due process rights.,"Context information is below.
---------------------
In this case, Bender did not avail himself of the statutory process to address allegations of judicial bias as set forth in R.C. 2701.03(A). Further, Bender has not raised any evidence that suggests his due process rights were violated. *See State v. Dendinger*, 3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-18-38, 2019-Ohio-2158, ¶ 23; *State v. Corchado*, 2017-Ohio-4390, 93 N.E.3d 150 (7th Dist.). In this case, the basis for Bender’s claim of judicial bias is only that his petition was dismissed. *See State v. Smith*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 18AP-525, 2019-Ohio-5199, ¶ 26, quoting *Liteky v. United States*, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994) (holding that “judicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion”). For these reasons, we conclude that Bender’s assertion of judicial bias lacks merit. As such, his third assignment of error is overruled.
Case No. 14-21-01

Conclusion

{¶21} Having found no error prejudicial to the appellant in the particulars assigned and argued, the judgment of the Union County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.
