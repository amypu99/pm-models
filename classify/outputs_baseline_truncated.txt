 The provided legal document is a decision from the Ohio Court of Appeals, specifically the 7th District Court of Appeals. This court hears appeals from decisions made in the lower courts within its jurisdiction. In this case, the defendant, Appellant, is appealing his conviction for murder by purposely causing the victim's death. The appellate court reviews the case based on the record and the arguments presented by both the prosecution and the defense.

The appellate court addresses four main issues raised by the defendant:

1. Sufficiency of the Evidence: The defendant argues that the evidence presented by the prosecution is insufficient to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court reviews the evidence presented during the trial, including witness testimonies, physical evidence, and expert opinions, to determine if the prosecution met its burden of proof.

2. Prosecutorial Misconduct: The defendant claims that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct during closing arguments, which denied him a fair trial. The court evaluates the prosecutor's statements and actions to determine if they were improper and if they affected the defendant's substantial rights.

3. Prosecutorial Misconduct: The defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jurors' sense of moral or civic duty, which denied him a fair trial. The court reviews the prosecut

 It seems that the defendant, Jonathon Patton, was convicted of two counts of murder and two counts of murder with gun specifications. The convictions were based on the testimony of two witnesses, Wells and Hicks, who testified that Patton was the one who handed the gun to the shooter, Maurice Searcy. The prosecutor made some improper comments during closing arguments, referring to Patton as "General Patton" and suggesting that there might have been two guns involved in the crime. However, the defense attorney did not object to these comments, and the court found that the outcome of the trial would not have been different if the defense attorney had hired an expert witness. The court also found that the prosecutor's comments did not rise to the level of plain error.

 Certainly, here's a summary:
    The defendant, appellant, was found guilty of multiple counts of sexual abuse of a minor. The trial court permitted the testimony of an expert witness, Dr. Robin Tener, who provided a written report summarizing her expected testimony and her findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinion regarding her knowledge of nondisclosure and denial by victims of childhood sexual abuse. The defendant argued that the expert's report did not comply with Crim.R. 16(K), which requires experts to generate written reports and that the trial court's decision to permit the expert's testimony violates the Supreme Court of Ohio's decision in State v. Boaston. The court of appeals found no violation of Crim.R. 16(K) and concluded that the defendant was not prejudiced by the error and that any error in admitting the expert's testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court.

 Certainly, here's a summary:
    The appellant, who was living in a tent at a campsite, was convicted of felonious assault for attacking four people with a saw and a stick. He argued that he was entitled to a Castle Doctrine jury instruction, which would have meant that he had no duty to retreat because he was protecting himself from the victims' attack in his own residence. The trial court found that the definition of "dwelling" pursuant to R.C. 2901.05(D)(2) and the factual circumstances of this case controlled, and that the appellant's homeless status was irrelevant because the definition of a "dwelling" specifically includes a tent. The appellant argued that a homeless person who seeks shelter under a "highway overpass" would not be in a "dwelling" because it is "not designed for habitation." However, the newly amended R.C. 2901.09(B) now states that "for purposes of any section of the Revised Code that sets forth a criminal offense, a person has no duty to retreat before using force in self-defense, defense of anoth er, or defense of that person's residence if that person is in a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be." The court affirmed the judgment of the Lake County Court of Common Pleas.

 In the case of State v. Burton, 2021-Ohio-3089, the court found that the trial court's denial of the appellant's petition for postconviction relief without a hearing constitutes an abuse of discretion. The appellant supported the timely filed petition with allegedly newly discovered evidence that, if believed, may be material, exculpatory, or exonerating under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The newly discovered evidence refutes the state's witness testimony and exhibits regarding when and where the appellant's vehicle was towed in support of the appellant's claim that the contents of his vehicle had been removed and placed within the living unit to establish the appellant's possession and control. The record also indicates confusion between the trial and postconviction exhibits during the postconviction proceedings.

 It appears that all of the criteria for this case to be considered for prosecutorial misconduct have not been met. The case does not involve a grand jury, self-defense, or the Castle Doctrine. The prosecutor's statement was not improper, and even if it was, James was not prejudiced by it. Therefore, the case does not fit the criteria for prosecutorial misconduct.

 It seems that you are looking for a summary of the legal case State v. Holcomb, 2021-Ohio-2352. Here is a summary:

    The defendant, Derrick Holcomb, was charged with two counts of felonious assault and two counts of domestic violence. The trial court merged the two felonious assault counts and sentenced Holcomb to five years in prison for each count, to be served concurrently. However, the trial court failed to note that the state had elected to proceed with only one of the felonious assault counts for sentencing.

    On appeal, the court found that the submission of both felonious assault offenses to the jury was not improper, but the sentencing entry's characterization of the merged counts was an obvious error that affected the right to be convicted of only one of the two merged offenses. The court reversed and remanded the case with instructions to issue a new sentencing entry in conformity with the opinion to eliminate the conviction and five-year sentence on count four as the trial court agreed this offense merged into count three on the state's election according to law and consistent with the court's opinion.

 The provided text is a legal decision, specifically a court opinion. It discusses a case involving the convictions of Phillips and Sutton, who were accused of shooting at police officers. The case revolves around the issue of Brady violation, which refers to the suppression of exculpatory evidence by the prosecution.

In this case, former police officers Gregory Jones and Officer Lundy provided evidence that directly challenged the testimony of Officers Keane and Lentz. The trial court dismissed this evidence, stating that it was not material and did not impact the outcome of the trial. However, the appellants argue that the failure to disclose this evidence violated their due process rights.

The court's decision is based on the principle that the jury system should impress upon the community that verdicts are given in accordance with the law by fair and impartial jurors. The court also refers to previous decisions, such as State v. Luckett, to emphasize the deference shown to the trial court in new trial appeals.

The case highlights the importance of disclosing all relevant evidence to the defense, even if it comes from a police officer. The court's decision ultimately finds that there is a reasonable probability that had the defense possessed the newly discovered material, exculpatory, and impeaching evidence, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. This decision underscores the need for transparency

 In this case, the court affirms the findings of guilt for unlawful restraint and assault, but reverses the sentences because the trial court failed to provide the defendant with the right of allocution. The court finds that the prosecutor's comments during closing argument were improper but did not affect the trial's result and constitute plain error. The court also finds that the trial court failed to ask the defendant if he personally wished to make a statement or present information in mitigation of punishment, as required by Crim.R. 32(A).

 Certainly, here's a summary:
    The appellant was convicted of multiple counts of rape, sexual battery, gross sexual imposition, and kidnapping. He appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting certain evidence and in allowing the prosecution to cross-examine him regarding specific incidents.

    The appellant first argued that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his domestic violence convictions and evidence from his social media accounts. The court found that the appellant opened the door to character evidence by testifying about his romantic relationship with the victim's mother and that the state was entitled to rebut that testimony. The court also found that the state's questions regarding the appellant's interactions with police were not improper, as they were not seeking to introduce extrinsic evidence. The court further found that the appellant's social media postings were admissible as "bad character evidence" because he brought his own character into question by introducing photographs of himself with his family. The court also found that the video depicting the appellant with firearms was admissible as a specific contradiction pursuant to Evid.R. 616(C).

    The appellant next argued that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his domestic violence convictions and evidence from his social media accounts. The court found that the appellant

    The Ohio Supreme Court held that the trial court erred by denying Buehner's motion for a new trial based on its determination that Buehner failed to establish a Brady violation. The court found that the state's failure to disclose the statements of Anderson, Jenkins, and Mason constituted separate and distinct Brady violations that deprived Buehner of his right to due process. The court further held that there was a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different decision if the exculpatory evidence had been known at trial.
    The court also held that Buehner's claim that the state utilized false testimony in violation of Illinois v. Napue, 360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959), was not established.

    The defendant, a hospice nurse, was convicted of tampering with evidence in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(2) for making two reports regarding the death of a patient. The first report falsely indicated that the hospice had notified the coroner of the patient’s death, and the second report contained information about the patient’s death that the nurse knew was false. The defendant appealed, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction.
    The court of appeals agreed with the defendant and reversed the conviction. The court found that there was no evidence that the defendant made the first report knowing that an official proceeding or investigation was in progress or was about to be or likely to be instituted. The court also found that there was no evidence that the defendant made the second report knowing that any other individual was likely to report the patient’s death to the coroner and cause the coroner to institute an investigation. The court concluded that no rational trier of fact could have found all of the essential elements of tampering with evidence proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

However, the court found that Jarrell's arguments regarding evidence of sexual abuse concerning an abuser who is not involved in this case and evidence that he suffered a head injury as a child were without merit.

As a result, the judgment of the trial court was reversed, and Jarrell's convictions were vacated.
