STEWART, JUDGE\n\nMARY EILEEN KILBANE, P.J., and\nTIM McCORMACK, J., CONCUR\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b610} In addition to the direct evidence of intimidation, the jury could rationally find that Sanders fled the jurisdiction with Renode, an act that showed a consciousness of guilt. *State v. Eaton*, 19 Ohio St.2d 145, 249 N.E.2d 897 (1969), paragraph six of the syllabus (\u201cFlight from justice * * * may be indicative of a consciousness of guilt.\u201d). Testimony showed that warrants were issued for the arrest of Sanders and Renode just days after the shooting. It is unclear when the two left Ohio, but Renode was forcibly apprehended six months later in Indiana.\n\n{\u00b611} Although there was no evidence that Sanders fired the shots at the victim, a rational trier of fact could find Sanders complicit in intimidating the victim; that is, that she acted with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense and she aided and abetted Renode. See R.C. 2923.03(A). Aiding and abetting can be inferred by presence, companionship, and conduct before and after the offense is committed. *State v. Johnson*, 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 245, 754 N.E.2d 796 (2001). Evidence that Sanders and Renode were together on the night the child died, along with incriminating statements both she and Renode later made, shows that Sanders would have benefitted just as much as Renode by intimidating the victim. This self-interest and companionship was sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that Sanders was complicit in committing intimidation.\n\n{\u00b612} For the same reasons, we reject Sanders\u2019s argument that the state failed to offer evidence sufficient to prove the firearm specifications attached to Counts 2 through 4 of the indictment. Those counts \u2014 felonious assault, discharge of a firearm near prohibited premises,\nand improper handling of a firearm in an automobile \u2014 were related to the intimidation count in that they pertained to conduct that occurred inside the car at the same time as the intimidation count (which did not contain a firearm specification). The culpability that Sanders had in intimidating the victim was applicable to the firearm specifications. *State v. Chapman*, 21 Ohio St.3d 41, 42-43, 487 N.E.2d 566 (1986); *State v. Rucker*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105628, 2018-Ohio-1832, \u00b6 43. The only remaining question is whether a rational trier of fact could find that Renode fired shots from the car, thus establishing the operability of the handgun. *See State v. Murphy*, 49 Ohio St.3d 206, 206, 551 N.E.2d 932 (1990), syllabus. The victim gave testimony which, when viewed most favorably to the state, established that Renode fired the gun from the moving car. The jury could rationally find Sanders was subject to a firearm specification because she aided and abetted Renode.\n\nB. Unfair Trial\n\n{\u00b613} Sanders next makes a broader argument that the court should have granted a mistrial because of repeated statements by the mother, and assertions by the state that Renode murdered the child.\n\n{\u00b614} Our discussion of Sanders\u2019s argument relating to the sufficiency of the evidence informs the present argument \u2014 because the state had to prove that the victim had been a \u201cwitness\u201d to a criminal act (that is, the child had knowledge concerning a fact or facts concerning a criminal act), it necessarily had to provide context for Sanders\u2019s belief that the victim had been a witness to a criminal act. *See State v. Skatzes*, 104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 216. The mother thus gave relevant testimony about the circumstances of her child\u2019s death.\nIt is true that the state told the jury in its opening statement that the child \u201cwas murdered in his bedroom, his throat was slashed, by Jacque Renode, by Navi Sanders\u2019[s] boyfriend,\u201d but this was irrelevant. This statement was not evidence \u2014 nothing said in an opening statement is considered evidence. *State v. Tenace*, 109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-Ohio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, \u00b6 48. What mattered was that the state prove that Sanders was complicit in intimidating a witness who had knowledge concerning a fact or facts about a criminal act. The jury could have drawn different conclusions on whether the child died as result of murder or some other criminal homicide. We thus conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by denying Sanders\u2019s motion for a mistrial.\n\nC. Jury Instructions\n\nAlthough defense counsel stated that he had no objection to the jury instructions, Sanders now claims plain error because the instructions for the offense of intimidation did not require the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the child had been murdered. Sanders also complains that the jury instruction failed to list any of the required elements of murder.\n\nWe summarily reject the argument that the jury instructions were erroneous based on our discussion in Part I(A) of this opinion. The state did not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a murder occurred; it only had to prove that Sanders subjectively believed that the victim had knowledge concerning the stabbing and that Sanders was complicit with Renode in firing shots at the victim in order to intimidate him.\n\nBecause the jury instructions were not plainly erroneous, defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to them did not deprive Sanders of her constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. *State v. Delawder*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 10CA3344, 2012-Ohio-1923, \u00b6 4 (\u201ccounsel had no duty to object to an appropriate instruction\u201d).\nII. Manifest Weight\n\n{\u00b619} Sanders asks us to independently weigh the evidence and conclude that testimony by the child\u2019s mother was completely fabricated because she testified, in seeming contradiction to the victim, that the victim claimed to have seen Sanders and Renode in the car, with a gun in Renode\u2019s hand, claiming that he would \u201ccome back and kill you and your family, your mother, as well as [the child\u2019s] * * * family.\u201d\n\n{\u00b620} Although the victim testified and denied hearing any voices coming from the car, that contradiction did not call the verdict into question. The victim plainly identified both Sanders and Renode, an identification that was credible because of his familiarity with them and interaction with them on the night the child died. This familiarity mitigated concerns about any inconsistencies in portions of the witnesses\u2019 testimony.\n\n{\u00b621} In addition to the strength of the victim\u2019s identification, other evidence made for a strong circumstantial case against Sanders. Renode and Sanders left the house at some point before the mother discovered that her son had been stabbed. When the victim later found Sanders and Renode and told them that the child was bleeding, Sanders replied that the child was not dead and that he would be \u201cokay.\u201d The jury could have viewed the affirmative nature of that statement as indicating that Sanders had some prior knowledge of what transpired with the child. Renode\u2019s rapid departure after seeing the child\u2019s condition (\u201cI have to get out of here\u201d) suggested a consciousness of guilt. By returning to the area where the stabbing occurred and shooting at the victim who had knowledge of statements made by both Sanders and Renode in connection with the stabbing, the act of firing shots at the victim could be viewed as an attempt to intimidate him into silence. Even more indicative of a consciousness of guilt was evidence that Sanders and Renode left the state as warrants were issued for their arrest in the course of the\ninvestigation into the child\u2019s death. They were arrested six months later, under circumstances in which Renode had to be apprehended with the use of force.\n\n{\u00b622} There were, as in many criminal cases, inconsistencies in how witnesses testified. It was for the jury to \u201cbelieve or disbelieve any witness or accept part of what a witness says and reject the rest.\u201d State v. Antill, 176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 197 N.E.2d 548 (1964). This is not the exceptional case where the evidence weighs heavily against conviction. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997).\n\nIII. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n{\u00b623} Sanders complains that the state engaged in misconduct by referring to the child\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder\u201d without actually proving that the child died as a result of a homicide. She also complains that the state improperly referenced facts not in evidence and vouched for the credibility of its witnesses.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nSTATE OF OHIO\n\nPLAINTIFF-APPELLEE\n\nvs.\n\nNAVI L. SANDERS\n\nDEFENDANT-APPELLANT\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nAFFIRMED\n\nCriminal Appeal from the\nCuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas\nCase No. CR-17-617652-B\n\nBEFORE: Stewart, J., Kilbane, P.J., and McCormack, J.\n\nRELEASED AND JOURNALIZED: November 15, 2018\nMELODY J. STEWART, J.:\n\n{\u00b61} A jury found defendant-appellant Navi Sanders guilty of felonious assault, discharging a firearm near a prohibited premises, improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle, and intimidation of a crime witness. The charges stemmed from the death of a 14-year-old child who was stabbed while sleeping in the same house where Sanders and her boyfriend, Jacque Renode, were staying. Just days after the stabbing, Sanders and Renode were seen in the back seat of a car moving down the same street where the stabbing occurred. Renode fired several shots from the car in the direction of a teenage victim, who had been present in the house where the stabbing occurred, and later heard Sanders and Renode make incriminating statements about the stabbing. The state theorized that Renode murdered the child, and that Sanders was complicit in intimidating the victim from assisting the police investigation. Sanders raises a number of assignments of error relating to evidence supporting the firearm specifications, the weight of evidence, the jury instructions on intimidation, prosecutorial misconduct, the assistance of trial counsel, and whether certain sentences should have merged.\nI. Intimidation of a Witness\n\n{\u00b62} The intimidation count charged Sanders with intimidating a witness to a murder. Sanders maintains that the state did not prove that the child\u2019s death was the result of murder, nor did it prove who committed the murder. She argues that because Renode had been charged with the child\u2019s murder, but had yet to be tried, the court allowed the jury to assume that Renode murdered the child. She maintains that this assumption was a failure of proof on the intimidation count and otherwise tainted her ability to receive a fair trial.\n\nA. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n{\u00b63} Count 5 of the indictment charged Sanders with intimidation in violation of R.C. 2921.04(B)(2). That section states that no person, knowingly and by force or threat of harm, \u201cshall attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder * * * [a] witness to a criminal or delinquent act by reason of the person being a witness to that act[.]\u201d In this context, a \u201cwitness\u201d means \u201cany person who has or claims to have knowledge concerning a fact or facts concerning a criminal or delinquent act, whether or not criminal or delinquent child charges are actually filed.\u201d R.C. 2921.04(E).\n\n{\u00b64} The intimidation charge did not require the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a murder occurred, much less who committed the murder. Had that been the legislature\u2019s intent, it could easily have used the words \u201ccriminal conviction\u201d or \u201cdelinquent adjudication\u201d rather than \u201ccriminal or delinquent act.\u201d The state only had to prove that the victim had knowledge about a fact or facts concerning the child\u2019s death and that Sanders knowingly and by force or threat of harm intimidated the victim because of the victim\u2019s knowledge of facts concerning the matter. As charged in the indictment, the to-wit clause referencing murder\napplied merely to describe the circumstances of the criminal act; the precise nature of the criminal act was not a separate element of proof for the offense of intimidation.\n\n{\u00b65} The evidence showed that the victim of the intimidation count, who was 13 years of age at the time, slept at the house where the stabbing occurred. He testified that after family members found the child, he personally saw the child on a bedroom floor, wrapped in a quilt and bleeding (the child had been stabbed in the neck). The child\u2019s mother told the victim to go to a local grocery store and locate her fianc\u00e9. The victim found the fianc\u00e9 with Sanders and Renode. After the victim said that the child \u201cwas bleeding\u201d and might be dead, the fianc\u00e9 and Renode started running to the house, but Sanders only walked, telling the victim that the child was \u201cnot dead, he\u2019s okay.\u201d When they returned to the house, Renode went to the bedroom, but Sanders remained outside. The child testified that Renode then came out of the bedroom \u201creally quick and said I have to get out of here * * *.\u201d\n\n{\u00b66} Trial testimony established that Sanders and Renode had previously stayed at the mother\u2019s house, but were told to move out after \u201ca bunch of altercations\u201d with her children. As she was moving out, Sanders told the mother that \u201cI\u2019ll be back and I\u2019m going to kill you and your kids.\u201d Sanders and Renode returned to the house a few weeks later, claiming that they were homeless and needed a place to stay. The mother took them in as an act of charity. Two days later, the mother became upset after discovering that Renode had given an alcoholic drink to the child. After sending the child to bed, the mother, her fianc\u00e9, Sanders, and Renode watched a movie. The mother checked on the child and found him sleeping on the floor, so she told Sanders and Renode that they could sleep in the child\u2019s bed. When the mother checked on the child two hours later, she found the child wrapped in a quilt and bleeding from a stab wound to the neck. Sanders and Renode were no longer in the house. The day after the child\u2019s death, the\nmother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 found a pair of blood-soaked pants belonging to Renode in a clothes pile in one of the bedrooms.\n\n{\u00b67} The child\u2019s mother testified that in the days following the stabbing, Renode\u2019s name was mentioned most frequently in speculation about who killed her son, given that bloody pants belonging to Renode were found in the house. Four days after the stabbing, the victim and his girlfriend were walking down the street where the stabbing occurred. They saw a car driving slowly down the street, with Renode and Sanders in the back seat. Renode, sitting behind the driver, extended a gun out the car window and fired about six times. Two bullets struck a vehicle next to where the victim was standing. The car then sped away.\n\n{\u00b68} The state offered no expert testimony on the cause of the child\u2019s death, nor did it offer any evidence in the form of police testimony regarding an investigation into the child\u2019s death. Nevertheless, the jury could reasonably infer that the child, having been stabbed in the neck and wrapped in a quilt, died as result of foul play that rose to the level of a criminal act. *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (it is \u201cthe responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts\u201d).\n\n{\u00b69} Evidence that Renode and Sanders may have been involved in the child\u2019s death provided a motive for intimidation. The victim testified that Renode and Sanders both made incriminating statements on the night of the child\u2019s death. And the discovery of Renode\u2019s bloody pants appeared to tie him to the death. These background facts put into perspective the victim\u2019s testimony that the car in which Sanders and Renode were traveling slowly down the street slowed down and that Renode fired multiple shots at him. A rational trier of fact could have found the shooting to be an act to intimidate the victim from testifying in a future criminal\nproceeding related to the child\u2019s death. *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. The facts support that the shots were intended to injure the victim and/or intimidate him. There is no evidence of any other plausible explanation for the shooting.\n\n{\u00b610} In addition to the direct evidence of intimidation, the jury could rationally find that Sanders fled the jurisdiction with Renode, an act that showed a consciousness of guilt. *State v. Eaton*, 19 Ohio St.2d 145, 249 N.E.2d 897 (1969), paragraph six of the syllabus (\u201cFlight from justice * * * may be indicative of a consciousness of guilt.\u201d). Testimony showed that warrants were issued for the arrest of Sanders and Renode just days after the shooting. It is unclear when the two left Ohio, but Renode was forcibly apprehended six months later in Indiana."}

She also complains that the state improperly referenced facts not in evidence and vouched for the credibility of its witnesses.\n\n{\u00b624} For reasons previously stated, we reject Sanders\u2019s argument that the state improperly referred to the child\u2019s death as the result of a \u201cmurder\u201d while examining witnesses. In any event, referring to the child\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder\u201d was acceptable as a euphemism for \u201cfoul play\u201d in this particular case and a fair characterization of the evidence based on unrebutted testimony that the child died after being stabbed in the neck while seemingly asleep. There was no rational basis to believe that the child died as a result of any accident, particularly when he had been wrapped in a quilt, possibly to hide his injuries.\n\n{\u00b625} Sanders\u2019s next argument references testimony by the victim\u2019s girlfriend that she saw a text message from the mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 stating that \u201cI know what happened that night.\u201d This text message came to light during trial, and, after the girlfriend had testified for the state, Sanders recalled the girlfriend as a witness. During Sanders\u2019s closing argument, defense\ncounsel referenced the girlfriend\u2019s testimony and questioned why she had not been contacted by police detectives until the eve of trial. In response to defense counsel\u2019s assertion that the police did not contact the girlfriend, the assistant prosecuting attorney stated: \u201cSo [defense counsel] says that [the girlfriend] wasn\u2019t contacted.

Nevertheless, the court sustained Sanders\u2019s objection and later instructed the jury that closing arguments were not evidence and that the jury should not speculate on why the court sustained any objection. This limited the potential for prejudice from any misconduct. State v.

STEWART, JUDGE\n\nMARY EILEEN KILBANE, P.J., and\nTIM McCORMACK, J., CONCUR\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b610} In addition to the direct evidence of intimidation, the jury could rationally find that Sanders fled the jurisdiction with Renode, an act that showed a consciousness of guilt. *State v. Eaton*, 19 Ohio St.2d 145, 249 N.E.2d 897 (1969), paragraph six of the syllabus (\u201cFlight from justice * * * may be indicative of a consciousness of guilt.\u201d). Testimony showed that warrants were issued for the arrest of Sanders and Renode just days after the shooting. It is unclear when the two left Ohio, but Renode was forcibly apprehended six months later in Indiana.\n\n{\u00b611} Although there was no evidence that Sanders fired the shots at the victim, a rational trier of fact could find Sanders complicit in intimidating the victim; that is, that she acted with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense and she aided and abetted Renode. See R.C. 2923.03(A). Aiding and abetting can be inferred by presence, companionship, and conduct before and after the offense is committed. *State v. Johnson*, 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 245, 754 N.E.2d 796 (2001). Evidence that Sanders and Renode were together on the night the child died, along with incriminating statements both she and Renode later made, shows that Sanders would have benefitted just as much as Renode by intimidating the victim. This self-interest and companionship was sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that Sanders was complicit in committing intimidation.\n\n{\u00b612} For the same reasons, we reject Sanders\u2019s argument that the state failed to offer evidence sufficient to prove the firearm specifications attached to Counts 2 through 4 of the indictment. Those counts \u2014 felonious assault, discharge of a firearm near prohibited premises,\nand improper handling of a firearm in an automobile \u2014 were related to the intimidation count in that they pertained to conduct that occurred inside the car at the same time as the intimidation count (which did not contain a firearm specification). The culpability that Sanders had in intimidating the victim was applicable to the firearm specifications. *State v. Chapman*, 21 Ohio St.3d 41, 42-43, 487 N.E.2d 566 (1986); *State v. Rucker*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105628, 2018-Ohio-1832, \u00b6 43. The only remaining question is whether a rational trier of fact could find that Renode fired shots from the car, thus establishing the operability of the handgun. *See State v. Murphy*, 49 Ohio St.3d 206, 206, 551 N.E.2d 932 (1990), syllabus. The victim gave testimony which, when viewed most favorably to the state, established that Renode fired the gun from the moving car. The jury could rationally find Sanders was subject to a firearm specification because she aided and abetted Renode.\n\nB. Unfair Trial\n\n{\u00b613} Sanders next makes a broader argument that the court should have granted a mistrial because of repeated statements by the mother, and assertions by the state that Renode murdered the child.\n\n{\u00b614} Our discussion of Sanders\u2019s argument relating to the sufficiency of the evidence informs the present argument \u2014 because the state had to prove that the victim had been a \u201cwitness\u201d to a criminal act (that is, the child had knowledge concerning a fact or facts concerning a criminal act), it necessarily had to provide context for Sanders\u2019s belief that the victim had been a witness to a criminal act. *See State v. Skatzes*, 104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 216. The mother thus gave relevant testimony about the circumstances of her child\u2019s death.\nIt is true that the state told the jury in its opening statement that the child \u201cwas murdered in his bedroom, his throat was slashed, by Jacque Renode, by Navi Sanders\u2019[s] boyfriend,\u201d but this was irrelevant. This statement was not evidence \u2014 nothing said in an opening statement is considered evidence. *State v. Tenace*, 109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-Ohio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, \u00b6 48. What mattered was that the state prove that Sanders was complicit in intimidating a witness who had knowledge concerning a fact or facts about a criminal act. The jury could have drawn different conclusions on whether the child died as result of murder or some other criminal homicide. We thus conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by denying Sanders\u2019s motion for a mistrial.\n\nC. Jury Instructions\n\nAlthough defense counsel stated that he had no objection to the jury instructions, Sanders now claims plain error because the instructions for the offense of intimidation did not require the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the child had been murdered. Sanders also complains that the jury instruction failed to list any of the required elements of murder.\n\nWe summarily reject the argument that the jury instructions were erroneous based on our discussion in Part I(A) of this opinion. The state did not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a murder occurred; it only had to prove that Sanders subjectively believed that the victim had knowledge concerning the stabbing and that Sanders was complicit with Renode in firing shots at the victim in order to intimidate him.\n\nBecause the jury instructions were not plainly erroneous, defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to them did not deprive Sanders of her constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. *State v. Delawder*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 10CA3344, 2012-Ohio-1923, \u00b6 4 (\u201ccounsel had no duty to object to an appropriate instruction\u201d).\nII. Manifest Weight\n\n{\u00b619} Sanders asks us to independently weigh the evidence and conclude that testimony by the child\u2019s mother was completely fabricated because she testified, in seeming contradiction to the victim, that the victim claimed to have seen Sanders and Renode in the car, with a gun in Renode\u2019s hand, claiming that he would \u201ccome back and kill you and your family, your mother, as well as [the child\u2019s] * * * family.\u201d\n\n{\u00b620} Although the victim testified and denied hearing any voices coming from the car, that contradiction did not call the verdict into question. The victim plainly identified both Sanders and Renode, an identification that was credible because of his familiarity with them and interaction with them on the night the child died. This familiarity mitigated concerns about any inconsistencies in portions of the witnesses\u2019 testimony.\n\n{\u00b621} In addition to the strength of the victim\u2019s identification, other evidence made for a strong circumstantial case against Sanders. Renode and Sanders left the house at some point before the mother discovered that her son had been stabbed. When the victim later found Sanders and Renode and told them that the child was bleeding, Sanders replied that the child was not dead and that he would be \u201cokay.\u201d The jury could have viewed the affirmative nature of that statement as indicating that Sanders had some prior knowledge of what transpired with the child. Renode\u2019s rapid departure after seeing the child\u2019s condition (\u201cI have to get out of here\u201d) suggested a consciousness of guilt. By returning to the area where the stabbing occurred and shooting at the victim who had knowledge of statements made by both Sanders and Renode in connection with the stabbing, the act of firing shots at the victim could be viewed as an attempt to intimidate him into silence. Even more indicative of a consciousness of guilt was evidence that Sanders and Renode left the state as warrants were issued for their arrest in the course of the\ninvestigation into the child\u2019s death. They were arrested six months later, under circumstances in which Renode had to be apprehended with the use of force.\n\n{\u00b622} There were, as in many criminal cases, inconsistencies in how witnesses testified. It was for the jury to \u201cbelieve or disbelieve any witness or accept part of what a witness says and reject the rest.\u201d State v. Antill, 176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 197 N.E.2d 548 (1964). This is not the exceptional case where the evidence weighs heavily against conviction. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997).\n\nIII. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n{\u00b623} Sanders complains that the state engaged in misconduct by referring to the child\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder\u201d without actually proving that the child died as a result of a homicide. She also complains that the state improperly referenced facts not in evidence and vouched for the credibility of its witnesses.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nSTATE OF OHIO\n\nPLAINTIFF-APPELLEE\n\nvs.\n\nNAVI L. SANDERS\n\nDEFENDANT-APPELLANT\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nAFFIRMED\n\nCriminal Appeal from the\nCuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas\nCase No. CR-17-617652-B\n\nBEFORE: Stewart, J., Kilbane, P.J., and McCormack, J.\n\nRELEASED AND JOURNALIZED: November 15, 2018\nMELODY J. STEWART, J.:\n\n{\u00b61} A jury found defendant-appellant Navi Sanders guilty of felonious assault, discharging a firearm near a prohibited premises, improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle, and intimidation of a crime witness. The charges stemmed from the death of a 14-year-old child who was stabbed while sleeping in the same house where Sanders and her boyfriend, Jacque Renode, were staying. Just days after the stabbing, Sanders and Renode were seen in the back seat of a car moving down the same street where the stabbing occurred. Renode fired several shots from the car in the direction of a teenage victim, who had been present in the house where the stabbing occurred, and later heard Sanders and Renode make incriminating statements about the stabbing. The state theorized that Renode murdered the child, and that Sanders was complicit in intimidating the victim from assisting the police investigation. Sanders raises a number of assignments of error relating to evidence supporting the firearm specifications, the weight of evidence, the jury instructions on intimidation, prosecutorial misconduct, the assistance of trial counsel, and whether certain sentences should have merged.\nI. Intimidation of a Witness\n\n{\u00b62} The intimidation count charged Sanders with intimidating a witness to a murder. Sanders maintains that the state did not prove that the child\u2019s death was the result of murder, nor did it prove who committed the murder. She argues that because Renode had been charged with the child\u2019s murder, but had yet to be tried, the court allowed the jury to assume that Renode murdered the child. She maintains that this assumption was a failure of proof on the intimidation count and otherwise tainted her ability to receive a fair trial.\n\nA. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n{\u00b63} Count 5 of the indictment charged Sanders with intimidation in violation of R.C. 2921.04(B)(2). That section states that no person, knowingly and by force or threat of harm, \u201cshall attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder * * * [a] witness to a criminal or delinquent act by reason of the person being a witness to that act[.]\u201d In this context, a \u201cwitness\u201d means \u201cany person who has or claims to have knowledge concerning a fact or facts concerning a criminal or delinquent act, whether or not criminal or delinquent child charges are actually filed.\u201d R.C. 2921.04(E).\n\n{\u00b64} The intimidation charge did not require the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a murder occurred, much less who committed the murder. Had that been the legislature\u2019s intent, it could easily have used the words \u201ccriminal conviction\u201d or \u201cdelinquent adjudication\u201d rather than \u201ccriminal or delinquent act.\u201d The state only had to prove that the victim had knowledge about a fact or facts concerning the child\u2019s death and that Sanders knowingly and by force or threat of harm intimidated the victim because of the victim\u2019s knowledge of facts concerning the matter. As charged in the indictment, the to-wit clause referencing murder\napplied merely to describe the circumstances of the criminal act; the precise nature of the criminal act was not a separate element of proof for the offense of intimidation.\n\n{\u00b65} The evidence showed that the victim of the intimidation count, who was 13 years of age at the time, slept at the house where the stabbing occurred. He testified that after family members found the child, he personally saw the child on a bedroom floor, wrapped in a quilt and bleeding (the child had been stabbed in the neck). The child\u2019s mother told the victim to go to a local grocery store and locate her fianc\u00e9. The victim found the fianc\u00e9 with Sanders and Renode. After the victim said that the child \u201cwas bleeding\u201d and might be dead, the fianc\u00e9 and Renode started running to the house, but Sanders only walked, telling the victim that the child was \u201cnot dead, he\u2019s okay.\u201d When they returned to the house, Renode went to the bedroom, but Sanders remained outside. The child testified that Renode then came out of the bedroom \u201creally quick and said I have to get out of here * * *.\u201d\n\n{\u00b66} Trial testimony established that Sanders and Renode had previously stayed at the mother\u2019s house, but were told to move out after \u201ca bunch of altercations\u201d with her children. As she was moving out, Sanders told the mother that \u201cI\u2019ll be back and I\u2019m going to kill you and your kids.\u201d Sanders and Renode returned to the house a few weeks later, claiming that they were homeless and needed a place to stay. The mother took them in as an act of charity. Two days later, the mother became upset after discovering that Renode had given an alcoholic drink to the child. After sending the child to bed, the mother, her fianc\u00e9, Sanders, and Renode watched a movie. The mother checked on the child and found him sleeping on the floor, so she told Sanders and Renode that they could sleep in the child\u2019s bed. When the mother checked on the child two hours later, she found the child wrapped in a quilt and bleeding from a stab wound to the neck. Sanders and Renode were no longer in the house. The day after the child\u2019s death, the\nmother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 found a pair of blood-soaked pants belonging to Renode in a clothes pile in one of the bedrooms.\n\n{\u00b67} The child\u2019s mother testified that in the days following the stabbing, Renode\u2019s name was mentioned most frequently in speculation about who killed her son, given that bloody pants belonging to Renode were found in the house. Four days after the stabbing, the victim and his girlfriend were walking down the street where the stabbing occurred. They saw a car driving slowly down the street, with Renode and Sanders in the back seat. Renode, sitting behind the driver, extended a gun out the car window and fired about six times. Two bullets struck a vehicle next to where the victim was standing. The car then sped away.\n\n{\u00b68} The state offered no expert testimony on the cause of the child\u2019s death, nor did it offer any evidence in the form of police testimony regarding an investigation into the child\u2019s death. Nevertheless, the jury could reasonably infer that the child, having been stabbed in the neck and wrapped in a quilt, died as result of foul play that rose to the level of a criminal act. *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (it is \u201cthe responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts\u201d).\n\n{\u00b69} Evidence that Renode and Sanders may have been involved in the child\u2019s death provided a motive for intimidation. The victim testified that Renode and Sanders both made incriminating statements on the night of the child\u2019s death. And the discovery of Renode\u2019s bloody pants appeared to tie him to the death. These background facts put into perspective the victim\u2019s testimony that the car in which Sanders and Renode were traveling slowly down the street slowed down and that Renode fired multiple shots at him. A rational trier of fact could have found the shooting to be an act to intimidate the victim from testifying in a future criminal\nproceeding related to the child\u2019s death. *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. The facts support that the shots were intended to injure the victim and/or intimidate him. There is no evidence of any other plausible explanation for the shooting.\n\n{\u00b610} In addition to the direct evidence of intimidation, the jury could rationally find that Sanders fled the jurisdiction with Renode, an act that showed a consciousness of guilt. *State v. Eaton*, 19 Ohio St.2d 145, 249 N.E.2d 897 (1969), paragraph six of the syllabus (\u201cFlight from justice * * * may be indicative of a consciousness of guilt.\u201d). Testimony showed that warrants were issued for the arrest of Sanders and Renode just days after the shooting. It is unclear when the two left Ohio, but Renode was forcibly apprehended six months later in Indiana."}
{"Index": "073-Sanders", "allegation": "The state improperly referred to the child\u2019s death as the result of a \u2018murder\u2019 while examining witnesses.", "evidence": "III. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n{\u00b623} Sanders complains that the state engaged in misconduct by referring to the child\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder\u201d without actually proving that the child died as a result of a homicide. She also complains that the state improperly referenced facts not in evidence and vouched for the credibility of its witnesses.\n\n{\u00b624} For reasons previously stated, we reject Sanders\u2019s argument that the state improperly referred to the child\u2019s death as the result of a \u201cmurder\u201d while examining witnesses. In any event, referring to the child\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder\u201d was acceptable as a euphemism for \u201cfoul play\u201d in this particular case and a fair characterization of the evidence based on unrebutted testimony that the child died after being stabbed in the neck while seemingly asleep. There was no rational basis to believe that the child died as a result of any accident, particularly when he had been wrapped in a quilt, possibly to hide his injuries.\n\n{\u00b625} Sanders\u2019s next argument references testimony by the victim\u2019s girlfriend that she saw a text message from the mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 stating that \u201cI know what happened that night.\u201d This text message came to light during trial, and, after the girlfriend had testified for the state, Sanders recalled the girlfriend as a witness. During Sanders\u2019s closing argument, defense\ncounsel referenced the girlfriend\u2019s testimony and questioned why she had not been contacted by police detectives until the eve of trial. In response to defense counsel\u2019s assertion that the police did not contact the girlfriend, the assistant prosecuting attorney stated: \u201cSo [defense counsel] says that [the girlfriend] wasn\u2019t contacted. I think you\u2019ll remember the testimony was that her mother did not want her to be a part of this. But we did find her in time for trial. Again he wants you to trust her but ignore her honest and deep-held belief that defendant was in that car.\u201d Defense counsel objected, and the court sustained the objection. Sanders now argues that the state improperly vouched for the truthfulness of its own witness.\n\n{\u00b626} \u201cIt is improper for an attorney to express his or her personal belief or opinion as to the credibility of a witness or as to the guilt of the accused.\u201d State v. Williams, 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 12, 679 N.E.2d 646 (1997). By charactering the girlfriend\u2019s belief that Sanders was in the car as \u201chonest,\u201d the state arguably expressed an opinion on her credibility. Nevertheless, the court sustained Sanders\u2019s objection and later instructed the jury that closing arguments were not evidence and that the jury should not speculate on why the court sustained any objection. This limited the potential for prejudice from any misconduct. State v. Dean, 146 Ohio St.3d 106, 2015-Ohio-4347, 54 N.E.3d 80, \u00b6 250, 253.\n\n{\u00b627} In a different part of its closing argument, the state noted that Sanders\u2019s attempt to intimidate the witnesses did not stop those witnesses from coming to court and \u201ctelling you the truth.\u201d Sanders did not object to this statement, so she forfeited all but plain error. Dean at \u00b6 237. Unlike the state\u2019s statement that the girlfriend was \u201chonest,\u201d the statement that the witnesses came to court for the purpose of \u201ctelling you the truth\u201d did not vouch for the credibility of any specific statement. There is enough difference in the semantic content of the statement that it did not vouch for the witness\u2019s credibility and rise to the level of plain error.\nIV. Allied Offenses\n\n{\u00b628} For her final assignment of error, Sanders maintains that the sentences for felonious assault, improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle, and discharge of a firearm near a prohibited premises should have merged because they all occurred simultaneously.\n\n{\u00b629} During sentencing, the court referenced all of the counts on which the jury returned a guilty verdict and stated, \u201c[i]t\u2019s my understanding that none of those counts would merge for purposes of sentencing; is that correct?\u201d The state replied, \u201cyes\u201d; defense counsel said nothing. By failing to object, Sanders forfeited all but plain error. State v. Rogers, 143 Ohio St.3d 385, 2015-Ohio-2459, 38 N.E.3d 860, \u00b6 21.\n\n{\u00b630} Even if some plain error in failing to merge the sentences occurred, an appellate court is not obligated to reverse. The application of the plain error doctrine should only be applied \u201c\u2018under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23, quoting State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978), paragraph three of the syllabus. The court imposed a total 15-year sentence on the felonious assault count, including mandatory consecutive time for three- and five-year firearm specifications. The sentences for the remaining counts were ordered to be served concurrently. The order of concurrent service means that recognition of plain error would not affect the length of Sanders\u2019s sentence. No manifest miscarriage of justice would occur if the counts were not merged.\n\n{\u00b631} Judgment affirmed.\n\nIt is ordered that appellee recover of appellant costs herein taxed.\n\nThe court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the common pleas court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n______________________________________________\nMELODY J.

The day after the child\u2019s death, the\nmother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 found a pair of blood-soaked pants belonging to Renode in a clothes pile in one of the bedrooms.\n\n{\u00b67} The child\u2019s mother testified that in the days following the stabbing, Renode\u2019s name was mentioned most frequently in speculation about who killed her son, given that bloody pants belonging to Renode were found in the house. Four days after the stabbing, the victim and his girlfriend were walking down the street where the stabbing occurred. They saw a car driving slowly down the street, with Renode and Sanders in the back seat. Renode, sitting behind the driver, extended a gun out the car window and fired about six times. Two bullets struck a vehicle next to where the victim was standing. The car then sped away.\n\n{\u00b68} The state offered no expert testimony on the cause of the child\u2019s death, nor did it offer any evidence in the form of police testimony regarding an investigation into the child\u2019s death. Nevertheless, the jury could reasonably infer that the child, having been stabbed in the neck and wrapped in a quilt, died as result of foul play that rose to the level of a criminal act. *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (it is \u201cthe responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts\u201d).\n\n{\u00b69} Evidence that Renode and Sanders may have been involved in the child\u2019s death provided a motive for intimidation. The victim testified that Renode and Sanders both made incriminating statements on the night of the child\u2019s death. And the discovery of Renode\u2019s bloody pants appeared to tie him to the death. These background facts put into perspective the victim\u2019s testimony that the car in which Sanders and Renode were traveling slowly down the street slowed down and that Renode fired multiple shots at him. A rational trier of fact could have found the shooting to be an act to intimidate the victim from testifying in a future criminal\nproceeding related to the child\u2019s death. *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. The facts support that the shots were intended to injure the victim and/or intimidate him. There is no evidence of any other plausible explanation for the shooting.\n\n{\u00b610} In addition to the direct evidence of intimidation, the jury could rationally find that Sanders fled the jurisdiction with Renode, an act that showed a consciousness of guilt. *State v. Eaton*, 19 Ohio St.2d 145, 249 N.E.2d 897 (1969), paragraph six of the syllabus (\u201cFlight from justice * * * may be indicative of a consciousness of guilt.\u201d). Testimony showed that warrants were issued for the arrest of Sanders and Renode just days after the shooting. It is unclear when the two left Ohio, but Renode was forcibly apprehended six months later in Indiana.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b610} In addition to the direct evidence of intimidation, the jury could rationally find that Sanders fled the jurisdiction with Renode, an act that showed a consciousness of guilt. *State v. Eaton*, 19 Ohio St.2d 145, 249 N.E.2d 897 (1969), paragraph six of the syllabus (\u201cFlight from justice * * * may be indicative of a consciousness of guilt.\u201d). Testimony showed that warrants were issued for the arrest of Sanders and Renode just days after the shooting. It is unclear when the two left Ohio, but Renode was forcibly apprehended six months later in Indiana.\n\n{\u00b611} Although there was no evidence that Sanders fired the shots at the victim, a rational trier of fact could find Sanders complicit in intimidating the victim; that is, that she acted with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense and she aided and abetted Renode. See R.C. 2923.03(A). Aiding and abetting can be inferred by presence, companionship, and conduct before and after the offense is committed. *State v. Johnson*, 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 245, 754 N.E.2d 796 (2001). Evidence that Sanders and Renode were together on the night the child died, along with incriminating statements both she and Renode later made, shows that Sanders would have benefitted just as much as Renode by intimidating the victim. This self-interest and companionship was sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that Sanders was complicit in committing intimidation.\n\n{\u00b612} For the same reasons, we reject Sanders\u2019s argument that the state failed to offer evidence sufficient to prove the firearm specifications attached to Counts 2 through 4 of the indictment. Those counts \u2014 felonious assault, discharge of a firearm near prohibited premises,\nand improper handling of a firearm in an automobile \u2014 were related to the intimidation count in that they pertained to conduct that occurred inside the car at the same time as the intimidation count (which did not contain a firearm specification). The culpability that Sanders had in intimidating the victim was applicable to the firearm specifications. *State v. Chapman*, 21 Ohio St.3d 41, 42-43, 487 N.E.2d 566 (1986); *State v. Rucker*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105628, 2018-Ohio-1832, \u00b6 43. The only remaining question is whether a rational trier of fact could find that Renode fired shots from the car, thus establishing the operability of the handgun. *See State v. Murphy*, 49 Ohio St.3d 206, 206, 551 N.E.2d 932 (1990), syllabus. The victim gave testimony which, when viewed most favorably to the state, established that Renode fired the gun from the moving car. The jury could rationally find Sanders was subject to a firearm specification because she aided and abetted Renode.\n\nB. Unfair Trial\n\n{\u00b613} Sanders next makes a broader argument that the court should have granted a mistrial because of repeated statements by the mother, and assertions by the state that Renode murdered the child.\n\n{\u00b614} Our discussion of Sanders\u2019s argument relating to the sufficiency of the evidence informs the present argument \u2014 because the state had to prove that the victim had been a \u201cwitness\u201d to a criminal act (that is, the child had knowledge concerning a fact or facts concerning a criminal act), it necessarily had to provide context for Sanders\u2019s belief that the victim had been a witness to a criminal act. *See State v. Skatzes*, 104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 216. The mother thus gave relevant testimony about the circumstances of her child\u2019s death.\nIt is true that the state told the jury in its opening statement that the child \u201cwas murdered in his bedroom, his throat was slashed, by Jacque Renode, by Navi Sanders\u2019[s] boyfriend,\u201d but this was irrelevant. This statement was not evidence \u2014 nothing said in an opening statement is considered evidence. *State v. Tenace*, 109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-Ohio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, \u00b6 48. What mattered was that the state prove that Sanders was complicit in intimidating a witness who had knowledge concerning a fact or facts about a criminal act. The jury could have drawn different conclusions on whether the child died as result of murder or some other criminal homicide. We thus conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by denying Sanders\u2019s motion for a mistrial.\n\nC. Jury Instructions\n\nAlthough defense counsel stated that he had no objection to the jury instructions, Sanders now claims plain error because the instructions for the offense of intimidation did not require the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the child had been murdered. Sanders also complains that the jury instruction failed to list any of the required elements of murder.\n\nWe summarily reject the argument that the jury instructions were erroneous based on our discussion in Part I(A) of this opinion. The state did not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a murder occurred; it only had to prove that Sanders subjectively believed that the victim had knowledge concerning the stabbing and that Sanders was complicit with Renode in firing shots at the victim in order to intimidate him.\n\nBecause the jury instructions were not plainly erroneous, defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to them did not deprive Sanders of her constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. *State v. Delawder*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 10CA3344, 2012-Ohio-1923, \u00b6 4 (\u201ccounsel had no duty to object to an appropriate instruction\u201d).\nII. Manifest Weight\n\n{\u00b619} Sanders asks us to independently weigh the evidence and conclude that testimony by the child\u2019s mother was completely fabricated because she testified, in seeming contradiction to the victim, that the victim claimed to have seen Sanders and Renode in the car, with a gun in Renode\u2019s hand, claiming that he would \u201ccome back and kill you and your family, your mother, as well as [the child\u2019s] * * * family.\u201d\n\n{\u00b620} Although the victim testified and denied hearing any voices coming from the car, that contradiction did not call the verdict into question. The victim plainly identified both Sanders and Renode, an identification that was credible because of his familiarity with them and interaction with them on the night the child died. This familiarity mitigated concerns about any inconsistencies in portions of the witnesses\u2019 testimony.\n\n{\u00b621} In addition to the strength of the victim\u2019s identification, other evidence made for a strong circumstantial case against Sanders. Renode and Sanders left the house at some point before the mother discovered that her son had been stabbed. When the victim later found Sanders and Renode and told them that the child was bleeding, Sanders replied that the child was not dead and that he would be \u201cokay.\u201d The jury could have viewed the affirmative nature of that statement as indicating that Sanders had some prior knowledge of what transpired with the child. Renode\u2019s rapid departure after seeing the child\u2019s condition (\u201cI have to get out of here\u201d) suggested a consciousness of guilt. By returning to the area where the stabbing occurred and shooting at the victim who had knowledge of statements made by both Sanders and Renode in connection with the stabbing, the act of firing shots at the victim could be viewed as an attempt to intimidate him into silence. Even more indicative of a consciousness of guilt was evidence that Sanders and Renode left the state as warrants were issued for their arrest in the course of the\ninvestigation into the child\u2019s death. They were arrested six months later, under circumstances in which Renode had to be apprehended with the use of force.\n\n{\u00b622} There were, as in many criminal cases, inconsistencies in how witnesses testified. It was for the jury to \u201cbelieve or disbelieve any witness or accept part of what a witness says and reject the rest.\u201d State v. Antill, 176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 197 N.E.2d 548 (1964). This is not the exceptional case where the evidence weighs heavily against conviction. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997).\n\nIII. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n{\u00b623} Sanders complains that the state engaged in misconduct by referring to the child\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder\u201d without actually proving that the child died as a result of a homicide. She also complains that the state improperly referenced facts not in evidence and vouched for the credibility of its witnesses."}

Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n{\u00b623} Sanders complains that the state engaged in misconduct by referring to the child\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder\u201d without actually proving that the child died as a result of a homicide. She also complains that the state improperly referenced facts not in evidence and vouched for the credibility of its witnesses.\n\n{\u00b624} For reasons previously stated, we reject Sanders\u2019s argument that the state improperly referred to the child\u2019s death as the result of a \u201cmurder\u201d while examining witnesses. In any event, referring to the child\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder\u201d was acceptable as a euphemism for \u201cfoul play\u201d in this particular case and a fair characterization of the evidence based on unrebutted testimony that the child died after being stabbed in the neck while seemingly asleep. There was no rational basis to believe that the child died as a result of any accident, particularly when he had been wrapped in a quilt, possibly to hide his injuries.\n\n{\u00b625} Sanders\u2019s next argument references testimony by the victim\u2019s girlfriend that she saw a text message from the mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 stating that \u201cI know what happened that night.\u201d This text message came to light during trial, and, after the girlfriend had testified for the state, Sanders recalled the girlfriend as a witness. During Sanders\u2019s closing argument, defense\ncounsel referenced the girlfriend\u2019s testimony and questioned why she had not been contacted by police detectives until the eve of trial. In response to defense counsel\u2019s assertion that the police did not contact the girlfriend, the assistant prosecuting attorney stated: \u201cSo [defense counsel] says that [the girlfriend] wasn\u2019t contacted. I think you\u2019ll remember the testimony was that her mother did not want her to be a part of this. But we did find her in time for trial. Again he wants you to trust her but ignore her honest and deep-held belief that defendant was in that car.\u201d Defense counsel objected, and the court sustained the objection. Sanders now argues that the state improperly vouched for the truthfulness of its own witness.\n\n{\u00b626} \u201cIt is improper for an attorney to express his or her personal belief or opinion as to the credibility of a witness or as to the guilt of the accused.\u201d State v. Williams, 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 12, 679 N.E.2d 646 (1997). By charactering the girlfriend\u2019s belief that Sanders was in the car as \u201chonest,\u201d the state arguably expressed an opinion on her credibility. Nevertheless, the court sustained Sanders\u2019s objection and later instructed the jury that closing arguments were not evidence and that the jury should not speculate on why the court sustained any objection. This limited the potential for prejudice from any misconduct. State v. Dean, 146 Ohio St.3d 106, 2015-Ohio-4347, 54 N.E.3d 80, \u00b6 250, 253.\n\n{\u00b627} In a different part of its closing argument, the state noted that Sanders\u2019s attempt to intimidate the witnesses did not stop those witnesses from coming to court and \u201ctelling you the truth.\u201d Sanders did not object to this statement, so she forfeited all but plain error. Dean at \u00b6 237. Unlike the state\u2019s statement that the girlfriend was \u201chonest,\u201d the statement that the witnesses came to court for the purpose of \u201ctelling you the truth\u201d did not vouch for the credibility of any specific statement. There is enough difference in the semantic content of the statement that it did not vouch for the witness\u2019s credibility and rise to the level of plain error.\nIV. Allied Offenses\n\n{\u00b628} For her final assignment of error, Sanders maintains that the sentences for felonious assault, improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle, and discharge of a firearm near a prohibited premises should have merged because they all occurred simultaneously.\n\n{\u00b629} During sentencing, the court referenced all of the counts on which the jury returned a guilty verdict and stated, \u201c[i]t\u2019s my understanding that none of those counts would merge for purposes of sentencing; is that correct?\u201d The state replied, \u201cyes\u201d; defense counsel said nothing. By failing to object, Sanders forfeited all but plain error. State v. Rogers, 143 Ohio St.3d 385, 2015-Ohio-2459, 38 N.E.3d 860, \u00b6 21.\n\n{\u00b630} Even if some plain error in failing to merge the sentences occurred, an appellate court is not obligated to reverse. The application of the plain error doctrine should only be applied \u201c\u2018under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23, quoting State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978), paragraph three of the syllabus. The court imposed a total 15-year sentence on the felonious assault count, including mandatory consecutive time for three- and five-year firearm specifications. The sentences for the remaining counts were ordered to be served concurrently. The order of concurrent service means that recognition of plain error would not affect the length of Sanders\u2019s sentence. No manifest miscarriage of justice would occur if the counts were not merged.\n\n{\u00b631} Judgment affirmed.\n\nIt is ordered that appellee recover of appellant costs herein taxed.\n\nThe court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the common pleas court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n______________________________________________\nMELODY J.

STEWART, J.:\n\n{\u00b61} A jury found defendant-appellant Navi Sanders guilty of felonious assault, discharging a firearm near a prohibited premises, improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle, and intimidation of a crime witness. The charges stemmed from the death of a 14-year-old child who was stabbed while sleeping in the same house where Sanders and her boyfriend, Jacque Renode, were staying. Just days after the stabbing, Sanders and Renode were seen in the back seat of a car moving down the same street where the stabbing occurred. Renode fired several shots from the car in the direction of a teenage victim, who had been present in the house where the stabbing occurred, and later heard Sanders and Renode make incriminating statements about the stabbing. The state theorized that Renode murdered the child, and that Sanders was complicit in intimidating the victim from assisting the police investigation. Sanders raises a number of assignments of error relating to evidence supporting the firearm specifications, the weight of evidence, the jury instructions on intimidation, prosecutorial misconduct, the assistance of trial counsel, and whether certain sentences should have merged.\nI. Intimidation of a Witness\n\n{\u00b62} The intimidation count charged Sanders with intimidating a witness to a murder. Sanders maintains that the state did not prove that the child\u2019s death was the result of murder, nor did it prove who committed the murder. She argues that because Renode had been charged with the child\u2019s murder, but had yet to be tried, the court allowed the jury to assume that Renode murdered the child. She maintains that this assumption was a failure of proof on the intimidation count and otherwise tainted her ability to receive a fair trial.\n\nA. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n{\u00b63} Count 5 of the indictment charged Sanders with intimidation in violation of R.C. 2921.04(B)(2). That section states that no person, knowingly and by force or threat of harm, \u201cshall attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder * * * [a] witness to a criminal or delinquent act by reason of the person being a witness to that act[.]\u201d In this context, a \u201cwitness\u201d means \u201cany person who has or claims to have knowledge concerning a fact or facts concerning a criminal or delinquent act, whether or not criminal or delinquent child charges are actually filed.\u201d R.C. 2921.04(E).\n\n{\u00b64} The intimidation charge did not require the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a murder occurred, much less who committed the murder. Had that been the legislature\u2019s intent, it could easily have used the words \u201ccriminal conviction\u201d or \u201cdelinquent adjudication\u201d rather than \u201ccriminal or delinquent act.\u201d The state only had to prove that the victim had knowledge about a fact or facts concerning the child\u2019s death and that Sanders knowingly and by force or threat of harm intimidated the victim because of the victim\u2019s knowledge of facts concerning the matter. As charged in the indictment, the to-wit clause referencing murder\napplied merely to describe the circumstances of the criminal act; the precise nature of the criminal act was not a separate element of proof for the offense of intimidation.\n\n{\u00b65} The evidence showed that the victim of the intimidation count, who was 13 years of age at the time, slept at the house where the stabbing occurred. He testified that after family members found the child, he personally saw the child on a bedroom floor, wrapped in a quilt and bleeding (the child had been stabbed in the neck). The child\u2019s mother told the victim to go to a local grocery store and locate her fianc\u00e9. The victim found the fianc\u00e9 with Sanders and Renode. After the victim said that the child \u201cwas bleeding\u201d and might be dead, the fianc\u00e9 and Renode started running to the house, but Sanders only walked, telling the victim that the child was \u201cnot dead, he\u2019s okay.\u201d When they returned to the house, Renode went to the bedroom, but Sanders remained outside. The child testified that Renode then came out of the bedroom \u201creally quick and said I have to get out of here * * *.\u201d\n\n{\u00b66} Trial testimony established that Sanders and Renode had previously stayed at the mother\u2019s house, but were told to move out after \u201ca bunch of altercations\u201d with her children. As she was moving out, Sanders told the mother that \u201cI\u2019ll be back and I\u2019m going to kill you and your kids.\u201d Sanders and Renode returned to the house a few weeks later, claiming that they were homeless and needed a place to stay. The mother took them in as an act of charity. Two days later, the mother became upset after discovering that Renode had given an alcoholic drink to the child. After sending the child to bed, the mother, her fianc\u00e9, Sanders, and Renode watched a movie. The mother checked on the child and found him sleeping on the floor, so she told Sanders and Renode that they could sleep in the child\u2019s bed. When the mother checked on the child two hours later, she found the child wrapped in a quilt and bleeding from a stab wound to the neck. Sanders and Renode were no longer in the house. The day after the child\u2019s death, the\nmother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 found a pair of blood-soaked pants belonging to Renode in a clothes pile in one of the bedrooms.\n\n{\u00b67} The child\u2019s mother testified that in the days following the stabbing, Renode\u2019s name was mentioned most frequently in speculation about who killed her son, given that bloody pants belonging to Renode were found in the house. Four days after the stabbing, the victim and his girlfriend were walking down the street where the stabbing occurred. They saw a car driving slowly down the street, with Renode and Sanders in the back seat. Renode, sitting behind the driver, extended a gun out the car window and fired about six times. Two bullets struck a vehicle next to where the victim was standing. The car then sped away.\n\n{\u00b68} The state offered no expert testimony on the cause of the child\u2019s death, nor did it offer any evidence in the form of police testimony regarding an investigation into the child\u2019s death. Nevertheless, the jury could reasonably infer that the child, having been stabbed in the neck and wrapped in a quilt, died as result of foul play that rose to the level of a criminal act. *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (it is \u201cthe responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts\u201d).\n\n{\u00b69} Evidence that Renode and Sanders may have been involved in the child\u2019s death provided a motive for intimidation. The victim testified that Renode and Sanders both made incriminating statements on the night of the child\u2019s death. And the discovery of Renode\u2019s bloody pants appeared to tie him to the death. These background facts put into perspective the victim\u2019s testimony that the car in which Sanders and Renode were traveling slowly down the street slowed down and that Renode fired multiple shots at him. A rational trier of fact could have found the shooting to be an act to intimidate the victim from testifying in a future criminal\nproceeding related to the child\u2019s death. *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. The facts support that the shots were intended to injure the victim and/or intimidate him. There is no evidence of any other plausible explanation for the shooting.\n\n{\u00b610} In addition to the direct evidence of intimidation, the jury could rationally find that Sanders fled the jurisdiction with Renode, an act that showed a consciousness of guilt. *State v. Eaton*, 19 Ohio St.2d 145, 249 N.E.2d 897 (1969), paragraph six of the syllabus (\u201cFlight from justice * * * may be indicative of a consciousness of guilt.\u201d). Testimony showed that warrants were issued for the arrest of Sanders and Renode just days after the shooting. It is unclear when the two left Ohio, but Renode was forcibly apprehended six months later in Indiana."}

SANDERS\n\nDEFENDANT-APPELLANT\n\nJUDGMENT:\n\nAFFIRMED\n\nCriminal Appeal from the\nCuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas\nCase No. CR-17-617652-B\n\nBEFORE: Stewart, J., Kilbane, P.J., and McCormack, J.\n\nRELEASED AND JOURNALIZED: November 15, 2018\nMELODY J. STEWART, J.:\n\n{\u00b61} A jury found defendant-appellant Navi Sanders guilty of felonious assault, discharging a firearm near a prohibited premises, improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle, and intimidation of a crime witness. The charges stemmed from the death of a 14-year-old child who was stabbed while sleeping in the same house where Sanders and her boyfriend, Jacque Renode, were staying. Just days after the stabbing, Sanders and Renode were seen in the back seat of a car moving down the same street where the stabbing occurred. Renode fired several shots from the car in the direction of a teenage victim, who had been present in the house where the stabbing occurred, and later heard Sanders and Renode make incriminating statements about the stabbing. The state theorized that Renode murdered the child, and that Sanders was complicit in intimidating the victim from assisting the police investigation. Sanders raises a number of assignments of error relating to evidence supporting the firearm specifications, the weight of evidence, the jury instructions on intimidation, prosecutorial misconduct, the assistance of trial counsel, and whether certain sentences should have merged.\nI. Intimidation of a Witness\n\n{\u00b62} The intimidation count charged Sanders with intimidating a witness to a murder. Sanders maintains that the state did not prove that the child\u2019s death was the result of murder, nor did it prove who committed the murder. She argues that because Renode had been charged with the child\u2019s murder, but had yet to be tried, the court allowed the jury to assume that Renode murdered the child. She maintains that this assumption was a failure of proof on the intimidation count and otherwise tainted her ability to receive a fair trial.\n\nA. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n{\u00b63} Count 5 of the indictment charged Sanders with intimidation in violation of R.C. 2921.04(B)(2). That section states that no person, knowingly and by force or threat of harm, \u201cshall attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder * * * [a] witness to a criminal or delinquent act by reason of the person being a witness to that act[.]\u201d In this context, a \u201cwitness\u201d means \u201cany person who has or claims to have knowledge concerning a fact or facts concerning a criminal or delinquent act, whether or not criminal or delinquent child charges are actually filed.\u201d R.C. 2921.04(E).\n\n{\u00b64} The intimidation charge did not require the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a murder occurred, much less who committed the murder. Had that been the legislature\u2019s intent, it could easily have used the words \u201ccriminal conviction\u201d or \u201cdelinquent adjudication\u201d rather than \u201ccriminal or delinquent act.\u201d The state only had to prove that the victim had knowledge about a fact or facts concerning the child\u2019s death and that Sanders knowingly and by force or threat of harm intimidated the victim because of the victim\u2019s knowledge of facts concerning the matter. As charged in the indictment, the to-wit clause referencing murder\napplied merely to describe the circumstances of the criminal act; the precise nature of the criminal act was not a separate element of proof for the offense of intimidation.\n\n{\u00b65} The evidence showed that the victim of the intimidation count, who was 13 years of age at the time, slept at the house where the stabbing occurred. He testified that after family members found the child, he personally saw the child on a bedroom floor, wrapped in a quilt and bleeding (the child had been stabbed in the neck). The child\u2019s mother told the victim to go to a local grocery store and locate her fianc\u00e9. The victim found the fianc\u00e9 with Sanders and Renode. After the victim said that the child \u201cwas bleeding\u201d and might be dead, the fianc\u00e9 and Renode started running to the house, but Sanders only walked, telling the victim that the child was \u201cnot dead, he\u2019s okay.\u201d When they returned to the house, Renode went to the bedroom, but Sanders remained outside. The child testified that Renode then came out of the bedroom \u201creally quick and said I have to get out of here * * *.\u201d\n\n{\u00b66} Trial testimony established that Sanders and Renode had previously stayed at the mother\u2019s house, but were told to move out after \u201ca bunch of altercations\u201d with her children. As she was moving out, Sanders told the mother that \u201cI\u2019ll be back and I\u2019m going to kill you and your kids.\u201d Sanders and Renode returned to the house a few weeks later, claiming that they were homeless and needed a place to stay. The mother took them in as an act of charity. Two days later, the mother became upset after discovering that Renode had given an alcoholic drink to the child. After sending the child to bed, the mother, her fianc\u00e9, Sanders, and Renode watched a movie. The mother checked on the child and found him sleeping on the floor, so she told Sanders and Renode that they could sleep in the child\u2019s bed. When the mother checked on the child two hours later, she found the child wrapped in a quilt and bleeding from a stab wound to the neck. Sanders and Renode were no longer in the house. The day after the child\u2019s death, the\nmother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 found a pair of blood-soaked pants belonging to Renode in a clothes pile in one of the bedrooms.\n\n{\u00b67} The child\u2019s mother testified that in the days following the stabbing, Renode\u2019s name was mentioned most frequently in speculation about who killed her son, given that bloody pants belonging to Renode were found in the house. Four days after the stabbing, the victim and his girlfriend were walking down the street where the stabbing occurred. They saw a car driving slowly down the street, with Renode and Sanders in the back seat. Renode, sitting behind the driver, extended a gun out the car window and fired about six times. Two bullets struck a vehicle next to where the victim was standing. The car then sped away.\n\n{\u00b68} The state offered no expert testimony on the cause of the child\u2019s death, nor did it offer any evidence in the form of police testimony regarding an investigation into the child\u2019s death. Nevertheless, the jury could reasonably infer that the child, having been stabbed in the neck and wrapped in a quilt, died as result of foul play that rose to the level of a criminal act. *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (it is \u201cthe responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts\u201d).\n\n{\u00b69} Evidence that Renode and Sanders may have been involved in the child\u2019s death provided a motive for intimidation. The victim testified that Renode and Sanders both made incriminating statements on the night of the child\u2019s death. And the discovery of Renode\u2019s bloody pants appeared to tie him to the death. These background facts put into perspective the victim\u2019s testimony that the car in which Sanders and Renode were traveling slowly down the street slowed down and that Renode fired multiple shots at him. A rational trier of fact could have found the shooting to be an act to intimidate the victim from testifying in a future criminal\nproceeding related to the child\u2019s death. *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. The facts support that the shots were intended to injure the victim and/or intimidate him. There is no evidence of any other plausible explanation for the shooting.\n\n{\u00b610} In addition to the direct evidence of intimidation, the jury could rationally find that Sanders fled the jurisdiction with Renode, an act that showed a consciousness of guilt. *State v. Eaton*, 19 Ohio St.2d 145, 249 N.E.2d 897 (1969), paragraph six of the syllabus (\u201cFlight from justice * * * may be indicative of a consciousness of guilt.\u201d). Testimony showed that warrants were issued for the arrest of Sanders and Renode just days after the shooting. It is unclear when the two left Ohio, but Renode was forcibly apprehended six months later in Indiana.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b610} In addition to the direct evidence of intimidation, the jury could rationally find that Sanders fled the jurisdiction with Renode, an act that showed a consciousness of guilt. *State v. Eaton*, 19 Ohio St.2d 145, 249 N.E.2d 897 (1969), paragraph six of the syllabus (\u201cFlight from justice * * * may be indicative of a consciousness of guilt.\u201d). Testimony showed that warrants were issued for the arrest of Sanders and Renode just days after the shooting. It is unclear when the two left Ohio, but Renode was forcibly apprehended six months later in Indiana.\n\n{\u00b611} Although there was no evidence that Sanders fired the shots at the victim, a rational trier of fact could find Sanders complicit in intimidating the victim; that is, that she acted with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense and she aided and abetted Renode. See R.C. 2923.03(A). Aiding and abetting can be inferred by presence, companionship, and conduct before and after the offense is committed. *State v. Johnson*, 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 245, 754 N.E.2d 796 (2001). Evidence that Sanders and Renode were together on the night the child died, along with incriminating statements both she and Renode later made, shows that Sanders would have benefitted just as much as Renode by intimidating the victim. This self-interest and companionship was sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that Sanders was complicit in committing intimidation.\n\n{\u00b612} For the same reasons, we reject Sanders\u2019s argument that the state failed to offer evidence sufficient to prove the firearm specifications attached to Counts 2 through 4 of the indictment. Those counts \u2014 felonious assault, discharge of a firearm near prohibited premises,\nand improper handling of a firearm in an automobile \u2014 were related to the intimidation count in that they pertained to conduct that occurred inside the car at the same time as the intimidation count (which did not contain a firearm specification). The culpability that Sanders had in intimidating the victim was applicable to the firearm specifications. *State v. Chapman*, 21 Ohio St.3d 41, 42-43, 487 N.E.2d 566 (1986); *State v. Rucker*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105628, 2018-Ohio-1832, \u00b6 43. The only remaining question is whether a rational trier of fact could find that Renode fired shots from the car, thus establishing the operability of the handgun. *See State v. Murphy*, 49 Ohio St.3d 206, 206, 551 N.E.2d 932 (1990), syllabus. The victim gave testimony which, when viewed most favorably to the state, established that Renode fired the gun from the moving car. The jury could rationally find Sanders was subject to a firearm specification because she aided and abetted Renode.\n\nB. Unfair Trial\n\n{\u00b613} Sanders next makes a broader argument that the court should have granted a mistrial because of repeated statements by the mother, and assertions by the state that Renode murdered the child.\n\n{\u00b614} Our discussion of Sanders\u2019s argument relating to the sufficiency of the evidence informs the present argument \u2014 because the state had to prove that the victim had been a \u201cwitness\u201d to a criminal act (that is, the child had knowledge concerning a fact or facts concerning a criminal act), it necessarily had to provide context for Sanders\u2019s belief that the victim had been a witness to a criminal act. *See State v. Skatzes*, 104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 216. The mother thus gave relevant testimony about the circumstances of her child\u2019s death.\nIt is true that the state told the jury in its opening statement that the child \u201cwas murdered in his bedroom, his throat was slashed, by Jacque Renode, by Navi Sanders\u2019[s] boyfriend,\u201d but this was irrelevant. This statement was not evidence \u2014 nothing said in an opening statement is considered evidence. *State v. Tenace*, 109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-Ohio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, \u00b6 48. What mattered was that the state prove that Sanders was complicit in intimidating a witness who had knowledge concerning a fact or facts about a criminal act. The jury could have drawn different conclusions on whether the child died as result of murder or some other criminal homicide. We thus conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by denying Sanders\u2019s motion for a mistrial.\n\nC. Jury Instructions\n\nAlthough defense counsel stated that he had no objection to the jury instructions, Sanders now claims plain error because the instructions for the offense of intimidation did not require the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the child had been murdered. Sanders also complains that the jury instruction failed to list any of the required elements of murder.\n\nWe summarily reject the argument that the jury instructions were erroneous based on our discussion in Part I(A) of this opinion. The state did not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a murder occurred; it only had to prove that Sanders subjectively believed that the victim had knowledge concerning the stabbing and that Sanders was complicit with Renode in firing shots at the victim in order to intimidate him.\n\nBecause the jury instructions were not plainly erroneous, defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to them did not deprive Sanders of her constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. *State v. Delawder*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 10CA3344, 2012-Ohio-1923, \u00b6 4 (\u201ccounsel had no duty to object to an appropriate instruction\u201d).\nII. Manifest Weight\n\n{\u00b619} Sanders asks us to independently weigh the evidence and conclude that testimony by the child\u2019s mother was completely fabricated because she testified, in seeming contradiction to the victim, that the victim claimed to have seen Sanders and Renode in the car, with a gun in Renode\u2019s hand, claiming that he would \u201ccome back and kill you and your family, your mother, as well as [the child\u2019s] * * * family.\u201d\n\n{\u00b620} Although the victim testified and denied hearing any voices coming from the car, that contradiction did not call the verdict into question. The victim plainly identified both Sanders and Renode, an identification that was credible because of his familiarity with them and interaction with them on the night the child died. This familiarity mitigated concerns about any inconsistencies in portions of the witnesses\u2019 testimony.\n\n{\u00b621} In addition to the strength of the victim\u2019s identification, other evidence made for a strong circumstantial case against Sanders. Renode and Sanders left the house at some point before the mother discovered that her son had been stabbed. When the victim later found Sanders and Renode and told them that the child was bleeding, Sanders replied that the child was not dead and that he would be \u201cokay.\u201d The jury could have viewed the affirmative nature of that statement as indicating that Sanders had some prior knowledge of what transpired with the child. Renode\u2019s rapid departure after seeing the child\u2019s condition (\u201cI have to get out of here\u201d) suggested a consciousness of guilt. By returning to the area where the stabbing occurred and shooting at the victim who had knowledge of statements made by both Sanders and Renode in connection with the stabbing, the act of firing shots at the victim could be viewed as an attempt to intimidate him into silence. Even more indicative of a consciousness of guilt was evidence that Sanders and Renode left the state as warrants were issued for their arrest in the course of the\ninvestigation into the child\u2019s death. They were arrested six months later, under circumstances in which Renode had to be apprehended with the use of force.\n\n{\u00b622} There were, as in many criminal cases, inconsistencies in how witnesses testified. It was for the jury to \u201cbelieve or disbelieve any witness or accept part of what a witness says and reject the rest.\u201d State v. Antill, 176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 197 N.E.2d 548 (1964). This is not the exceptional case where the evidence weighs heavily against conviction. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997).\n\nIII. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n{\u00b623} Sanders complains that the state engaged in misconduct by referring to the child\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder\u201d without actually proving that the child died as a result of a homicide. She also complains that the state improperly referenced facts not in evidence and vouched for the credibility of its witnesses.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nIII. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n{\u00b623} Sanders complains that the state engaged in misconduct by referring to the child\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder\u201d without actually proving that the child died as a result of a homicide. She also complains that the state improperly referenced facts not in evidence and vouched for the credibility of its witnesses.\n\n{\u00b624} For reasons previously stated, we reject Sanders\u2019s argument that the state improperly referred to the child\u2019s death as the result of a \u201cmurder\u201d while examining witnesses. In any event, referring to the child\u2019s death as a \u201cmurder\u201d was acceptable as a euphemism for \u201cfoul play\u201d in this particular case and a fair characterization of the evidence based on unrebutted testimony that the child died after being stabbed in the neck while seemingly asleep. There was no rational basis to believe that the child died as a result of any accident, particularly when he had been wrapped in a quilt, possibly to hide his injuries.\n\n{\u00b625} Sanders\u2019s next argument references testimony by the victim\u2019s girlfriend that she saw a text message from the mother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 stating that \u201cI know what happened that night.\u201d This text message came to light during trial, and, after the girlfriend had testified for the state, Sanders recalled the girlfriend as a witness. During Sanders\u2019s closing argument, defense\ncounsel referenced the girlfriend\u2019s testimony and questioned why she had not been contacted by police detectives until the eve of trial. In response to defense counsel\u2019s assertion that the police did not contact the girlfriend, the assistant prosecuting attorney stated: \u201cSo [defense counsel] says that [the girlfriend] wasn\u2019t contacted. I think you\u2019ll remember the testimony was that her mother did not want her to be a part of this. But we did find her in time for trial. Again he wants you to trust her but ignore her honest and deep-held belief that defendant was in that car.\u201d Defense counsel objected, and the court sustained the objection. Sanders now argues that the state improperly vouched for the truthfulness of its own witness.\n\n{\u00b626} \u201cIt is improper for an attorney to express his or her personal belief or opinion as to the credibility of a witness or as to the guilt of the accused.\u201d State v. Williams, 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 12, 679 N.E.2d 646 (1997). By charactering the girlfriend\u2019s belief that Sanders was in the car as \u201chonest,\u201d the state arguably expressed an opinion on her credibility. Nevertheless, the court sustained Sanders\u2019s objection and later instructed the jury that closing arguments were not evidence and that the jury should not speculate on why the court sustained any objection. This limited the potential for prejudice from any misconduct. State v. Dean, 146 Ohio St.3d 106, 2015-Ohio-4347, 54 N.E.3d 80, \u00b6 250, 253.\n\n{\u00b627} In a different part of its closing argument, the state noted that Sanders\u2019s attempt to intimidate the witnesses did not stop those witnesses from coming to court and \u201ctelling you the truth.\u201d Sanders did not object to this statement, so she forfeited all but plain error. Dean at \u00b6 237. Unlike the state\u2019s statement that the girlfriend was \u201chonest,\u201d the statement that the witnesses came to court for the purpose of \u201ctelling you the truth\u201d did not vouch for the credibility of any specific statement. There is enough difference in the semantic content of the statement that it did not vouch for the witness\u2019s credibility and rise to the level of plain error.\nIV. Allied Offenses\n\n{\u00b628} For her final assignment of error, Sanders maintains that the sentences for felonious assault, improper handling of a firearm in a motor vehicle, and discharge of a firearm near a prohibited premises should have merged because they all occurred simultaneously.\n\n{\u00b629} During sentencing, the court referenced all of the counts on which the jury returned a guilty verdict and stated, \u201c[i]t\u2019s my understanding that none of those counts would merge for purposes of sentencing; is that correct?\u201d The state replied, \u201cyes\u201d; defense counsel said nothing. By failing to object, Sanders forfeited all but plain error. State v. Rogers, 143 Ohio St.3d 385, 2015-Ohio-2459, 38 N.E.3d 860, \u00b6 21.\n\n{\u00b630} Even if some plain error in failing to merge the sentences occurred, an appellate court is not obligated to reverse. The application of the plain error doctrine should only be applied \u201c\u2018under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019\u201d Id. at \u00b6 23, quoting State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978), paragraph three of the syllabus. The court imposed a total 15-year sentence on the felonious assault count, including mandatory consecutive time for three- and five-year firearm specifications.

{"Index": "076-Tucker", "allegation": "The trial court erred when it denied the Defendant/Appellant\u2019s amended petition for post conviction relief under R.C. 2953.21 due to a violation of the Criminal Rule 16(B)(5) requirement to disclose \u201cAny evidence favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment.\u201d", "evidence": "MAYLE, P.J.\n\n\u00b6 1 Defendant-appellant, Robert Lee Tucker, appeals the September 27, 2017 judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas denying his petition for postconviction relief. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court judgment.\nI. Background\n\n\u00b6 2 Following a jury trial, Robert Lee Tucker was convicted of robbery, a violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(3), a third-degree felony, and obstructing official business, a violation of R.C. 2921.31(A), a second-degree misdemeanor. The trial court sentenced him to a prison term of 36 months on the robbery conviction, and 90 days on the obstructing official business conviction, to be served concurrently. We affirmed Tucker\u2019s conviction in a decision dated May 11, 2018. State v. Tucker, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-16-063, 2018-Ohio-1869.\n\n\u00b6 3 On March 15, 2017, Tucker filed a pro se petition for postconviction relief, which he amended on August 24, 2017. The trial court denied Tucker\u2019s motion on September 17, 2017. Tucker timely appealed and assigns the following error for our review:\n\nThe trial court erred when it denied the Defendant/Appellant\u2019s amended petition for post conviction relief under R.C. 2953.21 due to a violation of the Criminal Rule 16(B)(5) requirement to disclose \u201cAny evidence favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment.\u201d\n\nII. Law and Analysis\n\n\u00b6 4 While Tucker petitioned the trial court for postconviction relief on numerous issues, he raises only one issue on appeal: whether the state violated Crim.R. 16(B) when it failed to disclose exhibits, including a video depicting \u201cthe actual event giving rise to\nthe charges,\u201d later used at trial. He claims that he was unaware of the existence of the exhibits until trial commenced.\n\n\u00b6 5 Crim.R. 16(B) provides:\n\nUpon receipt of a written demand for discovery by the defendant\n\n* * *, the prosecuting attorney shall provide copies or photographs, or permit counsel for the defendant to copy or photograph, the following items related to the particular case indictment, information, or complaint, and which are material to the preparation of a defense, or are intended for use by the prosecuting attorney as evidence at the trial, or were obtained from or belong to the defendant, within the possession of, or reasonably available to the state, subject to the provisions of this rule:\n\n* * *\n\n(5) Any evidence favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment[.]\n\n\u00b6 6 Tucker acknowledges that he made no written request for discovery in the trial court, but indicates that the state provided initial discovery responses on October 14, 2016. He maintains that the state proceeded as if discovery had been requested. He also claims that the trial court treated this receipt of discovery responses as a tolling event for speedy-trial purposes, but at trial, it \u201cacted as if no request was ever made.\u201d He maintains that \u201cthe lower court cannot claim one thing at trial and the exact opposite in a subsequent judgment entry.\u201d\nThe state responds that the trial record makes clear that Tucker made the deliberate decision not to request discovery\u2014despite knowing that the video recording existed\u2014because he did not want to toll the speedy-trial clock. It also argues that Tucker\u2019s argument is barred by res judicata because it could have been raised on direct appeal.\n\nThe trial court in its judgment appears to have treated Tucker\u2019s argument concerning the non-disclosure of exhibits as a claim that new evidence had been discovered. It concluded that \u201cthe discovery of new evidence of innocence after a defendant has been tried, convicted and sentenced does not constitute a triable post-conviction claim of substantive constitutional magnitude,\u201d however, it noted that it had \u201cconsidered the argument and sees no merit in it under these facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cA trial court\u2019s decision to deny a petition for postconviction relief involves mixed questions of law and fact. We review the trial court\u2019s decision on factual issues using a manifest weight standard of review, and we review the trial court\u2019s decision on legal issues de novo.\u201d State v. Neyland, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-12-014, 2013-Ohio-3065, \u00b6 14, citing State v. Hoffner, 6th Dist. No. L-01-1281, 2002-Ohio-5201, \u00b6 6.\n\nHere, the record here is very clear that Tucker made the deliberate decision not to request discovery. The October 26, 2016 trial transcript contains the following exchange relative to this point:\nThe court: I need to address on the record, that the Court notes that the defense in this case did not request discovery. [Defense counsel], let\u2019s address this issue.\n\n[Defense counsel]: Judge, I did not request discovery in this case and I advised the State that I did not. Mr. Tucker was represented at the arraignment by [former counsel] but had indicated at that time to this Court and through [former counsel] to me that he did not want to waive any of his speedy trial rights. * * * And so I explained to him that if I were to request discovery, pursuant to case law and rule, the speedy trial time is tolled based upon a request for discovery and stays tolled until reciprocal discovery is provided. With that understanding, he had agreed that he does not want to waive that speedy trial time, therefore, is in agreement with my not requesting discovery in this case. I explained to him in full that that put us at somewhat of a disadvantage because we are flying a little bit blind. We knew the facts of the case and we had discussed it previously, but there were evidentiary issues that could present themselves that I would not have access to because I had not requested discovery. My client indicated he was comfortable with going forward on that basis.\n\nThe court: Mr. Tucker, is that correct?\n\nThe defendant: Yes, Your Honor, it is.\nThe court: And you directed your attorney not to request discovery specifically for that reason?\n\nThe defendant: Yes, Your Honor, I did.\n\nThe court: So that his failure to request discovery is not any failing on his part to represent you effectively, that is following your direction?\n\nThe defendant: That is correct, Your Honor. Yes.\n\nThe court: All right.\n\n[The state]: * * * I would note that I have a second DVD that was available for inspection, and the DVD surveillance video from the parking lot of Walmart where the defendant allegedly tried to run over J.R.\n\nThe court: All right, well this is apparently a tactical decision on the part of the defendant. * * *\n\n[Defense counsel]: Judge, I did want to put on the record just for information with regard to the tactical decision to not request discovery, Mr. Tucker and I had discussed tactically the potential for that video that the State talked about \u2013 of the parking lot \u2013 existing and us not having access to it. So we had discussed that possibility, and even with that understanding, he still was in agreement not to request discovery.\n\nThe court: Is that right, Mr. Tucker?\n\nThe defendant: Yes, Your Honor, it is.\nThe record is clear that Tucker made a conscious, tactical decision, not to request discovery and was advised by counsel of the potential consequences of that decision. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s denial of Tucker\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. We also agree with the state that this was an issue that could have been raised on direct appeal, therefore, Tucker is barred by res judicata from raising this issue now. See State v. Henson, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-11-068, 2012-Ohio-3730, \u00b6 20 (\u201cUnder res judicata a convicted defendant is barred from litigating issues that were raised or could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal from the judgment of conviction.\u201d).\n\nAccordingly, we find Tucker\u2019s sole assignment of error not well-taken.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\nTucker made the deliberate decision not to request discovery to avoid tolling the speedy-trial time, therefore, the state did not violate Crim.R. 16(B) by failing to disclose exhibits. Moreover, Tucker\u2019s claim here could have been raised on direct appeal. The trial court did not err in denying his petition for postconviction relief. We find his sole assignment of error not well-taken, and we affirm the September 27, 2017 judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas. Tucker is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal under App.R. 24.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to App.R. 27.

{"Index": "076-Williams", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT VIOLATED DUE PROCESS, EVID.R. 404(B), AND R.C. 2945.59 BY ADMITTING EVIDENCE OF PRIOR ACTS OF CHILD MOLESTATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF ARGUING THAT APPELLANT HAD A PROPENSITY TO MOLEST CHILDREN.", "evidence": "\u00b634 In the case at bar, there was overwhelming evidence, as set forth above, of Appellant\u2019s guilt. The two victims testified in detail how Appellant raped them when they were little girls, both recounted multiple specific instances and identified Appellant as their abuser. Accordingly, we find any error in admitting the testimony did not have an impact on the verdict, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the other evidence in the case established Appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nc. Prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing arguments.\n\n\u00b635 Appellant argues the prosecutor is arguing Appellant is acting in conformity with a character trait when the prosecutor remarked Appellant is attracted to young girls and is motivated to have sexual relations with them.\nAs Appellant did not object to the remarks during closing arguments, he has waived all but plain error. An error not raised in the trial court must be plain error for an appellate court to reverse. *State v. Long*, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978) at paragraph one of the syllabus; Crim.R. 52(B). To prevail under a plain error analysis, Appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different but for the error. *Id.* at paragraph two of the syllabus. Notice of plain error \u201cis to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d *Id.* at paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n\u201cA presumption always exists that the jury has followed the instructions given to it by the trial court.\u201d *Pang v. Minch*, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 187, 559 N.E.2d 1313 (1990), at paragraph four of the syllabus, *rehearing denied*, 54 Ohio St.3d 716, 562 N.E.2d 163.\n\nAs noted above, the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence could not be considered to show that Appellant had acted in conformity with a character trait. Appellant has not demonstrated that \u201cbut for\u201d this isolated statement by the prosecutor, he would not have been convicted of the crimes.\n\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of prior acts of child molestation.\n\u00b640 Appellant\u2019s sole Assignment of Error is overruled.\n\n\u00b641 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Delaware County, Ohio, is hereby affirmed.\n\nBy: Wise, John, J.\n\nBaldwin, P. J., concurs.\n\nWise, Earle, J., concurs separately\n\nJWW/br 0322\nWise, Earle, J., concurs separately.\n\n\u00b6 42 I concur in the judgment of the majority.\n\n\u00b6 43 While I find error, I find it to be harmless and specifically concur with paragraphs 33 and 34 of the majority opinion.\n\n\u00b6 44 I write separately because I find the other-acts evidence should not have been admitted.\n\n\u00b6 45 The trial court\u2019s December 19, 2019, judgment entry allowed the other-acts evidence because it found the evidence fit several of the exceptions in Evid.R. 404(B) and R.C. 2945.59.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\u00b6 46 The Supreme Court of Ohio recently reviewed the admission of other-acts evidence in two cases decided on September 22, 2020; State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, and State v. Smith, --- Ohio St.3d ---, 2020-Ohio-4441, --- N.E.3d ---. In Hartman at \u00b6 19, the court sought to \u201cclear up some of the confusion that exists regarding the use of other-acts evidence.\u201d One issue it made clear was that \u201cthe admissibility of other-acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) is a question of law.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 22. The question of \u201cwhether the evidence is offered for an impermissible purpose does not involve the exercise of discretion\u201d and is subject to review de novo. Id. If a permissible nonpropensity purpose is found, the trial court then has discretion to admit other-acts evidence. Id.\nPURPOSES FOR WHICH OTHER-ACTS EVIDENCE WERE ADMITTED\n\n\u00b6 47 The trial court considered whether the evidence supported permissible purposes pursuant to R.C. 2945.59 and Evid.R. 404(B) and found several exceptions. In its judgment entry at page 7, the trial court found:\n\nThe factual overlap between the prospective testimonies [of the witnesses] may point to a motive and intent: engaging in the sexual abuse of minors for sexual gratification. Detailed other-acts testimony here may help the jury identify [appellant] by a common scheme, plan, system, or modus operandi \u2013 a \u201cbehavioral fingerprint\u201d \u2013 aimed at the targeting, grooming, and raping of children. The testimony about prior acts of child sex abuse may cast significant doubt, too, on the possibility that any of the alleged conduct in the present matter was accidental. (Citation omitted, emphasis added.)\n\n\u00b6 48 The trial court further defined the purposes of the other-acts evidence in the instructions it gave to the jury prior to deliberation (T. at 955-956):\n\nIf you find that the evidence about other acts on the part of the Defendant is true, then you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether that evidence proves: one, the absence of a mistake or an accident on his part on the dates of the crimes at issue in this case; two, his motive or his intent on the dates of the crimes at issue in this case; three, his\nknowledge of the circumstances surrounding the crimes at issue in this case; or, four, his use of a particular method of selecting, grooming, and sexually abusing minor victims. The evidence about other acts may not be considered by you for any other purpose. (Emphasis added.)\n\nANALYSIS OF OTHER-ACTS EVIDENCE\n\n\u00b6 49 The four nonpropensity reasons for admission of the evidence given by the trial court to the jury will be discussed out of order.\n\n1. ABSENCE OF A MISTAKE OR AN ACCIDENT\n\n\u00b6 50 The trial court first instructed the jury the other-acts evidence may be used to show appellant\u2019s actions were not a mistake nor accidental. Appellant plead not guilty making a general denial of all allegations. He did not testify, nor did the police testify as to statements made by appellant. The record does not reflect any indication he ever claimed mistake or accident. Additionally, the state made no argument that appellant raised a defense claiming the acts were accidental.\n\n\u00b6 51 In Smith, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed lack of mistake evidence. In Smith, the defendant was charged in 2016 with rape, gross sexual imposition and disseminating matter harmful to a juvenile. The victim was his granddaughter. The allegations were he rubbed oil on her body under her clothes on her chest, buttock and vagina then licked her breast and vagina. He played a pornographic film showing oral and vaginal intercourse. The next morning he pressed his penis into her backside and began to remove her underwear; she moved away and he stop. He denied any of this was for sexual purposes. He admitted that he rubbed lotion on the child\u2019s body, but any\ninappropriate touching of private parts was accidental. He claimed that if his penis did touch her it was accidental because he tends to get erections in his sleep. He further claimed an R-rated movie accidentally began to play for a few seconds when he attempted to play a cartoon on a DVD. The state sought to admit other-acts evidence from a 1986 allegation that he did similar things to one of his daughters. The Smith court held the prior testimony was admissible to rebut the defendant\u2019s claim that his 2016 acts were accidental, inadvertent or a mistake.\n\n\u00b6 52 In the instant case there is no such claim by appellant. In Hartman, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio at \u00b6 27 stated, \u201cit is not enough to say the evidence is relevant to a nonpropensity purpose. The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a \u2018material\u2019 issue that is actually in dispute....\u201d\n\n\u00b6 53 Because there is no claim of mistake or accident before the jury, there is nothing for the prosecution to rebut on this issue. I find the evidence may not be admitted for a legitimate purpose under this exception to the rule.\n\n3. KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE CRIMES\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6 52 In the instant case there is no such claim by appellant. In Hartman, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio at \u00b6 27 stated, \u201cit is not enough to say the evidence is relevant to a nonpropensity purpose. The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a \u2018material\u2019 issue that is actually in dispute....\u201d\n\n\u00b6 53 Because there is no claim of mistake or accident before the jury, there is nothing for the prosecution to rebut on this issue. I find the evidence may not be admitted for a legitimate purpose under this exception to the rule.\n\n3. KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE CRIMES\n\n\u00b6 54 This purpose was not addressed in the trial court\u2019s judgment entry. It is unclear from the record exactly what nonpropensity purpose, \u201chis knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the crimes,\u201d refers to in this case. Typically, this type of other-acts evidence is admitted to show a defendant\u2019s awareness, such as knowledge that he possessed contraband or his awareness of illegal activity. I find under the facts of this case, this is not a permissible purpose to admit other-acts evidence.\n\nPURPOSES 2. AND 4.\n\u00b6 55 The next two purposes are the focus of the case as highlighted by the prosecutors\u2019 statements to the jury.\n\n\u00b6 56 In closing argument, the state told the jury: \u201cSo for our purposes, we\u2019re asking that you consider this evidence of other acts on the issues of motive and method. Specifically, his motive and his intent to engage in sexual conduct with minor girls and his method of selecting, grooming, and sexually abusing these minor girls.\u201d T. at 908. Later in rebuttal, the state again argued to the jury how it should use this evidence. \u201cSo yes, of course you can consider [L.C.\u2019s] testimony for those purposes that we discussed in our first closing which was to show method and to show motivation that Ron Williams is attracted to underage girls.\u201d T. at 944.\n\n4. USE OF A PARTICULAR METHOD OF SELECTING, GROOMING, AND SEXUALLY ABUSING MINOR VICTIMS\n\n\u00b6 57 The state sought to use the other-acts evidence to show appellant used a particular method of selecting, grooming and abusing his victims. In its judgment entry, the trial court found the other-acts evidence may be helpful to the jury to identify appellant by this common scheme or plan, modus operandi or behavioral fingerprint.\n\n\u00b6 58 This type of other acts evidence is a permissible purpose if the identity of the actor is an issue in actual dispute. \u201c[Modus operandi] is evidence of signature, fingerprint-like characteristics unique enough \u2018to show that the crimes were committed by the same person.\u2019 Evidence of modus operandi is relevant to prove identity.\u201d Hartman, supra, at \u00b6 37. (Citations omitted.)\n\n\u00b6 59 In the instant case there is no question as to who may have done the acts. Both victims were clear the actor was appellant. The only question before the jury was whether the acts occurred. I find the other-acts evidence to prove identity by showing\nmodus operandi or a behavioral fingerprint is not permissible because identity is not in dispute.\n\n\u00b6 60 In State v. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 330 N.E.2d 720 (1975), the Supreme Court of Ohio discussed the two factual situations where the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan or system pursuant to R.C. 2945.59 is relevant. One is identity, which as discussed above is not at issue here. The other, as cited in Curry at 73 is when:\n\n[T]he \u201cother acts\u201d form part of the immediate background of the alleged act which forms the foundation of the crime charged in the indictment.\n\n***\n\nTo be admissible pursuant to this sub-category of \u2018scheme, plan or system\u2019 evidence, the \u2018other acts\u2019 testimony must concern events which are inextricably related to the alleged criminal act. The July 8, 1972, incident and the December 22, 1972, incident are not so related; they are chronologically and factually separate occurrences.\n\n\u00b6 61 The Hartman court at \u00b6 13 cited Curry to re-emphasize the connection of the other-acts evidence to the current crime:\n\nCommon-plan evidence generally concerns events that are \u201cinextricably related\u2019 to the crime charged. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d at 73. The other acts form the \u201cimmediate background\u201d of the present crime: they are typically either part of the \u201csame transaction\u201d as the crime for which the defendant is\non trial or they are part of \u201ca sequence of events\u201d leading up to the commission of the crime in question.\n\n\u00b6 62 In Curry there was a five to six-month gap between the charged acts and the other-acts. In our current case there is a at least a seventeen-year gap between the \u201cchronological and factually separate\u201d other-acts and the current charges. I find the other-acts evidence is not admissible pursuant to a common scheme, plan or system exception.\n\n2. MOTIVE OR INTENT\n\n\u00b6 63 Motive and intent can be distinct issues. In Hartman at \u00b6 48, motive is described as a specific reason for committing a crime. If a person commits a murder to cover up a previous crime, the other-acts evidence of the previous crime may tend to prove the motive for the murder, a permissible nonpropensity purpose. Id. Motive is not typically an element of a criminal offense. Intent is normally an element. Did a person act with the purpose to cause a certain result which culminated in a criminal offense? In the murder example, the motive may be to want a person dead; the intent is the mental purpose to do the act to cause the death (to pull the trigger of a gun). In this case, the trial court and the arguments of the prosecutor appear to treat the terms as one. The evidence was admitted to show appellant\u2019s intent was to derive sexual gratification from the acts alleged in the charge of gross sexual imposition.\n\n\u00b6 64 Generally, intent is \u201cnot a material issue for other-acts purposes unless it is genuinely disputed \u2013 in most cases, \u2018the act speaks for itself.\u2019 \u201d Hartman at \u00b6 55. However, when the crime charged is one of specific intent, such intent is a material issue in the case. Id. The crime of gross sexual imposition requires the state prove appellant had the\nspecific intent to perform the act(s) for the sexual gratification of himself or another. This is a potential proper purpose for other-acts evidence to be considered. However, based upon the facts of this case, a more thorough examination of the purpose is warranted.\n\n\u00b6 65 The decision on whether to allow other-acts evidence on the single count of gross sexual imposition should not be considered in a vacuum. Appellant faced sixteen counts of rape as well. The testimony relating to these counts was replete with explicit accounts of sexual conduct that left no question as to appellant\u2019s intent. A single jury heard all of the testimony from both victims. There is certainly an argument, in light of the extensive testimony in the rape counts, that the element of sexual gratification in gross sexual imposition is not in actual dispute.\n\n\u00b6 66 Assuming arguendo, the permissible purpose to show intent by way of the other-acts evidence is justified, in my view the Evid.R. 403 balancing test is still a bar to this evidence. The Hartman court at \u00b6 32 advised courts to, \u201cconsider whether the prosecution is able to present alternative evidence to prove the same fact through less prejudicial means\u2026\u201d In this case, the attendant sixteen counts of rape provided the jury with extensive and overwhelming evidence to find intent. This other-acts evidence is certainly probative of intent. However, it does not show anything about appellant\u2019s intent not already shown by the extensive testimony in the current charges. I find the probative value of the other-acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Therefore, I would prohibit the admission of the other-acts evidence based upon the Evid.R. 403 balancing test.\n\u00b6 67 However, as indicated above, I find the error to admit the other-acts evidence to be harmless, and I join in the judgment of the majority in affirming the conviction of appellant.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nSTATE OF OHIO\n\nPlaintiff-Appellee\n\n- vs -\n\nRONALD M.

Plaintiff-Appellee is the State of Ohio. The relevant facts leading to this appeal are as follows.\n\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\nOn May 31, 2019, Appellant was indicted on six counts of Rape involving a child under the age of thirteen years old in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), all felonies in the first degree. Counts one and two alleged Appellant knew the victim was under ten years old. All six allegations were against the same victim, ZS.\n\nOn July 25, 2019, the State filed a new indictment which included the original six counts of Rape against ZS, and added ten counts of Rape and one count of Gross Sexual Imposition against AW.\n\nOn October 3, 2019, Appellant filed a Motion to Exclude any Evidence of Other Acts, Crimes or Wrongs seeking to prohibit Appellee from presenting evidence of other alleged misconduct involving criminal convictions, alleged conduct, or other investigations.\n\nOn December 19, 2019, the trial court denied Appellant\u2019s Motion to Exclude any Evidence of Other Acts, Crimes or Wrongs.\n\nOn January 21, 2020, Appellant\u2019s jury trial began.\n\nAt trial, ZS testified she was born in September of 1999. When she was nine years old, she moved in with her mother, where she met Appellant. Approximately three\nweeks after moving in, ZS was forced to perform oral sex on Appellant. While still nine years old, ZS went to live with Appellant at his house, where she first met Appellant\u2019s wife, Grace Williams. ZS lived at Appellant\u2019s house with Appellant, Grace, and ZS\u2019s sister, AW.\n\n\u00b68 While living at Appellant\u2019s house, ZS testified she was not allowed to have friends over or go outside. She said that Appellant always bathed her and her sister even though ZS could wash herself. ZS lived at the house on and off until she was eleven years old. ZS testified that while still nine years old and living with Appellant, she went to Appellant\u2019s room looking for AW. Grace and AW were asleep, and Appellant was awake, watching television. Appellant told ZS to take her underwear off, he then put lotion on his penis and penetrated her vagina. Appellant did not ejaculate in her, he would always use a napkin.\n\n\u00b69 Appellant then recalled several more instances of sexual abuse and said she was abused more times than she could count.\n\n\u00b610 AW also testified at trial. AW testified she was born in 2003 to the same mother as ZS. When AW was about six years old, she moved in with Appellant and Grace, Appellant\u2019s girlfriend. Starting when AW was six years old, Appellant made AW perform oral sex on him. She stated this happened routinely when Grace left the house until she was twelve years old.\n\n\u00b611 When AW was twelve and living with Appellant, Appellant penetrated AW\u2019s vagina with his finger and his penis. Appellant and AW continued to have vaginal intercourse regularly for the next three years. Appellant engaged in anal intercourse with\nAW when she was thirteen years old. Appellant never ejaculated in her; he always used a napkin.\n\n{\u00b612} EB lived with Appellant, Appellant\u2019s girlfriend Shirley, and Shirley\u2019s two kids, LC and ML, for several years starting around 1987. EB testified Appellant would bathe LC and ML. She often saw Appellant fondling and pinching LC\u2019s breasts. EB testified that after Shirley would leave for work in the morning, Appellant would routinely get LC and ML out of bed and take them to his bedroom. EB testified she could hear moaning, growling, and the bed moving coming from Appellant\u2019s bedroom.\n\n{\u00b613} LC then testified that Appellant began molesting her around age seven. The first time LC\u2019s mother, Shirley, was entertaining guests, and Appellant asked LC to come to his room. Appellant then closed the door. Appellant asked if LC loved him and then felt her all over under her dress. Appellant said if she was a good girl, they could do it again.\n\n{\u00b614} LC testified that the molestation progressed from there. Appellant made her watch pornography and then act out what was on screen. When LC was eight years old, Appellant had vaginal intercourse with her. This continued to age twelve. Appellant never ejaculated inside her. He always used a napkin or towel.\n\n{\u00b615} At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, Appellant moved to have the charges dismissed on a Crim.R. 29 motion. The trial court acquitted Appellant of Gross Sexual Imposition.\n\n{\u00b616} On January 27, 2020, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the remaining sixteen counts of Rape and found all of the force and age allegations to be true.\nAppellant waived a jury trial on the sexually violent predator specifications and a separate hearing was held to address the specifications. On January 30, 2020, at the hearing, the trial court took judicial notice of all the evidence presented at trial and the parties presented arguments.\n\nOn February 18, 2020, the trial court imposed life without parole on each of the eleven counts of rape of a minor, all to be served concurrently. The court imposed ten-years-to-life on each of the five counts of forcible rape, all to be served consecutively. The court granted Appellant 216 days of jail credit, imposed five years of mandatory post-release control, and provided Appellant with notice of his registration as a Tier III sex offender.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n\nOn March 12, 2020, Appellant filed a notice of appeal raising the following Assignment of Error:\n\n\"I. THE TRIAL COURT VIOLATED DUE PROCESS, EVID.R. 404(B), AND R.C. 2945.59 BY ADMITTING EVIDENCE OF PRIOR ACTS OF CHILD MOLESTATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF ARGUING THAT APPELLANT HAD A PROPENSITY TO MOLEST CHILDREN.\n\nI.\n\nAppellant, in his sole assignment of error, argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of prior acts of child molestation. We disagree.\n\na. Standard of Review\n\n\"Ordinarily, a trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence in any particular case, so long as such discretion is exercised\nin line with the rules of procedure and evidence.\u201d *Rigby v. Lake City*, 58 Ohio St.3d 269, 271 (1991). The appellate court must limit its review of the trial court\u2019s admission or exclusion of evidence to whether the trial court abused its discretion. *Id.* The abuse of discretion standard is more than an error of judgment; it implies the court ruled arbitrarily, unreasonably, or unconscionably. *Blakemore v. Blakemore*, 5 Ohio St.3d 217 (1983). Generally, all relevant evidence is admissible. Evid.R. 402.\n\n**b. Admissibility of EB\u2019s and LC\u2019s Testimony**\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n**b. Admissibility of EB\u2019s and LC\u2019s Testimony**\n\n{\u00b623} Evid.R. 404(B) provides:\n\n(B) Other crimes, wrongs or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\n\n{\u00b624} R.C. 2945.59 provides:\n\nIn any criminal case in which the defendant\u2019s motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\nRule 404(B) of the Ohio Rules of Evidence and R.C. 2945.59 preclude admission of other acts evidence to prove a character trait in order to demonstrate conduct in conformity with that trait. *State v. Williams*, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, \u00b616. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts of an accused tending to show the plan with which an act is done may be admissible for other purposes, such as those listed in Evid.R. 404(B); to show \u201cproof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d\n\nIn considering other acts evidence, trial courts should conduct a three-step analysis. The first step is to consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Evid.R. 401. Next, the trial court must consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in conformity with the character or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B), proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident. Finally, a trial court is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Evid.R. 403, *Williams*, at \u00b6\u00b619-20.\n\n\u201cBecause R.C. 2945.59 and Evid.R. 404(B) codify an exception to the common law with respect to evidence of other acts of wrongdoing, they must be construed against admissibility, and the standard for determining admissibility of such evidence is strict.\u201d *State v. Broom*, 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 281-82, 533 N.E.2d 682 (1988).\nAs cautioned by the Ohio Supreme Court in *State v. Lowe*, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 634 N.E.2d 616 (1994), \u201c\u2026we therefore must be careful\u2026to recognize the distinction between evidence which shows that a defendant is the type of person who might commit a particular crime and evidence which shows that a defendant is the person who committed a particular crime.\u201d *Id.* at 530. Evidence to prove the character of person the defendant is to show he acted in conformity therewith is barred by Evid.R. 404(B).\n\n{\u00b628} We must first determine whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact of consequence to determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. In *Williams*, the Ohio Supreme Court found testimony of prior acts describing grooming techniques were relevant to show the defendant\u2019s intent was sexual gratification. *Williams*, supra, \u00b622. Gross Sexual Imposition, with which the defendant was charged, requires \u201csexual contact.\u201d R.C. 2907.05(A)(1). R.C. 2907.01 defines \u201csexual contact\u201d to require the touching be for the purpose of \u201csexual arousing or gratifying either person.\u201d In the instant case, Appellant was charged with both Rape and Gross Sexual Imposition, making intent of sexual gratification an element which the State must prove.\n\n{\u00b629} The second step is to consider whether the evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show conformity therewith, or whether the acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose.\n\n{\u00b630} In the case *sub judice*, Appellee was permitted to introduce the testimony of another child Appellant raped in similar fashion to that of ZS and AW, raping young female children living in the same home as Appellant when other adults were not around. In its Judgment Entry dated December 19, 2019, the trial court stated, \u201cthe sought-after\ntestimony is relevant because it may tend to prove what the prosecution alleges was the defendant\u2019s motive and intent: to derive sexual gratification from groping and raping children.\u201d We find the legitimate purpose of proving Appellant\u2019s intent to derive sexual gratification from groping and raping children relevant for the charge of Gross Sexual Imposition.\n\n{\u00b631} The final step is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. In the case sub judice, the trial court gave a limiting instruction before the testimony, after the testimony, and at the close of trial, that the evidence may not be considered as character evidence and that Appellant acted in accordance with any such character trait. In Williams, the Ohio Supreme Court allowed the testimony because:\n\nThe evidence is not unduly prejudicial, because the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence could not be considered to show that Williams had acted in conformity with a character trait. This instruction lessened the prejudicial effect of A.B.\u2019s testimony, and A.B. corroborated J.H.\u2019s testimony about the sexual abuse, which had been denied by Williams. Thus Evid.R. 404(B) permitted admission of evidence of William\u2019s prior crime because it helped to prove motive, preparation, and plan on the part of Williams. The prejudicial effect did not substantially outweigh the probative value of that evidence.134 Ohio St.3d 521, \u00b624.\n\n{\u00b632} In the case sub judice, the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence could not be considered to show that Appellant had acted in conformity with a character trait. The testimony tended to show Appellant\u2019s motive to show sexual gratification for\ngroping and raping children. The prejudicial effect did not outweigh the probative value of that evidence.\n\n\u00b633 Moreover, assuming, arguendo, the trial court erred in admitting testimony from LC and EB, we find any error was harmless. Crim.R. 52(A) defines harmless error as \u201c[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\u201d Before constitutional error can be considered harmless, we must be able to \u201cdeclare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Where no reasonable possibility exists that the unlawful testimony contributed to a conviction, the error is harmless and therefore will not be grounds for reversal. State v. Lytle, 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 358 N.E.2d 623 (1976), paragraph three of the syllabus, vacated on other grounds in Lytle v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 910, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1978).\n\n\u00b634 In the case at bar, there was overwhelming evidence, as set forth above, of Appellant\u2019s guilt. The two victims testified in detail how Appellant raped them when they were little girls, both recounted multiple specific instances and identified Appellant as their abuser. Accordingly, we find any error in admitting the testimony did not have an impact on the verdict, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the other evidence in the case established Appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nc. Prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing arguments."}
{"Index": "077-Breneman", "allegation": "The trial court erred in failing to grant him a new trial due to the prosecutor\u2019s informing the jury of Breneman\u2019s three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions during opening statements.", "evidence": "\u00b6 44 During closing argument, the prosecutor stated that, as part of the theft of drug offense, the State had to prove that Breneman had a prior conviction of a felony drug abuse offense. The prosecutor told that jury that the parties had stipulated to that. The prosecutor did not mention Breneman\u2019s specific criminal history.\n\n\u00b6 45 The court subsequently provided instructions to the jury. It told the jury that opening statements and closing statements were not evidence and were designed to assist the jury in evaluating the evidence. In a section entitled \u201cUse of Prior Conviction \u2013 Enhancing the Degree of Offense,\u201d the court stated:\n\nEvidence was received that the Defendant has been convicted of a felony drug abuse offense. That evidence was received because a prior conviction is an element of the offense charged. It was not received, and you may not consider it, to prove the character of the Defendant in order to\nshow that he acted in conformity with the character.\n\n\u00b6 46 On appeal, Breneman claims that the trial court should have ordered a new trial due to the prosecutor\u2019s prejudicial opening statement. He claims that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to his three prior convictions precluded him from receiving a fair trial. The State counters that Breneman\u2019s argument is barred by the invited error doctrine, and that Breneman did not timely object to the prosecutor\u2019s mentioning of the three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions. We conclude that Breneman invited the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the three prior drug offenses in his opening statement. Moreover, with the unique record before us, we further conclude that Breneman was not prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s isolated reference to Breneman\u2019s three prior drug convictions, and no new trial was warranted.\n\n\u00b6 47 The indictment for Count 1, alleging theft of drugs as a felony of the third degree, include allegations that Breneman was previously convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony drug abuse offense, and it listed the 2014 conviction for possession of heroin, the 2011 conviction for possession of cocaine, and the 2002 conviction for trafficking in cocaine. The parties\u2019 pretrial stipulation agreed that Breneman had been convicted of those three offenses. The prosecutor\u2019s opening statement conformed to the parties\u2019 stipulation; it did not add any details about those offenses or mention any other prior offenses.\n\n\u00b6 48 Under the doctrine of invited error, \u201c[a] party will not be permitted to take advantage of an error [that] he himself invited or induced.\u201d (Citations omitted.) State v. Fair, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24388, 2011-Ohio-4454, \u00b6 69. Defense counsel agreed to a stipulation, prior to trial, that Breneman had been convicted of the three drug offenses\nreferenced in Count I of the indictment. The prosecutor cannot be faulted for relying on that stipulation in his opening statement, and Breneman cannot now complain about the prosecutor\u2019s informing the jury of those convictions in the State\u2019s opening statement.\n\n\u00b6 49 Moreover, under the facts of this case, any prejudice that resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s single reference to Breneman\u2019s three specific prior convictions was diminished by court\u2019s jury instructions and the nature of the charges at trial. First, the jury was told, immediately after the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, that evidence of Breneman\u2019s prior convictions was permitted because a prior conviction was an element of the offense of theft of drugs in Count One, but \u201c[t]hat evidence was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the Defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity or in accordance with that character.\u201d The court repeated that instruction at the conclusion of the trial. The court also twice instructed the jury that opening statements were not evidence. We presume that the jury followed the trial court\u2019s instructions. State v. Keeton, 2d Dist. Darke No. 2019-CA-8, 2020-Ohio-950, \u00b6 24, citing State v. Jones, 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 414, 739 N.E.2d 300 (2000) (\u201cWe presume that juries follow the instructions provided to them.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 50 Second, as part of the trial, the jury properly heard that Breneman had a prior felony drug abuse offense conviction and that he had previously served a prison sentence, for which he was on post-release control. The parties stipulated that Breneman had a prior felony drug abuse offense, and that stipulation was read to the jury. Although the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement provided the specific offense, date and case number for three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions, the prosecutor did not inform the jury of the factual circumstances underlying those offenses or discuss any\nother aspect of Breneman\u2019s criminal history.\n\n\u00b6 51 Upon review of the trial transcript, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement prejudicially affected Breneman\u2019s substantial rights, resulting in an unfair trial. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant Breneman a new trial.\n\n\u00b6 52 Breneman\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\nIII. Due Process / Sleeping Juror\n\n\u00b6 53 In his second assignment of error, Breneman claims that he was denied his right to due process when the trial court allowed a sleeping juror to remain on the jury panel.\n\n\u00b6 54 On the second day of trial, before resuming after a 10:00 a.m. recess, the prosecutor informed the trial court that Parole Officer Deskins, the State\u2019s representative, had noticed that Juror No. 10 \u201cappeared to be having difficulty keeping his eyes open.\u201d The prosecutor stated that he (the prosecutor) \u201clooked over and observed Juror 10 and his eyes were closed. It was only for a few moments, and he looked up and his eyes opened and his head came up. But his eyes were closed for a few moments, and I felt that I needed to bring it to the Court\u2019s attention.\u201d (Tr. at 388.)\n\n\u00b6 55 The court responded that it \u201chad taken a look at Juror No. 10 as well, and I never thought he was \u2018sleeping.\u2019 Some jurors will tend to listen to evidence without taking notes as if they\u2019re listening to music. But I will seek to keep a closer eye as well.\u201d (Id. at 388-389.) The court asked the prosecutor if he wanted the court to take any action. The prosecutor responded, \u201cNo. I just wanted to bring it to your attention.\u201d (Id. at 389.) Defense counsel stated that he had \u201cno comment.\u201d (Id.)\nLater that day, the court provided the jury an opportunity to stretch and asked the bailiff to turn on the air conditioning. The court told the prosecutor and defense counsel at sidebar that \u201c[i]t would appear that a couple the jurors were needing an opportunity to stretch.\u201d (Tr. at 456.) The court did not identify any particular juror or jurors.\n\n\u201cAn objection to a sleeping juror must be made at trial because the trial court has significant discretion in how it resolves an incident with a sleeping juror.\u201d See State v. Jones, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2013-CA-63, 2014-Ohio-1540, \u00b6 11. \u201c[I]f a sleeping juror has not missed \u2018large or critical portions\u2019 of the proceedings, no prejudice results from that juror\u2019s remaining on the jury.\u201d State v. Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, \u00b6 112, citing State v. Sanders, 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 253, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001).\n\nHere, the record does not substantiate that Breneman\u2019s due process rights were violated. First, we note that defense counsel did not ask the trial court to take any particular action with respect to the alleged sleeping juror, nor did defense counsel object to the juror\u2019s remaining on the panel. Moreover, after the prosecutor brought the juror to the court\u2019s attention, the court commented that it did not believe that the juror had been asleep. The prosecutor\u2019s statement also indicated that the juror\u2019s eyes had been closed \u201conly for a few moments.\u201d The record thus does not substantiate that the juror was, in fact, sleeping or that the juror missed \u201clarge or critical portions\u201d of the trial.\n\nBreneman\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.\nTUCKER, P.J. and HALL, J., concur.\n\nCopies sent to:\n\nSamantha B. Whetherholt\nThomas M. Kollin\nHon. Nick A. Selvaggio\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nBreneman\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\nII. Motion for New Trial/ Opening Statements\n\nIn his first assignment of error, Breneman claims that the trial court erred in failing to grant him a new trial due to the prosecutor\u2019s informing the jury of Breneman\u2019s\nthree prior felony drug abuse offense convictions during opening statements.\u00b9\n\n\u00b6 34 On August 8, 2019, prior to trial, the parties filed three written stipulations signed by the prosecutor and defense counsel. The first concerned the title for the 1995 Toyota Corolla at issue, the second concerned Breneman\u2019s criminal history, and the third concerned the prescription medication prescribed for Breneman\u2019s mother. In the criminal history stipulation, the parties agreed and stipulated that Breneman was previously convicted of or plead guilty to the following felony drug abuse offenses:\n\n1. Possession of Heroin in violation of section 2925.11 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on July 21, 2014 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2014 CR 121.\n\n2. Possession of Cocaine in violation of section 2925.11 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on July 21, 2011 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2010 CR 103.\n\n3. Trafficking in Cocaine in violation of section 2925.03 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on April 30, 2002 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2002 CR 004.\n\n\u00b6 35 Trial began on August 12. That morning, before jury selection, the\n\n\u00b9 Breneman\u2019s sentencing occurred the day after the trial ended, and the trial court filed its written judgment entry of conviction on the same day. Breneman\u2019s counsel filed a written motion for a new trial after the trial court filed its judgment entry of conviction. The court ruled on that motion after Breneman filed his notice of appeal of his conviction. The court\u2019s decision denying the motion for a new trial is not before us. However, Breneman repeatedly claimed at trial and sentencing that he was denied a fair trial due to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement. We will construe his assignment of error as claiming that the prosecutor\u2019s alleged misconduct violated his due process rights and that the court should have ordered a new trial.\nprosecutor and defense counsel gave opening statements to the prospective jurors. During the State\u2019s opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that Breneman was released from prison on September 17, 2018, and that he committed the offense of escape by failing to report to his parole officer and moving without notifying his parole officer. The prosecutor further indicated that the parole officers nevertheless \u201cwere learning that he [Breneman] was getting into some trouble.\u201d (Tr. at 21.) The prosecutor continued:\n\nThey heard of how the Defendant, who was previously convicted of felony drug abuse offenses of trafficking in cocaine in 2002, possession of cocaine in 2010, and possession of heroin in 2014 \u2013 They learned how this Defendant had stolen his mother\u2019s prescription pain medication. * * *\n\nThe parole officers also learned about how this Defendant took possession of a 1995 Toyota Corolla that didn\u2019t belong to him, and he sold the car without the permission of the owner. * * *\n\n(Tr. at 21-22.)\n\n\u00b6 36 After the prosecutor completed his opening statement, the court, sua sponte, gave the jury the following instruction:\n\nLadies and gentleman, from the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, we\u2019ve learned that evidence may be received that the Defendant has been previously convicted of certain criminal offenses.\n\nThe Court is instructing you that that evidence may be received because a prior conviction is an element of the offense of theft of drugs in Count One.\nThat evidence was not received and you may not consider it to prove\nthe character of the Defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity\nor in accordance with that character.\n\n(Tr. at 23-24.)\n\n\u00b6 37 At this juncture, defense counsel asked for a sidebar discussion. Counsel\nstated that he wanted to \u201cstrenuously object to the opening statement in that it included\noffenses of prior history that were not part of the post-release control,\u201d that is, Breneman\nwas not on post-release control for those offenses. Defense counsel asked for a mistrial.\n\n\u00b6 38 The trial court then asked defense counsel if he agreed that the three\nreferenced drug charges were predicate offenses for the theft of drug allegation.\nDefense counsel responded that he did. The court indicated that \u201c[t]hat was the purpose\nfor the Court\u2019s instruction to the jury.\u201d The court denied the motion for a mistrial. It\nreasoned that, although the court \u201chad a concern with the way the prosecution had\npositioned those offenses,\u201d the opening statement was not evidence and the concern was\ncured through the jury instruction.\n\n\u00b6 39 After the jury was selected, but prior to the presentation of testimony, the\ntrial court, sua sponte, admirably raised with the parties that it had concerns about the\ncriminal history stipulation. The court referred the parties to two cases: State v. Totarella,\n11th Dist. Lake No. 2002-L-147, 2004-Ohio-1175, and State v. Overton, 2017-Ohio-8389,\n99 N.E.3d 1007 (5th Dist.). Discussing Totarella, the court expressed concern that it\nwould be prejudicial for the jury to learn that Breneman had three convictions and the\ndetails of those convictions if Breneman were acknowledging, by stipulation, that he had\na prior drug abuse conviction. The trial court told counsel that Overton addressed undue\nprejudice caused by evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions.\n\n\u00b6 40 After having an opportunity to read the two cases, the prosecutor argued that they were distinguishable, because in both cases defense counsel had sought to exclude evidence of the prior convictions and the trial court had denied those requests. The prosecutor argued that, in contrast, the trial court here was raising the issue sua sponte. Specifically, the prosecutor noted that the trial court had denied a motion in limine in Totarella; the appellate court found that to be error, but overruled the defendant\u2019s assignment of error because the defendant had failed to preserve the error at trial. In Overton, the trial court overruled an oral motion to stipulate to a prior conviction, and the appellate court determined that the court should have allowed the stipulation. The prosecutor stated that the stipulation at issue stated that Breneman was agreeing that he previously was convicted of a felony drug abuse offense.\n\n\u00b6 41 Defense counsel indicated that he had been unaware of the Totarella case, and that the defense now wished only to stipulate that Breneman was previously convicted of or pled guilty to a felony drug abuse offense. The prosecutor responded that, given the case law and defense counsel\u2019s request, the State would be required to agree to the request. The court indicated that the parties would need to file an amended stipulation. (The new stipulation regarding Breneman\u2019s criminal history was filed on August 12, 2019.)\n\n\u00b6 42 The court then addressed the fact that the jury had been told of Breneman\u2019s prior offenses during opening statements. The court concluded that the error in informing the jury of the three convictions was harmless. Breneman told the court that he did not believe he could get a fair trial due to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement. The\nprosecutor responded that he did not intentionally engage in any improper conduct and only told the jury of the three offenses mentioned in the stipulation; he did not mention the rest of Breneman\u2019s \u201cvery extensive\u201d criminal history or that Breneman was on post-release control for a burglary offense.\n\n\u00b6 43 None of the State\u2019s witnesses discussed Breneman\u2019s criminal history, although there was testimony that Breneman was released from prison and placed on post-release control. After the State\u2019s final witness, the court read the stipulations regarding Breneman\u2019s criminal history and the motor vehicle title. The stipulation regarding Breneman\u2019s criminal history read, in its entirety: \u201cThe State of Ohio and the Defendant do hereby agree to stipulate that the Defendant, Virgil Royale Lee Breneman, was previously convicted of or pled guilty to a felony drug abuse offense.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 44 During closing argument, the prosecutor stated that, as part of the theft of drug offense, the State had to prove that Breneman had a prior conviction of a felony drug abuse offense. The prosecutor told that jury that the parties had stipulated to that. The prosecutor did not mention Breneman\u2019s specific criminal history.\n\n\u00b6 45 The court subsequently provided instructions to the jury. It told the jury that opening statements and closing statements were not evidence and were designed to assist the jury in evaluating the evidence. In a section entitled \u201cUse of Prior Conviction \u2013 Enhancing the Degree of Offense,\u201d the court stated:\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nIN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\nSECOND APPELLATE DISTRICT\nCHAMPAIGN COUNTY\n\nSTATE OF OHIO\n\nPlaintiff-Appellee\n\nAppellate Case No. 2019-CA-23\n\nv.\n\nVIRGIL ROYALE LEE BRENEMAN\n\nDefendant-Appellant\n\nTrial Court Case No. 2019-CR-141\n\n(Criminal Appeal from\nCommon Pleas Court)\n\nOPINION\n\nRendered on the 21st day of August, 2020.\n\nSAMANTHA B.

KOLLIN, Atty. Reg. No. 0066964, 3725 Pentagon Boulevard, Suite 270,\nBeavercreek, Ohio 45431\nAttorney for Defendant-Appellant\n\nFROELICH, J.\nVirgil Royale Lee Breneman was found guilty by a jury of theft of drugs, aggravated possession of drugs, escape, grand theft of a motor vehicle, and receiving stolen property. After merging two offenses, the trial court imposed an aggregate sentence of 42 months in prison, a $5,000 fine, and court costs. The court also terminated Breneman\u2019s post-release control in another case and imposed 795 days in prison, to be served consecutively to the 42-month sentence in this case.\n\nBreneman appeals from his conviction, claiming that the trial court should have granted him a new trial due to prejudicial statements by the prosecutor during opening statements, that he was denied due process when the court allowed a sleeping juror to remain, and that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the following reasons, the trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.\n\nI. Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n\nIn his third assignment of error, Breneman claims that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nWhen reviewing an argument challenging the weight of the evidence, an appellate court may not substitute its view for that of the trier of fact, but reviews the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses, and determines whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the finder of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), quoting State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\nBecause the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses at trial, we must defer to the factfinder\u2019s decisions whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses. *State v. Lawson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4* (Aug. 22, 1997). The fact that the evidence is subject to different interpretations does not render the conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. *State v. Wilson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22581, 2009-Ohio-525, \u00b6 14. A judgment of conviction should be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence only in exceptional circumstances. *Martin* at 175.\n\nAt trial in August 2019, the State\u2019s evidence at trial established the following facts.\n\nOn September 17, 2018, Breneman was released from prison and placed on post-release control. Parole Officer Chris Caughman reviewed the conditions of Breneman\u2019s post-release control with Breneman, and Breneman signed the document listing those conditions. One of the conditions was that Breneman must obtain the permission of his parole officer before changing his residence. Breneman reported that he would be residing at the home of his parents (his mother and step-father) in Champaign County. Breneman\u2019s step-father testified that he and his wife had resided at that location since 1981.\n\nParole Officer Patrick Powell was assigned as Breneman\u2019s initial supervising parole officer upon Breneman\u2019s release from prison. Breneman was required to meet with Powell the first and third Thursday of each month, plus have random home visits. Powell testified that Breneman was compliant with his post-release control for the remainder of 2018. Powell had one contact with Breneman in January 2019, and they\nhad no contact in February 2019. Powell testified at trial that he last had contact with Breneman on January 22, 2019. Powell stated that he was concerned about the lack of contact, and he repeatedly went by Breneman\u2019s reported residence (Breneman\u2019s parents\u2019 home), but no one answered the door. Powell also left voicemail messages for Breneman that went unreturned.\n\n\u00b6 9 On March 11, 2019, Parole Officer Brandon Deskins was assigned to be Breneman\u2019s parole officer. Deskins attempted to locate Breneman. On April 3 and 4, Deskins went to Breneman\u2019s parents\u2019 home and left business cards in the front door, asking Breneman to contact him.\n\n\u00b6 10 Breneman\u2019s mother had significant health issues, which required her to take multiple medications, including 7.5-325mg Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen tablets, known as Norco. The parties stipulated that Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen is a Schedule II dangerous drug and is a controlled substance. On April 7, Breneman\u2019s step-father picked up her prescription for a 28-day supply of Norco, which consisted of 112 pills. Breneman\u2019s mother kept her Norco pills on a nightstand in the master bedroom of her home.\n\n\u00b6 11 On April 15 or 16, the bottle of Norco pills went missing. Breneman\u2019s step-father testified that, on April 15, his wife called him into the master bedroom and told him that her pills were missing. He stated that he looked for the Norco bottle, but did not find it. Breneman\u2019s step-father indicated that Breneman and two of Breneman\u2019s children (ages 8 and 12) had come to the house that day. Breneman had stayed for approximately 15 minutes. Breneman\u2019s step-father did not see Breneman take the pills.\n\n\u00b6 12 Breneman\u2019s mother believed that the pills went missing on April 16. She\nrecalled Breneman\u2019s being in the master bedroom of her home and asking her if he could have five of her Norco pills. Breneman\u2019s mother told him that he could not, explaining \u201cMy medicine is counted out; only get so many for 28 days.\u201d She left Breneman in the master bathroom, brushing his teeth, while she went into the kitchen. Breneman\u2019s mother testified that the Norco pills were in the master bedroom at that time, and she stated that Breneman left 30 seconds after she went into the kitchen. When she returned to the master bedroom to take a Norco pill, she noticed that the pills were gone, and she called to her husband to tell him the pills were missing. Breneman\u2019s mother also did not see Breneman take the pills, but she believed that he did so.\n\n\u00b6 13 Breneman\u2019s step-father did not know exactly how many pills remained in the bottle on April 15. He thought his wife took four to six pills per day. Breneman\u2019s mother also did not know how many pills she had taken, but she estimated that she had taken six to nine pills over the nine days since April 7. She testified that she did not take 50 or 60 pills. The parties stipulated that 30 or more Norco tablets equals or exceeds the bulk amount.\n\n\u00b6 14 On April 18, Parole Officer Deskins received a call from Breneman\u2019s step-father, who expressed concern that Breneman had stolen his wife\u2019s medication. Deskins asked Breneman\u2019s step-father if they had filed a police report, and the step-father indicated that he had not. Deskins told him to contact the police and file a report if they believed a crime had been committed.\n\n\u00b6 15 Deskins testified that Breneman\u2019s step-father further stated that Breneman had not been living at the residence for approximately two weeks. At one point, Breneman\u2019s step-father testified that Breneman had lived at their home prior to April 15,\nbut he had been asked to leave. In different portions of their testimony, Breneman\u2019s parents testified that Breneman lived at their home on April 15.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6 14 On April 18, Parole Officer Deskins received a call from Breneman\u2019s step-father, who expressed concern that Breneman had stolen his wife\u2019s medication. Deskins asked Breneman\u2019s step-father if they had filed a police report, and the step-father indicated that he had not. Deskins told him to contact the police and file a report if they believed a crime had been committed.\n\n\u00b6 15 Deskins testified that Breneman\u2019s step-father further stated that Breneman had not been living at the residence for approximately two weeks. At one point, Breneman\u2019s step-father testified that Breneman had lived at their home prior to April 15,\nbut he had been asked to leave. In different portions of their testimony, Breneman\u2019s parents testified that Breneman lived at their home on April 15.\n\n\u00b6 16 Parole Officer Deskins declared Breneman to be \u201cwhereabouts unknown\u201d and in violation of his post-release control. As a result of that designation, the Adult Parole Authority would wait 30 days and then issue an arrest warrant. Deskins testified that Breneman did not contact him personally or through others.\n\n\u00b6 17 Breneman\u2019s mother contacted the police about the missing pills on April 19, the day after her husband spoke with Deskins. At trial, Breneman\u2019s parents explained the delay, indicating that they had hoped the person who took the pills would return them. Officer Tyler Reasor of the Urbana Police Department responded to Breneman\u2019s parents\u2019 home. They reported to Officer Reasor that their son, Breneman, had stolen more than 100 Norco pills. Officer Reasor was informed that only Breneman\u2019s parents and Breneman had been in the house.\n\n\u00b6 18 Officer Reasor attempted to locate Breneman, but was unable to find him. Officer Reasor spoke with Parole Officer Deskins in an attempt to locate Breneman, but Deskins said that he did not know where Breneman was either.\n\n\u00b6 19 In May 2019, Sheila Sanders had a 1995 Toyota Corolla that was titled in her name. Sanders had gotten the vehicle from her sister in January 2019, and had agreed to sell the vehicle to her (Sanders\u2019s) daughter, Lora Smith, for $400. Sanders testified that Smith had fully paid for the vehicle, but the transfer of title was contingent on Smith\u2019s obtaining a valid driver\u2019s license; Smith had not yet obtained one.\n\n\u00b6 20 Smith testified that she considered herself the owner of the Corolla after the last payment was made in March 2019, and that she bought the car for both herself and\nBreneman, whom she was then dating. Smith testified that she was arrested on March 28, and Breneman had the keys to the Corolla then. She indicated that Breneman was supposed to return the keys to her mother.\n\n\u00b6 21 On May 6, 2019, Sheila Sanders let Breneman borrow the Corolla. Sanders testified that Breneman told her that he wanted to go to Springfield and would bring the car back that night, in a couple hours. Breneman never returned the car. Sanders tried to contact Breneman, but he had left his phone at her home and she was unable to reach him. Sanders and Smith both testified that they spoke about the car, and Smith told Sanders to report the car as stolen. On May 14, a friend of Sanders spotted the Corolla at a gas station, and Sanders contacted the police.\n\n\u00b6 22 On May 14, 2019, Deputy Jayde Sheeley of the Champaign County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded to call from Sheila Sanders, reporting her vehicle missing. Detective Glenn Kemp later reviewed Sheeley\u2019s report and confirmed with Sanders that the vehicle had not been recovered. Kemp also checked with dispatch and learned that the vehicle had been entered into LEADS as stolen. The vehicle was later recovered in the possession of Suluki Evans. Evans testified that Breneman sold him the Corolla for $500 (Evans said that he still owed $200), and that Breneman led him to believe that he (Breneman) had title to the vehicle.\n\n\u00b6 23 After the 30-day period with Breneman listed as \u201cwhereabouts unknown\u201d had passed, the Ohio State Highway Patrol issued a warrant for Breneman\u2019s arrest.\n\n\u00b6 24 On May 20, 2019, Officer Seth Dale, a police officer for Wittenberg University, approached Breneman and another individual after seeing them attempt to open a door to a closed building. After checking with dispatch, Officer Dale learned that\nBreneman had an arrest warrant for a parole violation. Breneman attempted to flee but was quickly apprehended and taken to jail.\n\n\u00b6 25 On May 21, Parole Officer Deskins learned of Breneman\u2019s arrest and interviewed Breneman at the jail about the alleged theft of medication, car theft, and absconding. Breneman denied taking medication from his mother. He told Deskins, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t get nothing.\u201d As for the car, Breneman stated that he had borrowed the car many times and it had never been a problem. Breneman told Deskins, \u201cI paid for that car.\u201d Breneman claimed to have returned the car within the next day or two, and he denied knowing where the car was located. When asked about absconding, Breneman told Deskins that he had been living in Springfield on and off at different people\u2019s residences, and mentioned two women. Breneman said that his parents\u2019 home was still his residence, but he was not staying there. Breneman explained that he did not report as required, because \u201cI knew you guys were going to arrest me. I think Patrick Powell was going to arrest me.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 26 After deliberations, the jury found Breneman guilty of the five charged offenses: theft of drugs, aggravated possession of drugs, escape, grand theft of a motor vehicle, and receiving stolen property. With respect to the theft of drugs charge (Count 1), the jury further found that the offense involved a dangerous drug and that Breneman previously was convicted of a felony drug abuse offense. As to the aggravated possession of drugs charge (Count 2), the jury further found that the amount of drug involved was equal to or in excess of the bulk amount.\n\n\u00b6 27 Breneman did not present any witnesses. Rather, through cross-examination, he raised whether his mother, who managed her use of Norco, was often\nconfused and may have misplaced the prescription bottle. Defense counsel also raised that Breneman\u2019s two children could have been present when the Norco pills went missing. Counsel emphasized that Breneman\u2019s mother was unsure of how many pills she had taken from the bottle and how many were left.\n\n{\u00b6 28} As for the theft of the Corolla, the testimony of Smith and Sanders raised questions about the ownership of the car. Smith had testified that, upon the payment of $400 to her mother, she owned the car. Smith had testified that she bought the car for her and Breneman\u2019s use, and in some testimony, she referred at trial to the car as \u201cour car.\u201d In closing argument, defense counsel referred to Evans as a \u201ccar thief\u201d and argued that his testimony was not credible.\n\n{\u00b6 29} In cross-examining the parole officers, defense counsel emphasized that Parole Officer Powell was not Breneman\u2019s parole officer when Breneman allegedly absconded (April 18 to May 21). Defense counsel asked Deskins how \u201cviolator at large\u201d worked, whether Deskins had discretion to pursue escape charges, and whether he knew that Smith was contacting Breneman from jail.\n\n{\u00b6 30} On appeal, Breneman focuses on his drug possession conviction. He argues that his mother was very ill both in April 2019 and when trial was held, and that she took several medications that \u201caffected her physical and mental well-being.\u201d Breneman noted his mother\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that she believed that she had worked (without pay) for Facebook as a greeter, helping people to sign on and thanking them for joining. Emphasizing that no one saw him take his mother\u2019s medication, Breneman argued that his conviction for theft of drugs and aggravated possession of drugs was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\nIn reaching its verdict, the jury was free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of each witness and to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented. State v. Baker, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25828, 2014-Ohio-3163, \u00b6 28. It was the province of the jury, as the trier of fact, to weigh the evidence and determine whether the State had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Breneman committed each of the charged offenses. Upon review of the testimony of both of Breneman\u2019s parents, the jury could have reasonably concluded that, on or about April 15, Breneman\u2019s mother had her prescription Norco pills on her nightstand, that Breneman stole the pills from the master bedroom, that the amount remaining in the bottle equaled or exceeded the bulk amount, and that the Norco pills were a Schedule II dangerous drug and a controlled substance. The fact that no one observed Breneman take his mother\u2019s Norco medication did not require a different conclusion. Breneman stipulated that he had a prior felony drug abuse offense conviction. The jury\u2019s guilty verdicts as to theft of drugs and aggravated possession of drugs were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nBreneman\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\nII.

After merging two offenses, the trial court imposed an aggregate sentence of 42 months in prison, a $5,000 fine, and court costs. The court also terminated Breneman\u2019s post-release control in another case and imposed 795 days in prison, to be served consecutively to the 42-month sentence in this case.\n\nBreneman appeals from his conviction, claiming that the trial court should have granted him a new trial due to prejudicial statements by the prosecutor during opening statements, that he was denied due process when the court allowed a sleeping juror to remain, and that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the following reasons, the trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.\n\nI. Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n\nIn his third assignment of error, Breneman claims that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nWhen reviewing an argument challenging the weight of the evidence, an appellate court may not substitute its view for that of the trier of fact, but reviews the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses, and determines whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the finder of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), quoting State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\nBecause the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses at trial, we must defer to the factfinder\u2019s decisions whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses. *State v. Lawson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4* (Aug. 22, 1997). The fact that the evidence is subject to different interpretations does not render the conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. *State v. Wilson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22581, 2009-Ohio-525, \u00b6 14. A judgment of conviction should be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence only in exceptional circumstances. *Martin* at 175.\n\nAt trial in August 2019, the State\u2019s evidence at trial established the following facts.\n\nOn September 17, 2018, Breneman was released from prison and placed on post-release control. Parole Officer Chris Caughman reviewed the conditions of Breneman\u2019s post-release control with Breneman, and Breneman signed the document listing those conditions. One of the conditions was that Breneman must obtain the permission of his parole officer before changing his residence. Breneman reported that he would be residing at the home of his parents (his mother and step-father) in Champaign County. Breneman\u2019s step-father testified that he and his wife had resided at that location since 1981.\n\nParole Officer Patrick Powell was assigned as Breneman\u2019s initial supervising parole officer upon Breneman\u2019s release from prison. Breneman was required to meet with Powell the first and third Thursday of each month, plus have random home visits. Powell testified that Breneman was compliant with his post-release control for the remainder of 2018. Powell had one contact with Breneman in January 2019, and they\nhad no contact in February 2019. Powell testified at trial that he last had contact with Breneman on January 22, 2019. Powell stated that he was concerned about the lack of contact, and he repeatedly went by Breneman\u2019s reported residence (Breneman\u2019s parents\u2019 home), but no one answered the door. Powell also left voicemail messages for Breneman that went unreturned.\n\n\u00b6 9 On March 11, 2019, Parole Officer Brandon Deskins was assigned to be Breneman\u2019s parole officer. Deskins attempted to locate Breneman. On April 3 and 4, Deskins went to Breneman\u2019s parents\u2019 home and left business cards in the front door, asking Breneman to contact him.\n\n\u00b6 10 Breneman\u2019s mother had significant health issues, which required her to take multiple medications, including 7.5-325mg Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen tablets, known as Norco. The parties stipulated that Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen is a Schedule II dangerous drug and is a controlled substance. On April 7, Breneman\u2019s step-father picked up her prescription for a 28-day supply of Norco, which consisted of 112 pills. Breneman\u2019s mother kept her Norco pills on a nightstand in the master bedroom of her home.\n\n\u00b6 11 On April 15 or 16, the bottle of Norco pills went missing. Breneman\u2019s step-father testified that, on April 15, his wife called him into the master bedroom and told him that her pills were missing. He stated that he looked for the Norco bottle, but did not find it. Breneman\u2019s step-father indicated that Breneman and two of Breneman\u2019s children (ages 8 and 12) had come to the house that day. Breneman had stayed for approximately 15 minutes. Breneman\u2019s step-father did not see Breneman take the pills.\n\n\u00b6 12 Breneman\u2019s mother believed that the pills went missing on April 16. She\nrecalled Breneman\u2019s being in the master bedroom of her home and asking her if he could have five of her Norco pills. Breneman\u2019s mother told him that he could not, explaining \u201cMy medicine is counted out; only get so many for 28 days.\u201d She left Breneman in the master bathroom, brushing his teeth, while she went into the kitchen. Breneman\u2019s mother testified that the Norco pills were in the master bedroom at that time, and she stated that Breneman left 30 seconds after she went into the kitchen. When she returned to the master bedroom to take a Norco pill, she noticed that the pills were gone, and she called to her husband to tell him the pills were missing. Breneman\u2019s mother also did not see Breneman take the pills, but she believed that he did so.\n\n\u00b6 13 Breneman\u2019s step-father did not know exactly how many pills remained in the bottle on April 15. He thought his wife took four to six pills per day. Breneman\u2019s mother also did not know how many pills she had taken, but she estimated that she had taken six to nine pills over the nine days since April 7. She testified that she did not take 50 or 60 pills. The parties stipulated that 30 or more Norco tablets equals or exceeds the bulk amount.\n\n\u00b6 14 On April 18, Parole Officer Deskins received a call from Breneman\u2019s step-father, who expressed concern that Breneman had stolen his wife\u2019s medication. Deskins asked Breneman\u2019s step-father if they had filed a police report, and the step-father indicated that he had not. Deskins told him to contact the police and file a report if they believed a crime had been committed.\n\n\u00b6 15 Deskins testified that Breneman\u2019s step-father further stated that Breneman had not been living at the residence for approximately two weeks. At one point, Breneman\u2019s step-father testified that Breneman had lived at their home prior to April 15,\nbut he had been asked to leave. In different portions of their testimony, Breneman\u2019s parents testified that Breneman lived at their home on April 15.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6 14 On April 18, Parole Officer Deskins received a call from Breneman\u2019s step-father, who expressed concern that Breneman had stolen his wife\u2019s medication. Deskins asked Breneman\u2019s step-father if they had filed a police report, and the step-father indicated that he had not. Deskins told him to contact the police and file a report if they believed a crime had been committed.\n\n\u00b6 15 Deskins testified that Breneman\u2019s step-father further stated that Breneman had not been living at the residence for approximately two weeks. At one point, Breneman\u2019s step-father testified that Breneman had lived at their home prior to April 15,\nbut he had been asked to leave. In different portions of their testimony, Breneman\u2019s parents testified that Breneman lived at their home on April 15.\n\n\u00b6 16 Parole Officer Deskins declared Breneman to be \u201cwhereabouts unknown\u201d and in violation of his post-release control. As a result of that designation, the Adult Parole Authority would wait 30 days and then issue an arrest warrant. Deskins testified that Breneman did not contact him personally or through others.\n\n\u00b6 17 Breneman\u2019s mother contacted the police about the missing pills on April 19, the day after her husband spoke with Deskins. At trial, Breneman\u2019s parents explained the delay, indicating that they had hoped the person who took the pills would return them. Officer Tyler Reasor of the Urbana Police Department responded to Breneman\u2019s parents\u2019 home. They reported to Officer Reasor that their son, Breneman, had stolen more than 100 Norco pills. Officer Reasor was informed that only Breneman\u2019s parents and Breneman had been in the house.\n\n\u00b6 18 Officer Reasor attempted to locate Breneman, but was unable to find him. Officer Reasor spoke with Parole Officer Deskins in an attempt to locate Breneman, but Deskins said that he did not know where Breneman was either.\n\n\u00b6 19 In May 2019, Sheila Sanders had a 1995 Toyota Corolla that was titled in her name. Sanders had gotten the vehicle from her sister in January 2019, and had agreed to sell the vehicle to her (Sanders\u2019s) daughter, Lora Smith, for $400. Sanders testified that Smith had fully paid for the vehicle, but the transfer of title was contingent on Smith\u2019s obtaining a valid driver\u2019s license; Smith had not yet obtained one.\n\n\u00b6 20 Smith testified that she considered herself the owner of the Corolla after the last payment was made in March 2019, and that she bought the car for both herself and\nBreneman, whom she was then dating. Smith testified that she was arrested on March 28, and Breneman had the keys to the Corolla then. She indicated that Breneman was supposed to return the keys to her mother.\n\n\u00b6 21 On May 6, 2019, Sheila Sanders let Breneman borrow the Corolla. Sanders testified that Breneman told her that he wanted to go to Springfield and would bring the car back that night, in a couple hours. Breneman never returned the car. Sanders tried to contact Breneman, but he had left his phone at her home and she was unable to reach him. Sanders and Smith both testified that they spoke about the car, and Smith told Sanders to report the car as stolen. On May 14, a friend of Sanders spotted the Corolla at a gas station, and Sanders contacted the police.\n\n\u00b6 22 On May 14, 2019, Deputy Jayde Sheeley of the Champaign County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded to call from Sheila Sanders, reporting her vehicle missing. Detective Glenn Kemp later reviewed Sheeley\u2019s report and confirmed with Sanders that the vehicle had not been recovered. Kemp also checked with dispatch and learned that the vehicle had been entered into LEADS as stolen. The vehicle was later recovered in the possession of Suluki Evans. Evans testified that Breneman sold him the Corolla for $500 (Evans said that he still owed $200), and that Breneman led him to believe that he (Breneman) had title to the vehicle.\n\n\u00b6 23 After the 30-day period with Breneman listed as \u201cwhereabouts unknown\u201d had passed, the Ohio State Highway Patrol issued a warrant for Breneman\u2019s arrest.\n\n\u00b6 24 On May 20, 2019, Officer Seth Dale, a police officer for Wittenberg University, approached Breneman and another individual after seeing them attempt to open a door to a closed building. After checking with dispatch, Officer Dale learned that\nBreneman had an arrest warrant for a parole violation. Breneman attempted to flee but was quickly apprehended and taken to jail.\n\n\u00b6 25 On May 21, Parole Officer Deskins learned of Breneman\u2019s arrest and interviewed Breneman at the jail about the alleged theft of medication, car theft, and absconding. Breneman denied taking medication from his mother. He told Deskins, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t get nothing.\u201d As for the car, Breneman stated that he had borrowed the car many times and it had never been a problem. Breneman told Deskins, \u201cI paid for that car.\u201d Breneman claimed to have returned the car within the next day or two, and he denied knowing where the car was located. When asked about absconding, Breneman told Deskins that he had been living in Springfield on and off at different people\u2019s residences, and mentioned two women. Breneman said that his parents\u2019 home was still his residence, but he was not staying there. Breneman explained that he did not report as required, because \u201cI knew you guys were going to arrest me. I think Patrick Powell was going to arrest me.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 26 After deliberations, the jury found Breneman guilty of the five charged offenses: theft of drugs, aggravated possession of drugs, escape, grand theft of a motor vehicle, and receiving stolen property. With respect to the theft of drugs charge (Count 1), the jury further found that the offense involved a dangerous drug and that Breneman previously was convicted of a felony drug abuse offense. As to the aggravated possession of drugs charge (Count 2), the jury further found that the amount of drug involved was equal to or in excess of the bulk amount.\n\n\u00b6 27 Breneman did not present any witnesses. Rather, through cross-examination, he raised whether his mother, who managed her use of Norco, was often\nconfused and may have misplaced the prescription bottle. Defense counsel also raised that Breneman\u2019s two children could have been present when the Norco pills went missing. Counsel emphasized that Breneman\u2019s mother was unsure of how many pills she had taken from the bottle and how many were left.\n\n{\u00b6 28} As for the theft of the Corolla, the testimony of Smith and Sanders raised questions about the ownership of the car. Smith had testified that, upon the payment of $400 to her mother, she owned the car. Smith had testified that she bought the car for her and Breneman\u2019s use, and in some testimony, she referred at trial to the car as \u201cour car.\u201d In closing argument, defense counsel referred to Evans as a \u201ccar thief\u201d and argued that his testimony was not credible.\n\n{\u00b6 29} In cross-examining the parole officers, defense counsel emphasized that Parole Officer Powell was not Breneman\u2019s parole officer when Breneman allegedly absconded (April 18 to May 21). Defense counsel asked Deskins how \u201cviolator at large\u201d worked, whether Deskins had discretion to pursue escape charges, and whether he knew that Smith was contacting Breneman from jail.\n\n{\u00b6 30} On appeal, Breneman focuses on his drug possession conviction. He argues that his mother was very ill both in April 2019 and when trial was held, and that she took several medications that \u201caffected her physical and mental well-being.\u201d Breneman noted his mother\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that she believed that she had worked (without pay) for Facebook as a greeter, helping people to sign on and thanking them for joining. Emphasizing that no one saw him take his mother\u2019s medication, Breneman argued that his conviction for theft of drugs and aggravated possession of drugs was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\nIn reaching its verdict, the jury was free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of each witness and to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented. State v. Baker, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25828, 2014-Ohio-3163, \u00b6 28. It was the province of the jury, as the trier of fact, to weigh the evidence and determine whether the State had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Breneman committed each of the charged offenses. Upon review of the testimony of both of Breneman\u2019s parents, the jury could have reasonably concluded that, on or about April 15, Breneman\u2019s mother had her prescription Norco pills on her nightstand, that Breneman stole the pills from the master bedroom, that the amount remaining in the bottle equaled or exceeded the bulk amount, and that the Norco pills were a Schedule II dangerous drug and a controlled substance. The fact that no one observed Breneman take his mother\u2019s Norco medication did not require a different conclusion. Breneman stipulated that he had a prior felony drug abuse offense conviction. The jury\u2019s guilty verdicts as to theft of drugs and aggravated possession of drugs were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nBreneman\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\nII. Motion for New Trial/ Opening Statements\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6 44 During closing argument, the prosecutor stated that, as part of the theft of drug offense, the State had to prove that Breneman had a prior conviction of a felony drug abuse offense. The prosecutor told that jury that the parties had stipulated to that. The prosecutor did not mention Breneman\u2019s specific criminal history.\n\n\u00b6 45 The court subsequently provided instructions to the jury. It told the jury that opening statements and closing statements were not evidence and were designed to assist the jury in evaluating the evidence. In a section entitled \u201cUse of Prior Conviction \u2013 Enhancing the Degree of Offense,\u201d the court stated:\n\nEvidence was received that the Defendant has been convicted of a felony drug abuse offense. That evidence was received because a prior conviction is an element of the offense charged. It was not received, and you may not consider it, to prove the character of the Defendant in order to\nshow that he acted in conformity with the character.\n\n\u00b6 46 On appeal, Breneman claims that the trial court should have ordered a new trial due to the prosecutor\u2019s prejudicial opening statement. He claims that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to his three prior convictions precluded him from receiving a fair trial. The State counters that Breneman\u2019s argument is barred by the invited error doctrine, and that Breneman did not timely object to the prosecutor\u2019s mentioning of the three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions. We conclude that Breneman invited the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the three prior drug offenses in his opening statement. Moreover, with the unique record before us, we further conclude that Breneman was not prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s isolated reference to Breneman\u2019s three prior drug convictions, and no new trial was warranted.\n\n\u00b6 47 The indictment for Count 1, alleging theft of drugs as a felony of the third degree, include allegations that Breneman was previously convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony drug abuse offense, and it listed the 2014 conviction for possession of heroin, the 2011 conviction for possession of cocaine, and the 2002 conviction for trafficking in cocaine. The parties\u2019 pretrial stipulation agreed that Breneman had been convicted of those three offenses. The prosecutor\u2019s opening statement conformed to the parties\u2019 stipulation; it did not add any details about those offenses or mention any other prior offenses.\n\n\u00b6 48 Under the doctrine of invited error, \u201c[a] party will not be permitted to take advantage of an error [that] he himself invited or induced.\u201d (Citations omitted.) State v. Fair, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24388, 2011-Ohio-4454, \u00b6 69. Defense counsel agreed to a stipulation, prior to trial, that Breneman had been convicted of the three drug offenses\nreferenced in Count I of the indictment. The prosecutor cannot be faulted for relying on that stipulation in his opening statement, and Breneman cannot now complain about the prosecutor\u2019s informing the jury of those convictions in the State\u2019s opening statement.\n\n\u00b6 49 Moreover, under the facts of this case, any prejudice that resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s single reference to Breneman\u2019s three specific prior convictions was diminished by court\u2019s jury instructions and the nature of the charges at trial. First, the jury was told, immediately after the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, that evidence of Breneman\u2019s prior convictions was permitted because a prior conviction was an element of the offense of theft of drugs in Count One, but \u201c[t]hat evidence was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the Defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity or in accordance with that character.\u201d The court repeated that instruction at the conclusion of the trial. The court also twice instructed the jury that opening statements were not evidence. We presume that the jury followed the trial court\u2019s instructions. State v. Keeton, 2d Dist. Darke No. 2019-CA-8, 2020-Ohio-950, \u00b6 24, citing State v. Jones, 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 414, 739 N.E.2d 300 (2000) (\u201cWe presume that juries follow the instructions provided to them.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 50 Second, as part of the trial, the jury properly heard that Breneman had a prior felony drug abuse offense conviction and that he had previously served a prison sentence, for which he was on post-release control. The parties stipulated that Breneman had a prior felony drug abuse offense, and that stipulation was read to the jury. Although the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement provided the specific offense, date and case number for three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions, the prosecutor did not inform the jury of the factual circumstances underlying those offenses or discuss any\nother aspect of Breneman\u2019s criminal history.\n\n\u00b6 51 Upon review of the trial transcript, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement prejudicially affected Breneman\u2019s substantial rights, resulting in an unfair trial. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant Breneman a new trial.\n\n\u00b6 52 Breneman\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\nIII. Due Process / Sleeping Juror\n\n\u00b6 53 In his second assignment of error, Breneman claims that he was denied his right to due process when the trial court allowed a sleeping juror to remain on the jury panel.\n\n\u00b6 54 On the second day of trial, before resuming after a 10:00 a.m. recess, the prosecutor informed the trial court that Parole Officer Deskins, the State\u2019s representative, had noticed that Juror No. 10 \u201cappeared to be having difficulty keeping his eyes open.\u201d The prosecutor stated that he (the prosecutor) \u201clooked over and observed Juror 10 and his eyes were closed. It was only for a few moments, and he looked up and his eyes opened and his head came up. But his eyes were closed for a few moments, and I felt that I needed to bring it to the Court\u2019s attention.\u201d (Tr. at 388.)\n\n\u00b6 55 The court responded that it \u201chad taken a look at Juror No. 10 as well, and I never thought he was \u2018sleeping.\u2019 Some jurors will tend to listen to evidence without taking notes as if they\u2019re listening to music. But I will seek to keep a closer eye as well.\u201d (Id. at 388-389.) The court asked the prosecutor if he wanted the court to take any action. The prosecutor responded, \u201cNo. I just wanted to bring it to your attention.\u201d (Id. at 389.) Defense counsel stated that he had \u201cno comment.\u201d (Id.)\nLater that day, the court provided the jury an opportunity to stretch and asked the bailiff to turn on the air conditioning. The court told the prosecutor and defense counsel at sidebar that \u201c[i]t would appear that a couple the jurors were needing an opportunity to stretch.\u201d (Tr. at 456.) The court did not identify any particular juror or jurors.\n\n\u201cAn objection to a sleeping juror must be made at trial because the trial court has significant discretion in how it resolves an incident with a sleeping juror.\u201d See State v. Jones, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2013-CA-63, 2014-Ohio-1540, \u00b6 11. \u201c[I]f a sleeping juror has not missed \u2018large or critical portions\u2019 of the proceedings, no prejudice results from that juror\u2019s remaining on the jury.\u201d State v. Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, \u00b6 112, citing State v. Sanders, 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 253, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001).\n\nHere, the record does not substantiate that Breneman\u2019s due process rights were violated. First, we note that defense counsel did not ask the trial court to take any particular action with respect to the alleged sleeping juror, nor did defense counsel object to the juror\u2019s remaining on the panel. Moreover, after the prosecutor brought the juror to the court\u2019s attention, the court commented that it did not believe that the juror had been asleep. The prosecutor\u2019s statement also indicated that the juror\u2019s eyes had been closed \u201conly for a few moments.\u201d The record thus does not substantiate that the juror was, in fact, sleeping or that the juror missed \u201clarge or critical portions\u201d of the trial.\n\nBreneman\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.\nTUCKER, P.J. and HALL, J., concur.\n\nCopies sent to:\n\nSamantha B. Whetherholt\nThomas M. Kollin\nHon. Nick A. Selvaggio\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nBreneman\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\nII. Motion for New Trial/ Opening Statements\n\nIn his first assignment of error, Breneman claims that the trial court erred in failing to grant him a new trial due to the prosecutor\u2019s informing the jury of Breneman\u2019s\nthree prior felony drug abuse offense convictions during opening statements.\u00b9\n\n\u00b6 34 On August 8, 2019, prior to trial, the parties filed three written stipulations signed by the prosecutor and defense counsel. The first concerned the title for the 1995 Toyota Corolla at issue, the second concerned Breneman\u2019s criminal history, and the third concerned the prescription medication prescribed for Breneman\u2019s mother. In the criminal history stipulation, the parties agreed and stipulated that Breneman was previously convicted of or plead guilty to the following felony drug abuse offenses:\n\n1. Possession of Heroin in violation of section 2925.11 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on July 21, 2014 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2014 CR 121.\n\n2. Possession of Cocaine in violation of section 2925.11 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on July 21, 2011 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2010 CR 103.\n\n3. Trafficking in Cocaine in violation of section 2925.03 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on April 30, 2002 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2002 CR 004.\n\n\u00b6 35 Trial began on August 12. That morning, before jury selection, the\n\n\u00b9 Breneman\u2019s sentencing occurred the day after the trial ended, and the trial court filed its written judgment entry of conviction on the same day. Breneman\u2019s counsel filed a written motion for a new trial after the trial court filed its judgment entry of conviction. The court ruled on that motion after Breneman filed his notice of appeal of his conviction. The court\u2019s decision denying the motion for a new trial is not before us. However, Breneman repeatedly claimed at trial and sentencing that he was denied a fair trial due to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement. We will construe his assignment of error as claiming that the prosecutor\u2019s alleged misconduct violated his due process rights and that the court should have ordered a new trial.\nprosecutor and defense counsel gave opening statements to the prospective jurors. During the State\u2019s opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that Breneman was released from prison on September 17, 2018, and that he committed the offense of escape by failing to report to his parole officer and moving without notifying his parole officer. The prosecutor further indicated that the parole officers nevertheless \u201cwere learning that he [Breneman] was getting into some trouble.\u201d (Tr. at 21.) The prosecutor continued:\n\nThey heard of how the Defendant, who was previously convicted of felony drug abuse offenses of trafficking in cocaine in 2002, possession of cocaine in 2010, and possession of heroin in 2014 \u2013 They learned how this Defendant had stolen his mother\u2019s prescription pain medication. * * *\n\nThe parole officers also learned about how this Defendant took possession of a 1995 Toyota Corolla that didn\u2019t belong to him, and he sold the car without the permission of the owner. * * *\n\n(Tr. at 21-22.)\n\n\u00b6 36 After the prosecutor completed his opening statement, the court, sua sponte, gave the jury the following instruction:\n\nLadies and gentleman, from the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, we\u2019ve learned that evidence may be received that the Defendant has been previously convicted of certain criminal offenses.\n\nThe Court is instructing you that that evidence may be received because a prior conviction is an element of the offense of theft of drugs in Count One.\nThat evidence was not received and you may not consider it to prove\nthe character of the Defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity\nor in accordance with that character.\n\n(Tr. at 23-24.)\n\n\u00b6 37 At this juncture, defense counsel asked for a sidebar discussion. Counsel\nstated that he wanted to \u201cstrenuously object to the opening statement in that it included\noffenses of prior history that were not part of the post-release control,\u201d that is, Breneman\nwas not on post-release control for those offenses. Defense counsel asked for a mistrial.\n\n\u00b6 38 The trial court then asked defense counsel if he agreed that the three\nreferenced drug charges were predicate offenses for the theft of drug allegation.\nDefense counsel responded that he did. The court indicated that \u201c[t]hat was the purpose\nfor the Court\u2019s instruction to the jury.\u201d The court denied the motion for a mistrial. It\nreasoned that, although the court \u201chad a concern with the way the prosecution had\npositioned those offenses,\u201d the opening statement was not evidence and the concern was\ncured through the jury instruction.\n\n\u00b6 39 After the jury was selected, but prior to the presentation of testimony, the\ntrial court, sua sponte, admirably raised with the parties that it had concerns about the\ncriminal history stipulation. The court referred the parties to two cases: State v. Totarella,\n11th Dist. Lake No. 2002-L-147, 2004-Ohio-1175, and State v. Overton, 2017-Ohio-8389,\n99 N.E.3d 1007 (5th Dist.). Discussing Totarella, the court expressed concern that it\nwould be prejudicial for the jury to learn that Breneman had three convictions and the\ndetails of those convictions if Breneman were acknowledging, by stipulation, that he had\na prior drug abuse conviction. The trial court told counsel that Overton addressed undue\nprejudice caused by evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions.\n\n\u00b6 40 After having an opportunity to read the two cases, the prosecutor argued that they were distinguishable, because in both cases defense counsel had sought to exclude evidence of the prior convictions and the trial court had denied those requests. The prosecutor argued that, in contrast, the trial court here was raising the issue sua sponte. Specifically, the prosecutor noted that the trial court had denied a motion in limine in Totarella; the appellate court found that to be error, but overruled the defendant\u2019s assignment of error because the defendant had failed to preserve the error at trial. In Overton, the trial court overruled an oral motion to stipulate to a prior conviction, and the appellate court determined that the court should have allowed the stipulation. The prosecutor stated that the stipulation at issue stated that Breneman was agreeing that he previously was convicted of a felony drug abuse offense.\n\n\u00b6 41 Defense counsel indicated that he had been unaware of the Totarella case, and that the defense now wished only to stipulate that Breneman was previously convicted of or pled guilty to a felony drug abuse offense. The prosecutor responded that, given the case law and defense counsel\u2019s request, the State would be required to agree to the request. The court indicated that the parties would need to file an amended stipulation. (The new stipulation regarding Breneman\u2019s criminal history was filed on August 12, 2019.)\n\n\u00b6 42 The court then addressed the fact that the jury had been told of Breneman\u2019s prior offenses during opening statements. The court concluded that the error in informing the jury of the three convictions was harmless. Breneman told the court that he did not believe he could get a fair trial due to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement. The\nprosecutor responded that he did not intentionally engage in any improper conduct and only told the jury of the three offenses mentioned in the stipulation; he did not mention the rest of Breneman\u2019s \u201cvery extensive\u201d criminal history or that Breneman was on post-release control for a burglary offense.\n\n\u00b6 43 None of the State\u2019s witnesses discussed Breneman\u2019s criminal history, although there was testimony that Breneman was released from prison and placed on post-release control. After the State\u2019s final witness, the court read the stipulations regarding Breneman\u2019s criminal history and the motor vehicle title. The stipulation regarding Breneman\u2019s criminal history read, in its entirety: \u201cThe State of Ohio and the Defendant do hereby agree to stipulate that the Defendant, Virgil Royale Lee Breneman, was previously convicted of or pled guilty to a felony drug abuse offense.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 44 During closing argument, the prosecutor stated that, as part of the theft of drug offense, the State had to prove that Breneman had a prior conviction of a felony drug abuse offense. The prosecutor told that jury that the parties had stipulated to that. The prosecutor did not mention Breneman\u2019s specific criminal history.\n\n\u00b6 45 The court subsequently provided instructions to the jury. It told the jury that opening statements and closing statements were not evidence and were designed to assist the jury in evaluating the evidence. In a section entitled \u201cUse of Prior Conviction \u2013 Enhancing the Degree of Offense,\u201d the court stated:"}
{"Index": "077-Breneman", "allegation": "His convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.", "evidence": "\u00b6 44 During closing argument, the prosecutor stated that, as part of the theft of drug offense, the State had to prove that Breneman had a prior conviction of a felony drug abuse offense. The prosecutor told that jury that the parties had stipulated to that. The prosecutor did not mention Breneman\u2019s specific criminal history.\n\n\u00b6 45 The court subsequently provided instructions to the jury. It told the jury that opening statements and closing statements were not evidence and were designed to assist the jury in evaluating the evidence. In a section entitled \u201cUse of Prior Conviction \u2013 Enhancing the Degree of Offense,\u201d the court stated:\n\nEvidence was received that the Defendant has been convicted of a felony drug abuse offense. That evidence was received because a prior conviction is an element of the offense charged. It was not received, and you may not consider it, to prove the character of the Defendant in order to\nshow that he acted in conformity with the character.\n\n\u00b6 46 On appeal, Breneman claims that the trial court should have ordered a new trial due to the prosecutor\u2019s prejudicial opening statement. He claims that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to his three prior convictions precluded him from receiving a fair trial. The State counters that Breneman\u2019s argument is barred by the invited error doctrine, and that Breneman did not timely object to the prosecutor\u2019s mentioning of the three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions. We conclude that Breneman invited the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the three prior drug offenses in his opening statement. Moreover, with the unique record before us, we further conclude that Breneman was not prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s isolated reference to Breneman\u2019s three prior drug convictions, and no new trial was warranted.\n\n\u00b6 47 The indictment for Count 1, alleging theft of drugs as a felony of the third degree, include allegations that Breneman was previously convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony drug abuse offense, and it listed the 2014 conviction for possession of heroin, the 2011 conviction for possession of cocaine, and the 2002 conviction for trafficking in cocaine. The parties\u2019 pretrial stipulation agreed that Breneman had been convicted of those three offenses. The prosecutor\u2019s opening statement conformed to the parties\u2019 stipulation; it did not add any details about those offenses or mention any other prior offenses.\n\n\u00b6 48 Under the doctrine of invited error, \u201c[a] party will not be permitted to take advantage of an error [that] he himself invited or induced.\u201d (Citations omitted.) State v. Fair, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24388, 2011-Ohio-4454, \u00b6 69. Defense counsel agreed to a stipulation, prior to trial, that Breneman had been convicted of the three drug offenses\nreferenced in Count I of the indictment. The prosecutor cannot be faulted for relying on that stipulation in his opening statement, and Breneman cannot now complain about the prosecutor\u2019s informing the jury of those convictions in the State\u2019s opening statement.\n\n\u00b6 49 Moreover, under the facts of this case, any prejudice that resulted from the prosecutor\u2019s single reference to Breneman\u2019s three specific prior convictions was diminished by court\u2019s jury instructions and the nature of the charges at trial. First, the jury was told, immediately after the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, that evidence of Breneman\u2019s prior convictions was permitted because a prior conviction was an element of the offense of theft of drugs in Count One, but \u201c[t]hat evidence was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the Defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity or in accordance with that character.\u201d The court repeated that instruction at the conclusion of the trial. The court also twice instructed the jury that opening statements were not evidence. We presume that the jury followed the trial court\u2019s instructions. State v. Keeton, 2d Dist. Darke No. 2019-CA-8, 2020-Ohio-950, \u00b6 24, citing State v. Jones, 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 414, 739 N.E.2d 300 (2000) (\u201cWe presume that juries follow the instructions provided to them.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 50 Second, as part of the trial, the jury properly heard that Breneman had a prior felony drug abuse offense conviction and that he had previously served a prison sentence, for which he was on post-release control. The parties stipulated that Breneman had a prior felony drug abuse offense, and that stipulation was read to the jury. Although the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement provided the specific offense, date and case number for three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions, the prosecutor did not inform the jury of the factual circumstances underlying those offenses or discuss any\nother aspect of Breneman\u2019s criminal history.\n\n\u00b6 51 Upon review of the trial transcript, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement prejudicially affected Breneman\u2019s substantial rights, resulting in an unfair trial. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant Breneman a new trial.\n\n\u00b6 52 Breneman\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\nIII. Due Process / Sleeping Juror\n\n\u00b6 53 In his second assignment of error, Breneman claims that he was denied his right to due process when the trial court allowed a sleeping juror to remain on the jury panel.\n\n\u00b6 54 On the second day of trial, before resuming after a 10:00 a.m. recess, the prosecutor informed the trial court that Parole Officer Deskins, the State\u2019s representative, had noticed that Juror No. 10 \u201cappeared to be having difficulty keeping his eyes open.\u201d The prosecutor stated that he (the prosecutor) \u201clooked over and observed Juror 10 and his eyes were closed. It was only for a few moments, and he looked up and his eyes opened and his head came up. But his eyes were closed for a few moments, and I felt that I needed to bring it to the Court\u2019s attention.\u201d (Tr. at 388.)\n\n\u00b6 55 The court responded that it \u201chad taken a look at Juror No. 10 as well, and I never thought he was \u2018sleeping.\u2019 Some jurors will tend to listen to evidence without taking notes as if they\u2019re listening to music. But I will seek to keep a closer eye as well.\u201d (Id. at 388-389.) The court asked the prosecutor if he wanted the court to take any action. The prosecutor responded, \u201cNo. I just wanted to bring it to your attention.\u201d (Id. at 389.) Defense counsel stated that he had \u201cno comment.\u201d (Id.)\nLater that day, the court provided the jury an opportunity to stretch and asked the bailiff to turn on the air conditioning. The court told the prosecutor and defense counsel at sidebar that \u201c[i]t would appear that a couple the jurors were needing an opportunity to stretch.\u201d (Tr. at 456.) The court did not identify any particular juror or jurors.\n\n\u201cAn objection to a sleeping juror must be made at trial because the trial court has significant discretion in how it resolves an incident with a sleeping juror.\u201d See State v. Jones, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2013-CA-63, 2014-Ohio-1540, \u00b6 11. \u201c[I]f a sleeping juror has not missed \u2018large or critical portions\u2019 of the proceedings, no prejudice results from that juror\u2019s remaining on the jury.\u201d State v. Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, \u00b6 112, citing State v. Sanders, 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 253, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001).\n\nHere, the record does not substantiate that Breneman\u2019s due process rights were violated. First, we note that defense counsel did not ask the trial court to take any particular action with respect to the alleged sleeping juror, nor did defense counsel object to the juror\u2019s remaining on the panel. Moreover, after the prosecutor brought the juror to the court\u2019s attention, the court commented that it did not believe that the juror had been asleep. The prosecutor\u2019s statement also indicated that the juror\u2019s eyes had been closed \u201conly for a few moments.\u201d The record thus does not substantiate that the juror was, in fact, sleeping or that the juror missed \u201clarge or critical portions\u201d of the trial.\n\nBreneman\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThe trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.\nTUCKER, P.J. and HALL, J., concur.\n\nCopies sent to:\n\nSamantha B. Whetherholt\nThomas M. Kollin\nHon. Nick A.

WHETHERHOLT, Atty. Reg. No. 0092010, Champaign County\nProsecutor\u2019s Office, Appellate Division, 200 North Main Street, Urbana, Ohio 43078\nAttorney for Plaintiff-Appellee\n\nTHOMAS M. KOLLIN, Atty. Reg. No. 0066964, 3725 Pentagon Boulevard, Suite 270,\nBeavercreek, Ohio 45431\nAttorney for Defendant-Appellant\n\nFROELICH, J.\nVirgil Royale Lee Breneman was found guilty by a jury of theft of drugs, aggravated possession of drugs, escape, grand theft of a motor vehicle, and receiving stolen property. After merging two offenses, the trial court imposed an aggregate sentence of 42 months in prison, a $5,000 fine, and court costs. The court also terminated Breneman\u2019s post-release control in another case and imposed 795 days in prison, to be served consecutively to the 42-month sentence in this case.\n\nBreneman appeals from his conviction, claiming that the trial court should have granted him a new trial due to prejudicial statements by the prosecutor during opening statements, that he was denied due process when the court allowed a sleeping juror to remain, and that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the following reasons, the trial court\u2019s judgment will be affirmed.\n\nI. Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n\nIn his third assignment of error, Breneman claims that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nWhen reviewing an argument challenging the weight of the evidence, an appellate court may not substitute its view for that of the trier of fact, but reviews the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses, and determines whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the finder of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), quoting State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\nBecause the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses at trial, we must defer to the factfinder\u2019s decisions whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses. *State v. Lawson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4* (Aug. 22, 1997). The fact that the evidence is subject to different interpretations does not render the conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. *State v. Wilson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22581, 2009-Ohio-525, \u00b6 14. A judgment of conviction should be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence only in exceptional circumstances. *Martin* at 175.\n\nAt trial in August 2019, the State\u2019s evidence at trial established the following facts.\n\nOn September 17, 2018, Breneman was released from prison and placed on post-release control. Parole Officer Chris Caughman reviewed the conditions of Breneman\u2019s post-release control with Breneman, and Breneman signed the document listing those conditions. One of the conditions was that Breneman must obtain the permission of his parole officer before changing his residence. Breneman reported that he would be residing at the home of his parents (his mother and step-father) in Champaign County. Breneman\u2019s step-father testified that he and his wife had resided at that location since 1981.\n\nParole Officer Patrick Powell was assigned as Breneman\u2019s initial supervising parole officer upon Breneman\u2019s release from prison. Breneman was required to meet with Powell the first and third Thursday of each month, plus have random home visits. Powell testified that Breneman was compliant with his post-release control for the remainder of 2018. Powell had one contact with Breneman in January 2019, and they\nhad no contact in February 2019. Powell testified at trial that he last had contact with Breneman on January 22, 2019. Powell stated that he was concerned about the lack of contact, and he repeatedly went by Breneman\u2019s reported residence (Breneman\u2019s parents\u2019 home), but no one answered the door. Powell also left voicemail messages for Breneman that went unreturned.\n\n\u00b6 9 On March 11, 2019, Parole Officer Brandon Deskins was assigned to be Breneman\u2019s parole officer. Deskins attempted to locate Breneman. On April 3 and 4, Deskins went to Breneman\u2019s parents\u2019 home and left business cards in the front door, asking Breneman to contact him.\n\n\u00b6 10 Breneman\u2019s mother had significant health issues, which required her to take multiple medications, including 7.5-325mg Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen tablets, known as Norco. The parties stipulated that Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen is a Schedule II dangerous drug and is a controlled substance. On April 7, Breneman\u2019s step-father picked up her prescription for a 28-day supply of Norco, which consisted of 112 pills. Breneman\u2019s mother kept her Norco pills on a nightstand in the master bedroom of her home.\n\n\u00b6 11 On April 15 or 16, the bottle of Norco pills went missing. Breneman\u2019s step-father testified that, on April 15, his wife called him into the master bedroom and told him that her pills were missing. He stated that he looked for the Norco bottle, but did not find it. Breneman\u2019s step-father indicated that Breneman and two of Breneman\u2019s children (ages 8 and 12) had come to the house that day. Breneman had stayed for approximately 15 minutes. Breneman\u2019s step-father did not see Breneman take the pills.\n\n\u00b6 12 Breneman\u2019s mother believed that the pills went missing on April 16. She\nrecalled Breneman\u2019s being in the master bedroom of her home and asking her if he could have five of her Norco pills. Breneman\u2019s mother told him that he could not, explaining \u201cMy medicine is counted out; only get so many for 28 days.\u201d She left Breneman in the master bathroom, brushing his teeth, while she went into the kitchen. Breneman\u2019s mother testified that the Norco pills were in the master bedroom at that time, and she stated that Breneman left 30 seconds after she went into the kitchen. When she returned to the master bedroom to take a Norco pill, she noticed that the pills were gone, and she called to her husband to tell him the pills were missing. Breneman\u2019s mother also did not see Breneman take the pills, but she believed that he did so.\n\n\u00b6 13 Breneman\u2019s step-father did not know exactly how many pills remained in the bottle on April 15. He thought his wife took four to six pills per day. Breneman\u2019s mother also did not know how many pills she had taken, but she estimated that she had taken six to nine pills over the nine days since April 7. She testified that she did not take 50 or 60 pills. The parties stipulated that 30 or more Norco tablets equals or exceeds the bulk amount.\n\n\u00b6 14 On April 18, Parole Officer Deskins received a call from Breneman\u2019s step-father, who expressed concern that Breneman had stolen his wife\u2019s medication. Deskins asked Breneman\u2019s step-father if they had filed a police report, and the step-father indicated that he had not. Deskins told him to contact the police and file a report if they believed a crime had been committed.\n\n\u00b6 15 Deskins testified that Breneman\u2019s step-father further stated that Breneman had not been living at the residence for approximately two weeks. At one point, Breneman\u2019s step-father testified that Breneman had lived at their home prior to April 15,\nbut he had been asked to leave. In different portions of their testimony, Breneman\u2019s parents testified that Breneman lived at their home on April 15.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nBreneman\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\nII. Motion for New Trial/ Opening Statements\n\nIn his first assignment of error, Breneman claims that the trial court erred in failing to grant him a new trial due to the prosecutor\u2019s informing the jury of Breneman\u2019s\nthree prior felony drug abuse offense convictions during opening statements.\u00b9\n\n\u00b6 34 On August 8, 2019, prior to trial, the parties filed three written stipulations signed by the prosecutor and defense counsel. The first concerned the title for the 1995 Toyota Corolla at issue, the second concerned Breneman\u2019s criminal history, and the third concerned the prescription medication prescribed for Breneman\u2019s mother. In the criminal history stipulation, the parties agreed and stipulated that Breneman was previously convicted of or plead guilty to the following felony drug abuse offenses:\n\n1. Possession of Heroin in violation of section 2925.11 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on July 21, 2014 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2014 CR 121.\n\n2. Possession of Cocaine in violation of section 2925.11 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on July 21, 2011 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2010 CR 103.\n\n3. Trafficking in Cocaine in violation of section 2925.03 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on April 30, 2002 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2002 CR 004.\n\n\u00b6 35 Trial began on August 12. That morning, before jury selection, the\n\n\u00b9 Breneman\u2019s sentencing occurred the day after the trial ended, and the trial court filed its written judgment entry of conviction on the same day. Breneman\u2019s counsel filed a written motion for a new trial after the trial court filed its judgment entry of conviction. The court ruled on that motion after Breneman filed his notice of appeal of his conviction. The court\u2019s decision denying the motion for a new trial is not before us. However, Breneman repeatedly claimed at trial and sentencing that he was denied a fair trial due to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement. We will construe his assignment of error as claiming that the prosecutor\u2019s alleged misconduct violated his due process rights and that the court should have ordered a new trial.\nprosecutor and defense counsel gave opening statements to the prospective jurors. During the State\u2019s opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that Breneman was released from prison on September 17, 2018, and that he committed the offense of escape by failing to report to his parole officer and moving without notifying his parole officer. The prosecutor further indicated that the parole officers nevertheless \u201cwere learning that he [Breneman] was getting into some trouble.\u201d (Tr. at 21.) The prosecutor continued:\n\nThey heard of how the Defendant, who was previously convicted of felony drug abuse offenses of trafficking in cocaine in 2002, possession of cocaine in 2010, and possession of heroin in 2014 \u2013 They learned how this Defendant had stolen his mother\u2019s prescription pain medication. * * *\n\nThe parole officers also learned about how this Defendant took possession of a 1995 Toyota Corolla that didn\u2019t belong to him, and he sold the car without the permission of the owner. * * *\n\n(Tr. at 21-22.)\n\n\u00b6 36 After the prosecutor completed his opening statement, the court, sua sponte, gave the jury the following instruction:\n\nLadies and gentleman, from the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, we\u2019ve learned that evidence may be received that the Defendant has been previously convicted of certain criminal offenses.\n\nThe Court is instructing you that that evidence may be received because a prior conviction is an element of the offense of theft of drugs in Count One.\nThat evidence was not received and you may not consider it to prove\nthe character of the Defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity\nor in accordance with that character.\n\n(Tr. at 23-24.)\n\n\u00b6 37 At this juncture, defense counsel asked for a sidebar discussion. Counsel\nstated that he wanted to \u201cstrenuously object to the opening statement in that it included\noffenses of prior history that were not part of the post-release control,\u201d that is, Breneman\nwas not on post-release control for those offenses. Defense counsel asked for a mistrial.\n\n\u00b6 38 The trial court then asked defense counsel if he agreed that the three\nreferenced drug charges were predicate offenses for the theft of drug allegation.\nDefense counsel responded that he did. The court indicated that \u201c[t]hat was the purpose\nfor the Court\u2019s instruction to the jury.\u201d The court denied the motion for a mistrial. It\nreasoned that, although the court \u201chad a concern with the way the prosecution had\npositioned those offenses,\u201d the opening statement was not evidence and the concern was\ncured through the jury instruction.\n\n\u00b6 39 After the jury was selected, but prior to the presentation of testimony, the\ntrial court, sua sponte, admirably raised with the parties that it had concerns about the\ncriminal history stipulation. The court referred the parties to two cases: State v. Totarella,\n11th Dist. Lake No. 2002-L-147, 2004-Ohio-1175, and State v. Overton, 2017-Ohio-8389,\n99 N.E.3d 1007 (5th Dist.). Discussing Totarella, the court expressed concern that it\nwould be prejudicial for the jury to learn that Breneman had three convictions and the\ndetails of those convictions if Breneman were acknowledging, by stipulation, that he had\na prior drug abuse conviction. The trial court told counsel that Overton addressed undue\nprejudice caused by evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior convictions.\n\n\u00b6 40 After having an opportunity to read the two cases, the prosecutor argued that they were distinguishable, because in both cases defense counsel had sought to exclude evidence of the prior convictions and the trial court had denied those requests. The prosecutor argued that, in contrast, the trial court here was raising the issue sua sponte. Specifically, the prosecutor noted that the trial court had denied a motion in limine in Totarella; the appellate court found that to be error, but overruled the defendant\u2019s assignment of error because the defendant had failed to preserve the error at trial. In Overton, the trial court overruled an oral motion to stipulate to a prior conviction, and the appellate court determined that the court should have allowed the stipulation. The prosecutor stated that the stipulation at issue stated that Breneman was agreeing that he previously was convicted of a felony drug abuse offense.\n\n\u00b6 41 Defense counsel indicated that he had been unaware of the Totarella case, and that the defense now wished only to stipulate that Breneman was previously convicted of or pled guilty to a felony drug abuse offense. The prosecutor responded that, given the case law and defense counsel\u2019s request, the State would be required to agree to the request. The court indicated that the parties would need to file an amended stipulation. (The new stipulation regarding Breneman\u2019s criminal history was filed on August 12, 2019.)\n\n\u00b6 42 The court then addressed the fact that the jury had been told of Breneman\u2019s prior offenses during opening statements. The court concluded that the error in informing the jury of the three convictions was harmless. Breneman told the court that he did not believe he could get a fair trial due to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement. The\nprosecutor responded that he did not intentionally engage in any improper conduct and only told the jury of the three offenses mentioned in the stipulation; he did not mention the rest of Breneman\u2019s \u201cvery extensive\u201d criminal history or that Breneman was on post-release control for a burglary offense.\n\n\u00b6 43 None of the State\u2019s witnesses discussed Breneman\u2019s criminal history, although there was testimony that Breneman was released from prison and placed on post-release control. After the State\u2019s final witness, the court read the stipulations regarding Breneman\u2019s criminal history and the motor vehicle title. The stipulation regarding Breneman\u2019s criminal history read, in its entirety: \u201cThe State of Ohio and the Defendant do hereby agree to stipulate that the Defendant, Virgil Royale Lee Breneman, was previously convicted of or pled guilty to a felony drug abuse offense.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 44 During closing argument, the prosecutor stated that, as part of the theft of drug offense, the State had to prove that Breneman had a prior conviction of a felony drug abuse offense. The prosecutor told that jury that the parties had stipulated to that. The prosecutor did not mention Breneman\u2019s specific criminal history.\n\n\u00b6 45 The court subsequently provided instructions to the jury. It told the jury that opening statements and closing statements were not evidence and were designed to assist the jury in evaluating the evidence. In a section entitled \u201cUse of Prior Conviction \u2013 Enhancing the Degree of Offense,\u201d the court stated:\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6 14 On April 18, Parole Officer Deskins received a call from Breneman\u2019s step-father, who expressed concern that Breneman had stolen his wife\u2019s medication. Deskins asked Breneman\u2019s step-father if they had filed a police report, and the step-father indicated that he had not. Deskins told him to contact the police and file a report if they believed a crime had been committed.\n\n\u00b6 15 Deskins testified that Breneman\u2019s step-father further stated that Breneman had not been living at the residence for approximately two weeks. At one point, Breneman\u2019s step-father testified that Breneman had lived at their home prior to April 15,\nbut he had been asked to leave. In different portions of their testimony, Breneman\u2019s parents testified that Breneman lived at their home on April 15.\n\n\u00b6 16 Parole Officer Deskins declared Breneman to be \u201cwhereabouts unknown\u201d and in violation of his post-release control. As a result of that designation, the Adult Parole Authority would wait 30 days and then issue an arrest warrant. Deskins testified that Breneman did not contact him personally or through others.\n\n\u00b6 17 Breneman\u2019s mother contacted the police about the missing pills on April 19, the day after her husband spoke with Deskins. At trial, Breneman\u2019s parents explained the delay, indicating that they had hoped the person who took the pills would return them. Officer Tyler Reasor of the Urbana Police Department responded to Breneman\u2019s parents\u2019 home. They reported to Officer Reasor that their son, Breneman, had stolen more than 100 Norco pills. Officer Reasor was informed that only Breneman\u2019s parents and Breneman had been in the house.\n\n\u00b6 18 Officer Reasor attempted to locate Breneman, but was unable to find him. Officer Reasor spoke with Parole Officer Deskins in an attempt to locate Breneman, but Deskins said that he did not know where Breneman was either.\n\n\u00b6 19 In May 2019, Sheila Sanders had a 1995 Toyota Corolla that was titled in her name. Sanders had gotten the vehicle from her sister in January 2019, and had agreed to sell the vehicle to her (Sanders\u2019s) daughter, Lora Smith, for $400. Sanders testified that Smith had fully paid for the vehicle, but the transfer of title was contingent on Smith\u2019s obtaining a valid driver\u2019s license; Smith had not yet obtained one.\n\n\u00b6 20 Smith testified that she considered herself the owner of the Corolla after the last payment was made in March 2019, and that she bought the car for both herself and\nBreneman, whom she was then dating. Smith testified that she was arrested on March 28, and Breneman had the keys to the Corolla then. She indicated that Breneman was supposed to return the keys to her mother.\n\n\u00b6 21 On May 6, 2019, Sheila Sanders let Breneman borrow the Corolla. Sanders testified that Breneman told her that he wanted to go to Springfield and would bring the car back that night, in a couple hours. Breneman never returned the car. Sanders tried to contact Breneman, but he had left his phone at her home and she was unable to reach him. Sanders and Smith both testified that they spoke about the car, and Smith told Sanders to report the car as stolen. On May 14, a friend of Sanders spotted the Corolla at a gas station, and Sanders contacted the police.\n\n\u00b6 22 On May 14, 2019, Deputy Jayde Sheeley of the Champaign County Sheriff\u2019s Office responded to call from Sheila Sanders, reporting her vehicle missing. Detective Glenn Kemp later reviewed Sheeley\u2019s report and confirmed with Sanders that the vehicle had not been recovered. Kemp also checked with dispatch and learned that the vehicle had been entered into LEADS as stolen. The vehicle was later recovered in the possession of Suluki Evans. Evans testified that Breneman sold him the Corolla for $500 (Evans said that he still owed $200), and that Breneman led him to believe that he (Breneman) had title to the vehicle.\n\n\u00b6 23 After the 30-day period with Breneman listed as \u201cwhereabouts unknown\u201d had passed, the Ohio State Highway Patrol issued a warrant for Breneman\u2019s arrest.\n\n\u00b6 24 On May 20, 2019, Officer Seth Dale, a police officer for Wittenberg University, approached Breneman and another individual after seeing them attempt to open a door to a closed building. After checking with dispatch, Officer Dale learned that\nBreneman had an arrest warrant for a parole violation. Breneman attempted to flee but was quickly apprehended and taken to jail.\n\n\u00b6 25 On May 21, Parole Officer Deskins learned of Breneman\u2019s arrest and interviewed Breneman at the jail about the alleged theft of medication, car theft, and absconding. Breneman denied taking medication from his mother. He told Deskins, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t get nothing.\u201d As for the car, Breneman stated that he had borrowed the car many times and it had never been a problem. Breneman told Deskins, \u201cI paid for that car.\u201d Breneman claimed to have returned the car within the next day or two, and he denied knowing where the car was located. When asked about absconding, Breneman told Deskins that he had been living in Springfield on and off at different people\u2019s residences, and mentioned two women. Breneman said that his parents\u2019 home was still his residence, but he was not staying there. Breneman explained that he did not report as required, because \u201cI knew you guys were going to arrest me. I think Patrick Powell was going to arrest me.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 26 After deliberations, the jury found Breneman guilty of the five charged offenses: theft of drugs, aggravated possession of drugs, escape, grand theft of a motor vehicle, and receiving stolen property. With respect to the theft of drugs charge (Count 1), the jury further found that the offense involved a dangerous drug and that Breneman previously was convicted of a felony drug abuse offense. As to the aggravated possession of drugs charge (Count 2), the jury further found that the amount of drug involved was equal to or in excess of the bulk amount.\n\n\u00b6 27 Breneman did not present any witnesses. Rather, through cross-examination, he raised whether his mother, who managed her use of Norco, was often\nconfused and may have misplaced the prescription bottle. Defense counsel also raised that Breneman\u2019s two children could have been present when the Norco pills went missing. Counsel emphasized that Breneman\u2019s mother was unsure of how many pills she had taken from the bottle and how many were left.\n\n{\u00b6 28} As for the theft of the Corolla, the testimony of Smith and Sanders raised questions about the ownership of the car. Smith had testified that, upon the payment of $400 to her mother, she owned the car. Smith had testified that she bought the car for her and Breneman\u2019s use, and in some testimony, she referred at trial to the car as \u201cour car.\u201d In closing argument, defense counsel referred to Evans as a \u201ccar thief\u201d and argued that his testimony was not credible.\n\n{\u00b6 29} In cross-examining the parole officers, defense counsel emphasized that Parole Officer Powell was not Breneman\u2019s parole officer when Breneman allegedly absconded (April 18 to May 21). Defense counsel asked Deskins how \u201cviolator at large\u201d worked, whether Deskins had discretion to pursue escape charges, and whether he knew that Smith was contacting Breneman from jail.\n\n{\u00b6 30} On appeal, Breneman focuses on his drug possession conviction. He argues that his mother was very ill both in April 2019 and when trial was held, and that she took several medications that \u201caffected her physical and mental well-being.\u201d Breneman noted his mother\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that she believed that she had worked (without pay) for Facebook as a greeter, helping people to sign on and thanking them for joining. Emphasizing that no one saw him take his mother\u2019s medication, Breneman argued that his conviction for theft of drugs and aggravated possession of drugs was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\nIn reaching its verdict, the jury was free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of each witness and to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented. State v. Baker, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25828, 2014-Ohio-3163, \u00b6 28. It was the province of the jury, as the trier of fact, to weigh the evidence and determine whether the State had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Breneman committed each of the charged offenses. Upon review of the testimony of both of Breneman\u2019s parents, the jury could have reasonably concluded that, on or about April 15, Breneman\u2019s mother had her prescription Norco pills on her nightstand, that Breneman stole the pills from the master bedroom, that the amount remaining in the bottle equaled or exceeded the bulk amount, and that the Norco pills were a Schedule II dangerous drug and a controlled substance. The fact that no one observed Breneman take his mother\u2019s Norco medication did not require a different conclusion. Breneman stipulated that he had a prior felony drug abuse offense conviction. The jury\u2019s guilty verdicts as to theft of drugs and aggravated possession of drugs were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nBreneman\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\nII. Motion for New Trial/ Opening Statements"}
{"Index": "078-Burry", "allegation": "The trial court violated the defendant-appellant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to fair trial, due process and confrontation when it barred a defense expert from testifying regarding a key issue, yet allowed the prosecutor to conduct a demonstration regarding the same issue during closing argument.", "evidence": "Defendant-appellant, Robert P. Burry, appeals his convictions for Attempted Murder, Felonious Assault, and Kidnapping as well as his post-merger sentence for Attempted Murder following a jury trial in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas. The issues before this court are whether a trial court errs by preventing a defense expert from testifying to the results of an experiment when the fact that the experiment had been conducted was not disclosed to the prosecution; whether\na prosecutor commits prosecutorial misconduct by placing a gun against his forehead during closing argument to demonstrate an issue at trial; whether convictions for Attempted Murder, Felonious Assault, and Kidnapping are not supported by sufficient evidence and/or are against the weight of the evidence where the victim's testimony at trial is at variance with her initial statements to the police and where the defendant's expert testified to the unlikelihood of a gun being loaded when it is fired twice without discharging a bullet; and whether a thirteen-year sentence for Attempted Murder with a Firearm Specification is clearly and convincingly supported by the record based on the psychological harm caused the victim and the defendant's minimization of his conduct. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the court below.\n\n{\u00b62} On January 27, 2017, the Lake County Grand Jury indicted Burry of the following: two counts of Attempted Murder (Counts 1 and 2), felonies of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A) and R.C. 2923.02; two counts of Felonious Assault (Counts 3 and 4), felonies of the second degree in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2); Kidnapping (Count 5), a felony of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3); Domestic Violence (Count 6), a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A); Aggravated Menacing (Count 7), a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2903.21; Using Weapons While Intoxicated (Count 8), a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2923.15; and Resisting Arrest (Count 9), a misdemeanor of the second degree in violation of R.C. 2921.33(A). Counts 1 to 5 of the Indictment contained Firearm Specifications pursuant to R.C. 2941.145.\n\n{\u00b63} On February 3, 2017, Burry was arraigned and entered a plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d to the charges in the Indictment.\nBetween September 19 and 21, 2017, a jury trial was held. Prior to the commencement of trial, the State elected to dismiss Counts 6 to 9 of the Indictment. The following witness testimony was given at trial:\n\nSergeant Daniel Hirz of the Willowick Police Department testified that, at about 8:24 p.m. on Christmas Eve 2016, he responded to a call at the home of Robert and Carol Burry at 299 East 293rd Street. Upon arrival, Hirz observed: \u201cMrs. Burry at the end of the driveway crouched down behind the cars that were parked in the street. She was crying, a bit hysterical and she was just saying he tried to shoot me twice.\u201d Hirz entered the residence with his weapon drawn.\n\nSergeant Hirz met Burry in the hallway:\n\nI ordered him to the ground, I ordered to see his hands. Initially he showed me his hands and complied and was beginning to kneel down in compliance. * * * I saw he didn\u2019t have anything in his hands, I began to holster my weapon and he decided to get up and he said to shoot me, you mother and then he began to say the word fucker but since he was advancing on me I kicked him in the chest knocking him backwards which took the wind out of him. * * * [He] staggered backwards until he ran into the couch and sofa which kept him [from] falling over. Once he regained his balance Officer Sobkowich, who shortly came in the door right behind me * * * tased Mr. Burry striking him in the chest which dropped forward and on to the ground.\n\nThereupon, Burry was handcuffed. Sergeant Hirz noted that he was \u201chighly intoxicated.\u201d\n\nDuring the subsequent search of the residence: a magazine containing one bullet was found under the couch; a nine-millimeter shell casing was found in Burry\u2019s bedroom; a firearm was found in a drawer in Burry\u2019s bedroom; and a bullet hole was found, originating in Burry\u2019s bedroom, passing through another bedroom, and exiting the house.\nA video taken from Sergeant Hirz\u2019 body cam was played for the jury. In the video, Hirz asks Carol if Burry fired the gun at her and she responded that there were no bullets in it. She stated he \u201cstuck it right to my [indicating her forehead].\u201d Carol then advised Hirz that there was a gun that did go off, apparently believing it was a different gun.\n\nAfter being subdued, Burry denied that there was a firearm and that he did \u201canything.\u201d Several minutes later, he admitted that a gun had gone off but he denied pointing the gun at anybody and claimed he would never hurt his wife.\n\nPrior to taking their written statements, Sergeant Hirz interviewed Carol and her son (Burry\u2019s stepson), Kyle Johnson, in the basement of the home. Carol recalled that Burry threatened to kill her dogs and asked if she would like to die tonight. She repeated, indicating with her hands, that the gun was pointed at her head and belly and that he pulled the trigger. She claimed, \u201che didn\u2019t know if there could have been a bullet in there.\u201d Kyle interrupted and said, \u201cthere was.\u201d She continued, \u201che didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nOfficer Shaun Kovacic of the Willowick Police Department testified that he responded to the Christmas Eve call to the Burry residence and entered the home after Sergeant Hirz. After Mr. Burry was subdued, Kovacic searched his bedroom. He found a spent shell casing on the floor and a pistol in a dresser drawer. Kovacic also noted a bullet hole in the bedroom which led into another bedroom and finally through the exterior wall of the house.\n\nOfficer Steven Sobkowich of the Willowick Police Department responded to the Christmas Eve call to the Burry residence. His testimony corroborated Sergeant\nHirz\u2019 version of events. Sobkowich noted powder residue on Mr. Burry\u2019s left hand. A video taken from Sobkowich\u2019s body cam was played for the jury.\n\n{\u00b613} On the Officer Sobkowich video, Burry admits that he went to his room and loaded the Beretta and that there were two bullets in the magazine. He claimed that when he pulled the slide the gun went off accidentally. Burry denied that he ever pointed the gun at Carol.\n\n{\u00b614} Kyle Johnson was living with his mother (Carol) and stepfather (Robert Burry) in 2016. He testified that he, Burry, and Carol kept guns in the house. Burry kept his guns \u201cready to go with a clip, a magazine filled and in the gun with the safety off\u201d and \u201calways close by *** to a bed or a dresser.\u201d\n\n{\u00b615} Carol and Burry\u2019s marriage had been deteriorating and the couple argued frequently. Carol wanted a divorce and had made arrangements to move into an apartment. Kyle would remain in the home with Burry until it could be sold.\n\n{\u00b616} During the afternoon on Christmas Eve, Kyle and Carol were watching a movie while Burry was out having a couple of beers with a friend. Burry returned home, \u201cvisibly drunk,\u201d and wanted to open gifts. He became very angry while waiting for the movie to finish. Burry began to badger Carol about the impending divorce while his mood swung from angry to sad. For the first time that he could recall, Kyle heard Burry become \u201cverbally abusive\u201d toward Carol, calling her a \u201ctraitor\u201d and a \u201cpiece of shit.\u201d Kyle retired to his room as the argument continued for about ten minutes.\n\n{\u00b617} Eventually, Burry went to his room and Carol watched television. Kyle next heard the safe in Carol\u2019s room where guns were kept make a \u201cclanging\u201d noise. Kyle testified: \u201cThe next sound I heard was Bob rush[ing] out of the room and then\nimmediately after that I heard my mother calling my name and screaming Kyle, help, help, call the police.\u201d\n\nKyle called 911 and walked to the living room and observed the following:\n\nI saw Bob holding my mother down with his left hand, the Beretta in his right hand directly on her forehead. *** She was kicking and screaming and *** as I moved closer, she kicked, was able to kick him off of her for a moment. In that moment the gun was pointed in my direction. *** I moved toward the stairs. As Bob saw me move towards the stairs he moved his attention back towards my mom. *** As I was describing to the dispatcher what was going on above me *** my mother said you shot me, Bob, how could you shoot me right in the stomach. I became really scared at that moment and a little confused because at that point I hadn\u2019t heard a shot yet. *** I heard lots of footsteps, I heard doors slamming, *** and then I heard a shot in the house.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b652 Contrary to Burry\u2019s position, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s demonstration was not improper. There is no indication in the record that the demonstration was intended to be testimonial, i.e., by pressing the pistol against his forehead, the prosecutor was trying to convince rather than prove to the jury that the pistol could be put out of battery without leaving a mark. The demonstration was theatrical rather than evidentiary and the prosecutor anticipated that the jury would draw its own conclusions on the issue based on its own handling of the evidence.\n\n\u00b653 Before the jury, the prosecutor argued:\n\nNow there is a question about whether or not you press this into someone\u2019s forehead and it\u2019s going to cause some sort of injury, cause some sort of mark that\u2019s going to be obvious or visible. I\u2019m going to do something for you because I mean really you got to make a decision how you handle the evidence. *** But I\u2019d like to save you from putting this thing to your own head like I\u2019m about to do ***. I\u2019m not going to know if there is a mark on my head, I\u2019m not going to know if it disappears by the time I\u2019m done talking [to]\nyou. *** This is a .9 millimeter weapon, you'll see when you get back to the jury room it doesn't take a lot of force to put that out of battery. *** And I think when you have that weapon back there you'll find that is something because you're going to be pressing it into your head just like I did.\n\n*Compare State v. Naples*, 94 Ohio App. 33, 114 N.E.2d 302 (7th Dist.1952), paragraph four of the syllabus (\u201c[i]t is not misconduct resulting in prejudicial error for the prosecuting attorney in the trial of an accused for assault with intent to kill *** to refer to and demonstrate the use of a sawed-off billiard cue on the person of the prosecuting witness, there being no evidence that such billiard cue was used in the assault * * *, where such remarks merely constituted the prosecutor's interpretation of the facts as he knew them\u201d).\n\n{\u00b654} It is worth noting that the Beretta was repeatedly pressed against the human body to put it out of battery \u2013 by Silverstein, by Kapelsohn, and by the prosecutor3 \u2013 during trial but never with the understanding that such demonstration constituted a scientific test or experiment with evidentiary value. During his cross examination, Kapelsohn commented that he still had a mark on his hand forty-five minutes after using his hand to put it out of battery. The prosecutor commented that his hand did not have a mark, but recognized that whether a mark is made \u201cdepends on the individual's biology * * * [and] a million things that neither one of us have any business talking about with any expertise.\u201d\n\n{\u00b655} Lastly, the trial court duly instructed the jury both before and after trial that the closing arguments of counsel are \u201cdesigned to assist\u201d the jury in its deliberations but are not evidence. *Pang*, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 559 N.E.2d 1313, at paragraph four of the\n\n---\n\n3. The prosecutor pushed the Beretta against his hand to put it out of battery during his cross examination of Kapelsohn after Kapelsohn had made the same demonstration during direct examination.\nsyllabus (\"[a] presumption always exists that the jury has followed the instructions given to it by the trial court\").\n\n{\u00b656} Burry also claims the prosecutor improperly held himself out as an expert by explaining that he had firearms experience from his time in the Marine Corps and that one of the reasons he was brought on the case was because of his \u201cexpertise\u201d in handling firearms. Appellant\u2019s brief at 13.\n\n{\u00b657} The context of these comments readily demonstrates that the prosecutor was not holding himself out before the jury as an expert witness. Both comments occurred during the voir dire of the jury. In one instance, the prosecutor responded to a juror\u2019s statement that his experience and knowledge came from the \u201cU.S. Army\u201d with \u201cthat\u2019s my same experience in the Marine Corps.\u201d In the other instance, the prosecutor mentioned his \u201cexpertise\u201d to assure the jury that \u201cwe would handle this firearm [the Beretta] safely\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019re going to follow the safety things that everyone * * * is taught from the get go.\u201d\n\n{\u00b658} Burry\u2019s final argument under this assignment of error is that the prosecutor improperly claimed \u201cthat the defense expert was \u2018tricking\u2019 the jury.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 14. The prosecutor was referring to Kapelsohn\u2019s demonstration of how the Beretta would not be able to release its hammer (have a \u201cdead trigger\u201d) if it was put a quarter inch or more out of battery. On cross examination, the prosecutor had Kapelsohn admit that in order to achieve this result it was necessary for him to tilt his hand and apply\n\n4. Counsel for Burry likewise addressed the issue during voir dire: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that I\u2019m an expert. I can tell you that I\u2019m knowledgeable on the subject. I can tell you I\u2019ve been trained. I can tell you I\u2019ve been to the range. I can tell you I\u2019ve had several hours of shooting range practice and I\u2019ve done the course and I know the laws associated with the weapons and firing the weapons but are you able to kind of, can you look at me, can you look at Bob [Burry] the same way you look at Mr. Kaplan [the prosecutor]; what do you guys think? I\u2019m seeing nods, okay.\u201d\npressure to the top portion of the slide to allow it to move independently of the barrel. If the Beretta is pushed against the hand or other hard surface perpendicularly so that the slide and barrel moved in unison, the slide would not be able to be pushed so far out of battery as to disengage the hammer. In other words, when Kapelsohn performed the demonstration he pushed the Beretta against his hand at an angle and this affected the result.\n\n{\u00b659} In referring to the demonstration during closing argument, the prosecutor described the demonstration as a \u201ctrick\u201d:\n\nHe\u2019s holding his hand trying to push at the top of the slide to create the separation so he can get the trigger to go spongy [dead] like he showed and manipulated. * * * That\u2019s the problem I had with Kapelsohn and the extent that he went to try and cup the barrel and push against the slide so he can get the trigger in the position because when you\u2019re being fair about it when you\u2019re pushing it [the slide and barrel] together like a normal person would be you\u2019re not going to get it there [past a quarter inch]. That\u2019s a trick he\u2019s trying to pull on you, don\u2019t buy it.\n\n{\u00b660} The prosecutor\u2019s characterization of Kapelsohn\u2019s demonstration as a trick is within the permissible bounds for closing argument. This court has observed that \u201c[t]here is no requirement that a prosecutor\u2019s language must be neutral in its characterizations of the evidence or defense strategy.\u201d State v. Novak, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2003-L-077, 2005-Ohio-563, \u00b6 42 (the prosecutor described the defense strategy as a \u201cwhitewash\u201d he was trying to \u201csell\u201d the jury). In the present case, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the demonstration as a trick was no more pejorative (or improper) than was defense counsel\u2019s comments that \u201cthe government has told [Carol] what to say from the beginning\u201d and \u201cfrom December 24th, 2016 at approximately 8:30 p.m. this woman\u2019s been told and coached what to say.\u201d\nThe first assignment of error is without merit.\n\nIn his second and third assignments of error, Burry argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions and that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nThe manifest weight of the evidence and the sufficiency of the evidence are distinct legal concepts. *State v. Elmore*, 111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, 857 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 44. With respect to the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus, following *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nWhereas \u201csufficiency of the evidence is a test of adequacy as to whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support a verdict as a matter of law, * * * weight of the evidence addresses the evidence's effect of inducing belief.\u201d *State v. Wilson*, 113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, \u00b6 25, citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386-387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). \u201cIn other words, a reviewing court asks whose evidence is more persuasive -- the state's or the defendant's?\u201d *Id.* An appellate court considering whether a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence must consider all the evidence in the record, the reasonable inferences, the credibility of the witnesses, and whether, \u201cin resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction\nmust be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d *Thompkins* at 387, quoting *State v. Martin*, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\n\n{\u00b665} To convict Burry of Attempted Murder it was necessary for the State to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Burry purposely engaged in conduct that, if successful, would result in the death of another. R.C. 2903.02(A); R.C. 2923.02. To convict him of Felonious Assault, it was necessary to prove that he knowingly attempted to cause physical harm to another. R.C. 2903.11(A)(2). And to convict him of Kidnapping, it was necessary to prove that he, by force, restrained the liberty of another for the purpose of terrorizing or inflicting serious physical harm on her. R.C. 2905.01(A)(3).\n\n{\u00b666} There is no serious contention that the State failed to present evidence sufficient to convict Burry of the charges. There was evidence that he held Carol down and fired a loaded gun at her head and at her stomach. The real issue is whether the State\u2019s evidence is credible, thus implicating the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n{\u00b667} Burry raises issues with Carol\u2019s credibility, noting that she did not believe that the pistol was loaded at the time of the incident, did not claim that she had been held down in her initial statements to the police, and changed her account of events as to whether Burry held the magazine in his other hand and the number of clicks she heard when he pulled the trigger. Burry impugns Carol\u2019s credibility by noting that, after he allegedly threatened her life and the lives of her dogs, she remained on the couch watching television.\n\n{\u00b668} We find Carol\u2019s testimony to be credible, if not wholly consistent. It is evident that immediately after the assault she was confused as to what had happened.\nShe had no reason for believing that the gun was unloaded other than the fact that it did not fire. She also struggled with the fact that Burry had never been violent with her before.\n\n{\u00b669} The salient aspects of Carol's testimony are corroborated by other evidence. Kyle, who never doubted the Beretta was loaded, confirmed that Burry held Carol down while pointing the gun at her. Burry suggests that Kyle has also changed his testimony to conform to the State's theory of the crime. But there is no inconsistency between Carol's and Kyle's testimony that she was held down and their initial statements to the police. That Burry held Carol down is merely an additional detail that is consonant with the fact that Carol was sitting down on a couch when Burry put the gun to her head and stomach. He would have to have been standing over her or be physically on top of her to do this.\n\n{\u00b670} It is likewise significant that Carol was able to immediately locate the Beretta's magazine between the couch and ottoman, although she was unaware of the pistol's location in Burry's dresser drawer.\n\n{\u00b671} Burry emphasizes his expert witness' testimony that the possibility of the Beretta being out of battery twice within seconds of the trigger being pulled is extremely unlikely and that it is more probable that it was not loaded when Burry fired. Burry's theory of events, however, is not without its incredible elements. It presupposes Burry loading the Beretta after he had fired twice at Carol for reasons unknown, chambering a round, dropping the magazine in the living room, and then moving to his bedroom where he discharged the weapon. Under this theory, there is no obvious logic or reason behind Burry's actions. It fails to account for Carol's knowledge of the magazine's\nlocation (unless we assume she remained on the couch while Burry actually loaded the weapon and then waited for him to change his mind and discard the magazine). And it is inconsistent with Burry\u2019s own explanation of events from Sergeant Hirz\u2019 and Officer Subkowich\u2019s body cams.\n\n{\u00b672} Both parties\u2019 experts essentially agreed that the Beretta would not discharge if it was more than an eighth of an inch out of battery and that it could be put out of battery by pressing it against a person\u2019s body. The likelihood of the weapon being put out of battery by pressing against a person\u2019s forehead and stomach is especially for the jury to decide inasmuch as the jury was able to physically handle and manipulate the weapon in addition to witnessing the experts doing so.\n\n{\u00b673} On balance, we find that the greater amount of credible evidence supports Burry\u2019s convictions. The second and third assignments of error are without merit.\n\n{\u00b674} In his fourth and final assignment of error, Burry contends that his thirteen-year aggregate sentence is not supported by the record and is contrary to law.\n\n{\u00b675} \u201cThe court hearing an appeal [of a felony sentence] shall review the record, including the findings underlying the sentence or modification given by the sentencing court.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). \u201cThe appellate court may increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a sentence that is appealed under this section or may vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing * * * if it clearly and convincingly finds * * * [t]hat the record does not support the sentencing court\u2019s findings under division * * * (C)(4) of section 2929.14, or * * * [t]hat the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(a) and (b).\nWhere the sentence imposed does \u201cnot require the findings that R.C. 2953.08(G) specifically addresses * * *, it is fully consistent for appellate courts to review those sentences that are imposed solely after consideration of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 under a standard that is equally deferential to the sentencing court.\u201d State v. Marcum, 146 Ohio St.3d 516, 2016-Ohio-1002, 59 N.E.3d 1231, \u00b6 23. \u201cThat is, an appellate court may vacate or modify any sentence that is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law only if the appellate court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the record does not support the sentence.\u201d Id.\n\nFor a first-degree felony, the possible prison terms range from three to eleven years. R.C. 2929.14(A)(1). The Firearm Specification requires \u201ca prison term of three years\u201d to be served \u201cconsecutively to and prior to the prison term imposed for the underlying offense.\u201d R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(a)(ii) and (2)(d); R.C. 2941.145(A).\n\nBurry contends the trial court erred in finding that no factors under R.C. 2929.12(C) existed that made his offense less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense. Burry maintains that he showed genuine remorse as evidenced by his apology to Carol and Kyle at sentencing:\n\nCarol, I\u2019ve been waiting ten months to tell you how truly sorry I am for any pain or suffering I put you through that night. I constantly thank God that no one was hurt and killed. There is not a moment that I don\u2019t think about that night. It haunts me constantly. I hope someday you and Kyle and Todd can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nThe sentencing court did not find Burry\u2019s remorse genuine, or at least a mitigating factor, in light of Burry\u2019s claim to not remember pointing the gun at Carol:\n\nI did pick up on the fact that you remember certain aspects [of the night\u2019s events] in the presentence report as you related them to the probation officer and/or in writing and then indicate that you didn\u2019t\nremember most things because you blacked out. So I don\u2019t know which way it is. To me it\u2019s of no significance, the likelihood is you\u2019re at some point trying to minimize what happened **.5\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b634} Kapelsohn further opined to a \u201creasonable degree of certainty\u201d that if the pistol were pushed against someone\u2019s forehead with enough force to put it out of battery that it would leave a mark, \u201ca bruise or abrasion or something like that.\u201d\n\n{\u00b635} On September 21, 2017, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to Counts 1 (Attempted Murder), 2 (Attempted Murder), 3 (Felonious Assault), 4 (Felonious Assault), and 5 (Kidnapping) of the Indictment, all Counts including Firearm Specifications.\n\n{\u00b636} On October 25, 2017, a sentencing hearing was held. Prior to sentencing, the trial court merged all Counts into Count 1 (Attempted Murder). The court ordered Mr. Burry to serve a prison term of ten years for Attempted Murder and, consecutively, three years for the Firearm Specification; advised him of mandatory post release control for a period of five years; and ordered him to pay court costs and the costs of prosecution.\n\n{\u00b637} On October 27, 2017, Burry\u2019s sentence was memorialized in a Judgment Entry of Sentence.\n\n{\u00b638} On November 27, 2017, Burry filed a Notice of Appeal. On appeal, Burry raises the following assignments of error:\n\u201c[1.] The trial court violated the defendant-appellant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to fair trial, due process and confrontation when it barred a defense expert from testifying regarding a key issue, yet allowed the prosecutor to conduct a demonstration regarding the same issue during closing argument.\u201d\n\n\u201c[2.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant when it denied his motion for acquittal made pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A).\u201d\n\n\u201c[3.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant when it returned a verdict of guilty against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201c[4.] The trial court erred by sentencing the defendant-appellant to a thirteen-year prison term.\u201d\n\nBurry raises two arguments under his first assignment of error. The first argument is that the trial court erred by sustaining the State\u2019s objection to the defense expert, Kapelsohn, testifying regarding a soft wood experiment conducted prior to trial.\n\nWhile testifying on redirect examination regarding the issue of whether pressing the Beretta against Carol\u2019s forehead so as to put the weapon out of battery would have left a mark, Kapelsohn was asked if he had had \u201can opportunity to test this weapon about whether or not it would leave a mark on let\u2019s say a piece of soft wood?\u201d Kapelsohn answered that he did and began to explain the experiment when the State objected. The trial court sustained the objection having determined that, while Kapelsohn\u2019s expert report contained his opinion that pushing the Beretta against a person\u2019s forehead would leave a mark, the report did not disclose an experiment with a piece of wood which, apparently, was conducted after his report was turned over to the State.\nUnder the Rules of Criminal Procedure, \u201c[t]he defendant shall provide copies or photographs, or permit the prosecuting attorney to copy or photograph, * * * [the] [r]esults of * * * experiments or scientific tests.\u201d Crim.R. 16(H)(2).\n\n\u201cIf at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u201d Crim.R. 16(L)(1). This Rule \u201cvests in the trial court the discretion to determine the appropriate response for failure of a party to disclose material subject to a valid discovery request,\u201d and \u201c[r]eversible error exists only where the exercise of such authority by the trial court constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d State v. Wiles, 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 78, 571 N.E.2d 97 (1991); State v. Darmond, 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, 986 N.E.2d 971, \u00b6 20.\n\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision to prevent the defense expert from testifying regarding the soft wood experiment. Burry offered no explanation for the failure to disclose to the State that the experiment had been conducted. The issue of whether pushing a pistol against a person\u2019s forehead or stomach so as to put it out of battery would leave a mark was disputed at trial. The probative value of conducting an experiment with soft wood as a substitute for the human body is not immediately apparent. To allow Kapelsohn to testify regarding the results of such an experiment on redirect, when the State was unaware of either the methodology or the results of the experiment would have been unfair to the prosecution.\nThe case of *State v. Branham*, 104 Ohio App.3d 355, 662 N.E.2d 54 (12th Dist.1995), is comparable. In *Branham*, defense counsel had identified an expert witness in the pretrial discovery statement but did not disclose the details of an experiment \u201cinvolving the shooting of arrows into a pig skull stuffed with styrofoam.\u201d *Id.* at 361. \u201cTherefore, the trial court confined the expert\u2019s testimony to his expertise as developed through his experience and precluded testimony based upon the pig skull experiment.\u201d *Id.* The court of appeals affirmed, observing that \u201c[t]he trial court excluded only that expert testimony concerning the pig skull experiment,\u201d while \u201c[a]ll other testimony by the expert was permitted.\u201d *Id.* at 362. \u201cUnder the circumstances, the sanction imposed by the trial court is entirely consistent with the Criminal Rules and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d *Id.* Similarly in the present case, the trial court excluded only Kapelsohn\u2019s testimony regarding an experiment which had not been included in his expert report.2\n\nBurry\u2019s second argument under the first assignment of error is that the trial court, while preventing \u201chis expert witness from testifying regarding the results of a test that was key to his defense,\u201d nevertheless permitted \u201cthe prosecut[ing] attorney to essentially testify and conduct a presentation similar to the one the trial court barred his expert witness from presenting.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 15.\n\n\u201cWhere prosecutorial misconduct is alleged, the court must determine whether the remarks in closing argument were improper and, if so, whether the remarks prejudicially affected substantive rights of the defendant.\u201d *State v. Phillips*, 74 Ohio\n\n---\n\n2. Burry argues at length in his brief that the trial court misapplied Criminal Rule 16(K) (\u201c[f]ailure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert\u2019s testimony at trial.\u201d). The trial court did not cite to Rule 16(K) which does not properly apply to the present situation inasmuch as Kapelsohn did timely disclose his written report to the prosecution, albeit without mention of the soft wood experiment.\nSt.3d 72, 90, 656 N.E.2d 643 (1995). \u201cThe assessment of whether the permissible bounds of closing argument have been exceeded is, in the first instance, a discretionary function to be performed by the trial court.\u201d Pang v. Minch, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 559 N.E.2d 1313 (1990), paragraph three of the syllabus. \u201cSuch determination will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b651 During closing argument, and over the objection of defense counsel, the prosecutor demonstrated pointing the Beretta to his head to take it out of battery. He explained the demonstration to the court as follows:\n\nBy way of argument and by way of demonstrating things that are in evidence I\u2019m going to take that loaded pistol and I\u2019m going to take it cocked unloaded, I\u2019m going to press it into my forehead and create an out of battery situation and we\u2019re going to release and we\u2019ll see how long it takes to mark my forehead.\n\n\u00b652 Contrary to Burry\u2019s position, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s demonstration was not improper. There is no indication in the record that the demonstration was intended to be testimonial, i.e., by pressing the pistol against his forehead, the prosecutor was trying to convince rather than prove to the jury that the pistol could be put out of battery without leaving a mark. The demonstration was theatrical rather than evidentiary and the prosecutor anticipated that the jury would draw its own conclusions on the issue based on its own handling of the evidence.\n\n\u00b653 Before the jury, the prosecutor argued:\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nThe sentencing court did not find Burry\u2019s remorse genuine, or at least a mitigating factor, in light of Burry\u2019s claim to not remember pointing the gun at Carol:\n\nI did pick up on the fact that you remember certain aspects [of the night\u2019s events] in the presentence report as you related them to the probation officer and/or in writing and then indicate that you didn\u2019t\nremember most things because you blacked out. So I don\u2019t know which way it is. To me it\u2019s of no significance, the likelihood is you\u2019re at some point trying to minimize what happened **.5\n\n{\u00b680} Burry further cites as mitigating factors the fact that he worked for thirty-five years and led a law-abiding life; the stress of the impending divorce; his age (sixty-three at the time of sentencing); and his anxiety and depression. The sentencing court noted that Burry \u201ccharged Sergeant Hirz\u201d but Burry claims that, \u201con the bodycam, it appears that he was requesting a \u2018suicide by cop\u2019\u201d by standing up and telling the officers to shoot him.\n\n{\u00b681} With respect to Burry\u2019s remorse, it has been the position of this court to \u201cdefer to the trial court as to whether a defendant\u2019s remarks are indicative of genuine remorse because it is in the best position to make that determination.\u201d (Citation omitted.) State v. Sprott, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2016-A-0066, 2017-Ohio-1508, \u00b6 15. Moreover, even if Burry is deemed to be genuinely remorseful, \u201cthe trial court is not obligated * * * to give any particular weight or consideration to any sentencing factor.\u201d (Citation omitted.) State v. Pishner, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2017-P-0004, 2017-Ohio-8689, \u00b6 20. Rather, the court has \u201cfull discretion to impose a prison sentence within the statutory range.\u201d State v. Mathis, 109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, paragraph three of the syllabus; State v. Jones, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 103290 and 103302, 2018-Ohio-498, \u00b6 45 (\u201c[s]ince Marcum, a majority of districts have * * * recognized that appellate review is deferential\u201d) (cases cited).\n\n{\u00b682} In the present case, the sentencing court imposed a ten-year sentence, one year less than the possible maximum sentence for a first-degree felony. The court\n\n5. It is worth noting that from the moment Burry was subdued by police (before the ability to recall events was an issue) he denied that he had discharged a firearm and, when this claim became untenable, claimed to have discharged the weapon accidently without ever having pointed it at Carol.\nemphasized the psychological harm/\u201ctorment\u201d suffered by Carol and Burry\u2019s responsibility for causing the situation that evening (\u201cyou knew that taking that medication and mixing it with not only alcohol but a lot of alcohol *** was a combination that wasn\u2019t going to result in anything good\u201d). The court recognized Burry\u2019s lack of a criminal record and several letters of support received from friends and family but concluded, ultimately, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you get beyond the fact that other than that gun not going off because of the slide because it was out of battery [Carol] wouldn\u2019t be here and you\u2019d be in a whole different stretch of years that I would be considering right now.\u201d\n\n{\u00b683} In light of the foregoing we cannot conclude that the record does not clearly and convincingly support the sentence imposed.\n\n{\u00b684} The fourth assignment of error is without merit.\n\n{\u00b685} For the foregoing reasons, Burry\u2019s convictions and sentence in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.

{"Index": "078-Burry", "allegation": "The trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant when it denied his motion for acquittal made pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A).", "evidence": "Defendant-appellant, Robert P. Burry, appeals his convictions for Attempted Murder, Felonious Assault, and Kidnapping as well as his post-merger sentence for Attempted Murder following a jury trial in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas. The issues before this court are whether a trial court errs by preventing a defense expert from testifying to the results of an experiment when the fact that the experiment had been conducted was not disclosed to the prosecution; whether\na prosecutor commits prosecutorial misconduct by placing a gun against his forehead during closing argument to demonstrate an issue at trial; whether convictions for Attempted Murder, Felonious Assault, and Kidnapping are not supported by sufficient evidence and/or are against the weight of the evidence where the victim's testimony at trial is at variance with her initial statements to the police and where the defendant's expert testified to the unlikelihood of a gun being loaded when it is fired twice without discharging a bullet; and whether a thirteen-year sentence for Attempted Murder with a Firearm Specification is clearly and convincingly supported by the record based on the psychological harm caused the victim and the defendant's minimization of his conduct. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the court below.\n\n{\u00b62} On January 27, 2017, the Lake County Grand Jury indicted Burry of the following: two counts of Attempted Murder (Counts 1 and 2), felonies of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A) and R.C. 2923.02; two counts of Felonious Assault (Counts 3 and 4), felonies of the second degree in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2); Kidnapping (Count 5), a felony of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3); Domestic Violence (Count 6), a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A); Aggravated Menacing (Count 7), a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2903.21; Using Weapons While Intoxicated (Count 8), a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2923.15; and Resisting Arrest (Count 9), a misdemeanor of the second degree in violation of R.C. 2921.33(A). Counts 1 to 5 of the Indictment contained Firearm Specifications pursuant to R.C. 2941.145.\n\n{\u00b63} On February 3, 2017, Burry was arraigned and entered a plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d to the charges in the Indictment.\nBetween September 19 and 21, 2017, a jury trial was held. Prior to the commencement of trial, the State elected to dismiss Counts 6 to 9 of the Indictment. The following witness testimony was given at trial:\n\nSergeant Daniel Hirz of the Willowick Police Department testified that, at about 8:24 p.m. on Christmas Eve 2016, he responded to a call at the home of Robert and Carol Burry at 299 East 293rd Street. Upon arrival, Hirz observed: \u201cMrs. Burry at the end of the driveway crouched down behind the cars that were parked in the street. She was crying, a bit hysterical and she was just saying he tried to shoot me twice.\u201d Hirz entered the residence with his weapon drawn.\n\nSergeant Hirz met Burry in the hallway:\n\nI ordered him to the ground, I ordered to see his hands. Initially he showed me his hands and complied and was beginning to kneel down in compliance. * * * I saw he didn\u2019t have anything in his hands, I began to holster my weapon and he decided to get up and he said to shoot me, you mother and then he began to say the word fucker but since he was advancing on me I kicked him in the chest knocking him backwards which took the wind out of him. * * * [He] staggered backwards until he ran into the couch and sofa which kept him [from] falling over. Once he regained his balance Officer Sobkowich, who shortly came in the door right behind me * * * tased Mr. Burry striking him in the chest which dropped forward and on to the ground.\n\nThereupon, Burry was handcuffed. Sergeant Hirz noted that he was \u201chighly intoxicated.\u201d\n\nDuring the subsequent search of the residence: a magazine containing one bullet was found under the couch; a nine-millimeter shell casing was found in Burry\u2019s bedroom; a firearm was found in a drawer in Burry\u2019s bedroom; and a bullet hole was found, originating in Burry\u2019s bedroom, passing through another bedroom, and exiting the house.\nA video taken from Sergeant Hirz\u2019 body cam was played for the jury. In the video, Hirz asks Carol if Burry fired the gun at her and she responded that there were no bullets in it. She stated he \u201cstuck it right to my [indicating her forehead].\u201d Carol then advised Hirz that there was a gun that did go off, apparently believing it was a different gun.\n\nAfter being subdued, Burry denied that there was a firearm and that he did \u201canything.\u201d Several minutes later, he admitted that a gun had gone off but he denied pointing the gun at anybody and claimed he would never hurt his wife.\n\nPrior to taking their written statements, Sergeant Hirz interviewed Carol and her son (Burry\u2019s stepson), Kyle Johnson, in the basement of the home. Carol recalled that Burry threatened to kill her dogs and asked if she would like to die tonight. She repeated, indicating with her hands, that the gun was pointed at her head and belly and that he pulled the trigger. She claimed, \u201che didn\u2019t know if there could have been a bullet in there.\u201d Kyle interrupted and said, \u201cthere was.\u201d She continued, \u201che didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nOfficer Shaun Kovacic of the Willowick Police Department testified that he responded to the Christmas Eve call to the Burry residence and entered the home after Sergeant Hirz. After Mr. Burry was subdued, Kovacic searched his bedroom. He found a spent shell casing on the floor and a pistol in a dresser drawer. Kovacic also noted a bullet hole in the bedroom which led into another bedroom and finally through the exterior wall of the house.\n\nOfficer Steven Sobkowich of the Willowick Police Department responded to the Christmas Eve call to the Burry residence. His testimony corroborated Sergeant\nHirz\u2019 version of events. Sobkowich noted powder residue on Mr. Burry\u2019s left hand. A video taken from Sobkowich\u2019s body cam was played for the jury.\n\n{\u00b613} On the Officer Sobkowich video, Burry admits that he went to his room and loaded the Beretta and that there were two bullets in the magazine. He claimed that when he pulled the slide the gun went off accidentally. Burry denied that he ever pointed the gun at Carol.\n\n{\u00b614} Kyle Johnson was living with his mother (Carol) and stepfather (Robert Burry) in 2016. He testified that he, Burry, and Carol kept guns in the house. Burry kept his guns \u201cready to go with a clip, a magazine filled and in the gun with the safety off\u201d and \u201calways close by *** to a bed or a dresser.\u201d\n\n{\u00b615} Carol and Burry\u2019s marriage had been deteriorating and the couple argued frequently. Carol wanted a divorce and had made arrangements to move into an apartment. Kyle would remain in the home with Burry until it could be sold.\n\n{\u00b616} During the afternoon on Christmas Eve, Kyle and Carol were watching a movie while Burry was out having a couple of beers with a friend. Burry returned home, \u201cvisibly drunk,\u201d and wanted to open gifts. He became very angry while waiting for the movie to finish. Burry began to badger Carol about the impending divorce while his mood swung from angry to sad. For the first time that he could recall, Kyle heard Burry become \u201cverbally abusive\u201d toward Carol, calling her a \u201ctraitor\u201d and a \u201cpiece of shit.\u201d Kyle retired to his room as the argument continued for about ten minutes.\n\n{\u00b617} Eventually, Burry went to his room and Carol watched television. Kyle next heard the safe in Carol\u2019s room where guns were kept make a \u201cclanging\u201d noise. Kyle testified: \u201cThe next sound I heard was Bob rush[ing] out of the room and then\nimmediately after that I heard my mother calling my name and screaming Kyle, help, help, call the police.\u201d\n\nKyle called 911 and walked to the living room and observed the following:\n\nI saw Bob holding my mother down with his left hand, the Beretta in his right hand directly on her forehead. *** She was kicking and screaming and *** as I moved closer, she kicked, was able to kick him off of her for a moment. In that moment the gun was pointed in my direction. *** I moved toward the stairs. As Bob saw me move towards the stairs he moved his attention back towards my mom. *** As I was describing to the dispatcher what was going on above me *** my mother said you shot me, Bob, how could you shoot me right in the stomach. I became really scared at that moment and a little confused because at that point I hadn\u2019t heard a shot yet. *** I heard lots of footsteps, I heard doors slamming, *** and then I heard a shot in the house.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nWhereas \u201csufficiency of the evidence is a test of adequacy as to whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support a verdict as a matter of law, * * * weight of the evidence addresses the evidence's effect of inducing belief.\u201d *State v. Wilson*, 113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, \u00b6 25, citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386-387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). \u201cIn other words, a reviewing court asks whose evidence is more persuasive -- the state's or the defendant's?\u201d *Id.* An appellate court considering whether a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence must consider all the evidence in the record, the reasonable inferences, the credibility of the witnesses, and whether, \u201cin resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction\nmust be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d *Thompkins* at 387, quoting *State v. Martin*, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\n\n{\u00b665} To convict Burry of Attempted Murder it was necessary for the State to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Burry purposely engaged in conduct that, if successful, would result in the death of another. R.C. 2903.02(A); R.C. 2923.02. To convict him of Felonious Assault, it was necessary to prove that he knowingly attempted to cause physical harm to another. R.C. 2903.11(A)(2). And to convict him of Kidnapping, it was necessary to prove that he, by force, restrained the liberty of another for the purpose of terrorizing or inflicting serious physical harm on her. R.C. 2905.01(A)(3).\n\n{\u00b666} There is no serious contention that the State failed to present evidence sufficient to convict Burry of the charges. There was evidence that he held Carol down and fired a loaded gun at her head and at her stomach. The real issue is whether the State\u2019s evidence is credible, thus implicating the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n{\u00b667} Burry raises issues with Carol\u2019s credibility, noting that she did not believe that the pistol was loaded at the time of the incident, did not claim that she had been held down in her initial statements to the police, and changed her account of events as to whether Burry held the magazine in his other hand and the number of clicks she heard when he pulled the trigger. Burry impugns Carol\u2019s credibility by noting that, after he allegedly threatened her life and the lives of her dogs, she remained on the couch watching television.\n\n{\u00b668} We find Carol\u2019s testimony to be credible, if not wholly consistent. It is evident that immediately after the assault she was confused as to what had happened.\nShe had no reason for believing that the gun was unloaded other than the fact that it did not fire. She also struggled with the fact that Burry had never been violent with her before.\n\n{\u00b669} The salient aspects of Carol's testimony are corroborated by other evidence. Kyle, who never doubted the Beretta was loaded, confirmed that Burry held Carol down while pointing the gun at her. Burry suggests that Kyle has also changed his testimony to conform to the State's theory of the crime. But there is no inconsistency between Carol's and Kyle's testimony that she was held down and their initial statements to the police. That Burry held Carol down is merely an additional detail that is consonant with the fact that Carol was sitting down on a couch when Burry put the gun to her head and stomach. He would have to have been standing over her or be physically on top of her to do this.\n\n{\u00b670} It is likewise significant that Carol was able to immediately locate the Beretta's magazine between the couch and ottoman, although she was unaware of the pistol's location in Burry's dresser drawer.\n\n{\u00b671} Burry emphasizes his expert witness' testimony that the possibility of the Beretta being out of battery twice within seconds of the trigger being pulled is extremely unlikely and that it is more probable that it was not loaded when Burry fired. Burry's theory of events, however, is not without its incredible elements. It presupposes Burry loading the Beretta after he had fired twice at Carol for reasons unknown, chambering a round, dropping the magazine in the living room, and then moving to his bedroom where he discharged the weapon. Under this theory, there is no obvious logic or reason behind Burry's actions. It fails to account for Carol's knowledge of the magazine's\nlocation (unless we assume she remained on the couch while Burry actually loaded the weapon and then waited for him to change his mind and discard the magazine). And it is inconsistent with Burry\u2019s own explanation of events from Sergeant Hirz\u2019 and Officer Subkowich\u2019s body cams.\n\n{\u00b672} Both parties\u2019 experts essentially agreed that the Beretta would not discharge if it was more than an eighth of an inch out of battery and that it could be put out of battery by pressing it against a person\u2019s body. The likelihood of the weapon being put out of battery by pressing against a person\u2019s forehead and stomach is especially for the jury to decide inasmuch as the jury was able to physically handle and manipulate the weapon in addition to witnessing the experts doing so.\n\n{\u00b673} On balance, we find that the greater amount of credible evidence supports Burry\u2019s convictions. The second and third assignments of error are without merit.\n\n{\u00b674} In his fourth and final assignment of error, Burry contends that his thirteen-year aggregate sentence is not supported by the record and is contrary to law.\n\n{\u00b675} \u201cThe court hearing an appeal [of a felony sentence] shall review the record, including the findings underlying the sentence or modification given by the sentencing court.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). \u201cThe appellate court may increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a sentence that is appealed under this section or may vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing * * * if it clearly and convincingly finds * * * [t]hat the record does not support the sentencing court\u2019s findings under division * * * (C)(4) of section 2929.14, or * * * [t]hat the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(a) and (b).\nWhere the sentence imposed does \u201cnot require the findings that R.C. 2953.08(G) specifically addresses * * *, it is fully consistent for appellate courts to review those sentences that are imposed solely after consideration of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 under a standard that is equally deferential to the sentencing court.\u201d State v. Marcum, 146 Ohio St.3d 516, 2016-Ohio-1002, 59 N.E.3d 1231, \u00b6 23. \u201cThat is, an appellate court may vacate or modify any sentence that is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law only if the appellate court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the record does not support the sentence.\u201d Id.\n\nFor a first-degree felony, the possible prison terms range from three to eleven years. R.C. 2929.14(A)(1). The Firearm Specification requires \u201ca prison term of three years\u201d to be served \u201cconsecutively to and prior to the prison term imposed for the underlying offense.\u201d R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(a)(ii) and (2)(d); R.C. 2941.145(A).\n\nBurry contends the trial court erred in finding that no factors under R.C. 2929.12(C) existed that made his offense less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense. Burry maintains that he showed genuine remorse as evidenced by his apology to Carol and Kyle at sentencing:\n\nCarol, I\u2019ve been waiting ten months to tell you how truly sorry I am for any pain or suffering I put you through that night. I constantly thank God that no one was hurt and killed. There is not a moment that I don\u2019t think about that night. It haunts me constantly. I hope someday you and Kyle and Todd can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nThe sentencing court did not find Burry\u2019s remorse genuine, or at least a mitigating factor, in light of Burry\u2019s claim to not remember pointing the gun at Carol:\n\nI did pick up on the fact that you remember certain aspects [of the night\u2019s events] in the presentence report as you related them to the probation officer and/or in writing and then indicate that you didn\u2019t\nremember most things because you blacked out. So I don\u2019t know which way it is. To me it\u2019s of no significance, the likelihood is you\u2019re at some point trying to minimize what happened **.5\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b634} Kapelsohn further opined to a \u201creasonable degree of certainty\u201d that if the pistol were pushed against someone\u2019s forehead with enough force to put it out of battery that it would leave a mark, \u201ca bruise or abrasion or something like that.\u201d\n\n{\u00b635} On September 21, 2017, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to Counts 1 (Attempted Murder), 2 (Attempted Murder), 3 (Felonious Assault), 4 (Felonious Assault), and 5 (Kidnapping) of the Indictment, all Counts including Firearm Specifications.\n\n{\u00b636} On October 25, 2017, a sentencing hearing was held. Prior to sentencing, the trial court merged all Counts into Count 1 (Attempted Murder). The court ordered Mr. Burry to serve a prison term of ten years for Attempted Murder and, consecutively, three years for the Firearm Specification; advised him of mandatory post release control for a period of five years; and ordered him to pay court costs and the costs of prosecution.\n\n{\u00b637} On October 27, 2017, Burry\u2019s sentence was memorialized in a Judgment Entry of Sentence.\n\n{\u00b638} On November 27, 2017, Burry filed a Notice of Appeal. On appeal, Burry raises the following assignments of error:\n\u201c[1.] The trial court violated the defendant-appellant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to fair trial, due process and confrontation when it barred a defense expert from testifying regarding a key issue, yet allowed the prosecutor to conduct a demonstration regarding the same issue during closing argument.\u201d\n\n\u201c[2.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant when it denied his motion for acquittal made pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A).\u201d\n\n\u201c[3.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant when it returned a verdict of guilty against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201c[4.] The trial court erred by sentencing the defendant-appellant to a thirteen-year prison term.\u201d\n\nBurry raises two arguments under his first assignment of error. The first argument is that the trial court erred by sustaining the State\u2019s objection to the defense expert, Kapelsohn, testifying regarding a soft wood experiment conducted prior to trial.\n\nWhile testifying on redirect examination regarding the issue of whether pressing the Beretta against Carol\u2019s forehead so as to put the weapon out of battery would have left a mark, Kapelsohn was asked if he had had \u201can opportunity to test this weapon about whether or not it would leave a mark on let\u2019s say a piece of soft wood?\u201d Kapelsohn answered that he did and began to explain the experiment when the State objected. The trial court sustained the objection having determined that, while Kapelsohn\u2019s expert report contained his opinion that pushing the Beretta against a person\u2019s forehead would leave a mark, the report did not disclose an experiment with a piece of wood which, apparently, was conducted after his report was turned over to the State.\nUnder the Rules of Criminal Procedure, \u201c[t]he defendant shall provide copies or photographs, or permit the prosecuting attorney to copy or photograph, * * * [the] [r]esults of * * * experiments or scientific tests.\u201d Crim.R. 16(H)(2).\n\n\u201cIf at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u201d Crim.R. 16(L)(1). This Rule \u201cvests in the trial court the discretion to determine the appropriate response for failure of a party to disclose material subject to a valid discovery request,\u201d and \u201c[r]eversible error exists only where the exercise of such authority by the trial court constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d State v. Wiles, 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 78, 571 N.E.2d 97 (1991); State v. Darmond, 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, 986 N.E.2d 971, \u00b6 20.\n\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision to prevent the defense expert from testifying regarding the soft wood experiment. Burry offered no explanation for the failure to disclose to the State that the experiment had been conducted. The issue of whether pushing a pistol against a person\u2019s forehead or stomach so as to put it out of battery would leave a mark was disputed at trial. The probative value of conducting an experiment with soft wood as a substitute for the human body is not immediately apparent. To allow Kapelsohn to testify regarding the results of such an experiment on redirect, when the State was unaware of either the methodology or the results of the experiment would have been unfair to the prosecution.\nThe case of *State v. Branham*, 104 Ohio App.3d 355, 662 N.E.2d 54 (12th Dist.1995), is comparable. In *Branham*, defense counsel had identified an expert witness in the pretrial discovery statement but did not disclose the details of an experiment \u201cinvolving the shooting of arrows into a pig skull stuffed with styrofoam.\u201d *Id.* at 361. \u201cTherefore, the trial court confined the expert\u2019s testimony to his expertise as developed through his experience and precluded testimony based upon the pig skull experiment.\u201d *Id.* The court of appeals affirmed, observing that \u201c[t]he trial court excluded only that expert testimony concerning the pig skull experiment,\u201d while \u201c[a]ll other testimony by the expert was permitted.\u201d *Id.* at 362. \u201cUnder the circumstances, the sanction imposed by the trial court is entirely consistent with the Criminal Rules and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d *Id.* Similarly in the present case, the trial court excluded only Kapelsohn\u2019s testimony regarding an experiment which had not been included in his expert report.2\n\nBurry\u2019s second argument under the first assignment of error is that the trial court, while preventing \u201chis expert witness from testifying regarding the results of a test that was key to his defense,\u201d nevertheless permitted \u201cthe prosecut[ing] attorney to essentially testify and conduct a presentation similar to the one the trial court barred his expert witness from presenting.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 15.\n\n\u201cWhere prosecutorial misconduct is alleged, the court must determine whether the remarks in closing argument were improper and, if so, whether the remarks prejudicially affected substantive rights of the defendant.\u201d *State v. Phillips*, 74 Ohio\n\n---\n\n2. Burry argues at length in his brief that the trial court misapplied Criminal Rule 16(K) (\u201c[f]ailure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert\u2019s testimony at trial.\u201d). The trial court did not cite to Rule 16(K) which does not properly apply to the present situation inasmuch as Kapelsohn did timely disclose his written report to the prosecution, albeit without mention of the soft wood experiment.\nSt.3d 72, 90, 656 N.E.2d 643 (1995). \u201cThe assessment of whether the permissible bounds of closing argument have been exceeded is, in the first instance, a discretionary function to be performed by the trial court.\u201d Pang v. Minch, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 559 N.E.2d 1313 (1990), paragraph three of the syllabus. \u201cSuch determination will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b651 During closing argument, and over the objection of defense counsel, the prosecutor demonstrated pointing the Beretta to his head to take it out of battery. He explained the demonstration to the court as follows:\n\nBy way of argument and by way of demonstrating things that are in evidence I\u2019m going to take that loaded pistol and I\u2019m going to take it cocked unloaded, I\u2019m going to press it into my forehead and create an out of battery situation and we\u2019re going to release and we\u2019ll see how long it takes to mark my forehead.\n\n\u00b652 Contrary to Burry\u2019s position, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s demonstration was not improper. There is no indication in the record that the demonstration was intended to be testimonial, i.e., by pressing the pistol against his forehead, the prosecutor was trying to convince rather than prove to the jury that the pistol could be put out of battery without leaving a mark. The demonstration was theatrical rather than evidentiary and the prosecutor anticipated that the jury would draw its own conclusions on the issue based on its own handling of the evidence.\n\n\u00b653 Before the jury, the prosecutor argued:\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b652 Contrary to Burry\u2019s position, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s demonstration was not improper.

The demonstration was theatrical rather than evidentiary and the prosecutor anticipated that the jury would draw its own conclusions on the issue based on its own handling of the evidence.\n\n\u00b653 Before the jury, the prosecutor argued:\n\nNow there is a question about whether or not you press this into someone\u2019s forehead and it\u2019s going to cause some sort of injury, cause some sort of mark that\u2019s going to be obvious or visible. I\u2019m going to do something for you because I mean really you got to make a decision how you handle the evidence. *** But I\u2019d like to save you from putting this thing to your own head like I\u2019m about to do ***. I\u2019m not going to know if there is a mark on my head, I\u2019m not going to know if it disappears by the time I\u2019m done talking [to]\nyou. *** This is a .9 millimeter weapon, you'll see when you get back to the jury room it doesn't take a lot of force to put that out of battery. *** And I think when you have that weapon back there you'll find that is something because you're going to be pressing it into your head just like I did.\n\n*Compare State v. Naples*, 94 Ohio App. 33, 114 N.E.2d 302 (7th Dist.1952), paragraph four of the syllabus (\u201c[i]t is not misconduct resulting in prejudicial error for the prosecuting attorney in the trial of an accused for assault with intent to kill *** to refer to and demonstrate the use of a sawed-off billiard cue on the person of the prosecuting witness, there being no evidence that such billiard cue was used in the assault * * *, where such remarks merely constituted the prosecutor's interpretation of the facts as he knew them\u201d).\n\n{\u00b654} It is worth noting that the Beretta was repeatedly pressed against the human body to put it out of battery \u2013 by Silverstein, by Kapelsohn, and by the prosecutor3 \u2013 during trial but never with the understanding that such demonstration constituted a scientific test or experiment with evidentiary value. During his cross examination, Kapelsohn commented that he still had a mark on his hand forty-five minutes after using his hand to put it out of battery. The prosecutor commented that his hand did not have a mark, but recognized that whether a mark is made \u201cdepends on the individual's biology * * * [and] a million things that neither one of us have any business talking about with any expertise.\u201d\n\n{\u00b655} Lastly, the trial court duly instructed the jury both before and after trial that the closing arguments of counsel are \u201cdesigned to assist\u201d the jury in its deliberations but are not evidence. *Pang*, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 559 N.E.2d 1313, at paragraph four of the\n\n---\n\n3. The prosecutor pushed the Beretta against his hand to put it out of battery during his cross examination of Kapelsohn after Kapelsohn had made the same demonstration during direct examination.\nsyllabus (\"[a] presumption always exists that the jury has followed the instructions given to it by the trial court\").\n\n{\u00b656} Burry also claims the prosecutor improperly held himself out as an expert by explaining that he had firearms experience from his time in the Marine Corps and that one of the reasons he was brought on the case was because of his \u201cexpertise\u201d in handling firearms. Appellant\u2019s brief at 13.\n\n{\u00b657} The context of these comments readily demonstrates that the prosecutor was not holding himself out before the jury as an expert witness. Both comments occurred during the voir dire of the jury. In one instance, the prosecutor responded to a juror\u2019s statement that his experience and knowledge came from the \u201cU.S. Army\u201d with \u201cthat\u2019s my same experience in the Marine Corps.\u201d In the other instance, the prosecutor mentioned his \u201cexpertise\u201d to assure the jury that \u201cwe would handle this firearm [the Beretta] safely\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019re going to follow the safety things that everyone * * * is taught from the get go.\u201d\n\n{\u00b658} Burry\u2019s final argument under this assignment of error is that the prosecutor improperly claimed \u201cthat the defense expert was \u2018tricking\u2019 the jury.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 14. The prosecutor was referring to Kapelsohn\u2019s demonstration of how the Beretta would not be able to release its hammer (have a \u201cdead trigger\u201d) if it was put a quarter inch or more out of battery. On cross examination, the prosecutor had Kapelsohn admit that in order to achieve this result it was necessary for him to tilt his hand and apply\n\n4. Counsel for Burry likewise addressed the issue during voir dire: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that I\u2019m an expert. I can tell you that I\u2019m knowledgeable on the subject. I can tell you I\u2019ve been trained. I can tell you I\u2019ve been to the range. I can tell you I\u2019ve had several hours of shooting range practice and I\u2019ve done the course and I know the laws associated with the weapons and firing the weapons but are you able to kind of, can you look at me, can you look at Bob [Burry] the same way you look at Mr. Kaplan [the prosecutor]; what do you guys think? I\u2019m seeing nods, okay.\u201d\npressure to the top portion of the slide to allow it to move independently of the barrel. If the Beretta is pushed against the hand or other hard surface perpendicularly so that the slide and barrel moved in unison, the slide would not be able to be pushed so far out of battery as to disengage the hammer. In other words, when Kapelsohn performed the demonstration he pushed the Beretta against his hand at an angle and this affected the result.\n\n{\u00b659} In referring to the demonstration during closing argument, the prosecutor described the demonstration as a \u201ctrick\u201d:\n\nHe\u2019s holding his hand trying to push at the top of the slide to create the separation so he can get the trigger to go spongy [dead] like he showed and manipulated. * * * That\u2019s the problem I had with Kapelsohn and the extent that he went to try and cup the barrel and push against the slide so he can get the trigger in the position because when you\u2019re being fair about it when you\u2019re pushing it [the slide and barrel] together like a normal person would be you\u2019re not going to get it there [past a quarter inch]. That\u2019s a trick he\u2019s trying to pull on you, don\u2019t buy it.\n\n{\u00b660} The prosecutor\u2019s characterization of Kapelsohn\u2019s demonstration as a trick is within the permissible bounds for closing argument. This court has observed that \u201c[t]here is no requirement that a prosecutor\u2019s language must be neutral in its characterizations of the evidence or defense strategy.\u201d State v. Novak, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2003-L-077, 2005-Ohio-563, \u00b6 42 (the prosecutor described the defense strategy as a \u201cwhitewash\u201d he was trying to \u201csell\u201d the jury). In the present case, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the demonstration as a trick was no more pejorative (or improper) than was defense counsel\u2019s comments that \u201cthe government has told [Carol] what to say from the beginning\u201d and \u201cfrom December 24th, 2016 at approximately 8:30 p.m. this woman\u2019s been told and coached what to say.\u201d\nThe first assignment of error is without merit.\n\nIn his second and third assignments of error, Burry argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions and that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nThe manifest weight of the evidence and the sufficiency of the evidence are distinct legal concepts. *State v. Elmore*, 111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, 857 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 44. With respect to the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus, following *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nThe sentencing court did not find Burry\u2019s remorse genuine, or at least a mitigating factor, in light of Burry\u2019s claim to not remember pointing the gun at Carol:\n\nI did pick up on the fact that you remember certain aspects [of the night\u2019s events] in the presentence report as you related them to the probation officer and/or in writing and then indicate that you didn\u2019t\nremember most things because you blacked out. So I don\u2019t know which way it is. To me it\u2019s of no significance, the likelihood is you\u2019re at some point trying to minimize what happened **.5\n\n{\u00b680} Burry further cites as mitigating factors the fact that he worked for thirty-five years and led a law-abiding life; the stress of the impending divorce; his age (sixty-three at the time of sentencing); and his anxiety and depression. The sentencing court noted that Burry \u201ccharged Sergeant Hirz\u201d but Burry claims that, \u201con the bodycam, it appears that he was requesting a \u2018suicide by cop\u2019\u201d by standing up and telling the officers to shoot him.\n\n{\u00b681} With respect to Burry\u2019s remorse, it has been the position of this court to \u201cdefer to the trial court as to whether a defendant\u2019s remarks are indicative of genuine remorse because it is in the best position to make that determination.\u201d (Citation omitted.) State v. Sprott, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2016-A-0066, 2017-Ohio-1508, \u00b6 15. Moreover, even if Burry is deemed to be genuinely remorseful, \u201cthe trial court is not obligated * * * to give any particular weight or consideration to any sentencing factor.\u201d (Citation omitted.) State v. Pishner, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2017-P-0004, 2017-Ohio-8689, \u00b6 20. Rather, the court has \u201cfull discretion to impose a prison sentence within the statutory range.\u201d State v. Mathis, 109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, paragraph three of the syllabus; State v. Jones, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 103290 and 103302, 2018-Ohio-498, \u00b6 45 (\u201c[s]ince Marcum, a majority of districts have * * * recognized that appellate review is deferential\u201d) (cases cited).\n\n{\u00b682} In the present case, the sentencing court imposed a ten-year sentence, one year less than the possible maximum sentence for a first-degree felony. The court\n\n5. It is worth noting that from the moment Burry was subdued by police (before the ability to recall events was an issue) he denied that he had discharged a firearm and, when this claim became untenable, claimed to have discharged the weapon accidently without ever having pointed it at Carol.\nemphasized the psychological harm/\u201ctorment\u201d suffered by Carol and Burry\u2019s responsibility for causing the situation that evening (\u201cyou knew that taking that medication and mixing it with not only alcohol but a lot of alcohol *** was a combination that wasn\u2019t going to result in anything good\u201d). The court recognized Burry\u2019s lack of a criminal record and several letters of support received from friends and family but concluded, ultimately, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you get beyond the fact that other than that gun not going off because of the slide because it was out of battery [Carol] wouldn\u2019t be here and you\u2019d be in a whole different stretch of years that I would be considering right now.\u201d\n\n{\u00b683} In light of the foregoing we cannot conclude that the record does not clearly and convincingly support the sentence imposed.\n\n{\u00b684} The fourth assignment of error is without merit.\n\n{\u00b685} For the foregoing reasons, Burry\u2019s convictions and sentence in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.

For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the court below.\n\n{\u00b62} On January 27, 2017, the Lake County Grand Jury indicted Burry of the following: two counts of Attempted Murder (Counts 1 and 2), felonies of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A) and R.C. 2923.02; two counts of Felonious Assault (Counts 3 and 4), felonies of the second degree in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2); Kidnapping (Count 5), a felony of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3); Domestic Violence (Count 6), a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A); Aggravated Menacing (Count 7), a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2903.21; Using Weapons While Intoxicated (Count 8), a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2923.15; and Resisting Arrest (Count 9), a misdemeanor of the second degree in violation of R.C. 2921.33(A). Counts 1 to 5 of the Indictment contained Firearm Specifications pursuant to R.C. 2941.145.\n\n{\u00b63} On February 3, 2017, Burry was arraigned and entered a plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d to the charges in the Indictment.\nBetween September 19 and 21, 2017, a jury trial was held. Prior to the commencement of trial, the State elected to dismiss Counts 6 to 9 of the Indictment. The following witness testimony was given at trial:\n\nSergeant Daniel Hirz of the Willowick Police Department testified that, at about 8:24 p.m. on Christmas Eve 2016, he responded to a call at the home of Robert and Carol Burry at 299 East 293rd Street. Upon arrival, Hirz observed: \u201cMrs. Burry at the end of the driveway crouched down behind the cars that were parked in the street. She was crying, a bit hysterical and she was just saying he tried to shoot me twice.\u201d Hirz entered the residence with his weapon drawn.\n\nSergeant Hirz met Burry in the hallway:\n\nI ordered him to the ground, I ordered to see his hands. Initially he showed me his hands and complied and was beginning to kneel down in compliance. * * * I saw he didn\u2019t have anything in his hands, I began to holster my weapon and he decided to get up and he said to shoot me, you mother and then he began to say the word fucker but since he was advancing on me I kicked him in the chest knocking him backwards which took the wind out of him. * * * [He] staggered backwards until he ran into the couch and sofa which kept him [from] falling over. Once he regained his balance Officer Sobkowich, who shortly came in the door right behind me * * * tased Mr. Burry striking him in the chest which dropped forward and on to the ground.\n\nThereupon, Burry was handcuffed. Sergeant Hirz noted that he was \u201chighly intoxicated.\u201d\n\nDuring the subsequent search of the residence: a magazine containing one bullet was found under the couch; a nine-millimeter shell casing was found in Burry\u2019s bedroom; a firearm was found in a drawer in Burry\u2019s bedroom; and a bullet hole was found, originating in Burry\u2019s bedroom, passing through another bedroom, and exiting the house.\nA video taken from Sergeant Hirz\u2019 body cam was played for the jury. In the video, Hirz asks Carol if Burry fired the gun at her and she responded that there were no bullets in it. She stated he \u201cstuck it right to my [indicating her forehead].\u201d Carol then advised Hirz that there was a gun that did go off, apparently believing it was a different gun.\n\nAfter being subdued, Burry denied that there was a firearm and that he did \u201canything.\u201d Several minutes later, he admitted that a gun had gone off but he denied pointing the gun at anybody and claimed he would never hurt his wife.\n\nPrior to taking their written statements, Sergeant Hirz interviewed Carol and her son (Burry\u2019s stepson), Kyle Johnson, in the basement of the home. Carol recalled that Burry threatened to kill her dogs and asked if she would like to die tonight. She repeated, indicating with her hands, that the gun was pointed at her head and belly and that he pulled the trigger. She claimed, \u201che didn\u2019t know if there could have been a bullet in there.\u201d Kyle interrupted and said, \u201cthere was.\u201d She continued, \u201che didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nOfficer Shaun Kovacic of the Willowick Police Department testified that he responded to the Christmas Eve call to the Burry residence and entered the home after Sergeant Hirz. After Mr. Burry was subdued, Kovacic searched his bedroom. He found a spent shell casing on the floor and a pistol in a dresser drawer. Kovacic also noted a bullet hole in the bedroom which led into another bedroom and finally through the exterior wall of the house.\n\nOfficer Steven Sobkowich of the Willowick Police Department responded to the Christmas Eve call to the Burry residence. His testimony corroborated Sergeant\nHirz\u2019 version of events. Sobkowich noted powder residue on Mr. Burry\u2019s left hand. A video taken from Sobkowich\u2019s body cam was played for the jury.\n\n{\u00b613} On the Officer Sobkowich video, Burry admits that he went to his room and loaded the Beretta and that there were two bullets in the magazine. He claimed that when he pulled the slide the gun went off accidentally. Burry denied that he ever pointed the gun at Carol.\n\n{\u00b614} Kyle Johnson was living with his mother (Carol) and stepfather (Robert Burry) in 2016. He testified that he, Burry, and Carol kept guns in the house. Burry kept his guns \u201cready to go with a clip, a magazine filled and in the gun with the safety off\u201d and \u201calways close by *** to a bed or a dresser.\u201d\n\n{\u00b615} Carol and Burry\u2019s marriage had been deteriorating and the couple argued frequently. Carol wanted a divorce and had made arrangements to move into an apartment. Kyle would remain in the home with Burry until it could be sold.\n\n{\u00b616} During the afternoon on Christmas Eve, Kyle and Carol were watching a movie while Burry was out having a couple of beers with a friend. Burry returned home, \u201cvisibly drunk,\u201d and wanted to open gifts. He became very angry while waiting for the movie to finish. Burry began to badger Carol about the impending divorce while his mood swung from angry to sad. For the first time that he could recall, Kyle heard Burry become \u201cverbally abusive\u201d toward Carol, calling her a \u201ctraitor\u201d and a \u201cpiece of shit.\u201d Kyle retired to his room as the argument continued for about ten minutes.\n\n{\u00b617} Eventually, Burry went to his room and Carol watched television. Kyle next heard the safe in Carol\u2019s room where guns were kept make a \u201cclanging\u201d noise. Kyle testified: \u201cThe next sound I heard was Bob rush[ing] out of the room and then\nimmediately after that I heard my mother calling my name and screaming Kyle, help, help, call the police.\u201d\n\nKyle called 911 and walked to the living room and observed the following:\n\nI saw Bob holding my mother down with his left hand, the Beretta in his right hand directly on her forehead. *** She was kicking and screaming and *** as I moved closer, she kicked, was able to kick him off of her for a moment. In that moment the gun was pointed in my direction. *** I moved toward the stairs. As Bob saw me move towards the stairs he moved his attention back towards my mom. *** As I was describing to the dispatcher what was going on above me *** my mother said you shot me, Bob, how could you shoot me right in the stomach. I became really scared at that moment and a little confused because at that point I hadn\u2019t heard a shot yet. *** I heard lots of footsteps, I heard doors slamming, *** and then I heard a shot in the house.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nWhereas \u201csufficiency of the evidence is a test of adequacy as to whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support a verdict as a matter of law, * * * weight of the evidence addresses the evidence's effect of inducing belief.\u201d *State v. Wilson*, 113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, \u00b6 25, citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386-387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). \u201cIn other words, a reviewing court asks whose evidence is more persuasive -- the state's or the defendant's?\u201d *Id.* An appellate court considering whether a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence must consider all the evidence in the record, the reasonable inferences, the credibility of the witnesses, and whether, \u201cin resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction\nmust be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d *Thompkins* at 387, quoting *State v. Martin*, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\n\n{\u00b665} To convict Burry of Attempted Murder it was necessary for the State to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Burry purposely engaged in conduct that, if successful, would result in the death of another. R.C. 2903.02(A); R.C. 2923.02. To convict him of Felonious Assault, it was necessary to prove that he knowingly attempted to cause physical harm to another. R.C. 2903.11(A)(2). And to convict him of Kidnapping, it was necessary to prove that he, by force, restrained the liberty of another for the purpose of terrorizing or inflicting serious physical harm on her. R.C. 2905.01(A)(3).\n\n{\u00b666} There is no serious contention that the State failed to present evidence sufficient to convict Burry of the charges. There was evidence that he held Carol down and fired a loaded gun at her head and at her stomach. The real issue is whether the State\u2019s evidence is credible, thus implicating the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n{\u00b667} Burry raises issues with Carol\u2019s credibility, noting that she did not believe that the pistol was loaded at the time of the incident, did not claim that she had been held down in her initial statements to the police, and changed her account of events as to whether Burry held the magazine in his other hand and the number of clicks she heard when he pulled the trigger. Burry impugns Carol\u2019s credibility by noting that, after he allegedly threatened her life and the lives of her dogs, she remained on the couch watching television.\n\n{\u00b668} We find Carol\u2019s testimony to be credible, if not wholly consistent. It is evident that immediately after the assault she was confused as to what had happened.\nShe had no reason for believing that the gun was unloaded other than the fact that it did not fire. She also struggled with the fact that Burry had never been violent with her before.\n\n{\u00b669} The salient aspects of Carol's testimony are corroborated by other evidence. Kyle, who never doubted the Beretta was loaded, confirmed that Burry held Carol down while pointing the gun at her. Burry suggests that Kyle has also changed his testimony to conform to the State's theory of the crime. But there is no inconsistency between Carol's and Kyle's testimony that she was held down and their initial statements to the police. That Burry held Carol down is merely an additional detail that is consonant with the fact that Carol was sitting down on a couch when Burry put the gun to her head and stomach. He would have to have been standing over her or be physically on top of her to do this.\n\n{\u00b670} It is likewise significant that Carol was able to immediately locate the Beretta's magazine between the couch and ottoman, although she was unaware of the pistol's location in Burry's dresser drawer.\n\n{\u00b671} Burry emphasizes his expert witness' testimony that the possibility of the Beretta being out of battery twice within seconds of the trigger being pulled is extremely unlikely and that it is more probable that it was not loaded when Burry fired. Burry's theory of events, however, is not without its incredible elements. It presupposes Burry loading the Beretta after he had fired twice at Carol for reasons unknown, chambering a round, dropping the magazine in the living room, and then moving to his bedroom where he discharged the weapon. Under this theory, there is no obvious logic or reason behind Burry's actions. It fails to account for Carol's knowledge of the magazine's\nlocation (unless we assume she remained on the couch while Burry actually loaded the weapon and then waited for him to change his mind and discard the magazine). And it is inconsistent with Burry\u2019s own explanation of events from Sergeant Hirz\u2019 and Officer Subkowich\u2019s body cams.\n\n{\u00b672} Both parties\u2019 experts essentially agreed that the Beretta would not discharge if it was more than an eighth of an inch out of battery and that it could be put out of battery by pressing it against a person\u2019s body. The likelihood of the weapon being put out of battery by pressing against a person\u2019s forehead and stomach is especially for the jury to decide inasmuch as the jury was able to physically handle and manipulate the weapon in addition to witnessing the experts doing so.\n\n{\u00b673} On balance, we find that the greater amount of credible evidence supports Burry\u2019s convictions. The second and third assignments of error are without merit.\n\n{\u00b674} In his fourth and final assignment of error, Burry contends that his thirteen-year aggregate sentence is not supported by the record and is contrary to law.\n\n{\u00b675} \u201cThe court hearing an appeal [of a felony sentence] shall review the record, including the findings underlying the sentence or modification given by the sentencing court.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). \u201cThe appellate court may increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a sentence that is appealed under this section or may vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing * * * if it clearly and convincingly finds * * * [t]hat the record does not support the sentencing court\u2019s findings under division * * * (C)(4) of section 2929.14, or * * * [t]hat the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(a) and (b).\nWhere the sentence imposed does \u201cnot require the findings that R.C. 2953.08(G) specifically addresses * * *, it is fully consistent for appellate courts to review those sentences that are imposed solely after consideration of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 under a standard that is equally deferential to the sentencing court.\u201d State v. Marcum, 146 Ohio St.3d 516, 2016-Ohio-1002, 59 N.E.3d 1231, \u00b6 23. \u201cThat is, an appellate court may vacate or modify any sentence that is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law only if the appellate court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the record does not support the sentence.\u201d Id.\n\nFor a first-degree felony, the possible prison terms range from three to eleven years. R.C. 2929.14(A)(1). The Firearm Specification requires \u201ca prison term of three years\u201d to be served \u201cconsecutively to and prior to the prison term imposed for the underlying offense.\u201d R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(a)(ii) and (2)(d); R.C. 2941.145(A).\n\nBurry contends the trial court erred in finding that no factors under R.C. 2929.12(C) existed that made his offense less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense. Burry maintains that he showed genuine remorse as evidenced by his apology to Carol and Kyle at sentencing:\n\nCarol, I\u2019ve been waiting ten months to tell you how truly sorry I am for any pain or suffering I put you through that night. I constantly thank God that no one was hurt and killed. There is not a moment that I don\u2019t think about that night. It haunts me constantly. I hope someday you and Kyle and Todd can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nThe sentencing court did not find Burry\u2019s remorse genuine, or at least a mitigating factor, in light of Burry\u2019s claim to not remember pointing the gun at Carol:\n\nI did pick up on the fact that you remember certain aspects [of the night\u2019s events] in the presentence report as you related them to the probation officer and/or in writing and then indicate that you didn\u2019t\nremember most things because you blacked out. So I don\u2019t know which way it is. To me it\u2019s of no significance, the likelihood is you\u2019re at some point trying to minimize what happened **.5\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b634} Kapelsohn further opined to a \u201creasonable degree of certainty\u201d that if the pistol were pushed against someone\u2019s forehead with enough force to put it out of battery that it would leave a mark, \u201ca bruise or abrasion or something like that.\u201d\n\n{\u00b635} On September 21, 2017, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to Counts 1 (Attempted Murder), 2 (Attempted Murder), 3 (Felonious Assault), 4 (Felonious Assault), and 5 (Kidnapping) of the Indictment, all Counts including Firearm Specifications.\n\n{\u00b636} On October 25, 2017, a sentencing hearing was held. Prior to sentencing, the trial court merged all Counts into Count 1 (Attempted Murder). The court ordered Mr. Burry to serve a prison term of ten years for Attempted Murder and, consecutively, three years for the Firearm Specification; advised him of mandatory post release control for a period of five years; and ordered him to pay court costs and the costs of prosecution.\n\n{\u00b637} On October 27, 2017, Burry\u2019s sentence was memorialized in a Judgment Entry of Sentence.\n\n{\u00b638} On November 27, 2017, Burry filed a Notice of Appeal. On appeal, Burry raises the following assignments of error:\n\u201c[1.] The trial court violated the defendant-appellant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to fair trial, due process and confrontation when it barred a defense expert from testifying regarding a key issue, yet allowed the prosecutor to conduct a demonstration regarding the same issue during closing argument.\u201d\n\n\u201c[2.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant when it denied his motion for acquittal made pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A).\u201d\n\n\u201c[3.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant when it returned a verdict of guilty against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201c[4.] The trial court erred by sentencing the defendant-appellant to a thirteen-year prison term.\u201d\n\nBurry raises two arguments under his first assignment of error. The first argument is that the trial court erred by sustaining the State\u2019s objection to the defense expert, Kapelsohn, testifying regarding a soft wood experiment conducted prior to trial.\n\nWhile testifying on redirect examination regarding the issue of whether pressing the Beretta against Carol\u2019s forehead so as to put the weapon out of battery would have left a mark, Kapelsohn was asked if he had had \u201can opportunity to test this weapon about whether or not it would leave a mark on let\u2019s say a piece of soft wood?\u201d Kapelsohn answered that he did and began to explain the experiment when the State objected. The trial court sustained the objection having determined that, while Kapelsohn\u2019s expert report contained his opinion that pushing the Beretta against a person\u2019s forehead would leave a mark, the report did not disclose an experiment with a piece of wood which, apparently, was conducted after his report was turned over to the State.\nUnder the Rules of Criminal Procedure, \u201c[t]he defendant shall provide copies or photographs, or permit the prosecuting attorney to copy or photograph, * * * [the] [r]esults of * * * experiments or scientific tests.\u201d Crim.R. 16(H)(2).\n\n\u201cIf at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u201d Crim.R. 16(L)(1). This Rule \u201cvests in the trial court the discretion to determine the appropriate response for failure of a party to disclose material subject to a valid discovery request,\u201d and \u201c[r]eversible error exists only where the exercise of such authority by the trial court constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d State v. Wiles, 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 78, 571 N.E.2d 97 (1991); State v. Darmond, 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, 986 N.E.2d 971, \u00b6 20.\n\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision to prevent the defense expert from testifying regarding the soft wood experiment. Burry offered no explanation for the failure to disclose to the State that the experiment had been conducted. The issue of whether pushing a pistol against a person\u2019s forehead or stomach so as to put it out of battery would leave a mark was disputed at trial. The probative value of conducting an experiment with soft wood as a substitute for the human body is not immediately apparent. To allow Kapelsohn to testify regarding the results of such an experiment on redirect, when the State was unaware of either the methodology or the results of the experiment would have been unfair to the prosecution.\nThe case of *State v. Branham*, 104 Ohio App.3d 355, 662 N.E.2d 54 (12th Dist.1995), is comparable. In *Branham*, defense counsel had identified an expert witness in the pretrial discovery statement but did not disclose the details of an experiment \u201cinvolving the shooting of arrows into a pig skull stuffed with styrofoam.\u201d *Id.* at 361. \u201cTherefore, the trial court confined the expert\u2019s testimony to his expertise as developed through his experience and precluded testimony based upon the pig skull experiment.\u201d *Id.* The court of appeals affirmed, observing that \u201c[t]he trial court excluded only that expert testimony concerning the pig skull experiment,\u201d while \u201c[a]ll other testimony by the expert was permitted.\u201d *Id.* at 362. \u201cUnder the circumstances, the sanction imposed by the trial court is entirely consistent with the Criminal Rules and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d *Id.* Similarly in the present case, the trial court excluded only Kapelsohn\u2019s testimony regarding an experiment which had not been included in his expert report.2\n\nBurry\u2019s second argument under the first assignment of error is that the trial court, while preventing \u201chis expert witness from testifying regarding the results of a test that was key to his defense,\u201d nevertheless permitted \u201cthe prosecut[ing] attorney to essentially testify and conduct a presentation similar to the one the trial court barred his expert witness from presenting.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 15.\n\n\u201cWhere prosecutorial misconduct is alleged, the court must determine whether the remarks in closing argument were improper and, if so, whether the remarks prejudicially affected substantive rights of the defendant.\u201d *State v. Phillips*, 74 Ohio\n\n---\n\n2. Burry argues at length in his brief that the trial court misapplied Criminal Rule 16(K) (\u201c[f]ailure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert\u2019s testimony at trial.\u201d). The trial court did not cite to Rule 16(K) which does not properly apply to the present situation inasmuch as Kapelsohn did timely disclose his written report to the prosecution, albeit without mention of the soft wood experiment.\nSt.3d 72, 90, 656 N.E.2d 643 (1995). \u201cThe assessment of whether the permissible bounds of closing argument have been exceeded is, in the first instance, a discretionary function to be performed by the trial court.\u201d Pang v. Minch, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 559 N.E.2d 1313 (1990), paragraph three of the syllabus. \u201cSuch determination will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b651 During closing argument, and over the objection of defense counsel, the prosecutor demonstrated pointing the Beretta to his head to take it out of battery. He explained the demonstration to the court as follows:\n\nBy way of argument and by way of demonstrating things that are in evidence I\u2019m going to take that loaded pistol and I\u2019m going to take it cocked unloaded, I\u2019m going to press it into my forehead and create an out of battery situation and we\u2019re going to release and we\u2019ll see how long it takes to mark my forehead.\n\n\u00b652 Contrary to Burry\u2019s position, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s demonstration was not improper. There is no indication in the record that the demonstration was intended to be testimonial, i.e., by pressing the pistol against his forehead, the prosecutor was trying to convince rather than prove to the jury that the pistol could be put out of battery without leaving a mark. The demonstration was theatrical rather than evidentiary and the prosecutor anticipated that the jury would draw its own conclusions on the issue based on its own handling of the evidence.\n\n\u00b653 Before the jury, the prosecutor argued:\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b652 Contrary to Burry\u2019s position, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s demonstration was not improper.

I\u2019m going to do something for you because I mean really you got to make a decision how you handle the evidence. *** But I\u2019d like to save you from putting this thing to your own head like I\u2019m about to do ***. I\u2019m not going to know if there is a mark on my head, I\u2019m not going to know if it disappears by the time I\u2019m done talking [to]\nyou. *** This is a .9 millimeter weapon, you'll see when you get back to the jury room it doesn't take a lot of force to put that out of battery. *** And I think when you have that weapon back there you'll find that is something because you're going to be pressing it into your head just like I did.\n\n*Compare State v. Naples*, 94 Ohio App. 33, 114 N.E.2d 302 (7th Dist.1952), paragraph four of the syllabus (\u201c[i]t is not misconduct resulting in prejudicial error for the prosecuting attorney in the trial of an accused for assault with intent to kill *** to refer to and demonstrate the use of a sawed-off billiard cue on the person of the prosecuting witness, there being no evidence that such billiard cue was used in the assault * * *, where such remarks merely constituted the prosecutor's interpretation of the facts as he knew them\u201d).\n\n{\u00b654} It is worth noting that the Beretta was repeatedly pressed against the human body to put it out of battery \u2013 by Silverstein, by Kapelsohn, and by the prosecutor3 \u2013 during trial but never with the understanding that such demonstration constituted a scientific test or experiment with evidentiary value. During his cross examination, Kapelsohn commented that he still had a mark on his hand forty-five minutes after using his hand to put it out of battery. The prosecutor commented that his hand did not have a mark, but recognized that whether a mark is made \u201cdepends on the individual's biology * * * [and] a million things that neither one of us have any business talking about with any expertise.\u201d\n\n{\u00b655} Lastly, the trial court duly instructed the jury both before and after trial that the closing arguments of counsel are \u201cdesigned to assist\u201d the jury in its deliberations but are not evidence. *Pang*, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 559 N.E.2d 1313, at paragraph four of the\n\n---\n\n3. The prosecutor pushed the Beretta against his hand to put it out of battery during his cross examination of Kapelsohn after Kapelsohn had made the same demonstration during direct examination.\nsyllabus (\"[a] presumption always exists that the jury has followed the instructions given to it by the trial court\").\n\n{\u00b656} Burry also claims the prosecutor improperly held himself out as an expert by explaining that he had firearms experience from his time in the Marine Corps and that one of the reasons he was brought on the case was because of his \u201cexpertise\u201d in handling firearms. Appellant\u2019s brief at 13.\n\n{\u00b657} The context of these comments readily demonstrates that the prosecutor was not holding himself out before the jury as an expert witness. Both comments occurred during the voir dire of the jury. In one instance, the prosecutor responded to a juror\u2019s statement that his experience and knowledge came from the \u201cU.S. Army\u201d with \u201cthat\u2019s my same experience in the Marine Corps.\u201d In the other instance, the prosecutor mentioned his \u201cexpertise\u201d to assure the jury that \u201cwe would handle this firearm [the Beretta] safely\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019re going to follow the safety things that everyone * * * is taught from the get go.\u201d\n\n{\u00b658} Burry\u2019s final argument under this assignment of error is that the prosecutor improperly claimed \u201cthat the defense expert was \u2018tricking\u2019 the jury.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 14. The prosecutor was referring to Kapelsohn\u2019s demonstration of how the Beretta would not be able to release its hammer (have a \u201cdead trigger\u201d) if it was put a quarter inch or more out of battery. On cross examination, the prosecutor had Kapelsohn admit that in order to achieve this result it was necessary for him to tilt his hand and apply\n\n4. Counsel for Burry likewise addressed the issue during voir dire: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that I\u2019m an expert. I can tell you that I\u2019m knowledgeable on the subject. I can tell you I\u2019ve been trained. I can tell you I\u2019ve been to the range. I can tell you I\u2019ve had several hours of shooting range practice and I\u2019ve done the course and I know the laws associated with the weapons and firing the weapons but are you able to kind of, can you look at me, can you look at Bob [Burry] the same way you look at Mr. Kaplan [the prosecutor]; what do you guys think? I\u2019m seeing nods, okay.\u201d\npressure to the top portion of the slide to allow it to move independently of the barrel. If the Beretta is pushed against the hand or other hard surface perpendicularly so that the slide and barrel moved in unison, the slide would not be able to be pushed so far out of battery as to disengage the hammer. In other words, when Kapelsohn performed the demonstration he pushed the Beretta against his hand at an angle and this affected the result.\n\n{\u00b659} In referring to the demonstration during closing argument, the prosecutor described the demonstration as a \u201ctrick\u201d:\n\nHe\u2019s holding his hand trying to push at the top of the slide to create the separation so he can get the trigger to go spongy [dead] like he showed and manipulated. * * * That\u2019s the problem I had with Kapelsohn and the extent that he went to try and cup the barrel and push against the slide so he can get the trigger in the position because when you\u2019re being fair about it when you\u2019re pushing it [the slide and barrel] together like a normal person would be you\u2019re not going to get it there [past a quarter inch]. That\u2019s a trick he\u2019s trying to pull on you, don\u2019t buy it.\n\n{\u00b660} The prosecutor\u2019s characterization of Kapelsohn\u2019s demonstration as a trick is within the permissible bounds for closing argument. This court has observed that \u201c[t]here is no requirement that a prosecutor\u2019s language must be neutral in its characterizations of the evidence or defense strategy.\u201d State v. Novak, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2003-L-077, 2005-Ohio-563, \u00b6 42 (the prosecutor described the defense strategy as a \u201cwhitewash\u201d he was trying to \u201csell\u201d the jury). In the present case, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the demonstration as a trick was no more pejorative (or improper) than was defense counsel\u2019s comments that \u201cthe government has told [Carol] what to say from the beginning\u201d and \u201cfrom December 24th, 2016 at approximately 8:30 p.m. this woman\u2019s been told and coached what to say.\u201d\nThe first assignment of error is without merit.\n\nIn his second and third assignments of error, Burry argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions and that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nThe manifest weight of the evidence and the sufficiency of the evidence are distinct legal concepts. *State v. Elmore*, 111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, 857 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 44. With respect to the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus, following *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nThe sentencing court did not find Burry\u2019s remorse genuine, or at least a mitigating factor, in light of Burry\u2019s claim to not remember pointing the gun at Carol:\n\nI did pick up on the fact that you remember certain aspects [of the night\u2019s events] in the presentence report as you related them to the probation officer and/or in writing and then indicate that you didn\u2019t\nremember most things because you blacked out. So I don\u2019t know which way it is. To me it\u2019s of no significance, the likelihood is you\u2019re at some point trying to minimize what happened **.5\n\n{\u00b680} Burry further cites as mitigating factors the fact that he worked for thirty-five years and led a law-abiding life; the stress of the impending divorce; his age (sixty-three at the time of sentencing); and his anxiety and depression. The sentencing court noted that Burry \u201ccharged Sergeant Hirz\u201d but Burry claims that, \u201con the bodycam, it appears that he was requesting a \u2018suicide by cop\u2019\u201d by standing up and telling the officers to shoot him.\n\n{\u00b681} With respect to Burry\u2019s remorse, it has been the position of this court to \u201cdefer to the trial court as to whether a defendant\u2019s remarks are indicative of genuine remorse because it is in the best position to make that determination.\u201d (Citation omitted.) State v. Sprott, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2016-A-0066, 2017-Ohio-1508, \u00b6 15. Moreover, even if Burry is deemed to be genuinely remorseful, \u201cthe trial court is not obligated * * * to give any particular weight or consideration to any sentencing factor.\u201d (Citation omitted.) State v. Pishner, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2017-P-0004, 2017-Ohio-8689, \u00b6 20. Rather, the court has \u201cfull discretion to impose a prison sentence within the statutory range.\u201d State v.

The court recognized Burry\u2019s lack of a criminal record and several letters of support received from friends and family but concluded, ultimately, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you get beyond the fact that other than that gun not going off because of the slide because it was out of battery [Carol] wouldn\u2019t be here and you\u2019d be in a whole different stretch of years that I would be considering right now.\u201d\n\n{\u00b683} In light of the foregoing we cannot conclude that the record does not clearly and convincingly support the sentence imposed.\n\n{\u00b684} The fourth assignment of error is without merit.\n\n{\u00b685} For the foregoing reasons, Burry\u2019s convictions and sentence in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.

{"Index": "078-Burry", "allegation": "The trial court erred by sentencing the defendant-appellant to a thirteen-year prison term.", "evidence": "Defendant-appellant, Robert P. Burry, appeals his convictions for Attempted Murder, Felonious Assault, and Kidnapping as well as his post-merger sentence for Attempted Murder following a jury trial in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas. The issues before this court are whether a trial court errs by preventing a defense expert from testifying to the results of an experiment when the fact that the experiment had been conducted was not disclosed to the prosecution; whether\na prosecutor commits prosecutorial misconduct by placing a gun against his forehead during closing argument to demonstrate an issue at trial; whether convictions for Attempted Murder, Felonious Assault, and Kidnapping are not supported by sufficient evidence and/or are against the weight of the evidence where the victim's testimony at trial is at variance with her initial statements to the police and where the defendant's expert testified to the unlikelihood of a gun being loaded when it is fired twice without discharging a bullet; and whether a thirteen-year sentence for Attempted Murder with a Firearm Specification is clearly and convincingly supported by the record based on the psychological harm caused the victim and the defendant's minimization of his conduct. For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the court below.\n\n{\u00b62} On January 27, 2017, the Lake County Grand Jury indicted Burry of the following: two counts of Attempted Murder (Counts 1 and 2), felonies of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A) and R.C. 2923.02; two counts of Felonious Assault (Counts 3 and 4), felonies of the second degree in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2); Kidnapping (Count 5), a felony of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(3); Domestic Violence (Count 6), a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A); Aggravated Menacing (Count 7), a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2903.21; Using Weapons While Intoxicated (Count 8), a misdemeanor of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2923.15; and Resisting Arrest (Count 9), a misdemeanor of the second degree in violation of R.C. 2921.33(A). Counts 1 to 5 of the Indictment contained Firearm Specifications pursuant to R.C. 2941.145.\n\n{\u00b63} On February 3, 2017, Burry was arraigned and entered a plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d to the charges in the Indictment.\nBetween September 19 and 21, 2017, a jury trial was held. Prior to the commencement of trial, the State elected to dismiss Counts 6 to 9 of the Indictment. The following witness testimony was given at trial:\n\nSergeant Daniel Hirz of the Willowick Police Department testified that, at about 8:24 p.m. on Christmas Eve 2016, he responded to a call at the home of Robert and Carol Burry at 299 East 293rd Street. Upon arrival, Hirz observed: \u201cMrs. Burry at the end of the driveway crouched down behind the cars that were parked in the street. She was crying, a bit hysterical and she was just saying he tried to shoot me twice.\u201d Hirz entered the residence with his weapon drawn.\n\nSergeant Hirz met Burry in the hallway:\n\nI ordered him to the ground, I ordered to see his hands. Initially he showed me his hands and complied and was beginning to kneel down in compliance. * * * I saw he didn\u2019t have anything in his hands, I began to holster my weapon and he decided to get up and he said to shoot me, you mother and then he began to say the word fucker but since he was advancing on me I kicked him in the chest knocking him backwards which took the wind out of him. * * * [He] staggered backwards until he ran into the couch and sofa which kept him [from] falling over. Once he regained his balance Officer Sobkowich, who shortly came in the door right behind me * * * tased Mr. Burry striking him in the chest which dropped forward and on to the ground.\n\nThereupon, Burry was handcuffed. Sergeant Hirz noted that he was \u201chighly intoxicated.\u201d\n\nDuring the subsequent search of the residence: a magazine containing one bullet was found under the couch; a nine-millimeter shell casing was found in Burry\u2019s bedroom; a firearm was found in a drawer in Burry\u2019s bedroom; and a bullet hole was found, originating in Burry\u2019s bedroom, passing through another bedroom, and exiting the house.\nA video taken from Sergeant Hirz\u2019 body cam was played for the jury. In the video, Hirz asks Carol if Burry fired the gun at her and she responded that there were no bullets in it. She stated he \u201cstuck it right to my [indicating her forehead].\u201d Carol then advised Hirz that there was a gun that did go off, apparently believing it was a different gun.\n\nAfter being subdued, Burry denied that there was a firearm and that he did \u201canything.\u201d Several minutes later, he admitted that a gun had gone off but he denied pointing the gun at anybody and claimed he would never hurt his wife.\n\nPrior to taking their written statements, Sergeant Hirz interviewed Carol and her son (Burry\u2019s stepson), Kyle Johnson, in the basement of the home. Carol recalled that Burry threatened to kill her dogs and asked if she would like to die tonight. She repeated, indicating with her hands, that the gun was pointed at her head and belly and that he pulled the trigger. She claimed, \u201che didn\u2019t know if there could have been a bullet in there.\u201d Kyle interrupted and said, \u201cthere was.\u201d She continued, \u201che didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nOfficer Shaun Kovacic of the Willowick Police Department testified that he responded to the Christmas Eve call to the Burry residence and entered the home after Sergeant Hirz. After Mr. Burry was subdued, Kovacic searched his bedroom. He found a spent shell casing on the floor and a pistol in a dresser drawer. Kovacic also noted a bullet hole in the bedroom which led into another bedroom and finally through the exterior wall of the house.\n\nOfficer Steven Sobkowich of the Willowick Police Department responded to the Christmas Eve call to the Burry residence. His testimony corroborated Sergeant\nHirz\u2019 version of events. Sobkowich noted powder residue on Mr. Burry\u2019s left hand. A video taken from Sobkowich\u2019s body cam was played for the jury.\n\n{\u00b613} On the Officer Sobkowich video, Burry admits that he went to his room and loaded the Beretta and that there were two bullets in the magazine. He claimed that when he pulled the slide the gun went off accidentally. Burry denied that he ever pointed the gun at Carol.\n\n{\u00b614} Kyle Johnson was living with his mother (Carol) and stepfather (Robert Burry) in 2016. He testified that he, Burry, and Carol kept guns in the house. Burry kept his guns \u201cready to go with a clip, a magazine filled and in the gun with the safety off\u201d and \u201calways close by *** to a bed or a dresser.\u201d\n\n{\u00b615} Carol and Burry\u2019s marriage had been deteriorating and the couple argued frequently. Carol wanted a divorce and had made arrangements to move into an apartment. Kyle would remain in the home with Burry until it could be sold.\n\n{\u00b616} During the afternoon on Christmas Eve, Kyle and Carol were watching a movie while Burry was out having a couple of beers with a friend. Burry returned home, \u201cvisibly drunk,\u201d and wanted to open gifts. He became very angry while waiting for the movie to finish. Burry began to badger Carol about the impending divorce while his mood swung from angry to sad. For the first time that he could recall, Kyle heard Burry become \u201cverbally abusive\u201d toward Carol, calling her a \u201ctraitor\u201d and a \u201cpiece of shit.\u201d Kyle retired to his room as the argument continued for about ten minutes.\n\n{\u00b617} Eventually, Burry went to his room and Carol watched television. Kyle next heard the safe in Carol\u2019s room where guns were kept make a \u201cclanging\u201d noise. Kyle testified: \u201cThe next sound I heard was Bob rush[ing] out of the room and then\nimmediately after that I heard my mother calling my name and screaming Kyle, help, help, call the police.\u201d\n\nKyle called 911 and walked to the living room and observed the following:\n\nI saw Bob holding my mother down with his left hand, the Beretta in his right hand directly on her forehead. *** She was kicking and screaming and *** as I moved closer, she kicked, was able to kick him off of her for a moment. In that moment the gun was pointed in my direction. *** I moved toward the stairs. As Bob saw me move towards the stairs he moved his attention back towards my mom. *** As I was describing to the dispatcher what was going on above me *** my mother said you shot me, Bob, how could you shoot me right in the stomach. I became really scared at that moment and a little confused because at that point I hadn\u2019t heard a shot yet. *** I heard lots of footsteps, I heard doors slamming, *** and then I heard a shot in the house.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b634} Kapelsohn further opined to a \u201creasonable degree of certainty\u201d that if the pistol were pushed against someone\u2019s forehead with enough force to put it out of battery that it would leave a mark, \u201ca bruise or abrasion or something like that.\u201d\n\n{\u00b635} On September 21, 2017, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to Counts 1 (Attempted Murder), 2 (Attempted Murder), 3 (Felonious Assault), 4 (Felonious Assault), and 5 (Kidnapping) of the Indictment, all Counts including Firearm Specifications.\n\n{\u00b636} On October 25, 2017, a sentencing hearing was held. Prior to sentencing, the trial court merged all Counts into Count 1 (Attempted Murder). The court ordered Mr. Burry to serve a prison term of ten years for Attempted Murder and, consecutively, three years for the Firearm Specification; advised him of mandatory post release control for a period of five years; and ordered him to pay court costs and the costs of prosecution.\n\n{\u00b637} On October 27, 2017, Burry\u2019s sentence was memorialized in a Judgment Entry of Sentence.\n\n{\u00b638} On November 27, 2017, Burry filed a Notice of Appeal. On appeal, Burry raises the following assignments of error:\n\u201c[1.] The trial court violated the defendant-appellant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to fair trial, due process and confrontation when it barred a defense expert from testifying regarding a key issue, yet allowed the prosecutor to conduct a demonstration regarding the same issue during closing argument.\u201d\n\n\u201c[2.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant when it denied his motion for acquittal made pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A).\u201d\n\n\u201c[3.] The trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant when it returned a verdict of guilty against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201c[4.] The trial court erred by sentencing the defendant-appellant to a thirteen-year prison term.\u201d\n\nBurry raises two arguments under his first assignment of error. The first argument is that the trial court erred by sustaining the State\u2019s objection to the defense expert, Kapelsohn, testifying regarding a soft wood experiment conducted prior to trial.\n\nWhile testifying on redirect examination regarding the issue of whether pressing the Beretta against Carol\u2019s forehead so as to put the weapon out of battery would have left a mark, Kapelsohn was asked if he had had \u201can opportunity to test this weapon about whether or not it would leave a mark on let\u2019s say a piece of soft wood?\u201d Kapelsohn answered that he did and began to explain the experiment when the State objected. The trial court sustained the objection having determined that, while Kapelsohn\u2019s expert report contained his opinion that pushing the Beretta against a person\u2019s forehead would leave a mark, the report did not disclose an experiment with a piece of wood which, apparently, was conducted after his report was turned over to the State.\nUnder the Rules of Criminal Procedure, \u201c[t]he defendant shall provide copies or photographs, or permit the prosecuting attorney to copy or photograph, * * * [the] [r]esults of * * * experiments or scientific tests.\u201d Crim.R. 16(H)(2).\n\n\u201cIf at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\u201d Crim.R. 16(L)(1). This Rule \u201cvests in the trial court the discretion to determine the appropriate response for failure of a party to disclose material subject to a valid discovery request,\u201d and \u201c[r]eversible error exists only where the exercise of such authority by the trial court constitutes an abuse of discretion.\u201d State v. Wiles, 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 78, 571 N.E.2d 97 (1991); State v. Darmond, 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, 986 N.E.2d 971, \u00b6 20.\n\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision to prevent the defense expert from testifying regarding the soft wood experiment. Burry offered no explanation for the failure to disclose to the State that the experiment had been conducted. The issue of whether pushing a pistol against a person\u2019s forehead or stomach so as to put it out of battery would leave a mark was disputed at trial. The probative value of conducting an experiment with soft wood as a substitute for the human body is not immediately apparent. To allow Kapelsohn to testify regarding the results of such an experiment on redirect, when the State was unaware of either the methodology or the results of the experiment would have been unfair to the prosecution.\nThe case of *State v. Branham*, 104 Ohio App.3d 355, 662 N.E.2d 54 (12th Dist.1995), is comparable. In *Branham*, defense counsel had identified an expert witness in the pretrial discovery statement but did not disclose the details of an experiment \u201cinvolving the shooting of arrows into a pig skull stuffed with styrofoam.\u201d *Id.* at 361. \u201cTherefore, the trial court confined the expert\u2019s testimony to his expertise as developed through his experience and precluded testimony based upon the pig skull experiment.\u201d *Id.* The court of appeals affirmed, observing that \u201c[t]he trial court excluded only that expert testimony concerning the pig skull experiment,\u201d while \u201c[a]ll other testimony by the expert was permitted.\u201d *Id.* at 362. \u201cUnder the circumstances, the sanction imposed by the trial court is entirely consistent with the Criminal Rules and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d *Id.* Similarly in the present case, the trial court excluded only Kapelsohn\u2019s testimony regarding an experiment which had not been included in his expert report.2\n\nBurry\u2019s second argument under the first assignment of error is that the trial court, while preventing \u201chis expert witness from testifying regarding the results of a test that was key to his defense,\u201d nevertheless permitted \u201cthe prosecut[ing] attorney to essentially testify and conduct a presentation similar to the one the trial court barred his expert witness from presenting.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 15.\n\n\u201cWhere prosecutorial misconduct is alleged, the court must determine whether the remarks in closing argument were improper and, if so, whether the remarks prejudicially affected substantive rights of the defendant.\u201d *State v. Phillips*, 74 Ohio\n\n---\n\n2. Burry argues at length in his brief that the trial court misapplied Criminal Rule 16(K) (\u201c[f]ailure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert\u2019s testimony at trial.\u201d). The trial court did not cite to Rule 16(K) which does not properly apply to the present situation inasmuch as Kapelsohn did timely disclose his written report to the prosecution, albeit without mention of the soft wood experiment.\nSt.3d 72, 90, 656 N.E.2d 643 (1995). \u201cThe assessment of whether the permissible bounds of closing argument have been exceeded is, in the first instance, a discretionary function to be performed by the trial court.\u201d Pang v. Minch, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 559 N.E.2d 1313 (1990), paragraph three of the syllabus. \u201cSuch determination will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b651 During closing argument, and over the objection of defense counsel, the prosecutor demonstrated pointing the Beretta to his head to take it out of battery. He explained the demonstration to the court as follows:\n\nBy way of argument and by way of demonstrating things that are in evidence I\u2019m going to take that loaded pistol and I\u2019m going to take it cocked unloaded, I\u2019m going to press it into my forehead and create an out of battery situation and we\u2019re going to release and we\u2019ll see how long it takes to mark my forehead.\n\n\u00b652 Contrary to Burry\u2019s position, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s demonstration was not improper. There is no indication in the record that the demonstration was intended to be testimonial, i.e., by pressing the pistol against his forehead, the prosecutor was trying to convince rather than prove to the jury that the pistol could be put out of battery without leaving a mark. The demonstration was theatrical rather than evidentiary and the prosecutor anticipated that the jury would draw its own conclusions on the issue based on its own handling of the evidence.\n\n\u00b653 Before the jury, the prosecutor argued:\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nWhereas \u201csufficiency of the evidence is a test of adequacy as to whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support a verdict as a matter of law, * * * weight of the evidence addresses the evidence's effect of inducing belief.\u201d *State v. Wilson*, 113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, \u00b6 25, citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386-387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). \u201cIn other words, a reviewing court asks whose evidence is more persuasive -- the state's or the defendant's?\u201d *Id.* An appellate court considering whether a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence must consider all the evidence in the record, the reasonable inferences, the credibility of the witnesses, and whether, \u201cin resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction\nmust be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d *Thompkins* at 387, quoting *State v. Martin*, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\n\n{\u00b665} To convict Burry of Attempted Murder it was necessary for the State to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Burry purposely engaged in conduct that, if successful, would result in the death of another. R.C. 2903.02(A); R.C. 2923.02. To convict him of Felonious Assault, it was necessary to prove that he knowingly attempted to cause physical harm to another. R.C. 2903.11(A)(2). And to convict him of Kidnapping, it was necessary to prove that he, by force, restrained the liberty of another for the purpose of terrorizing or inflicting serious physical harm on her. R.C. 2905.01(A)(3).\n\n{\u00b666} There is no serious contention that the State failed to present evidence sufficient to convict Burry of the charges. There was evidence that he held Carol down and fired a loaded gun at her head and at her stomach. The real issue is whether the State\u2019s evidence is credible, thus implicating the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n{\u00b667} Burry raises issues with Carol\u2019s credibility, noting that she did not believe that the pistol was loaded at the time of the incident, did not claim that she had been held down in her initial statements to the police, and changed her account of events as to whether Burry held the magazine in his other hand and the number of clicks she heard when he pulled the trigger. Burry impugns Carol\u2019s credibility by noting that, after he allegedly threatened her life and the lives of her dogs, she remained on the couch watching television.\n\n{\u00b668} We find Carol\u2019s testimony to be credible, if not wholly consistent. It is evident that immediately after the assault she was confused as to what had happened.\nShe had no reason for believing that the gun was unloaded other than the fact that it did not fire. She also struggled with the fact that Burry had never been violent with her before.\n\n{\u00b669} The salient aspects of Carol's testimony are corroborated by other evidence. Kyle, who never doubted the Beretta was loaded, confirmed that Burry held Carol down while pointing the gun at her. Burry suggests that Kyle has also changed his testimony to conform to the State's theory of the crime. But there is no inconsistency between Carol's and Kyle's testimony that she was held down and their initial statements to the police. That Burry held Carol down is merely an additional detail that is consonant with the fact that Carol was sitting down on a couch when Burry put the gun to her head and stomach. He would have to have been standing over her or be physically on top of her to do this.\n\n{\u00b670} It is likewise significant that Carol was able to immediately locate the Beretta's magazine between the couch and ottoman, although she was unaware of the pistol's location in Burry's dresser drawer.\n\n{\u00b671} Burry emphasizes his expert witness' testimony that the possibility of the Beretta being out of battery twice within seconds of the trigger being pulled is extremely unlikely and that it is more probable that it was not loaded when Burry fired. Burry's theory of events, however, is not without its incredible elements. It presupposes Burry loading the Beretta after he had fired twice at Carol for reasons unknown, chambering a round, dropping the magazine in the living room, and then moving to his bedroom where he discharged the weapon. Under this theory, there is no obvious logic or reason behind Burry's actions. It fails to account for Carol's knowledge of the magazine's\nlocation (unless we assume she remained on the couch while Burry actually loaded the weapon and then waited for him to change his mind and discard the magazine). And it is inconsistent with Burry\u2019s own explanation of events from Sergeant Hirz\u2019 and Officer Subkowich\u2019s body cams.\n\n{\u00b672} Both parties\u2019 experts essentially agreed that the Beretta would not discharge if it was more than an eighth of an inch out of battery and that it could be put out of battery by pressing it against a person\u2019s body. The likelihood of the weapon being put out of battery by pressing against a person\u2019s forehead and stomach is especially for the jury to decide inasmuch as the jury was able to physically handle and manipulate the weapon in addition to witnessing the experts doing so.\n\n{\u00b673} On balance, we find that the greater amount of credible evidence supports Burry\u2019s convictions. The second and third assignments of error are without merit.\n\n{\u00b674} In his fourth and final assignment of error, Burry contends that his thirteen-year aggregate sentence is not supported by the record and is contrary to law.\n\n{\u00b675} \u201cThe court hearing an appeal [of a felony sentence] shall review the record, including the findings underlying the sentence or modification given by the sentencing court.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). \u201cThe appellate court may increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a sentence that is appealed under this section or may vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing * * * if it clearly and convincingly finds * * * [t]hat the record does not support the sentencing court\u2019s findings under division * * * (C)(4) of section 2929.14, or * * * [t]hat the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\u201d R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(a) and (b).\nWhere the sentence imposed does \u201cnot require the findings that R.C. 2953.08(G) specifically addresses * * *, it is fully consistent for appellate courts to review those sentences that are imposed solely after consideration of the factors in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12 under a standard that is equally deferential to the sentencing court.\u201d State v. Marcum, 146 Ohio St.3d 516, 2016-Ohio-1002, 59 N.E.3d 1231, \u00b6 23. \u201cThat is, an appellate court may vacate or modify any sentence that is not clearly and convincingly contrary to law only if the appellate court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the record does not support the sentence.\u201d Id.\n\nFor a first-degree felony, the possible prison terms range from three to eleven years. R.C. 2929.14(A)(1). The Firearm Specification requires \u201ca prison term of three years\u201d to be served \u201cconsecutively to and prior to the prison term imposed for the underlying offense.\u201d R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(a)(ii) and (2)(d); R.C. 2941.145(A).\n\nBurry contends the trial court erred in finding that no factors under R.C. 2929.12(C) existed that made his offense less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense. Burry maintains that he showed genuine remorse as evidenced by his apology to Carol and Kyle at sentencing:\n\nCarol, I\u2019ve been waiting ten months to tell you how truly sorry I am for any pain or suffering I put you through that night. I constantly thank God that no one was hurt and killed. There is not a moment that I don\u2019t think about that night. It haunts me constantly. I hope someday you and Kyle and Todd can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nThe sentencing court did not find Burry\u2019s remorse genuine, or at least a mitigating factor, in light of Burry\u2019s claim to not remember pointing the gun at Carol:\n\nI did pick up on the fact that you remember certain aspects [of the night\u2019s events] in the presentence report as you related them to the probation officer and/or in writing and then indicate that you didn\u2019t\nremember most things because you blacked out. So I don\u2019t know which way it is. To me it\u2019s of no significance, the likelihood is you\u2019re at some point trying to minimize what happened **.5\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nThe sentencing court did not find Burry\u2019s remorse genuine, or at least a mitigating factor, in light of Burry\u2019s claim to not remember pointing the gun at Carol:\n\nI did pick up on the fact that you remember certain aspects [of the night\u2019s events] in the presentence report as you related them to the probation officer and/or in writing and then indicate that you didn\u2019t\nremember most things because you blacked out.

To me it\u2019s of no significance, the likelihood is you\u2019re at some point trying to minimize what happened **.5\n\n{\u00b680} Burry further cites as mitigating factors the fact that he worked for thirty-five years and led a law-abiding life; the stress of the impending divorce; his age (sixty-three at the time of sentencing); and his anxiety and depression. The sentencing court noted that Burry \u201ccharged Sergeant Hirz\u201d but Burry claims that, \u201con the bodycam, it appears that he was requesting a \u2018suicide by cop\u2019\u201d by standing up and telling the officers to shoot him.\n\n{\u00b681} With respect to Burry\u2019s remorse, it has been the position of this court to \u201cdefer to the trial court as to whether a defendant\u2019s remarks are indicative of genuine remorse because it is in the best position to make that determination.\u201d (Citation omitted.) State v. Sprott, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2016-A-0066, 2017-Ohio-1508, \u00b6 15. Moreover, even if Burry is deemed to be genuinely remorseful, \u201cthe trial court is not obligated * * * to give any particular weight or consideration to any sentencing factor.\u201d (Citation omitted.) State v. Pishner, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2017-P-0004, 2017-Ohio-8689, \u00b6 20. Rather, the court has \u201cfull discretion to impose a prison sentence within the statutory range.\u201d State v.

It is worth noting that from the moment Burry was subdued by police (before the ability to recall events was an issue) he denied that he had discharged a firearm and, when this claim became untenable, claimed to have discharged the weapon accidently without ever having pointed it at Carol.\nemphasized the psychological harm/\u201ctorment\u201d suffered by Carol and Burry\u2019s responsibility for causing the situation that evening (\u201cyou knew that taking that medication and mixing it with not only alcohol but a lot of alcohol *** was a combination that wasn\u2019t going to result in anything good\u201d). The court recognized Burry\u2019s lack of a criminal record and several letters of support received from friends and family but concluded, ultimately, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you get beyond the fact that other than that gun not going off because of the slide because it was out of battery [Carol] wouldn\u2019t be here and you\u2019d be in a whole different stretch of years that I would be considering right now.\u201d\n\n{\u00b683} In light of the foregoing we cannot conclude that the record does not clearly and convincingly support the sentence imposed.\n\n{\u00b684} The fourth assignment of error is without merit.\n\n{\u00b685} For the foregoing reasons, Burry\u2019s convictions and sentence in the Lake County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed. Costs to be taxed against the appellant.\n\nCYNTHIA WESTCOTT RICE, J., concurs,\n\nCOLLEEN MARY O\u2019TOOLE, J., dissents.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b652 Contrary to Burry\u2019s position, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s demonstration was not improper. There is no indication in the record that the demonstration was intended to be testimonial, i.e., by pressing the pistol against his forehead, the prosecutor was trying to convince rather than prove to the jury that the pistol could be put out of battery without leaving a mark. The demonstration was theatrical rather than evidentiary and the prosecutor anticipated that the jury would draw its own conclusions on the issue based on its own handling of the evidence.\n\n\u00b653 Before the jury, the prosecutor argued:\n\nNow there is a question about whether or not you press this into someone\u2019s forehead and it\u2019s going to cause some sort of injury, cause some sort of mark that\u2019s going to be obvious or visible. I\u2019m going to do something for you because I mean really you got to make a decision how you handle the evidence. *** But I\u2019d like to save you from putting this thing to your own head like I\u2019m about to do ***. I\u2019m not going to know if there is a mark on my head, I\u2019m not going to know if it disappears by the time I\u2019m done talking [to]\nyou. *** This is a .9 millimeter weapon, you'll see when you get back to the jury room it doesn't take a lot of force to put that out of battery. *** And I think when you have that weapon back there you'll find that is something because you're going to be pressing it into your head just like I did.\n\n*Compare State v. Naples*, 94 Ohio App. 33, 114 N.E.2d 302 (7th Dist.1952), paragraph four of the syllabus (\u201c[i]t is not misconduct resulting in prejudicial error for the prosecuting attorney in the trial of an accused for assault with intent to kill *** to refer to and demonstrate the use of a sawed-off billiard cue on the person of the prosecuting witness, there being no evidence that such billiard cue was used in the assault * * *, where such remarks merely constituted the prosecutor's interpretation of the facts as he knew them\u201d).\n\n{\u00b654} It is worth noting that the Beretta was repeatedly pressed against the human body to put it out of battery \u2013 by Silverstein, by Kapelsohn, and by the prosecutor3 \u2013 during trial but never with the understanding that such demonstration constituted a scientific test or experiment with evidentiary value. During his cross examination, Kapelsohn commented that he still had a mark on his hand forty-five minutes after using his hand to put it out of battery. The prosecutor commented that his hand did not have a mark, but recognized that whether a mark is made \u201cdepends on the individual's biology * * * [and] a million things that neither one of us have any business talking about with any expertise.\u201d\n\n{\u00b655} Lastly, the trial court duly instructed the jury both before and after trial that the closing arguments of counsel are \u201cdesigned to assist\u201d the jury in its deliberations but are not evidence. *Pang*, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 559 N.E.2d 1313, at paragraph four of the\n\n---\n\n3. The prosecutor pushed the Beretta against his hand to put it out of battery during his cross examination of Kapelsohn after Kapelsohn had made the same demonstration during direct examination.\nsyllabus (\"[a] presumption always exists that the jury has followed the instructions given to it by the trial court\").\n\n{\u00b656} Burry also claims the prosecutor improperly held himself out as an expert by explaining that he had firearms experience from his time in the Marine Corps and that one of the reasons he was brought on the case was because of his \u201cexpertise\u201d in handling firearms. Appellant\u2019s brief at 13.\n\n{\u00b657} The context of these comments readily demonstrates that the prosecutor was not holding himself out before the jury as an expert witness. Both comments occurred during the voir dire of the jury. In one instance, the prosecutor responded to a juror\u2019s statement that his experience and knowledge came from the \u201cU.S. Army\u201d with \u201cthat\u2019s my same experience in the Marine Corps.\u201d In the other instance, the prosecutor mentioned his \u201cexpertise\u201d to assure the jury that \u201cwe would handle this firearm [the Beretta] safely\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019re going to follow the safety things that everyone * * * is taught from the get go.\u201d\n\n{\u00b658} Burry\u2019s final argument under this assignment of error is that the prosecutor improperly claimed \u201cthat the defense expert was \u2018tricking\u2019 the jury.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 14. The prosecutor was referring to Kapelsohn\u2019s demonstration of how the Beretta would not be able to release its hammer (have a \u201cdead trigger\u201d) if it was put a quarter inch or more out of battery. On cross examination, the prosecutor had Kapelsohn admit that in order to achieve this result it was necessary for him to tilt his hand and apply\n\n4. Counsel for Burry likewise addressed the issue during voir dire: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you that I\u2019m an expert. I can tell you that I\u2019m knowledgeable on the subject. I can tell you I\u2019ve been trained. I can tell you I\u2019ve been to the range. I can tell you I\u2019ve had several hours of shooting range practice and I\u2019ve done the course and I know the laws associated with the weapons and firing the weapons but are you able to kind of, can you look at me, can you look at Bob [Burry] the same way you look at Mr. Kaplan [the prosecutor]; what do you guys think? I\u2019m seeing nods, okay.\u201d\npressure to the top portion of the slide to allow it to move independently of the barrel. If the Beretta is pushed against the hand or other hard surface perpendicularly so that the slide and barrel moved in unison, the slide would not be able to be pushed so far out of battery as to disengage the hammer. In other words, when Kapelsohn performed the demonstration he pushed the Beretta against his hand at an angle and this affected the result.\n\n{\u00b659} In referring to the demonstration during closing argument, the prosecutor described the demonstration as a \u201ctrick\u201d:\n\nHe\u2019s holding his hand trying to push at the top of the slide to create the separation so he can get the trigger to go spongy [dead] like he showed and manipulated. * * * That\u2019s the problem I had with Kapelsohn and the extent that he went to try and cup the barrel and push against the slide so he can get the trigger in the position because when you\u2019re being fair about it when you\u2019re pushing it [the slide and barrel] together like a normal person would be you\u2019re not going to get it there [past a quarter inch]. That\u2019s a trick he\u2019s trying to pull on you, don\u2019t buy it.\n\n{\u00b660} The prosecutor\u2019s characterization of Kapelsohn\u2019s demonstration as a trick is within the permissible bounds for closing argument. This court has observed that \u201c[t]here is no requirement that a prosecutor\u2019s language must be neutral in its characterizations of the evidence or defense strategy.\u201d State v. Novak, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2003-L-077, 2005-Ohio-563, \u00b6 42 (the prosecutor described the defense strategy as a \u201cwhitewash\u201d he was trying to \u201csell\u201d the jury). In the present case, the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the demonstration as a trick was no more pejorative (or improper) than was defense counsel\u2019s comments that \u201cthe government has told [Carol] what to say from the beginning\u201d and \u201cfrom December 24th, 2016 at approximately 8:30 p.m. this woman\u2019s been told and coached what to say.\u201d\nThe first assignment of error is without merit.\n\nIn his second and third assignments of error, Burry argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions and that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nThe manifest weight of the evidence and the sufficiency of the evidence are distinct legal concepts. *State v. Elmore*, 111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, 857 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 44. With respect to the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus, following *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)."}
{"Index": "079-JARRELL", "allegation": "The trial court erred by prohibiting testimony and evidence relating to Battered Child Syndrome and/or PTSD as said evidence was admissible pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in State v. Nemeth.", "evidence": "The trial court sentenced Appellant to a period of incarceration of fifteen years to life for murder, thirty-six months for tampering with evidence, and twelve months for receiving stolen property. The court ordered the sentences to run consecutively, for an aggregate prison term of nineteen years to life with credit for 1,127 days served. This timely appeal followed.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n\nThe trial court erred by prohibiting testimony and evidence relating to Battered Child Syndrome and/or PTSD as said evidence was admissible pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in State v. Nemeth.\n\nAppellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and her potential testimony, which was relevant to his argument regarding voluntary manslaughter. As the evidence was intended to demonstrate a history of child abuse that triggered Appellant\u2019s sudden passion and fit of rage, he argues this evidence is admissible pursuant to Nemeth. The evidence was also necessary to respond to the state\u2019s repeated commentary on his lack of corroboration regarding his allegations of sexual abuse.\nThe state responds that Dr. McPherson did not diagnose Appellant with battered child syndrome, thus her report and the potential testimony of Appellant\u2019s mother and sister are irrelevant. The state also argues that Appellant did not testify that he acted under a sudden passion or a fit of rage. Even so, the state points out that words are generally insufficient to support a voluntary manslaughter claim.\n\nThere are four separate evidentiary issues within this assignment of error, including the admissibility of: (1) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving T.J., (2) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving a childhood acquaintance, (3) evidence of a head injury Appellant suffered as a child, and (4) testimony from Appellant\u2019s mother and sister pertaining to the abuse inflicted by T.J. While each argument is related, a distinct analysis of each is required.\n\nAppellant was diagnosed with PTSD. According to Dr. McPherson\u2019s report, her diagnosis was based on an interview with Appellant, psychological testing, ancillary information, and an interview with Appellant\u2019s sister. Appellant\u2019s sister spoke to Dr. McPherson about an incident where she observed Appellant and T.J. engaging in inappropriate behavior. The report detailed the alleged sexual abuse of Appellant by T.J. and was consistent with Appellant\u2019s testimony; however, the report provided a more in-depth look at the abuse. The report also addressed abuse Appellant suffered from a childhood acquaintance and a head injury he suffered as a child. These latter two incidents are limited to a few lines in the report.\n\nAccording to the report, Appellant\u2019s coping mechanism involves a high level of emotional reactivity due to the extent of his trauma. The report also noted that Appellant has an issue with male sexuality due to T.J. subjecting him to male partners at\na young age. Dr. McPherson found that Appellant\u2019s description of the abuse was consistent with her test results. Based on the testing, Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with major depressive disorder, PTSD as a result of multiple sexual abuse experiences, and substance abuse and dependance. Dr. McPherson opined that the abuse perpetrated by T.J. is considered extreme based on Appellant\u2019s repeated victimization.\n\nChild Abuse - T.J.\n\n\u00b619 The leading case regarding child abuse that results in the killing of the abuser is Nemeth. In Nemeth, the defendant\u2019s mother violently physically abused him for several years. Id. at 202. On the date of the incident, the defendant\u2019s mother was abusive and, believing his life was in danger, he killed her. The defense sought to introduce a report diagnosing him with PTSD/battered child syndrome for purpose of establishing a self-defense claim and as a justification for a lesser included offense to murder. Id. at 204.\n\n\u00b620 At oral argument in the instant case, the state suggested that Nemeth is limited to cases involving violent abuse and does not apply to cases involving sexual abuse. Contrary to the state\u2019s claim, there is no support for the argument that Nemeth is limited to violent abuse, alone. Nemeth clearly articulates a general rule that expert testimony is admissible if it is relevant. While it is true that Nemeth involved violent abuse, nothing within the opinion limits its application to that type of abuse.\n\n\u00b621 In fact, the oral arguments in Nemeth relied on a case involving sexual abuse and this is discussed in Nemeth. Nemeth, 82 Ohio St.3d at 207, 694 N.E.2d 1332 (1998), citing State v. Stowers, 81 Ohio St.3d 260, 690 N.E.2d 881 (1998); Nemeth at fn.\n1, citing Stowers, supra. While Stowers did not involve the death of the abuser, it did involve the admissibility of expert testimony on the issue of whether a violently abused child fits the general characteristics observed in sexually abused children. Id. at 262.\n\n{\u00b622} The Nemeth Court applied Stowers\u2019 guiding principles and determined that \u201c[g]eneral information on battered child syndrome would also tend to show that [the defendant\u2019s] behavior was consistent with that of an abused child and would lend support to his testimony that he had been abused both generally and just prior to the killing.\u201d Nemeth at 207, citing Stowers, at 262.\n\n{\u00b623} If the Nemeth Court found it appropriate to rely on Stowers, then it stands to reason that Nemeth is applicable to sexual abuse cases where expert testimony is offered by the defense. Notably, Nemeth has been applied to several other cases involving sexual abuse. See State v. Butts, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108381, 2020-Ohio-1498; State v. Slaven, 5th Dist. Delaware No. 12 CAA 08 0062, 2013-Ohio-3552; State v. Jennings, 10th Dist. Franklin 2001 WL 1045490 (Sept. 13, 2001). Although none of these cases involved the death of the abuser, their reliance on Nemeth furthers the proposition that this case is not limited to physically violent child abuse claims, but stands for the proposition that if expert testimony is relevant and satisfies Evid.R. 702, it is admissible.\n\n{\u00b624} Significantly, the Nemeth Court specifically stated that:\n\nThe defense in this case did not ask that battered child syndrome be recognized as a new defense or an independent justification for the killing of an abusive parent. The proffer made at trial was limited to expert testimony that would explain the psychological effects of long-term child\nabuse, and was proffered in support of a self-defense theory as well as a charge on voluntary manslaughter. As such, the issue before us is an evidentiary matter and is governed by the Ohio Rules of Evidence. Because there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court's exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant, we need not reach the constitutional issues addressed by the court of appeals.\n\nId. at 206-207.\n\n{\u00b625} We note that the state relies on State v. Hamad, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2017-T-0108, 2019-Ohio-2664, appeal not allowed, 157 Ohio St.3d 1466, 2019-Ohio-4419, 133 N.E.3d 537. However, Hamad is readily distinguishable from the instant case. In Hamad, the record demonstrated that \u201cthere [was] no history of physical abuse between the victims.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 98. The record also showed that \u201c[u]ntil the assault and shooting took place on February 25, only verbal threats and harassing behavior had been exchanged\u201d between the defendant and victim. Id. In the instant case, there was an attempt to present evidence of a lengthy history of sexual abuse that appears to span more than two decades. Hamad did not involve either violent physical or sexual abuse. Instead, it involved \u201can exchange of offensive communications\u201d that led to a physical confrontation. Id. at \u00b6 2.\n\n{\u00b626} The state also argues that Nemeth does not apply because Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with PTSD, not battered child syndrome. This argument ignores the plain language of Nemeth, which explained that battered child syndrome has many labels, including PTSD. The Nemeth Court noted that the psychological effects and behavioral\nsymptoms have long been recognized by the medical and legal professions regardless of which term is used. *Id.* at 206.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b626} The state also argues that Nemeth does not apply because Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with PTSD, not battered child syndrome. This argument ignores the plain language of Nemeth, which explained that battered child syndrome has many labels, including PTSD. The Nemeth Court noted that the psychological effects and behavioral\nsymptoms have long been recognized by the medical and legal professions regardless of which term is used. *Id.* at 206.\n\n{\u00b627} In the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the state\u2019s motion in this case, the court referenced *Nemeth* but relied on *State v. Fulmer*, 117 Ohio St.3d 319, 2008-Ohio-936, 883 N.E.2d 1052; *State v. Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982); and *State v. Jackson*, 32 Ohio St.2d 203, 291 N.E.2d 432 (1972). In *Fulmer*, the defendant produced expert testimony that he acted under the influence of an aspirin overdose at the time of the incident. The defense attempted to use the evidence to show that he was \u201cmetabolically deranged.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 64. The Court determined that the evidence was relevant to whether the defendant was capable of forming the requisite intent to commit the crime at issue. *Id.* As such, the Court determined the defense was the functional equivalent of a diminished capacity defense, which is not recognized within Ohio. *Id.* at \u00b6 69.\n\n{\u00b628} In *Wilcox*, the defendant attempted to introduce evidence to show that he was \u201cborderline retarded, schizophrenic, dyslexic, and to be suffering from organic brain syndrome.\u201d *Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d at 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982). The Court held that \u201ca defendant may not offer expert psychiatric testimony, unrelated to the insanity defense, to show that the defendant lacked the mental capacity to form the specific mental state required for a particular crime or degree of crime.\u201d *Id.* at 199.\n\n{\u00b629} In *Jackson*, the defendant similarly attempted to introduce evidence that he was suffering from a mental disease or defect which so impaired his reason at the time of the criminal act that he did not act knowingly. *Id.* at 205-206. In a limited analysis, the Court explained that in order to attack intent based on capacity, a defendant must show\nthat he was either too intoxicated to form intent (a state of unconsciousness) or have such \u201cdefect of reason as not to know the nature and quality of the illegal act or that it is wrong (insane).\u201d *Id.* at 206.\n\n{\u00b630} We note that *Fulmer* was decided after *Nemeth* but does not cite to *Nemeth*. This is because the two cases address wholly separate issues. *Fulmer*, along with *Jackson* and *Wilcox*, address evidence of an impaired mental state which is intended to show that the defendant did not act knowingly, whereas *Nemeth* addresses evidence of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant in order to support either a self-defense instruction or voluntary manslaughter charge. As the evidence in this case was sought in an attempt to show that the history of abuse caused Appellant to become enraged and act with sudden passion, and not to argue that he was so impaired he lacked the ability to understand the nature of his actions, *Nemeth* and not *Fulmer, Jackson*, and *Wilcox*, applies.\n\n{\u00b631} In accordance with *Nemeth*, such evidence is admissible so long as it is relevant and meets the criteria of Evid.R. 702. *Id.* at 207. Pursuant to Evid.R. 401: \u201c\u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d\n\n{\u00b632} The state contends that the evidence is irrelevant, relying on *State v. Sallie*, 81 Ohio St.3d 673, 693 N.E.2d 267 (1998). However, *Sallie* is also readily distinguishable from the instant matter. The issue before the *Sallie* Court was whether trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to argue that the defendant suffered from battered woman\u2019s syndrome. At trial, however, the defendant did not claim self-\ndefense. Rather, she claimed the shooting was an accident. As the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental, and not a conscious act of self-defense, the Court concluded that any evidence regarding battered woman\u2019s syndrome was irrelevant. *Id.* at 676.\n\n{\u00b633} The *Nemeth* Court held that evidence of child abuse is relevant to the determination of whether the accused \u201chad acted with prior calculation and design as charged in the indictment, (2) had acted with purpose as required for the lesser included offense of murder, (3) had created the confrontation or initiated the confrontation or initiated the aggression, and (4) had an honest belief that he was in imminent danger.\u201d *Id.* at 207.\n\n{\u00b634} Relevant to the instant matter, the *Nemeth* Court also explained that Expert testimony on battered child syndrome would, in this case, tend to enhance the probability that [the defendant\u2019s] account of the facts leading up to the killing was truthful and would lend credibility to his assertion that he was in a state of rage and dissociation at the time of the killing. A diagnosis of battered child syndrome and an explanation of its effects would therefore be relevant in determining whether the case warranted a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter.\n\n*Id.* at 207-208.\n\n{\u00b635} At the outset, it is important to consider the *Nemeth* court\u2019s explanation that \u201c[t]he triggering event for posttraumatic stress disorder can be any traumatic event that involved \u2018actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others\u2019 and where the person\u2019s response involved \u2018intense fear, helplessness,\nor horror.\u201d *Id.* at 212. The Court explained that these responses are triggered by an \u201cinterpersonal stressor\u201d that can manifest itself in \u201cfear and anxiety, abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control, reenacting or physiologically reexperiencing the abuse, avoidance (often in the form of hypervigilance), helplessness, somatic complaints, and various forms of dissociation.\u201d *Id.* at 213.\n\n{\u00b636} As in *Nemeth*, Appellant argues that Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and testimony was relevant to lend credence to his account of the facts leading up to the killing and to provide credibility for his assertion that he was in a state of rage at the time of the incident, both of which are aspects of his voluntary manslaughter argument. He also contends that the evidence is admissible to rebut the state\u2019s repeated comments that he could not corroborate his abuse claims, and to dispel any misconceptions the jurors may have had as to why he did not previously inform anyone of the abuse.\n\n{\u00b637} We begin our review of Appellant\u2019s voluntary manslaughter argument by noting that the trial court did instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. Thus, the trial court implicitly found that Appellant\u2019s testimony, limited as it was, provided a sufficient basis to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction. However, contrary to the state\u2019s contentions, we cannot limit our analysis of Appellant\u2019s voluntary manslaughter argument to his testimony, alone. This is because the question before us is whether Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and testimony would have made a voluntary manslaughter conviction more or less probable. Thus, in determining whether that evidence is relevant, we must also consider the extent of what Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and potential testimony would have added to Appellant\u2019s testimony.\nIn beginning our review of Appellant\u2019s testimony, we first address the state\u2019s assertion that a defendant must specifically state legal \u201cbuzzwords\u201d such as \u201csudden passion\u201d and \u201cfit of rage\u201d within their testimony. This assertion is incorrect. Unlike attorneys, lay members of society tend to lack the legal knowledge and sophistication to articulate these terms. Even without using those specific terms, a defendant can sufficiently demonstrate the concepts by describing emotions, actions, or reactions that emulate this standard.\n\nHere, Appellant did not explicitly use the phrases \u201csudden passion\u201d or \u201cfit of rage\u201d during his testimony. Thus, we review his testimony to determine whether the substance of that testimony established facts that would show \u201csudden passion\u201d and \u201ca fit of rage.\u201d\n\nAccording to Appellant, T.J. became physical with him, throwing things at him and charging at him with a glass snow globe in her hand. Prior to that, she made sexual advances towards him while becoming verbally abusive. The state discounts the language used by T.J. by arguing that words alone are insufficient to establish sudden passion. While the state is generally correct, this is the point where the expert report and testimony of Dr. McPherson become essential to Appellant\u2019s claims. It is Dr. McPherson\u2019s report that links the decades of sexual abuse and sexual confusion to the import these words and actions had on Appellant\u2019s behavior.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b651} As to the second prong of Evid.R. 702, the record does not reflect that the state objected to or otherwise questioned Dr. McPherson\u2019s qualifications. Hence, we may infer that the witness satisfied the second prong of the test.\n\n{\u00b652} As to the third prong, the *Nemeth* Court held that \u201cthe behavioral and psychological effects of prolonged child abuse on the child have been generally accepted in the medical and psychiatric communities and therefore unquestionably meet the requisite level of reliability for admission as the subject of expert testimony.\u201d *Id.* at 212. Thus, the evidence is based on scientific information.\n\n{\u00b653} As to prejudice, the *Nemeth* Court set forth two reasons for their holding: \u201c[b]ecause there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant * * *.\u201d *Id.* at 207. It appears axiomatic that a defendant will be prejudiced by the exclusion of otherwise relevant, partially exculpable evidence. To the extent that prejudice must be shown, this jury did not find Appellant guilty of the most serious offenses with which he was charged, aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. Based on the jury\u2019s failure to find Appellant guilty of these two offenses, it can be inferred that\njury believed Appellant\u2019s testimony at least in part. Based on the jury\u2019s reluctance to convict Appellant on the most serious offenses, the improperly excluded evidence could very well have resulted in a conviction on voluntary manslaughter instead of murder. Thus, this record reveals that Appellant was prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence.\n\n\u00b654 Appellant\u2019s argument that he was entitled to expert testimony regarding the sexual abuse perpetrated by T.J. has merit. As such, Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and her testimony are admissible as they relate to this particular evidence, but our determination as to this evidence is limited to only the evidence applicable to T.J.\u2019s abuse of Appellant, as we discuss below.\n\nSexual Abuse \u2013 Acquaintance\n\n\u00b655 Appellant also sought to admit evidence pertaining to sexual abuse inflicted on him by the uncle of a childhood friend. As earlier discussed, evidence of child abuse is relevant only where the defendant\u2019s conduct is directed towards the abuser. Gray at \u00b6 31. This principal is consistent with Nemeth. Hence, any evidence that Appellant had been abused by some other person would not be relevant to Appellant\u2019s sudden passion or a fit of rage towards T.J. As such, any evidence within Dr. McPherson\u2019s report that addressed the abuse perpetrated by anyone other than T.J. is inadmissible.\n\n\u00b656 We note here that there are a limited number of references to a third-party abuser in Dr. McPherson\u2019s report. As this evidence is not admissible, these limited references must be redacted from the report and cannot be referenced within Dr. McPherson or any other witness\u2019 testimony.\n\nTestimony of Appellant\u2019s Mother and Sister\nAppellant also contends that the trial court erroneously excluded the testimony of his mother and his sister. According to Appellant, his mother and sister would have provided testimony in support of his claims of abuse perpetrated by T.J., the abuse he suffered from his childhood acquaintance, and the head injury he suffered as a child.\n\nIn response, the state argues that because Dr. McPherson\u2019s report was excluded, any similar testimony offered by Appellant\u2019s mother and sister would have been irrelevant.\n\nAll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by the Constitution of the State of Ohio, by statute enacted by the General Assembly not in conflict with a rule of the Supreme Court of Ohio, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n\nEvid.R. 402.\n\nEvidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evid.R. 401. \u201cEvidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d Evid.R. 402.\n\n\u201cThe admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d State v. Griffin, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 16 MA 0029, 2017-Ohio-7796, \u00b6 27, citing State v. Sage, 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 180, 510 N.E.2d 343 (1987). \u201cError may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a\nsubstantial right of the party is affected\u201d and the issue is properly preserved. Evid.R. 103(A).\n\n\u00b661 At trial, defense counsel informed the court that the witnesses would provide testimony regarding the abuse Appellant suffered from the victim and from a childhood acquaintance, and would discuss his prior head injury. It is unclear why the court deemed their testimony inadmissible; however, it appears that the court\u2019s decision may have been based on the exclusion of Dr. McPherson\u2019s report.\n\n\u00b662 As previously discussed, any testimony regarding the abuse perpetrated by T.J. is relevant and admissible. Dr. McPherson\u2019s report indicates that Appellant\u2019s sister \u201ccaught\u201d Appellant and T.J. engaging in inappropriate behavior. Thus, it appears she may have had personal knowledge pertaining to those accusations. The record does not indicate if Appellant\u2019s mother had personal knowledge of the abuse; however, there is no reason to prohibit her testimony to the extent she has such knowledge. As such, Appellant\u2019s argument as to the testimony of his mother and sister has merit as it pertains to Appellant\u2019s sexual abuse perpetrated by T.J.\n\nHead Injury\n\n\u00b663 Appellant sought to introduce evidence that he suffered some sort of head injury as a child. Again, in Fulmer the Ohio Supreme Court reiterated that the partial defense of diminished capacity is not recognized in Ohio. Id. at \u00b6 66. The Court explained that the appellant\u2019s attempt to introduce evidence of a metabolic derangement (the aspirin overdose) was the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a diminished capacity argument because it sought to show that he lacked the mental capacity to form the specific mental state required. Fulmer at \u00b6 69. Further, the Court explained that \u201c[i]f the evidence generates\nonly a mere speculation or possible doubt, such evidence is insufficient to raise the affirmative defense, and submission of the issue to the jury will be unwarranted.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 72, citing *State v. Robinson*, 47 Ohio St.2d 103, 111-112, 351 N.E.2d 88 (1976).\n\n{\u00b664} Similarly, the Courts in *Jackson* and *Wilcox* held that evidence designed to show an inability to form the requisite mental capacity is inadmissible as evidence of diminished capacity. See *Jackson* and *Wilcox* (evidence of mental disease or defect or evidence that the defendant suffered from borderline mental retardation, was schizophrenic, dyslexic, and suffering from organic brain syndrome inadmissible.)\n\n{\u00b665} Appellant has not explained how he seeks to use evidence pertaining to his injury. It would appear he seeks to introduce it as evidence that the injury affected his mental capacity. As such, Appellant\u2019s argument pertaining to the head injury is similarly without merit. Dr. McPherson\u2019s report contains only a limited reference to the injury which must be redacted.\n\n{\u00b666} In summation, Appellant\u2019s arguments as to evidence pertaining to his sexual abuse perpetrated by T.J. have merit and are sustained. The remaining arguments within Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error are without merit and are overruled.\n\n**ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2**\n\nThe Prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments, thus depriving Appellant of his right to a fair trial.\n\n{\u00b667} Appellant contends that the prosecutor made a series of comments during closing arguments that constituted prosecutorial misconduct. Appellant groups these into separate categories: denigration of defense counsel, appeals to the emotions of the jury,\nand other remarks. Appellant acknowledged that he did not object to all of the comments at issue.\n\n{\u00b668} Due to resolution of Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, Appellant\u2019s conviction is vacated and this matter is reversed and remanded for a new trial. Thus, this assignment of error is moot. We must note, however, that the state repeatedly made comments regarding Appellant and his counsel that were disturbing, disrespectful and improper. Even after being chided by the court, the state continued to make such comments until the court was forced to call a sidebar conference. At its conclusion, the state made yet one more such comment. While we are disturbed by the record in this regard, we are certain that on remand, the issue will not be capable of repetition. Therefore, this assignment of error is moot.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3\n\nThe trial court erred in imposing maximum, consecutive sentences.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nIN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\n\nSEVENTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\nMAHONING COUNTY\n\nSTATE OF OHIO,\n\nPlaintiff-Appellee,\n\nv.\n\nJAMES JARRELL,\n\nDefendant-Appellant.\n\nOPINION AND JUDGMENT ENTRY\nCase No. 18 MA 0119\n\nCriminal Appeal from the\nCourt of Common Pleas of Mahoning County, Ohio\nCase No. 15 CR 943\n\nBEFORE:\nCheryl L. Waite, Gene Donofrio, Carol Ann Robb, Judges.\n\nJUDGMENT:\nReversed and Remanded.\nConviction Vacated.\n\nAtty. Paul J. Gains, Mahoning County Prosecutor and Atty. Ralph M. Rivera, Assistant Chief Prosecuting Attorney, Criminal Division, 21 West Boardman Street, 6th Floor, Youngstown, Ohio 44503, for Plaintiff-Appellee\nAppellant James Jarrell appeals an October 17, 2018 Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas judgment entry convicting him of various offenses associated with the murder of his stepmother, T.J., following his jury trial. Appellant argues that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence, including sexual child abuse of Appellant perpetrated by T.J., sexual abuse perpetrated by a childhood acquaintance, and that Appellant suffered a head injury as a child. He also argues that several statements made by the state during closing arguments constitute prosecutorial misconduct. Finally, he contends the court improperly imposed consecutive sentences. Appellant\u2019s argument regarding the admissibility of evidence related to the sexual abuse of Appellant by T.J. has merit pursuant to State v. Nemeth, 82 Ohio St.3d 202, 694 N.E.2d 1332 (1998). However, Appellant\u2019s arguments as to the other two items of evidence he seeks to admit are meritless. The remainder of Appellant\u2019s arguments are moot. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed. Appellant\u2019s convictions are hereby vacated and the matter is remanded for a new trial.\n\nFactual and Procedural History\n\nAppellant admits he killed his stepmother, T.J., after the two argued about their relationship. According to Appellant, he met T.J. for the first time when he was eight years old. At that time, she was married to her now ex-husband. (Trial Tr., p. 680.)\nAccording to Appellant, he and T.J. engaged in sexual touching on the day they met. Appellant alleges this conduct continued, but it is unclear how frequently.\n\n{\u00b63} Several years later, when Appellant was fifteen or sixteen years old, his father began dating T.J. and they married shortly thereafter. When T.J. moved into the Jarrell house, the touching immediately escalated to sexual intercourse between T.J. and Appellant. They also regularly used drugs together. According to Appellant, when T.J. ran out of drugs, she would ask him to have sex with their male drug dealer. (Trial Tr., p. 684.)\n\n{\u00b64} While Appellant\u2019s father admitted that T.J. drank alcohol in excess and used cocaine, he denied that she had a sexual relationship with Appellant. However, he acknowledged that T.J. did not have a good relationship with any of his children except for Appellant. Although he knew T.J. used drugs, Appellant\u2019s father would not allow Appellant into the marital residence when he was not home because of Appellant\u2019s drug use.\n\n{\u00b65} According to Appellant, on the day of the killing T.J. had invited him to the house. (Trial Tr., p. 686.) He asked a friend, Z.J., to give him a ride. Z.J. is apparently a drug dealer. When they approached the house, Appellant cautioned Z.J. not to pull into the driveway and Appellant reclined his seat. He testified that T.J. had instructed him to avoid being seen coming to the house because the neighbors would tell his father. (Trial Tr., p., 688.) Z.J. testified that although he did not specifically know there was a sexual relationship between Appellant and T.J., he once observed them hug in a manner that would not be expected between a stepmother and stepson.\nWhen Appellant entered the house, T.J. hugged him and then washed his clothes while he took a shower. According to Appellant, it was raining outside and his clothes were wet. When he exited the shower, T.J. provided him with some of his father\u2019s clothes. After Appellant settled in, T.J. initiated a conversation regarding the future of their relationship. She informed him that she intended to divorce his father. She asked Appellant to move to Florida with her to continue their relationship. When Appellant responded that moving to Florida would not be in his best interests because his life was in a state of disarray, she took his hand and placed it on her crotch and said, \u201cyou don\u2019t love me.\u201d (Trial Tr., p. 692.) He responded that he did love her.\n\nShe then became physically and verbally abusive, stating \u201c[y]ou don\u2019t know how to be a man\u201d and calling him a \u201cfaggot.\u201d (Trial Tr., p. 692.) As she screamed, she threw nearby objects at him, including a can of beer or a beer bottle. When she picked up a glass snow globe and charged at him, Appellant reached for a box cutter that was nearby and began to swing it at her. He testified that he remembered cutting her, but did not know how many times.\n\nWhen he realized she was dead, he did not think anyone would believe him about the circumstances leading to her death. He washed the blood off of his hands and changed into another set of his father\u2019s clothes. He took two credit cards and some jewelry before leaving the house in T.J.\u2019s car. Appellant used the credit cards to purchase gas and a few items at WalMart. He also purchased heroin, testifying that he planned to overdose and commit suicide. (Trial Tr., p. 694.) At some point, he met up with Z.J. and they used drugs together.\nAppellant drove T.J.\u2019s car to Pittsburgh to seek help from a friend. While he was in Pittsburgh, detectives from Youngstown contacted the Pittsburgh Police Department and put a BOLO (\u201cbe on the lookout\u201d order) on the car. Two plain clothed detectives in an unmarked vehicle saw Appellant sitting in the car while parked at a gas station. Appellant was arrested and transported to Youngstown.\n\nOn September 17, 2015, Appellant was indicted on the following charges: one count of aggravated murder, an unclassified felony in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B),(F); one count of murder, an unclassified felony in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A),(D); one count of aggravated robbery, a felony of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), (C); one count of tampering with evidence, a felony of the third degree in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1), (B); and one count of receiving stolen property, a felony of the fifth degree in violation of R.C. 2913.51(A), (C).\n\nPrior to trial, Appellant obtained a psychological report from Dr. Sandra McPherson. Dr. McPherson evaluated Appellant and diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) as a result of his childhood sexual abuse involving not only T.J. but also due to a separate incident involving a childhood acquaintance who had earlier molested Appellant. The report also noted that Appellant had suffered a significant head injury when he was a child. The state filed a motion in limine to exclude the report and any accompanying testimony from Dr. McPherson. The state also sought to prevent Appellant\u2019s mother and sister from testifying about the abuse. The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion, finding that the report was intended to support a defense of diminished capacity, which is not recognized in Ohio.\nAppellant testified at trial. He attempted to raise the issue of sexual abuse, but was limited as to this testimony after the trial court sustained an objection from the state. Based on Appellant\u2019s testimony, the trial court did allow an instruction to the jury on voluntary manslaughter. Appellant was found guilty of murder, tampering with evidence, and receiving stolen property. The jury acquitted him of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery.\n\nThe trial court sentenced Appellant to a period of incarceration of fifteen years to life for murder, thirty-six months for tampering with evidence, and twelve months for receiving stolen property. The court ordered the sentences to run consecutively, for an aggregate prison term of nineteen years to life with credit for 1,127 days served. This timely appeal followed.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n\nThe trial court erred by prohibiting testimony and evidence relating to Battered Child Syndrome and/or PTSD as said evidence was admissible pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in State v. Nemeth.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b668} Due to resolution of Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, Appellant\u2019s conviction is vacated and this matter is reversed and remanded for a new trial. Thus, this assignment of error is moot. We must note, however, that the state repeatedly made comments regarding Appellant and his counsel that were disturbing, disrespectful and improper. Even after being chided by the court, the state continued to make such comments until the court was forced to call a sidebar conference. At its conclusion, the state made yet one more such comment. While we are disturbed by the record in this regard, we are certain that on remand, the issue will not be capable of repetition. Therefore, this assignment of error is moot.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3\n\nThe trial court erred in imposing maximum, consecutive sentences.\n\n{\u00b669} While Appellant concedes that the trial court made the requisite statutory findings, Appellant argues that the imposition of consecutive sentences is improper where the reason for the consecutive nature of his sentence is the mere fact that a murder occurred. Appellant argues that his two convictions for nonviolent offenses, tampering and receiving stolen property, were ordered to run consecutively solely because a murder was committed.\n\n{\u00b670} In response, the state argues that the killing was particularly gruesome and that hiding the murder weapon impaired law enforcement\u2019s ability to resolve the case.\nThe state also contends the fact that Appellant stole credit cards and the vehicle after the murder supports consecutive sentences.\n\n{\u00b671} Because we have found partial merit with Appellant\u2019s first assignment and have remanded the matter for a new trial, Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is moot.\n\nConclusion\n\n{\u00b672} Appellant argues that trial court improperly excluded evidence of sexual child abuse perpetrated against him by T.J. Pursuant to Nemeth, Appellant\u2019s argument is correct and this evidence is admissible.

{"Index": "079-JARRELL", "allegation": "The Prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments, thus depriving Appellant of his right to a fair trial.", "evidence": "{\u00b668} Due to resolution of Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, Appellant\u2019s conviction is vacated and this matter is reversed and remanded for a new trial. Thus, this assignment of error is moot. We must note, however, that the state repeatedly made comments regarding Appellant and his counsel that were disturbing, disrespectful and improper. Even after being chided by the court, the state continued to make such comments until the court was forced to call a sidebar conference. At its conclusion, the state made yet one more such comment. While we are disturbed by the record in this regard, we are certain that on remand, the issue will not be capable of repetition. Therefore, this assignment of error is moot.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3\n\nThe trial court erred in imposing maximum, consecutive sentences.\n\n{\u00b669} While Appellant concedes that the trial court made the requisite statutory findings, Appellant argues that the imposition of consecutive sentences is improper where the reason for the consecutive nature of his sentence is the mere fact that a murder occurred. Appellant argues that his two convictions for nonviolent offenses, tampering and receiving stolen property, were ordered to run consecutively solely because a murder was committed.\n\n{\u00b670} In response, the state argues that the killing was particularly gruesome and that hiding the murder weapon impaired law enforcement\u2019s ability to resolve the case.\nThe state also contends the fact that Appellant stole credit cards and the vehicle after the murder supports consecutive sentences.\n\n{\u00b671} Because we have found partial merit with Appellant\u2019s first assignment and have remanded the matter for a new trial, Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is moot.\n\nConclusion\n\n{\u00b672} Appellant argues that trial court improperly excluded evidence of sexual child abuse perpetrated against him by T.J. Pursuant to Nemeth, Appellant\u2019s argument is correct and this evidence is admissible. However, his argument that the court improperly excluded evidence of sexual abuse concerning an abuser who is not involved in this case and evidence that he suffered a head injury as a child is without merit.

The court ordered the sentences to run consecutively, for an aggregate prison term of nineteen years to life with credit for 1,127 days served. This timely appeal followed.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n\nThe trial court erred by prohibiting testimony and evidence relating to Battered Child Syndrome and/or PTSD as said evidence was admissible pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in State v. Nemeth.\n\nAppellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and her potential testimony, which was relevant to his argument regarding voluntary manslaughter. As the evidence was intended to demonstrate a history of child abuse that triggered Appellant\u2019s sudden passion and fit of rage, he argues this evidence is admissible pursuant to Nemeth. The evidence was also necessary to respond to the state\u2019s repeated commentary on his lack of corroboration regarding his allegations of sexual abuse.\nThe state responds that Dr. McPherson did not diagnose Appellant with battered child syndrome, thus her report and the potential testimony of Appellant\u2019s mother and sister are irrelevant. The state also argues that Appellant did not testify that he acted under a sudden passion or a fit of rage. Even so, the state points out that words are generally insufficient to support a voluntary manslaughter claim.\n\nThere are four separate evidentiary issues within this assignment of error, including the admissibility of: (1) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving T.J., (2) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving a childhood acquaintance, (3) evidence of a head injury Appellant suffered as a child, and (4) testimony from Appellant\u2019s mother and sister pertaining to the abuse inflicted by T.J. While each argument is related, a distinct analysis of each is required.\n\nAppellant was diagnosed with PTSD. According to Dr. McPherson\u2019s report, her diagnosis was based on an interview with Appellant, psychological testing, ancillary information, and an interview with Appellant\u2019s sister. Appellant\u2019s sister spoke to Dr. McPherson about an incident where she observed Appellant and T.J. engaging in inappropriate behavior. The report detailed the alleged sexual abuse of Appellant by T.J. and was consistent with Appellant\u2019s testimony; however, the report provided a more in-depth look at the abuse. The report also addressed abuse Appellant suffered from a childhood acquaintance and a head injury he suffered as a child. These latter two incidents are limited to a few lines in the report.\n\nAccording to the report, Appellant\u2019s coping mechanism involves a high level of emotional reactivity due to the extent of his trauma. The report also noted that Appellant has an issue with male sexuality due to T.J. subjecting him to male partners at\na young age. Dr. McPherson found that Appellant\u2019s description of the abuse was consistent with her test results. Based on the testing, Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with major depressive disorder, PTSD as a result of multiple sexual abuse experiences, and substance abuse and dependance. Dr. McPherson opined that the abuse perpetrated by T.J. is considered extreme based on Appellant\u2019s repeated victimization.\n\nChild Abuse - T.J.\n\n\u00b619 The leading case regarding child abuse that results in the killing of the abuser is Nemeth. In Nemeth, the defendant\u2019s mother violently physically abused him for several years. Id. at 202. On the date of the incident, the defendant\u2019s mother was abusive and, believing his life was in danger, he killed her. The defense sought to introduce a report diagnosing him with PTSD/battered child syndrome for purpose of establishing a self-defense claim and as a justification for a lesser included offense to murder. Id. at 204.\n\n\u00b620 At oral argument in the instant case, the state suggested that Nemeth is limited to cases involving violent abuse and does not apply to cases involving sexual abuse. Contrary to the state\u2019s claim, there is no support for the argument that Nemeth is limited to violent abuse, alone. Nemeth clearly articulates a general rule that expert testimony is admissible if it is relevant. While it is true that Nemeth involved violent abuse, nothing within the opinion limits its application to that type of abuse.\n\n\u00b621 In fact, the oral arguments in Nemeth relied on a case involving sexual abuse and this is discussed in Nemeth. Nemeth, 82 Ohio St.3d at 207, 694 N.E.2d 1332 (1998), citing State v. Stowers, 81 Ohio St.3d 260, 690 N.E.2d 881 (1998); Nemeth at fn.\n1, citing Stowers, supra. While Stowers did not involve the death of the abuser, it did involve the admissibility of expert testimony on the issue of whether a violently abused child fits the general characteristics observed in sexually abused children. Id. at 262.\n\n{\u00b622} The Nemeth Court applied Stowers\u2019 guiding principles and determined that \u201c[g]eneral information on battered child syndrome would also tend to show that [the defendant\u2019s] behavior was consistent with that of an abused child and would lend support to his testimony that he had been abused both generally and just prior to the killing.\u201d Nemeth at 207, citing Stowers, at 262.\n\n{\u00b623} If the Nemeth Court found it appropriate to rely on Stowers, then it stands to reason that Nemeth is applicable to sexual abuse cases where expert testimony is offered by the defense. Notably, Nemeth has been applied to several other cases involving sexual abuse. See State v. Butts, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108381, 2020-Ohio-1498; State v. Slaven, 5th Dist. Delaware No. 12 CAA 08 0062, 2013-Ohio-3552; State v. Jennings, 10th Dist. Franklin 2001 WL 1045490 (Sept. 13, 2001). Although none of these cases involved the death of the abuser, their reliance on Nemeth furthers the proposition that this case is not limited to physically violent child abuse claims, but stands for the proposition that if expert testimony is relevant and satisfies Evid.R. 702, it is admissible.\n\n{\u00b624} Significantly, the Nemeth Court specifically stated that:\n\nThe defense in this case did not ask that battered child syndrome be recognized as a new defense or an independent justification for the killing of an abusive parent. The proffer made at trial was limited to expert testimony that would explain the psychological effects of long-term child\nabuse, and was proffered in support of a self-defense theory as well as a charge on voluntary manslaughter. As such, the issue before us is an evidentiary matter and is governed by the Ohio Rules of Evidence. Because there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court's exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant, we need not reach the constitutional issues addressed by the court of appeals.\n\nId. at 206-207.\n\n{\u00b625} We note that the state relies on State v. Hamad, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2017-T-0108, 2019-Ohio-2664, appeal not allowed, 157 Ohio St.3d 1466, 2019-Ohio-4419, 133 N.E.3d 537. However, Hamad is readily distinguishable from the instant case. In Hamad, the record demonstrated that \u201cthere [was] no history of physical abuse between the victims.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 98. The record also showed that \u201c[u]ntil the assault and shooting took place on February 25, only verbal threats and harassing behavior had been exchanged\u201d between the defendant and victim. Id. In the instant case, there was an attempt to present evidence of a lengthy history of sexual abuse that appears to span more than two decades. Hamad did not involve either violent physical or sexual abuse. Instead, it involved \u201can exchange of offensive communications\u201d that led to a physical confrontation. Id. at \u00b6 2.\n\n{\u00b626} The state also argues that Nemeth does not apply because Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with PTSD, not battered child syndrome. This argument ignores the plain language of Nemeth, which explained that battered child syndrome has many labels, including PTSD. The Nemeth Court noted that the psychological effects and behavioral\nsymptoms have long been recognized by the medical and legal professions regardless of which term is used. *Id.* at 206.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nIN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\n\nSEVENTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\nMAHONING COUNTY\n\nSTATE OF OHIO,\n\nPlaintiff-Appellee,\n\nv.\n\nJAMES JARRELL,\n\nDefendant-Appellant.\n\nOPINION AND JUDGMENT ENTRY\nCase No. 18 MA 0119\n\nCriminal Appeal from the\nCourt of Common Pleas of Mahoning County, Ohio\nCase No. 15 CR 943\n\nBEFORE:\nCheryl L. Waite, Gene Donofrio, Carol Ann Robb, Judges.\n\nJUDGMENT:\nReversed and Remanded.\nConviction Vacated.\n\nAtty. Paul J. Gains, Mahoning County Prosecutor and Atty. Ralph M. Rivera, Assistant Chief Prosecuting Attorney, Criminal Division, 21 West Boardman Street, 6th Floor, Youngstown, Ohio 44503, for Plaintiff-Appellee\nAppellant James Jarrell appeals an October 17, 2018 Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas judgment entry convicting him of various offenses associated with the murder of his stepmother, T.J., following his jury trial. Appellant argues that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence, including sexual child abuse of Appellant perpetrated by T.J., sexual abuse perpetrated by a childhood acquaintance, and that Appellant suffered a head injury as a child. He also argues that several statements made by the state during closing arguments constitute prosecutorial misconduct. Finally, he contends the court improperly imposed consecutive sentences. Appellant\u2019s argument regarding the admissibility of evidence related to the sexual abuse of Appellant by T.J. has merit pursuant to State v. Nemeth, 82 Ohio St.3d 202, 694 N.E.2d 1332 (1998). However, Appellant\u2019s arguments as to the other two items of evidence he seeks to admit are meritless. The remainder of Appellant\u2019s arguments are moot. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed. Appellant\u2019s convictions are hereby vacated and the matter is remanded for a new trial.\n\nFactual and Procedural History\n\nAppellant admits he killed his stepmother, T.J., after the two argued about their relationship. According to Appellant, he met T.J. for the first time when he was eight years old. At that time, she was married to her now ex-husband. (Trial Tr., p. 680.)\nAccording to Appellant, he and T.J. engaged in sexual touching on the day they met. Appellant alleges this conduct continued, but it is unclear how frequently.\n\n{\u00b63} Several years later, when Appellant was fifteen or sixteen years old, his father began dating T.J. and they married shortly thereafter. When T.J. moved into the Jarrell house, the touching immediately escalated to sexual intercourse between T.J. and Appellant. They also regularly used drugs together. According to Appellant, when T.J. ran out of drugs, she would ask him to have sex with their male drug dealer. (Trial Tr., p. 684.)\n\n{\u00b64} While Appellant\u2019s father admitted that T.J. drank alcohol in excess and used cocaine, he denied that she had a sexual relationship with Appellant. However, he acknowledged that T.J. did not have a good relationship with any of his children except for Appellant. Although he knew T.J. used drugs, Appellant\u2019s father would not allow Appellant into the marital residence when he was not home because of Appellant\u2019s drug use.\n\n{\u00b65} According to Appellant, on the day of the killing T.J. had invited him to the house. (Trial Tr., p. 686.) He asked a friend, Z.J., to give him a ride. Z.J. is apparently a drug dealer. When they approached the house, Appellant cautioned Z.J. not to pull into the driveway and Appellant reclined his seat. He testified that T.J. had instructed him to avoid being seen coming to the house because the neighbors would tell his father. (Trial Tr., p., 688.) Z.J. testified that although he did not specifically know there was a sexual relationship between Appellant and T.J., he once observed them hug in a manner that would not be expected between a stepmother and stepson.\nWhen Appellant entered the house, T.J. hugged him and then washed his clothes while he took a shower. According to Appellant, it was raining outside and his clothes were wet. When he exited the shower, T.J. provided him with some of his father\u2019s clothes. After Appellant settled in, T.J. initiated a conversation regarding the future of their relationship. She informed him that she intended to divorce his father. She asked Appellant to move to Florida with her to continue their relationship. When Appellant responded that moving to Florida would not be in his best interests because his life was in a state of disarray, she took his hand and placed it on her crotch and said, \u201cyou don\u2019t love me.\u201d (Trial Tr., p. 692.) He responded that he did love her.\n\nShe then became physically and verbally abusive, stating \u201c[y]ou don\u2019t know how to be a man\u201d and calling him a \u201cfaggot.\u201d (Trial Tr., p. 692.) As she screamed, she threw nearby objects at him, including a can of beer or a beer bottle. When she picked up a glass snow globe and charged at him, Appellant reached for a box cutter that was nearby and began to swing it at her. He testified that he remembered cutting her, but did not know how many times.\n\nWhen he realized she was dead, he did not think anyone would believe him about the circumstances leading to her death. He washed the blood off of his hands and changed into another set of his father\u2019s clothes. He took two credit cards and some jewelry before leaving the house in T.J.\u2019s car. Appellant used the credit cards to purchase gas and a few items at WalMart. He also purchased heroin, testifying that he planned to overdose and commit suicide. (Trial Tr., p. 694.) At some point, he met up with Z.J. and they used drugs together.\nAppellant drove T.J.\u2019s car to Pittsburgh to seek help from a friend. While he was in Pittsburgh, detectives from Youngstown contacted the Pittsburgh Police Department and put a BOLO (\u201cbe on the lookout\u201d order) on the car. Two plain clothed detectives in an unmarked vehicle saw Appellant sitting in the car while parked at a gas station. Appellant was arrested and transported to Youngstown.\n\nOn September 17, 2015, Appellant was indicted on the following charges: one count of aggravated murder, an unclassified felony in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B),(F); one count of murder, an unclassified felony in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A),(D); one count of aggravated robbery, a felony of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), (C); one count of tampering with evidence, a felony of the third degree in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1), (B); and one count of receiving stolen property, a felony of the fifth degree in violation of R.C. 2913.51(A), (C).\n\nPrior to trial, Appellant obtained a psychological report from Dr. Sandra McPherson. Dr. McPherson evaluated Appellant and diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) as a result of his childhood sexual abuse involving not only T.J. but also due to a separate incident involving a childhood acquaintance who had earlier molested Appellant. The report also noted that Appellant had suffered a significant head injury when he was a child. The state filed a motion in limine to exclude the report and any accompanying testimony from Dr. McPherson. The state also sought to prevent Appellant\u2019s mother and sister from testifying about the abuse. The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion, finding that the report was intended to support a defense of diminished capacity, which is not recognized in Ohio.\nAppellant testified at trial. He attempted to raise the issue of sexual abuse, but was limited as to this testimony after the trial court sustained an objection from the state. Based on Appellant\u2019s testimony, the trial court did allow an instruction to the jury on voluntary manslaughter. Appellant was found guilty of murder, tampering with evidence, and receiving stolen property. The jury acquitted him of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery.\n\nThe trial court sentenced Appellant to a period of incarceration of fifteen years to life for murder, thirty-six months for tampering with evidence, and twelve months for receiving stolen property. The court ordered the sentences to run consecutively, for an aggregate prison term of nineteen years to life with credit for 1,127 days served. This timely appeal followed.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n\nThe trial court erred by prohibiting testimony and evidence relating to Battered Child Syndrome and/or PTSD as said evidence was admissible pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in State v. Nemeth.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nHere, Appellant did not explicitly use the phrases \u201csudden passion\u201d or \u201cfit of rage\u201d during his testimony. Thus, we review his testimony to determine whether the substance of that testimony established facts that would show \u201csudden passion\u201d and \u201ca fit of rage.\u201d\n\nAccording to Appellant, T.J. became physical with him, throwing things at him and charging at him with a glass snow globe in her hand. Prior to that, she made sexual advances towards him while becoming verbally abusive. The state discounts the language used by T.J. by arguing that words alone are insufficient to establish sudden passion. While the state is generally correct, this is the point where the expert report and testimony of Dr. McPherson become essential to Appellant\u2019s claims. It is Dr. McPherson\u2019s report that links the decades of sexual abuse and sexual confusion to the import these words and actions had on Appellant\u2019s behavior.\n\nFor instance, Dr. McPherson\u2019s report states that T.J. used the sexual abuse to \u201ctoy\u201d with Appellant. Applied to the events leading up to the killing, T.J placed Appellant\u2019s hand on her crotch, pushed her chest against him and questioned his love for her. Her actions in making sexual advances while questioning his love for her could be\nconstrued as \u201ctoying\u201d with his emotions. Thus, what is important here are not just the words themselves but also the history of the abuse combined with the sexual advancements and the effect that combination had on Appellant\u2019s emotional state.\n\n{\u00b642} During the altercation, T.J. questioned Appellant\u2019s sexuality by calling him a \u201cfaggot\u201d and telling him he did not know how to be a man. Again, in order to understand the significance of this, Appellant cites to the report where Dr. McPherson opines that T.J. caused sexual confusion in Appellant by subjecting him to male sexual partners at a young age. In other words, Dr. McPherson links the decade of T.J.\u2019s abuse to Appellant\u2019s reaction to T.J.\u2019s words, sexual advances, and physical outburst and explains how this combination could have triggered Appellant, causing him to react in the way that he did, resulting in T.J.\u2019s death.\n\n{\u00b643} During cross examination, the state responded to Appellant\u2019s description of T.J.\u2019s verbal abuse by asking, \u201c[h]ave you heard of sticks and stones?\u201d (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Appellant responded, \u201c[m]a\u2019am, she is hitting me. With all of her past history, my emotional state at the time --.\u201d (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Before Appellant could finish his sentence, the trial court sustained an objection by the state. It is unclear why the trial court sustained the objection. However, from this limited excerpt it is clear Appellant tried to explain his emotions and why T.J.\u2019s words and actions caused him to react in the manner he did, but he was not permitted to provide that testimony.\n\n{\u00b644} As discussed at length in Nemeth, testimony of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant is relevant to demonstrate the \u201ctriggering event\u201d of PTSD. The event need not rise to the level of threat of death or serious injury but can be \u201ca threat to the physical integrity of self or others.\u201d Id. at 212. The Court explained that\nthis triggering event is relevant to behavior such as \u201cabnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control\u201d and various forms of dissociation. *Id.* at 213. We note that in Dr. McPherson\u2019s report she determined that Appellant\u2019s coping mechanism involved a high level of emotional reactivity.\n\n{\u00b645} The state also repeatedly confronted Appellant with the lack of corroboration of Appellant\u2019s testimony that he was abused by T.J. For instance, the state commented: \u201c[s]o what is [Appellant] going to do? He is going to attack the only person that can contradict his story, the woman he killed. He is going to blame her for his behavior. He is going to tell you through no corroboration that they were having an affair * * *.\u201d (Trial Tr., pp. 778-779.) The prosecution said it was \u201cconvenient\u201d that Appellant never filed a police report regarding his abuse nor had any witnesses to corroborate the abuse. (Trial Tr., p., 713.) Again, we note that Appellant\u2019s corroborating witnesses in this regard were not permitted to testify. The state also questioned why none of the witnesses knew of the abuse, despite the fact that the state was aware of the conclusions in Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and that Appellant was prevented from having other witnesses testify.\n\n{\u00b646} The *Nemeth* Court emphasized that evidence of battered child syndrome is particularly relevant to dispel a juror\u2019s misconception that if abuse had occurred, the victim would have told someone or filed a police report. The Court explained that \u201c[i]t is the lack of corroborating evidence that makes expert testimony even more crucial in these cases. The defense needs expert testimony to refute the seemingly logical conclusion that serious abuse could not be taking place if no one outside the home was aware of it.\u201d *Id.* at 209.\nIn addressing this issue, the case relies on *State v. Gray*, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 26473, 2016-Ohio-5869. *Gray* involved a murder committed by a person who had allegedly suffered sexual abuse earlier in his life. Importantly, the appellant\u2019s victim was not his abuser. The appellant attempted to claim that he killed the victim because he had been abused by someone else, that this abuse caused him to have a violent reaction sufficient to excuse his killing of the victim. The expert report and testimony that was offered concluded that \u201cthat the defendant's abnormal mental condition shows that the defendant did not have the specific mental state required for the crime, though he was aware that his action was wrong and was able to control it.\u201d *Id.*, at \u00b6 27. The Second District held that the evidence appellant offered:\n\n[Did] not fit the rationale given for the exceptions in battered-syndrome cases. Whatever problems [the defendant] has, they are not the result of abuse by [the victim]. Also, [the defendant] does not mention any common misconceptions that [the doctor\u2019s] testimony would dispel. He argues only that her testimony would help the jury understand why the events of his childhood might explain his extreme response to the alleged threat posed by [the victim].\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 32. In other words, the evidence did not show that the defendant suffered \u201cfrom battered-woman syndrome or battered-child syndrome as a result of abuse at the hands of the \u2018victim.\u2019 \u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 31. Instead, he attempted to rely on prior abuse by someone other than the victim to explain why he killed the victim. *Gray* does appear to be an example of a \u201cdiminished capacity\u201d case, and as earlier discussed, this theory does not\nexist in Ohio as a defense. Thus, Gray is clearly distinguishable from the instant matter even though both cases involve sexual abuse.\n\n{\u00b648} In summation, the admissibility of evidence concerning any kind of abuse is governed by Nemeth. Admission of the evidence in the instant matter was solely sought to explain the psychological effects of the long-term sexual abuse in order to justify and support voluntary manslaughter. The evidence was also relevant to rebut the state\u2019s repeated insistence that Appellant could not corroborate his abuse and the inference that he was lying about the abuse.\n\n{\u00b649} As the evidence is relevant, the issue becomes whether it is admissible under Evid.R. 702. Pursuant to Evid.R. 702, a witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply:\n\n(A) The witness' testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons;\n\n(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;\n\n(C) The witness' testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.* * *\n\n{\u00b650} As addressed by the Nemeth Court, evidence of battered child syndrome is necessary to assist the jury where there is a lack of corroborating evidence \u201cas a trier of\nfact is likely to believe that the abuse allegations are fabricated in response to the charges levied against the child-defendant.\u201d *Id.* at 209. Additionally, the Court explained that the evidence assists in helping the jury to understand the effects of the abuse as \u201c[p]rolonged exposure to abuse results in feelings of powerlessness, embarrassment, fear of reprisal, isolation, and low self-esteem.\u201d *Id.* at 208. The same rationale applies to those charged as an adult. *Id.* at 209, citing *Koss, supra.* Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and testimony fall squarely into this category.\n\n{\u00b651} As to the second prong of Evid.R. 702, the record does not reflect that the state objected to or otherwise questioned Dr. McPherson\u2019s qualifications.

Hence, we may infer that the witness satisfied the second prong of the test.\n\n{\u00b652} As to the third prong, the *Nemeth* Court held that \u201cthe behavioral and psychological effects of prolonged child abuse on the child have been generally accepted in the medical and psychiatric communities and therefore unquestionably meet the requisite level of reliability for admission as the subject of expert testimony.\u201d *Id.* at 212. Thus, the evidence is based on scientific information.\n\n{\u00b653} As to prejudice, the *Nemeth* Court set forth two reasons for their holding: \u201c[b]ecause there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant * * *.\u201d *Id.* at 207. It appears axiomatic that a defendant will be prejudiced by the exclusion of otherwise relevant, partially exculpable evidence. To the extent that prejudice must be shown, this jury did not find Appellant guilty of the most serious offenses with which he was charged, aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. Based on the jury\u2019s failure to find Appellant guilty of these two offenses, it can be inferred that\njury believed Appellant\u2019s testimony at least in part. Based on the jury\u2019s reluctance to convict Appellant on the most serious offenses, the improperly excluded evidence could very well have resulted in a conviction on voluntary manslaughter instead of murder. Thus, this record reveals that Appellant was prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence.\n\n\u00b654 Appellant\u2019s argument that he was entitled to expert testimony regarding the sexual abuse perpetrated by T.J. has merit. As such, Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and her testimony are admissible as they relate to this particular evidence, but our determination as to this evidence is limited to only the evidence applicable to T.J.\u2019s abuse of Appellant, as we discuss below.\n\nSexual Abuse \u2013 Acquaintance\n\n\u00b655 Appellant also sought to admit evidence pertaining to sexual abuse inflicted on him by the uncle of a childhood friend. As earlier discussed, evidence of child abuse is relevant only where the defendant\u2019s conduct is directed towards the abuser. Gray at \u00b6 31. This principal is consistent with Nemeth. Hence, any evidence that Appellant had been abused by some other person would not be relevant to Appellant\u2019s sudden passion or a fit of rage towards T.J. As such, any evidence within Dr. McPherson\u2019s report that addressed the abuse perpetrated by anyone other than T.J. is inadmissible.\n\n\u00b656 We note here that there are a limited number of references to a third-party abuser in Dr. McPherson\u2019s report. As this evidence is not admissible, these limited references must be redacted from the report and cannot be referenced within Dr. McPherson or any other witness\u2019 testimony.\n\nTestimony of Appellant\u2019s Mother and Sister\nAppellant also contends that the trial court erroneously excluded the testimony of his mother and his sister. According to Appellant, his mother and sister would have provided testimony in support of his claims of abuse perpetrated by T.J., the abuse he suffered from his childhood acquaintance, and the head injury he suffered as a child.\n\nIn response, the state argues that because Dr. McPherson\u2019s report was excluded, any similar testimony offered by Appellant\u2019s mother and sister would have been irrelevant.\n\nAll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by the Constitution of the State of Ohio, by statute enacted by the General Assembly not in conflict with a rule of the Supreme Court of Ohio, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n\nEvid.R. 402.\n\nEvidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evid.R. 401. \u201cEvidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\u201d Evid.R. 402.\n\n\u201cThe admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d State v. Griffin, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 16 MA 0029, 2017-Ohio-7796, \u00b6 27, citing State v. Sage, 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 180, 510 N.E.2d 343 (1987). \u201cError may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a\nsubstantial right of the party is affected\u201d and the issue is properly preserved. Evid.R. 103(A).\n\n\u00b661 At trial, defense counsel informed the court that the witnesses would provide testimony regarding the abuse Appellant suffered from the victim and from a childhood acquaintance, and would discuss his prior head injury. It is unclear why the court deemed their testimony inadmissible; however, it appears that the court\u2019s decision may have been based on the exclusion of Dr. McPherson\u2019s report.\n\n\u00b662 As previously discussed, any testimony regarding the abuse perpetrated by T.J. is relevant and admissible. Dr. McPherson\u2019s report indicates that Appellant\u2019s sister \u201ccaught\u201d Appellant and T.J. engaging in inappropriate behavior. Thus, it appears she may have had personal knowledge pertaining to those accusations. The record does not indicate if Appellant\u2019s mother had personal knowledge of the abuse; however, there is no reason to prohibit her testimony to the extent she has such knowledge. As such, Appellant\u2019s argument as to the testimony of his mother and sister has merit as it pertains to Appellant\u2019s sexual abuse perpetrated by T.J.\n\nHead Injury\n\n\u00b663 Appellant sought to introduce evidence that he suffered some sort of head injury as a child. Again, in Fulmer the Ohio Supreme Court reiterated that the partial defense of diminished capacity is not recognized in Ohio. Id. at \u00b6 66. The Court explained that the appellant\u2019s attempt to introduce evidence of a metabolic derangement (the aspirin overdose) was the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of a diminished capacity argument because it sought to show that he lacked the mental capacity to form the specific mental state required. Fulmer at \u00b6 69. Further, the Court explained that \u201c[i]f the evidence generates\nonly a mere speculation or possible doubt, such evidence is insufficient to raise the affirmative defense, and submission of the issue to the jury will be unwarranted.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 72, citing *State v. Robinson*, 47 Ohio St.2d 103, 111-112, 351 N.E.2d 88 (1976).\n\n{\u00b664} Similarly, the Courts in *Jackson* and *Wilcox* held that evidence designed to show an inability to form the requisite mental capacity is inadmissible as evidence of diminished capacity. See *Jackson* and *Wilcox* (evidence of mental disease or defect or evidence that the defendant suffered from borderline mental retardation, was schizophrenic, dyslexic, and suffering from organic brain syndrome inadmissible.)\n\n{\u00b665} Appellant has not explained how he seeks to use evidence pertaining to his injury. It would appear he seeks to introduce it as evidence that the injury affected his mental capacity. As such, Appellant\u2019s argument pertaining to the head injury is similarly without merit. Dr. McPherson\u2019s report contains only a limited reference to the injury which must be redacted.\n\n{\u00b666} In summation, Appellant\u2019s arguments as to evidence pertaining to his sexual abuse perpetrated by T.J. have merit and are sustained. The remaining arguments within Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error are without merit and are overruled.\n\n**ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2**\n\nThe Prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments, thus depriving Appellant of his right to a fair trial.\n\n{\u00b667} Appellant contends that the prosecutor made a series of comments during closing arguments that constituted prosecutorial misconduct. Appellant groups these into separate categories: denigration of defense counsel, appeals to the emotions of the jury,\nand other remarks. Appellant acknowledged that he did not object to all of the comments at issue.\n\n{\u00b668} Due to resolution of Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, Appellant\u2019s conviction is vacated and this matter is reversed and remanded for a new trial. Thus, this assignment of error is moot. We must note, however, that the state repeatedly made comments regarding Appellant and his counsel that were disturbing, disrespectful and improper. Even after being chided by the court, the state continued to make such comments until the court was forced to call a sidebar conference. At its conclusion, the state made yet one more such comment. While we are disturbed by the record in this regard, we are certain that on remand, the issue will not be capable of repetition. Therefore, this assignment of error is moot.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3\n\nThe trial court erred in imposing maximum, consecutive sentences."}

Therefore, this assignment of error is moot.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3\n\nThe trial court erred in imposing maximum, consecutive sentences.\n\n{\u00b669} While Appellant concedes that the trial court made the requisite statutory findings, Appellant argues that the imposition of consecutive sentences is improper where the reason for the consecutive nature of his sentence is the mere fact that a murder occurred. Appellant argues that his two convictions for nonviolent offenses, tampering and receiving stolen property, were ordered to run consecutively solely because a murder was committed.\n\n{\u00b670} In response, the state argues that the killing was particularly gruesome and that hiding the murder weapon impaired law enforcement\u2019s ability to resolve the case.\nThe state also contends the fact that Appellant stole credit cards and the vehicle after the murder supports consecutive sentences.\n\n{\u00b671} Because we have found partial merit with Appellant\u2019s first assignment and have remanded the matter for a new trial, Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is moot.\n\nConclusion\n\n{\u00b672} Appellant argues that trial court improperly excluded evidence of sexual child abuse perpetrated against him by T.J. Pursuant to Nemeth, Appellant\u2019s argument is correct and this evidence is admissible. However, his argument that the court improperly excluded evidence of sexual abuse concerning an abuser who is not involved in this case and evidence that he suffered a head injury as a child is without merit. Appellant\u2019s remaining arguments regarding improper comments by the state and consecutive sentences are moot. As such, the judgment of the trial court is reversed. Appellant\u2019s convictions are vacated and the matter is remanded for a new trial.\n\nDonofrio, P.J., concurs.\n\nRobb, J., concurs.\nFor the reasons stated in the Opinion rendered herein, Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error as to evidence pertaining to sexual abuse have merit and are sustained and his remaining arguments within that assignment are without merit and are overruled. Appellant\u2019s remaining assignments are moot. It is the final judgment and order of this Court that the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning County, Ohio, is reversed and Appellant\u2019s convictions are hereby vacated. We remand this matter to the trial court for a new trial according to law and consistent with this Court\u2019s Opinion. Costs to be taxed against the Appellee.\n\nA certified copy of this opinion and judgment entry shall constitute the mandate in this case pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. It is ordered that a certified copy be sent by the clerk to the trial court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\nNOTICE TO COUNSEL\n\nThis document constitutes a final judgment entry.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nThe trial court sentenced Appellant to a period of incarceration of fifteen years to life for murder, thirty-six months for tampering with evidence, and twelve months for receiving stolen property. The court ordered the sentences to run consecutively, for an aggregate prison term of nineteen years to life with credit for 1,127 days served. This timely appeal followed.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n\nThe trial court erred by prohibiting testimony and evidence relating to Battered Child Syndrome and/or PTSD as said evidence was admissible pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in State v. Nemeth.\n\nAppellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and her potential testimony, which was relevant to his argument regarding voluntary manslaughter. As the evidence was intended to demonstrate a history of child abuse that triggered Appellant\u2019s sudden passion and fit of rage, he argues this evidence is admissible pursuant to Nemeth. The evidence was also necessary to respond to the state\u2019s repeated commentary on his lack of corroboration regarding his allegations of sexual abuse.\nThe state responds that Dr. McPherson did not diagnose Appellant with battered child syndrome, thus her report and the potential testimony of Appellant\u2019s mother and sister are irrelevant. The state also argues that Appellant did not testify that he acted under a sudden passion or a fit of rage. Even so, the state points out that words are generally insufficient to support a voluntary manslaughter claim.\n\nThere are four separate evidentiary issues within this assignment of error, including the admissibility of: (1) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving T.J., (2) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving a childhood acquaintance, (3) evidence of a head injury Appellant suffered as a child, and (4) testimony from Appellant\u2019s mother and sister pertaining to the abuse inflicted by T.J. While each argument is related, a distinct analysis of each is required.\n\nAppellant was diagnosed with PTSD. According to Dr. McPherson\u2019s report, her diagnosis was based on an interview with Appellant, psychological testing, ancillary information, and an interview with Appellant\u2019s sister. Appellant\u2019s sister spoke to Dr. McPherson about an incident where she observed Appellant and T.J. engaging in inappropriate behavior. The report detailed the alleged sexual abuse of Appellant by T.J. and was consistent with Appellant\u2019s testimony; however, the report provided a more in-depth look at the abuse. The report also addressed abuse Appellant suffered from a childhood acquaintance and a head injury he suffered as a child. These latter two incidents are limited to a few lines in the report.\n\nAccording to the report, Appellant\u2019s coping mechanism involves a high level of emotional reactivity due to the extent of his trauma. The report also noted that Appellant has an issue with male sexuality due to T.J. subjecting him to male partners at\na young age. Dr. McPherson found that Appellant\u2019s description of the abuse was consistent with her test results. Based on the testing, Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with major depressive disorder, PTSD as a result of multiple sexual abuse experiences, and substance abuse and dependance. Dr. McPherson opined that the abuse perpetrated by T.J. is considered extreme based on Appellant\u2019s repeated victimization.\n\nChild Abuse - T.J.\n\n\u00b619 The leading case regarding child abuse that results in the killing of the abuser is Nemeth. In Nemeth, the defendant\u2019s mother violently physically abused him for several years. Id. at 202. On the date of the incident, the defendant\u2019s mother was abusive and, believing his life was in danger, he killed her. The defense sought to introduce a report diagnosing him with PTSD/battered child syndrome for purpose of establishing a self-defense claim and as a justification for a lesser included offense to murder. Id. at 204.\n\n\u00b620 At oral argument in the instant case, the state suggested that Nemeth is limited to cases involving violent abuse and does not apply to cases involving sexual abuse. Contrary to the state\u2019s claim, there is no support for the argument that Nemeth is limited to violent abuse, alone. Nemeth clearly articulates a general rule that expert testimony is admissible if it is relevant. While it is true that Nemeth involved violent abuse, nothing within the opinion limits its application to that type of abuse.\n\n\u00b621 In fact, the oral arguments in Nemeth relied on a case involving sexual abuse and this is discussed in Nemeth. Nemeth, 82 Ohio St.3d at 207, 694 N.E.2d 1332 (1998), citing State v. Stowers, 81 Ohio St.3d 260, 690 N.E.2d 881 (1998); Nemeth at fn.\n1, citing Stowers, supra. While Stowers did not involve the death of the abuser, it did involve the admissibility of expert testimony on the issue of whether a violently abused child fits the general characteristics observed in sexually abused children. Id. at 262.\n\n{\u00b622} The Nemeth Court applied Stowers\u2019 guiding principles and determined that \u201c[g]eneral information on battered child syndrome would also tend to show that [the defendant\u2019s] behavior was consistent with that of an abused child and would lend support to his testimony that he had been abused both generally and just prior to the killing.\u201d Nemeth at 207, citing Stowers, at 262.\n\n{\u00b623} If the Nemeth Court found it appropriate to rely on Stowers, then it stands to reason that Nemeth is applicable to sexual abuse cases where expert testimony is offered by the defense. Notably, Nemeth has been applied to several other cases involving sexual abuse. See State v. Butts, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108381, 2020-Ohio-1498; State v. Slaven, 5th Dist. Delaware No. 12 CAA 08 0062, 2013-Ohio-3552; State v. Jennings, 10th Dist. Franklin 2001 WL 1045490 (Sept. 13, 2001). Although none of these cases involved the death of the abuser, their reliance on Nemeth furthers the proposition that this case is not limited to physically violent child abuse claims, but stands for the proposition that if expert testimony is relevant and satisfies Evid.R. 702, it is admissible.\n\n{\u00b624} Significantly, the Nemeth Court specifically stated that:\n\nThe defense in this case did not ask that battered child syndrome be recognized as a new defense or an independent justification for the killing of an abusive parent. The proffer made at trial was limited to expert testimony that would explain the psychological effects of long-term child\nabuse, and was proffered in support of a self-defense theory as well as a charge on voluntary manslaughter. As such, the issue before us is an evidentiary matter and is governed by the Ohio Rules of Evidence. Because there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court's exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant, we need not reach the constitutional issues addressed by the court of appeals.\n\nId. at 206-207.\n\n{\u00b625} We note that the state relies on State v. Hamad, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2017-T-0108, 2019-Ohio-2664, appeal not allowed, 157 Ohio St.3d 1466, 2019-Ohio-4419, 133 N.E.3d 537. However, Hamad is readily distinguishable from the instant case. In Hamad, the record demonstrated that \u201cthere [was] no history of physical abuse between the victims.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 98. The record also showed that \u201c[u]ntil the assault and shooting took place on February 25, only verbal threats and harassing behavior had been exchanged\u201d between the defendant and victim. Id. In the instant case, there was an attempt to present evidence of a lengthy history of sexual abuse that appears to span more than two decades. Hamad did not involve either violent physical or sexual abuse. Instead, it involved \u201can exchange of offensive communications\u201d that led to a physical confrontation. Id. at \u00b6 2.\n\n{\u00b626} The state also argues that Nemeth does not apply because Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with PTSD, not battered child syndrome. This argument ignores the plain language of Nemeth, which explained that battered child syndrome has many labels, including PTSD. The Nemeth Court noted that the psychological effects and behavioral\nsymptoms have long been recognized by the medical and legal professions regardless of which term is used. *Id.* at 206.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b651} As to the second prong of Evid.R. 702, the record does not reflect that the state objected to or otherwise questioned Dr. McPherson\u2019s qualifications. Hence, we may infer that the witness satisfied the second prong of the test.\n\n{\u00b652} As to the third prong, the *Nemeth* Court held that \u201cthe behavioral and psychological effects of prolonged child abuse on the child have been generally accepted in the medical and psychiatric communities and therefore unquestionably meet the requisite level of reliability for admission as the subject of expert testimony.\u201d *Id.* at 212. Thus, the evidence is based on scientific information.\n\n{\u00b653} As to prejudice, the *Nemeth* Court set forth two reasons for their holding: \u201c[b]ecause there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant * * *.\u201d *Id.* at 207. It appears axiomatic that a defendant will be prejudiced by the exclusion of otherwise relevant, partially exculpable evidence. To the extent that prejudice must be shown, this jury did not find Appellant guilty of the most serious offenses with which he was charged, aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. Based on the jury\u2019s failure to find Appellant guilty of these two offenses, it can be inferred that\njury believed Appellant\u2019s testimony at least in part. Based on the jury\u2019s reluctance to convict Appellant on the most serious offenses, the improperly excluded evidence could very well have resulted in a conviction on voluntary manslaughter instead of murder. Thus, this record reveals that Appellant was prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence.\n\n\u00b654 Appellant\u2019s argument that he was entitled to expert testimony regarding the sexual abuse perpetrated by T.J. has merit. As such, Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and her testimony are admissible as they relate to this particular evidence, but our determination as to this evidence is limited to only the evidence applicable to T.J.\u2019s abuse of Appellant, as we discuss below.\n\nSexual Abuse \u2013 Acquaintance\n\n\u00b655 Appellant also sought to admit evidence pertaining to sexual abuse inflicted on him by the uncle of a childhood friend. As earlier discussed, evidence of child abuse is relevant only where the defendant\u2019s conduct is directed towards the abuser. Gray at \u00b6 31. This principal is consistent with Nemeth.

Rivera, Assistant Chief Prosecuting Attorney, Criminal Division, 21 West Boardman Street, 6th Floor, Youngstown, Ohio 44503, for Plaintiff-Appellee\nAppellant James Jarrell appeals an October 17, 2018 Mahoning County Court of Common Pleas judgment entry convicting him of various offenses associated with the murder of his stepmother, T.J., following his jury trial. Appellant argues that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence, including sexual child abuse of Appellant perpetrated by T.J., sexual abuse perpetrated by a childhood acquaintance, and that Appellant suffered a head injury as a child. He also argues that several statements made by the state during closing arguments constitute prosecutorial misconduct. Finally, he contends the court improperly imposed consecutive sentences. Appellant\u2019s argument regarding the admissibility of evidence related to the sexual abuse of Appellant by T.J. has merit pursuant to State v. Nemeth, 82 Ohio St.3d 202, 694 N.E.2d 1332 (1998). However, Appellant\u2019s arguments as to the other two items of evidence he seeks to admit are meritless. The remainder of Appellant\u2019s arguments are moot. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed. Appellant\u2019s convictions are hereby vacated and the matter is remanded for a new trial.\n\nFactual and Procedural History\n\nAppellant admits he killed his stepmother, T.J., after the two argued about their relationship. According to Appellant, he met T.J. for the first time when he was eight years old. At that time, she was married to her now ex-husband. (Trial Tr., p. 680.)\nAccording to Appellant, he and T.J. engaged in sexual touching on the day they met. Appellant alleges this conduct continued, but it is unclear how frequently.\n\n{\u00b63} Several years later, when Appellant was fifteen or sixteen years old, his father began dating T.J. and they married shortly thereafter. When T.J. moved into the Jarrell house, the touching immediately escalated to sexual intercourse between T.J. and Appellant. They also regularly used drugs together. According to Appellant, when T.J. ran out of drugs, she would ask him to have sex with their male drug dealer. (Trial Tr., p. 684.)\n\n{\u00b64} While Appellant\u2019s father admitted that T.J. drank alcohol in excess and used cocaine, he denied that she had a sexual relationship with Appellant. However, he acknowledged that T.J. did not have a good relationship with any of his children except for Appellant. Although he knew T.J. used drugs, Appellant\u2019s father would not allow Appellant into the marital residence when he was not home because of Appellant\u2019s drug use.\n\n{\u00b65} According to Appellant, on the day of the killing T.J. had invited him to the house. (Trial Tr., p. 686.) He asked a friend, Z.J., to give him a ride. Z.J. is apparently a drug dealer. When they approached the house, Appellant cautioned Z.J. not to pull into the driveway and Appellant reclined his seat. He testified that T.J. had instructed him to avoid being seen coming to the house because the neighbors would tell his father. (Trial Tr., p., 688.) Z.J. testified that although he did not specifically know there was a sexual relationship between Appellant and T.J., he once observed them hug in a manner that would not be expected between a stepmother and stepson.\nWhen Appellant entered the house, T.J. hugged him and then washed his clothes while he took a shower. According to Appellant, it was raining outside and his clothes were wet. When he exited the shower, T.J. provided him with some of his father\u2019s clothes. After Appellant settled in, T.J. initiated a conversation regarding the future of their relationship. She informed him that she intended to divorce his father. She asked Appellant to move to Florida with her to continue their relationship. When Appellant responded that moving to Florida would not be in his best interests because his life was in a state of disarray, she took his hand and placed it on her crotch and said, \u201cyou don\u2019t love me.\u201d (Trial Tr., p. 692.) He responded that he did love her.\n\nShe then became physically and verbally abusive, stating \u201c[y]ou don\u2019t know how to be a man\u201d and calling him a \u201cfaggot.\u201d (Trial Tr., p. 692.) As she screamed, she threw nearby objects at him, including a can of beer or a beer bottle. When she picked up a glass snow globe and charged at him, Appellant reached for a box cutter that was nearby and began to swing it at her. He testified that he remembered cutting her, but did not know how many times.\n\nWhen he realized she was dead, he did not think anyone would believe him about the circumstances leading to her death. He washed the blood off of his hands and changed into another set of his father\u2019s clothes. He took two credit cards and some jewelry before leaving the house in T.J.\u2019s car. Appellant used the credit cards to purchase gas and a few items at WalMart. He also purchased heroin, testifying that he planned to overdose and commit suicide. (Trial Tr., p. 694.) At some point, he met up with Z.J. and they used drugs together.\nAppellant drove T.J.\u2019s car to Pittsburgh to seek help from a friend. While he was in Pittsburgh, detectives from Youngstown contacted the Pittsburgh Police Department and put a BOLO (\u201cbe on the lookout\u201d order) on the car. Two plain clothed detectives in an unmarked vehicle saw Appellant sitting in the car while parked at a gas station. Appellant was arrested and transported to Youngstown.\n\nOn September 17, 2015, Appellant was indicted on the following charges: one count of aggravated murder, an unclassified felony in violation of R.C. 2903.01(B),(F); one count of murder, an unclassified felony in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A),(D); one count of aggravated robbery, a felony of the first degree in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), (C); one count of tampering with evidence, a felony of the third degree in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1), (B); and one count of receiving stolen property, a felony of the fifth degree in violation of R.C. 2913.51(A), (C).\n\nPrior to trial, Appellant obtained a psychological report from Dr. Sandra McPherson. Dr. McPherson evaluated Appellant and diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) as a result of his childhood sexual abuse involving not only T.J. but also due to a separate incident involving a childhood acquaintance who had earlier molested Appellant. The report also noted that Appellant had suffered a significant head injury when he was a child. The state filed a motion in limine to exclude the report and any accompanying testimony from Dr. McPherson. The state also sought to prevent Appellant\u2019s mother and sister from testifying about the abuse. The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion, finding that the report was intended to support a defense of diminished capacity, which is not recognized in Ohio.\nAppellant testified at trial. He attempted to raise the issue of sexual abuse, but was limited as to this testimony after the trial court sustained an objection from the state. Based on Appellant\u2019s testimony, the trial court did allow an instruction to the jury on voluntary manslaughter. Appellant was found guilty of murder, tampering with evidence, and receiving stolen property. The jury acquitted him of aggravated murder and aggravated robbery.\n\nThe trial court sentenced Appellant to a period of incarceration of fifteen years to life for murder, thirty-six months for tampering with evidence, and twelve months for receiving stolen property. The court ordered the sentences to run consecutively, for an aggregate prison term of nineteen years to life with credit for 1,127 days served. This timely appeal followed.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1\n\nThe trial court erred by prohibiting testimony and evidence relating to Battered Child Syndrome and/or PTSD as said evidence was admissible pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in State v. Nemeth.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b626} The state also argues that Nemeth does not apply because Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with PTSD, not battered child syndrome. This argument ignores the plain language of Nemeth, which explained that battered child syndrome has many labels, including PTSD. The Nemeth Court noted that the psychological effects and behavioral\nsymptoms have long been recognized by the medical and legal professions regardless of which term is used. *Id.* at 206.\n\n{\u00b627} In the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the state\u2019s motion in this case, the court referenced *Nemeth* but relied on *State v. Fulmer*, 117 Ohio St.3d 319, 2008-Ohio-936, 883 N.E.2d 1052; *State v. Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982); and *State v. Jackson*, 32 Ohio St.2d 203, 291 N.E.2d 432 (1972). In *Fulmer*, the defendant produced expert testimony that he acted under the influence of an aspirin overdose at the time of the incident. The defense attempted to use the evidence to show that he was \u201cmetabolically deranged.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 64. The Court determined that the evidence was relevant to whether the defendant was capable of forming the requisite intent to commit the crime at issue. *Id.* As such, the Court determined the defense was the functional equivalent of a diminished capacity defense, which is not recognized within Ohio. *Id.* at \u00b6 69.\n\n{\u00b628} In *Wilcox*, the defendant attempted to introduce evidence to show that he was \u201cborderline retarded, schizophrenic, dyslexic, and to be suffering from organic brain syndrome.\u201d *Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d at 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982). The Court held that \u201ca defendant may not offer expert psychiatric testimony, unrelated to the insanity defense, to show that the defendant lacked the mental capacity to form the specific mental state required for a particular crime or degree of crime.\u201d *Id.* at 199.\n\n{\u00b629} In *Jackson*, the defendant similarly attempted to introduce evidence that he was suffering from a mental disease or defect which so impaired his reason at the time of the criminal act that he did not act knowingly. *Id.* at 205-206. In a limited analysis, the Court explained that in order to attack intent based on capacity, a defendant must show\nthat he was either too intoxicated to form intent (a state of unconsciousness) or have such \u201cdefect of reason as not to know the nature and quality of the illegal act or that it is wrong (insane).\u201d *Id.* at 206.\n\n{\u00b630} We note that *Fulmer* was decided after *Nemeth* but does not cite to *Nemeth*. This is because the two cases address wholly separate issues. *Fulmer*, along with *Jackson* and *Wilcox*, address evidence of an impaired mental state which is intended to show that the defendant did not act knowingly, whereas *Nemeth* addresses evidence of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant in order to support either a self-defense instruction or voluntary manslaughter charge. As the evidence in this case was sought in an attempt to show that the history of abuse caused Appellant to become enraged and act with sudden passion, and not to argue that he was so impaired he lacked the ability to understand the nature of his actions, *Nemeth* and not *Fulmer, Jackson*, and *Wilcox*, applies.\n\n{\u00b631} In accordance with *Nemeth*, such evidence is admissible so long as it is relevant and meets the criteria of Evid.R. 702. *Id.* at 207. Pursuant to Evid.R. 401: \u201c\u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d\n\n{\u00b632} The state contends that the evidence is irrelevant, relying on *State v. Sallie*, 81 Ohio St.3d 673, 693 N.E.2d 267 (1998). However, *Sallie* is also readily distinguishable from the instant matter. The issue before the *Sallie* Court was whether trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to argue that the defendant suffered from battered woman\u2019s syndrome. At trial, however, the defendant did not claim self-\ndefense. Rather, she claimed the shooting was an accident. As the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental, and not a conscious act of self-defense, the Court concluded that any evidence regarding battered woman\u2019s syndrome was irrelevant. *Id.* at 676.\n\n{\u00b633} The *Nemeth* Court held that evidence of child abuse is relevant to the determination of whether the accused \u201chad acted with prior calculation and design as charged in the indictment, (2) had acted with purpose as required for the lesser included offense of murder, (3) had created the confrontation or initiated the confrontation or initiated the aggression, and (4) had an honest belief that he was in imminent danger.\u201d *Id.* at 207.\n\n{\u00b634} Relevant to the instant matter, the *Nemeth* Court also explained that Expert testimony on battered child syndrome would, in this case, tend to enhance the probability that [the defendant\u2019s] account of the facts leading up to the killing was truthful and would lend credibility to his assertion that he was in a state of rage and dissociation at the time of the killing. A diagnosis of battered child syndrome and an explanation of its effects would therefore be relevant in determining whether the case warranted a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter.\n\n*Id.* at 207-208.\n\n{\u00b635} At the outset, it is important to consider the *Nemeth* court\u2019s explanation that \u201c[t]he triggering event for posttraumatic stress disorder can be any traumatic event that involved \u2018actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others\u2019 and where the person\u2019s response involved \u2018intense fear, helplessness,\nor horror.\u201d *Id.* at 212. The Court explained that these responses are triggered by an \u201cinterpersonal stressor\u201d that can manifest itself in \u201cfear and anxiety, abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control, reenacting or physiologically reexperiencing the abuse, avoidance (often in the form of hypervigilance), helplessness, somatic complaints, and various forms of dissociation.\u201d *Id.* at 213.\n\n{\u00b636} As in *Nemeth*, Appellant argues that Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and testimony was relevant to lend credence to his account of the facts leading up to the killing and to provide credibility for his assertion that he was in a state of rage at the time of the incident, both of which are aspects of his voluntary manslaughter argument. He also contends that the evidence is admissible to rebut the state\u2019s repeated comments that he could not corroborate his abuse claims, and to dispel any misconceptions the jurors may have had as to why he did not previously inform anyone of the abuse.\n\n{\u00b637} We begin our review of Appellant\u2019s voluntary manslaughter argument by noting that the trial court did instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. Thus, the trial court implicitly found that Appellant\u2019s testimony, limited as it was, provided a sufficient basis to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction. However, contrary to the state\u2019s contentions, we cannot limit our analysis of Appellant\u2019s voluntary manslaughter argument to his testimony, alone. This is because the question before us is whether Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and testimony would have made a voluntary manslaughter conviction more or less probable. Thus, in determining whether that evidence is relevant, we must also consider the extent of what Dr. McPherson\u2019s report and potential testimony would have added to Appellant\u2019s testimony.\nIn beginning our review of Appellant\u2019s testimony, we first address the state\u2019s assertion that a defendant must specifically state legal \u201cbuzzwords\u201d such as \u201csudden passion\u201d and \u201cfit of rage\u201d within their testimony. This assertion is incorrect. Unlike attorneys, lay members of society tend to lack the legal knowledge and sophistication to articulate these terms. Even without using those specific terms, a defendant can sufficiently demonstrate the concepts by describing emotions, actions, or reactions that emulate this standard.\n\nHere, Appellant did not explicitly use the phrases \u201csudden passion\u201d or \u201cfit of rage\u201d during his testimony. Thus, we review his testimony to determine whether the substance of that testimony established facts that would show \u201csudden passion\u201d and \u201ca fit of rage.\u201d\n\nAccording to Appellant, T.J. became physical with him, throwing things at him and charging at him with a glass snow globe in her hand. Prior to that, she made sexual advances towards him while becoming verbally abusive. The state discounts the language used by T.J. by arguing that words alone are insufficient to establish sudden passion. While the state is generally correct, this is the point where the expert report and testimony of Dr. McPherson become essential to Appellant\u2019s claims. It is Dr. McPherson\u2019s report that links the decades of sexual abuse and sexual confusion to the import these words and actions had on Appellant\u2019s behavior."}
{"Index": "081-Bolware", "allegation": "The trial court abused its discretion when it failed to grant a mistrial as a result of the comments made by the prosecutor.", "evidence": "In this case, the instances cited by Bolware were not so significant that they deprived him of a fair trial. None of the comments became recurring themes in the case, and they were not repeated. Furthermore, the evidence against Bolware was such that we do not question the guilty finding the jury reached. The trial court did not err when it denied Bolware\u2019s motions for a mistrial, and he was not denied his right to due process by comments made by the prosecutor. We overrule Bolware\u2019s first and second assignments of error.\n\nSufficiency and Weight of the Evidence\n\nBolware argues his third and fourth assignments of error together. In his third assignment of error, Bolware claims that his conviction was based upon insufficient evidence. In his fourth assignment of error, he claims that his conviction was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.\nIn a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the question is whether after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. In reviewing a challenge to the weight of the evidence, we sit as a \u201cthirteenth juror.\u201d *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). We must review the entire record, weigh the evidence, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. *Id.*\n\nBolware\u2019s argument centers solely on the relative value of the evidence. He claims that neither the victim\u2019s account nor the testimony of the witness was credible. He argues that the fact that she delayed seeking medical treatment discredited the victim\u2019s account of the events. And he argues that there was no physical evidence in the apartment to support the victim\u2019s claim. But arguments based on the value of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses are not proper on review of evidentiary sufficiency. *State v. Yarbrough*, 95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, \u00b6 79. Nothing Bolware has argued supports his contention that his conviction was based upon insufficient evidence. We overrule Bolware\u2019s third assignment of error.\n\nTurning to Bolware\u2019s manifest-weight argument, we note that reversing a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence should be reserved for only the most \u201c\u2018exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019\u201d *Thompkins* at 387, quoting *State v. Martin*, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983), paragraph three of the syllabus. The jury, as the trier of fact, is in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses. *See State v. DeHass*, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212 (1967),\nparagraph one of the syllabus. After reviewing the record, we hold that there was nothing about the testimony presented by the victim and the witness which would make their version so incredible that it indicates the jury lost its way. We also cannot conclude that the jury created a manifest miscarriage of justice by choosing to find the testimony of the state's witnesses credible. See Thompkins at 386. We overrule Bolware's fourth assignment of error.\n\nConsecutive Sentences Unsupported\n\n{\u00b615} In his final assignment of error, Bolware claims that the trial court failed to make the appropriate findings when sentencing him to consecutive prison terms. We agree.\n\n{\u00b616} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court did not make any findings to support its decision to order Bolware to serve his sentence in the case numbered B-1702916 consecutively to the sentences imposed in the cases numbered B-1403009 and B-1503778, but findings were incorporated into the trial court's sentencing entry. Consecutive sentences may be imposed only if the trial court makes the required findings pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). State v. Bonnell, 140 Ohio St.3d 209, 2014-Ohio-3177, 16 N.E.3d 659, \u00b6 20-22. In order to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment, a trial court must make the statutory findings mandated for consecutive sentences under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) at the sentencing hearing and incorporate those findings into its sentencing entry. Bonnell at syllabus.\n\n{\u00b617} The state noted that the prosecutor mentioned factors that could have supported the imposition of consecutive sentences and that \u201c[w]hile the trial court did not repeat the prosecutor's statements, they completely justify the imposition of a maximum, consecutive sentence.\u201d That is insufficient. There is no indication that the trial court agreed with the statements the prosecutor made or adopted the statements as its own. Accordingly, we must vacate the consecutive nature of\nBolware\u2019s sentences and remand the cause for the trial court to consider whether consecutive sentences are appropriate under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) and, if so, to make the required findings on the record and incorporate those findings in the sentencing journal entry. We sustain Bolware\u2019s fifth assignment of error.\n\nConclusion\n\n{\u00b618} Having considered each of Bolware\u2019s assignments of error, we affirm the judgments of the trial court in part, vacate the sentences in part, and remand the matter for further proceedings.\n\nJudgments affirmed in part, sentences vacated in part, and cause remanded.\n\nZAYAS and MYERS, JJ., concur.\n\nPlease note:\n\nThe court has recorded its own entry on the date of the release of this opinion.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nIN THE COURT OF APPEALS\nFIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT OF OHIO\nHAMILTON COUNTY, OHIO\n\nSTATE OF OHIO, : APPEAL NOS.

McKenna, for Defendant-Appellant.\nMock, Presiding Judge.\n\n{\u00b61} In five assignments of error, defendant-appellant Kevin Bolware claims that he was improperly found guilty of and sentenced for felonious assault. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Bolware\u2019s conviction, but remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings relating to the imposition of consecutive sentences.\n\nDiffering Accounts\n\n{\u00b62} Bolware met the victim in this case in the fall of 2016. The two would meet a few times a month for sex. On February 10, 2017, the victim invited Bolware to her apartment. After engaging in intercourse, the two began to argue. The victim testified that Bolware punched her in the side of the head. The victim retrieved pepper spray from a drawer and sprayed Bolware with it. The victim testified that Bolware then started to leave, but turned and resumed his assault. According to her, he punched her numerous times and clawed at her eyes. He then stomped on her while she was on the ground.\n\n{\u00b63} A neighbor testified that she heard the commotion and came to investigate. She saw Bolware standing over the victim and could smell the pepper spray in the air. She testified that she saw Bolware stomping on the victim and striking her several times. She yelled for Bolware to leave the victim alone, and Bolware fled from the apartment with the victim\u2019s cell phone and keys. A few hours later, the victim\u2019s eyes began to swell and she went to the hospital. The victim suffered bruising, cuts, lacerations, and four broken ribs. An initial report was taken by a police officer at the scene, but further investigation did not occur until later when the victim identified Bolware as the assailant. Both the victim and the neighbor identified Bolware from a photo array.\nBolware was indicted, in the case numbered B-1702916, for one count of felonious assault and one count of aggravated robbery. As a result of the charges and additional violations, his community control in the cases numbered B-1403009 and B-1503778 was terminated. The B-1702916 matter proceeded to a jury trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Bolware was found guilty of felonious assault, but acquitted on the charge of aggravated robbery. He was sentenced to eight years in prison, which he was ordered to serve consecutively to the prison terms imposed in the cases numbered B-1403009 and B-1503778, which had been ordered to be served consecutively to each other.\n\nProsecutorial Misconduct\u2014No Prejudice\n\nIn the first two assignments of error, which he has argued together, Bolware attack statements made by the prosecutor during the course of the trial. After each statement, defense counsel had objected and requested a mistrial. The first assignment of error claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to grant a mistrial as a result of the comments. The second assignment of error claims that the statements deprived him of a fair trial. We will address the assignments together.\n\nBolware groups the first two instances together as attempts by the prosecutor to improperly refer to his criminal history. The first instance occurred during voir dire when the prosecutor said, \u201cYou are not allowed to know things about the defendant. You are not allowed to know what if any criminal history the defendant has. You are not allowed to know information that may be obtained through investigative sources to determine the defendant\u2019s background.\u201d During opening statements, the prosecutor told the jury that Bolware was identified when the victim and witness reviewed a packet of information \u201cused by police where they put a series of mug shots together of people.\u201d\nBolware groups the second two instances together as improper attempts to denigrate defense counsel during rebuttal closing argument. In the first instance, the prosecutor said,\n\n[What I have struck about [sic] in this case, it finally hit me, was when [defense counsel] said to you\u2014he talked to about the lie right from the start. * * * What was the lie? You sat here and you listened to it yesterday * * * when [defense counsel] stood up and told you about the case. He talked to you about legs being grabbed, he talked about the victim doing drugs, being a cokehead, doing cocaine * * *.\n\nThe second instance occurred a few moments later when the state characterized the defense's case as the \u201cnutty and slutty\u201d defense.\n\nYou heard all these things come out of defense counsel\u2019s mouth * * * His explanation of this case was a raging prostitute that was upset that one of her johns wouldn\u2019t come and stay with her * * * Did you hear one scintilla of evidence to support that argument? Did anyone have the moral courage to sit in that witness chair and say \u201cthis woman was a prostitute?\u201d\n\nBut even if we were to conclude that the remarks cited were improper, they did not prejudicially affect Bolware\u2019s substantial rights. The granting or denial of a motion for a mistrial rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 480, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001). To show an abuse of discretion in failing to grant a mistrial, the defendant must demonstrate material prejudice. See State v. Adams, 144 Ohio St.3d 429, 2015-Ohio-3954, 45 N.E.3d 127, \u00b6 198. Similarly, the test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights. See State v.

We overrule Bolware\u2019s first and second assignments of error.\n\nSufficiency and Weight of the Evidence\n\nBolware argues his third and fourth assignments of error together. In his third assignment of error, Bolware claims that his conviction was based upon insufficient evidence. In his fourth assignment of error, he claims that his conviction was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.\nIn a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the question is whether after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. In reviewing a challenge to the weight of the evidence, we sit as a \u201cthirteenth juror.\u201d *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). We must review the entire record, weigh the evidence, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. *Id.*\n\nBolware\u2019s argument centers solely on the relative value of the evidence. He claims that neither the victim\u2019s account nor the testimony of the witness was credible. He argues that the fact that she delayed seeking medical treatment discredited the victim\u2019s account of the events. And he argues that there was no physical evidence in the apartment to support the victim\u2019s claim. But arguments based on the value of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses are not proper on review of evidentiary sufficiency. *State v. Yarbrough*, 95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, \u00b6 79. Nothing Bolware has argued supports his contention that his conviction was based upon insufficient evidence. We overrule Bolware\u2019s third assignment of error.\n\nTurning to Bolware\u2019s manifest-weight argument, we note that reversing a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence should be reserved for only the most \u201c\u2018exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019\u201d *Thompkins* at 387, quoting *State v. Martin*, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983), paragraph three of the syllabus. The jury, as the trier of fact, is in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses. *See State v. DeHass*, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212 (1967),\nparagraph one of the syllabus. After reviewing the record, we hold that there was nothing about the testimony presented by the victim and the witness which would make their version so incredible that it indicates the jury lost its way. We also cannot conclude that the jury created a manifest miscarriage of justice by choosing to find the testimony of the state's witnesses credible. See Thompkins at 386. We overrule Bolware's fourth assignment of error.\n\nConsecutive Sentences Unsupported\n\n{\u00b615} In his final assignment of error, Bolware claims that the trial court failed to make the appropriate findings when sentencing him to consecutive prison terms. We agree.\n\n{\u00b616} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court did not make any findings to support its decision to order Bolware to serve his sentence in the case numbered B-1702916 consecutively to the sentences imposed in the cases numbered B-1403009 and B-1503778, but findings were incorporated into the trial court's sentencing entry. Consecutive sentences may be imposed only if the trial court makes the required findings pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). State v. Bonnell, 140 Ohio St.3d 209, 2014-Ohio-3177, 16 N.E.3d 659, \u00b6 20-22. In order to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment, a trial court must make the statutory findings mandated for consecutive sentences under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) at the sentencing hearing and incorporate those findings into its sentencing entry. Bonnell at syllabus.\n\n{\u00b617} The state noted that the prosecutor mentioned factors that could have supported the imposition of consecutive sentences and that \u201c[w]hile the trial court did not repeat the prosecutor's statements, they completely justify the imposition of a maximum, consecutive sentence.\u201d That is insufficient. There is no indication that the trial court agreed with the statements the prosecutor made or adopted the statements as its own. Accordingly, we must vacate the consecutive nature of\nBolware\u2019s sentences and remand the cause for the trial court to consider whether consecutive sentences are appropriate under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) and, if so, to make the required findings on the record and incorporate those findings in the sentencing journal entry. We sustain Bolware\u2019s fifth assignment of error.\n\nConclusion\n\n{\u00b618} Having considered each of Bolware\u2019s assignments of error, we affirm the judgments of the trial court in part, vacate the sentences in part, and remand the matter for further proceedings.\n\nJudgments affirmed in part, sentences vacated in part, and cause remanded.\n\nZAYAS and MYERS, JJ., concur.\n\nPlease note:\n\nThe court has recorded its own entry on the date of the release of this opinion.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nIN THE COURT OF APPEALS\nFIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT OF OHIO\nHAMILTON COUNTY, OHIO\n\nSTATE OF OHIO, : APPEAL NOS.

McKenna, for Defendant-Appellant.\nMock, Presiding Judge.\n\n{\u00b61} In five assignments of error, defendant-appellant Kevin Bolware claims that he was improperly found guilty of and sentenced for felonious assault. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Bolware\u2019s conviction, but remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings relating to the imposition of consecutive sentences.\n\nDiffering Accounts\n\n{\u00b62} Bolware met the victim in this case in the fall of 2016. The two would meet a few times a month for sex. On February 10, 2017, the victim invited Bolware to her apartment. After engaging in intercourse, the two began to argue. The victim testified that Bolware punched her in the side of the head. The victim retrieved pepper spray from a drawer and sprayed Bolware with it. The victim testified that Bolware then started to leave, but turned and resumed his assault. According to her, he punched her numerous times and clawed at her eyes. He then stomped on her while she was on the ground.\n\n{\u00b63} A neighbor testified that she heard the commotion and came to investigate. She saw Bolware standing over the victim and could smell the pepper spray in the air. She testified that she saw Bolware stomping on the victim and striking her several times. She yelled for Bolware to leave the victim alone, and Bolware fled from the apartment with the victim\u2019s cell phone and keys. A few hours later, the victim\u2019s eyes began to swell and she went to the hospital. The victim suffered bruising, cuts, lacerations, and four broken ribs. An initial report was taken by a police officer at the scene, but further investigation did not occur until later when the victim identified Bolware as the assailant. Both the victim and the neighbor identified Bolware from a photo array.\nBolware was indicted, in the case numbered B-1702916, for one count of felonious assault and one count of aggravated robbery. As a result of the charges and additional violations, his community control in the cases numbered B-1403009 and B-1503778 was terminated. The B-1702916 matter proceeded to a jury trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Bolware was found guilty of felonious assault, but acquitted on the charge of aggravated robbery. He was sentenced to eight years in prison, which he was ordered to serve consecutively to the prison terms imposed in the cases numbered B-1403009 and B-1503778, which had been ordered to be served consecutively to each other.\n\nProsecutorial Misconduct\u2014No Prejudice\n\nIn the first two assignments of error, which he has argued together, Bolware attack statements made by the prosecutor during the course of the trial. After each statement, defense counsel had objected and requested a mistrial. The first assignment of error claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to grant a mistrial as a result of the comments. The second assignment of error claims that the statements deprived him of a fair trial. We will address the assignments together.\n\nBolware groups the first two instances together as attempts by the prosecutor to improperly refer to his criminal history. The first instance occurred during voir dire when the prosecutor said, \u201cYou are not allowed to know things about the defendant. You are not allowed to know what if any criminal history the defendant has. You are not allowed to know information that may be obtained through investigative sources to determine the defendant\u2019s background.\u201d During opening statements, the prosecutor told the jury that Bolware was identified when the victim and witness reviewed a packet of information \u201cused by police where they put a series of mug shots together of people.\u201d\nBolware groups the second two instances together as improper attempts to denigrate defense counsel during rebuttal closing argument. In the first instance, the prosecutor said,\n\n[What I have struck about [sic] in this case, it finally hit me, was when [defense counsel] said to you\u2014he talked to about the lie right from the start. * * * What was the lie? You sat here and you listened to it yesterday * * * when [defense counsel] stood up and told you about the case. He talked to you about legs being grabbed, he talked about the victim doing drugs, being a cokehead, doing cocaine * * *.\n\nThe second instance occurred a few moments later when the state characterized the defense's case as the \u201cnutty and slutty\u201d defense.\n\nYou heard all these things come out of defense counsel\u2019s mouth * * * His explanation of this case was a raging prostitute that was upset that one of her johns wouldn\u2019t come and stay with her * * * Did you hear one scintilla of evidence to support that argument? Did anyone have the moral courage to sit in that witness chair and say \u201cthis woman was a prostitute?\u201d\n\nBut even if we were to conclude that the remarks cited were improper, they did not prejudicially affect Bolware\u2019s substantial rights. The granting or denial of a motion for a mistrial rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 480, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001). To show an abuse of discretion in failing to grant a mistrial, the defendant must demonstrate material prejudice. See State v. Adams, 144 Ohio St.3d 429, 2015-Ohio-3954, 45 N.E.3d 127, \u00b6 198. Similarly, the test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights. See State v.

We overrule Bolware\u2019s first and second assignments of error.\n\nSufficiency and Weight of the Evidence\n\nBolware argues his third and fourth assignments of error together. In his third assignment of error, Bolware claims that his conviction was based upon insufficient evidence. In his fourth assignment of error, he claims that his conviction was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.\nIn a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the question is whether after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. In reviewing a challenge to the weight of the evidence, we sit as a \u201cthirteenth juror.\u201d *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). We must review the entire record, weigh the evidence, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. *Id.*\n\nBolware\u2019s argument centers solely on the relative value of the evidence. He claims that neither the victim\u2019s account nor the testimony of the witness was credible. He argues that the fact that she delayed seeking medical treatment discredited the victim\u2019s account of the events. And he argues that there was no physical evidence in the apartment to support the victim\u2019s claim. But arguments based on the value of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses are not proper on review of evidentiary sufficiency. *State v. Yarbrough*, 95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, \u00b6 79. Nothing Bolware has argued supports his contention that his conviction was based upon insufficient evidence. We overrule Bolware\u2019s third assignment of error.\n\nTurning to Bolware\u2019s manifest-weight argument, we note that reversing a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence should be reserved for only the most \u201c\u2018exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019\u201d *Thompkins* at 387, quoting *State v. Martin*, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983), paragraph three of the syllabus. The jury, as the trier of fact, is in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses. *See State v. DeHass*, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212 (1967),\nparagraph one of the syllabus. After reviewing the record, we hold that there was nothing about the testimony presented by the victim and the witness which would make their version so incredible that it indicates the jury lost its way. We also cannot conclude that the jury created a manifest miscarriage of justice by choosing to find the testimony of the state's witnesses credible. See Thompkins at 386. We overrule Bolware's fourth assignment of error.\n\nConsecutive Sentences Unsupported\n\n{\u00b615} In his final assignment of error, Bolware claims that the trial court failed to make the appropriate findings when sentencing him to consecutive prison terms. We agree.\n\n{\u00b616} At the sentencing hearing, the trial court did not make any findings to support its decision to order Bolware to serve his sentence in the case numbered B-1702916 consecutively to the sentences imposed in the cases numbered B-1403009 and B-1503778, but findings were incorporated into the trial court's sentencing entry. Consecutive sentences may be imposed only if the trial court makes the required findings pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). State v. Bonnell, 140 Ohio St.3d 209, 2014-Ohio-3177, 16 N.E.3d 659, \u00b6 20-22. In order to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment, a trial court must make the statutory findings mandated for consecutive sentences under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) at the sentencing hearing and incorporate those findings into its sentencing entry. Bonnell at syllabus.\n\n{\u00b617} The state noted that the prosecutor mentioned factors that could have supported the imposition of consecutive sentences and that \u201c[w]hile the trial court did not repeat the prosecutor's statements, they completely justify the imposition of a maximum, consecutive sentence.\u201d That is insufficient. There is no indication that the trial court agreed with the statements the prosecutor made or adopted the statements as its own. Accordingly, we must vacate the consecutive nature of\nBolware\u2019s sentences and remand the cause for the trial court to consider whether consecutive sentences are appropriate under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) and, if so, to make the required findings on the record and incorporate those findings in the sentencing journal entry. We sustain Bolware\u2019s fifth assignment of error.\n\nConclusion\n\n{\u00b618} Having considered each of Bolware\u2019s assignments of error, we affirm the judgments of the trial court in part, vacate the sentences in part, and remand the matter for further proceedings.\n\nJudgments affirmed in part, sentences vacated in part, and cause remanded.\n\nZAYAS and MYERS, JJ., concur.\n\nPlease note:\n\nThe court has recorded its own entry on the date of the release of this opinion.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nIN THE COURT OF APPEALS\nFIRST APPELLATE DISTRICT OF OHIO\nHAMILTON COUNTY, OHIO\n\nSTATE OF OHIO, : APPEAL NOS.

McKenna, for Defendant-Appellant.\nMock, Presiding Judge.\n\n{\u00b61} In five assignments of error, defendant-appellant Kevin Bolware claims that he was improperly found guilty of and sentenced for felonious assault. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm Bolware\u2019s conviction, but remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings relating to the imposition of consecutive sentences.\n\nDiffering Accounts\n\n{\u00b62} Bolware met the victim in this case in the fall of 2016. The two would meet a few times a month for sex. On February 10, 2017, the victim invited Bolware to her apartment. After engaging in intercourse, the two began to argue. The victim testified that Bolware punched her in the side of the head. The victim retrieved pepper spray from a drawer and sprayed Bolware with it. The victim testified that Bolware then started to leave, but turned and resumed his assault. According to her, he punched her numerous times and clawed at her eyes. He then stomped on her while she was on the ground.\n\n{\u00b63} A neighbor testified that she heard the commotion and came to investigate. She saw Bolware standing over the victim and could smell the pepper spray in the air. She testified that she saw Bolware stomping on the victim and striking her several times. She yelled for Bolware to leave the victim alone, and Bolware fled from the apartment with the victim\u2019s cell phone and keys. A few hours later, the victim\u2019s eyes began to swell and she went to the hospital. The victim suffered bruising, cuts, lacerations, and four broken ribs. An initial report was taken by a police officer at the scene, but further investigation did not occur until later when the victim identified Bolware as the assailant. Both the victim and the neighbor identified Bolware from a photo array.\nBolware was indicted, in the case numbered B-1702916, for one count of felonious assault and one count of aggravated robbery. As a result of the charges and additional violations, his community control in the cases numbered B-1403009 and B-1503778 was terminated. The B-1702916 matter proceeded to a jury trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Bolware was found guilty of felonious assault, but acquitted on the charge of aggravated robbery. He was sentenced to eight years in prison, which he was ordered to serve consecutively to the prison terms imposed in the cases numbered B-1403009 and B-1503778, which had been ordered to be served consecutively to each other.\n\nProsecutorial Misconduct\u2014No Prejudice\n\nIn the first two assignments of error, which he has argued together, Bolware attack statements made by the prosecutor during the course of the trial. After each statement, defense counsel had objected and requested a mistrial. The first assignment of error claims that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to grant a mistrial as a result of the comments. The second assignment of error claims that the statements deprived him of a fair trial. We will address the assignments together.\n\nBolware groups the first two instances together as attempts by the prosecutor to improperly refer to his criminal history. The first instance occurred during voir dire when the prosecutor said, \u201cYou are not allowed to know things about the defendant. You are not allowed to know what if any criminal history the defendant has. You are not allowed to know information that may be obtained through investigative sources to determine the defendant\u2019s background.\u201d During opening statements, the prosecutor told the jury that Bolware was identified when the victim and witness reviewed a packet of information \u201cused by police where they put a series of mug shots together of people.\u201d\nBolware groups the second two instances together as improper attempts to denigrate defense counsel during rebuttal closing argument. In the first instance, the prosecutor said,\n\n[What I have struck about [sic] in this case, it finally hit me, was when [defense counsel] said to you\u2014he talked to about the lie right from the start. * * * What was the lie? You sat here and you listened to it yesterday * * * when [defense counsel] stood up and told you about the case. He talked to you about legs being grabbed, he talked about the victim doing drugs, being a cokehead, doing cocaine * * *.\n\nThe second instance occurred a few moments later when the state characterized the defense's case as the \u201cnutty and slutty\u201d defense.\n\nYou heard all these things come out of defense counsel\u2019s mouth * * * His explanation of this case was a raging prostitute that was upset that one of her johns wouldn\u2019t come and stay with her * * * Did you hear one scintilla of evidence to support that argument? Did anyone have the moral courage to sit in that witness chair and say \u201cthis woman was a prostitute?\u201d\n\nBut even if we were to conclude that the remarks cited were improper, they did not prejudicially affect Bolware\u2019s substantial rights. The granting or denial of a motion for a mistrial rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 480, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001). To show an abuse of discretion in failing to grant a mistrial, the defendant must demonstrate material prejudice. See State v. Adams, 144 Ohio St.3d 429, 2015-Ohio-3954, 45 N.E.3d 127, \u00b6 198. Similarly, the test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights. See State v. Drummund,\nEach instance represented an isolated comment in a trial that spanned several days. \u201c[I]solated comments by a prosecutor are not to be taken out of context and given their most damaging meaning.\u201d State v. Gapen, 104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, \u00b6 106, citing Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974). Thus, \u201c[n]ot every intemperate remark by counsel can be a basis for reversal.\u201d State v. Landrum, 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 112, 559 N.E.2d 710 (1990). And there can be no prejudice where the remaining evidence of guilt is so overwhelming that the outcome of the case would have been the same regardless of evidence admitted erroneously. State v. Williams, 38 Ohio St.3d 346, 349, 528 N.E.2d 910 (1988).\n\nIn this case, the instances cited by Bolware were not so significant that they deprived him of a fair trial. None of the comments became recurring themes in the case, and they were not repeated. Furthermore, the evidence against Bolware was such that we do not question the guilty finding the jury reached. The trial court did not err when it denied Bolware\u2019s motions for a mistrial, and he was not denied his right to due process by comments made by the prosecutor.

Specifically, Jenkins argues that Eanes\u2019s in-court identification of him as the shooter was impermissibly suggestive and that Eanes\u2019s \u201climited ability to view the shooter,\u201d lack of attention, and description shows that his identification is unreliable.\n\n***\n\nHere, while Eanes did not identify Jenkins as the shooter before trial, the record reflects that his in-court identification was reliable. Like the witness in Nelson, Eanes testified that he was only a few feet away from the fight between Jenkins and Super. He testified that he got a good look at Jenkins on a number of different occasions that night: when Jenkins walked into Phantasy with Super; later, during the fight with Super; when Jenkins drove away after the fight in a white vehicle; and finally, when Jenkins picked up Super and drove by Phantasy and fired a gun. While Jenkins argues that the time of day made Eanes\u2019s identification of him less reliable, Eanes also testified that the area outside of Phantasy is well lit and that he would \u201cnever forget\u201d the shooter\u2019s face. Further, as to Jenkins\u2019s argument that Eanes had a limited ability to view the shooter because of Jones\u2019s SUV parked in front of Phantasy, Eanes testified that he walked back and forth while working security that night, and right before the shooting occurred, he was standing at the rear of the SUV. Eanes testified that, as a result, he was able to see the driver of the white vehicle as well as the gun that the driver was pointing out of his window toward Phantasy. Finally, like Nelson, Eanes\u2019s testimony was under oath and subject to cross-examination.\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, we find that Eanes had a reliable and independent basis for identifying Jenkins as the shooter. We do not find that Eanes\u2019s in-court identification denied Jenkins his right to a fair trial or that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting that evidence. Accordingly, we overrule Jenkins\u2019s first assignment of error.\n\nIn his second assignment of error, Jenkins argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his request for the eyewitness identification instruction set forth in Telfaire, 469 F.2d 552 (D.C.Cir.1972).\n\n***\n\nAs a result, we concluded that the court\u2019s instruction \u201cadequately informed the jury of its duty to carefully consider the credibility of and surrounding circumstances affecting the witness\u2019s identification.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 26. Here, the trial court denied Jenkins\u2019s request for a Telfaire instruction. Like the trial court in Witherspoon, however, the trial court in this case gave a general instruction regarding eyewitness identification, stating:\nConcerning eyewitness testimony. Some things you may consider in weighing that testimony are: The capacity of the witness, that is, the age, intelligence, defective senses, if any, and the opportunity of the witness to observe; the witness\u2019s degree of attention at the time he observed the offender; the accuracy of the witness\u2019s prior description or identification, if any; whether the witness had occasion to observe the defendant in the past; the interval of time between the event and the identification, and all surrounding circumstances under which the witness had identified the defendant including deficiencies, if any, in lineup, photo display, or one on one.\n\nTherefore, despite denying Jenkins\u2019s request for the Telfaire instruction, the court \u201cadequately informed the jury of its duty to carefully consider opportunity of the witness to observe the defendant, the reasonableness of identification, and the credibility of the witness.\u201d Witherspoon, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94475, 2011-Ohio-704, at \u00b6 26. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, and we overrule Jenkins\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\nJenkins, supra, \u00b6 35-45.\n\n{\u00b618} The doctrine of res judicata bars Jenkins from once again raising the issues of improper in-court identification and limiting instructions to the jury with regard to in-court identification, because the issues were previously adjudicated before this court on direct appeal. O\u2019Nesti v. DeBartolo Realty Corp., 113 Ohio St.3d 59, 2007-Ohio-1102, 862 N.E.2d 803. Jenkins has failed to establish any prejudice through his fourth proposed assignment of error.\n\n{\u00b619} Accordingly, the application for reopening is denied.\n\nMARY J.

BOYLE, J.:\n\n\u00b61 Trevonte Jenkins has filed a timely application for reopening pursuant to App.R. 26(B). Jenkins is attempting to reopen the appellate judgment, rendered in State v. Jenkins, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105881, 2018-Ohio-2397, that affirmed his convictions and sentence of incarceration for two counts of attempted murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02 and 2923.02, two counts of felonious assault in violation R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), two counts of discharging a firearm on or near prohibited premises in violation of R.C. 2923.162(A)(3), two counts of improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle in violation of R.C. 2923.16(A) and (B), one count of having weapons while under disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(2), one count of criminal damaging or endangering in violation of R.C. 2909.06(A)(1), and one count of domestic violence in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A). We decline to reopen Jenkins\u2019s original appeal.\n\nI. Standard of Review Applicable to App.R. 26(B) Application for Reopening\nIn order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, Jenkins is required to establish that the performance of his appellate counsel was deficient and the deficiency resulted in prejudice. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); *State v. Bradley*, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), *cert. denied*, 497 U.S. 1011, 110 S.Ct. 3258, 111 L.Ed.2d 767 (1990).\n\nIn *Strickland*, the United States Supreme Court held that a court\u2019s scrutiny of an attorney\u2019s work must be highly deferential. The court further stated that it is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess his attorney after conviction and that it would be too easy for a court to conclude that a specific act or omission was deficient, especially when examining the matter in hindsight. Thus, a court must indulge in a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. *Strickland*.\n\n**II. Prosecutorial Misconduct**\n\nJenkins has raised four proposed assignments of error in support of his application for reopening. Having a common basis in law and fact, we shall simultaneously consider the first and third proposed assignments of error.\n\nJenkins\u2019s first proposed assignment of error is that:\n\nAppellate counsel failed to argue that appellant was prejudiced by the state\u2019s misconduct in vouching for the state\u2019s key witness.\n\nJenkins\u2019s third proposed assignment of error is that:\n\nAppellate counsel failed to argue that the prosecutor committed misconduct when the jury was misled by improper statements regarding the standard of evidence and the law.\nJenkins, through his first and third proposed assignments of error, argues that appellate counsel failed to argue on appeal the issue of prosecutorial misconduct. Specifically, Jenkins argues that prosecutorial misconduct resulted from: 1) prosecutor vouching for the credibility of a state\u2019s witness during closing argument; 2) prosecutor instructing jury that a lesser standard than reasonable doubt could be employed to convict Jenkins during closing argument; and 3) prosecutor misleading the jury regarding the evidence presented at trial during closing argument.\n\nA prosecuting attorney possesses wide latitude to summarize the evidence and zealously advocate the state\u2019s position during closing argument. State v. Richey, 64 Ohio St.3d 353, 362, 595 N.E.2d 915 (1992). The individual specific remarks by a prosecutor, made during closing argument, cannot be judged in isolation, but must be examined in light of the tenor and context of the entire closing argument. State v. Slagle, 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 607, 605 N.E.2d 916 (1992). Improper remarks made by a prosecuting attorney during closing argument are grounds for reversal only when the remarks serve to deny the defendant a fair trial. State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 266, 15 Ohio B. 379, 473 N.E.2d 768 (1984).\n\nWhen the closing arguments made by the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel are viewed in their entirety, we find that Jenkins was not denied a fair trial: 1) both the prosecutor and defense counsel simply argued that the jury was charged with determining the credibility of each witness, and the prosecutor did not vouch for the credibility of any witness; 2) the prosecutor did not instruct the jury as to a lesser standard of proof; and 3) the prosecutor did not mislead the jury with regard to the evidence presented during the course of trial. The remarks of the prosecutor during closing argument did not deny Jenkins a fair trial. Thus, Jenkins has\nfailed to establish that he was prejudiced through his first and third proposed assignments of error.\n\nIII. Defective Arrest Warrant and Indictment\n\n\u00b610 Jenkins\u2019s second proposed assignment of error is that:\n\nAppellant\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to argue ineffective assistance of trial counsel related to appellant\u2019s indictment and arrest warrant.\n\n\u00b611 Jenkins, through his second proposed assignment of error, argues that appellate counsel failed to argue on appeal the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Specifically, Jenkins argues that the warrant for his arrest and the indictment were defective.\n\n\u00b612 Probable cause to obtain and execute an arrest warrant exists where the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer\u2019s knowledge are sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that an offense was committed. Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142,(1964). Probable cause has been defined as \u201ca fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found.\u201d Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).\n\n\u00b613 Herein, the record demonstrates that sufficient probable cause existed for the Lakewood Police Dept. to obtain and execute an arrest warrant for Jenkins. Lakewood Police detective McLaughlin testified that: 1) there was a shooting at a bar located in Lakewood, Ohio, tr. 903; 2) the suspect motor vehicle involved in the shooting was identified through a city of Lakewood surveillance video, tr. 903; 3) the surveillance video revealed that the suspected motor vehicle was a white Hyundai Accent, tr. 903; 4) the license plate number for the white Hyundai Accent was identified through the surveillance video, tr. 903; 5) the white Hyundai Accent was rented by Jenkins from Enterprise Rent-A-Car, tr. 903; and 6) an arrest warrant was obtained for\nthe arrest of Jenkins based upon the facts gathered by the Lakewood police, tr. 908. We find that there existed probable cause to issue and execute an arrest warrant for Jenkins.\n\n{\u00b614} Any argument with regard to defective grand jury proceedings and an invalid indictment cannot be addressed through an App.R. 26(B) application for reopening. The record before this court does not indicate the type of testimony that was presented before the grand jury."}

Jenkins has failed to establish that he was prejudiced through his second proposed assignment of error.\n\nIV. In-court identification of Jenkins\n\n{\u00b615} Jenkins\u2019s fourth proposed assignment of error is that:\n\nAppellate counsel failed to effectively argue the issue of the impermissible first-time in-court identification of appellant.\n\n{\u00b616} Jenkins, through his fourth proposed assignment of error, argues that appellate counsel failed to effectively challenge on appeal the in-court identification of Jenkins by a state\u2019s witness. In addition, Jenkins argues that appellate counsel should have challenged the failure of the trial court to provide limiting instructions to the jury with regard to in-court identification.\n\n{\u00b617} The issues raised by Jenkins through his fourth proposed assignments of error have already been addressed on direct appeal.

He testified that he got a good look at Jenkins on a number of different occasions that night: when Jenkins walked into Phantasy with Super; later, during the fight with Super; when Jenkins drove away after the fight in a white vehicle; and finally, when Jenkins picked up Super and drove by Phantasy and fired a gun. While Jenkins argues that the time of day made Eanes\u2019s identification of him less reliable, Eanes also testified that the area outside of Phantasy is well lit and that he would \u201cnever forget\u201d the shooter\u2019s face. Further, as to Jenkins\u2019s argument that Eanes had a limited ability to view the shooter because of Jones\u2019s SUV parked in front of Phantasy, Eanes testified that he walked back and forth while working security that night, and right before the shooting occurred, he was standing at the rear of the SUV. Eanes testified that, as a result, he was able to see the driver of the white vehicle as well as the gun that the driver was pointing out of his window toward Phantasy. Finally, like Nelson, Eanes\u2019s testimony was under oath and subject to cross-examination.\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, we find that Eanes had a reliable and independent basis for identifying Jenkins as the shooter. We do not find that Eanes\u2019s in-court identification denied Jenkins his right to a fair trial or that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting that evidence. Accordingly, we overrule Jenkins\u2019s first assignment of error.\n\nIn his second assignment of error, Jenkins argues that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his request for the eyewitness identification instruction set forth in Telfaire, 469 F.2d 552 (D.C.Cir.1972).\n\n***\n\nAs a result, we concluded that the court\u2019s instruction \u201cadequately informed the jury of its duty to carefully consider the credibility of and surrounding circumstances affecting the witness\u2019s identification.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 26. Here, the trial court denied Jenkins\u2019s request for a Telfaire instruction. Like the trial court in Witherspoon, however, the trial court in this case gave a general instruction regarding eyewitness identification, stating:\nConcerning eyewitness testimony. Some things you may consider in weighing that testimony are: The capacity of the witness, that is, the age, intelligence, defective senses, if any, and the opportunity of the witness to observe; the witness\u2019s degree of attention at the time he observed the offender; the accuracy of the witness\u2019s prior description or identification, if any; whether the witness had occasion to observe the defendant in the past; the interval of time between the event and the identification, and all surrounding circumstances under which the witness had identified the defendant including deficiencies, if any, in lineup, photo display, or one on one.\n\nTherefore, despite denying Jenkins\u2019s request for the Telfaire instruction, the court \u201cadequately informed the jury of its duty to carefully consider opportunity of the witness to observe the defendant, the reasonableness of identification, and the credibility of the witness.\u201d Witherspoon, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94475, 2011-Ohio-704, at \u00b6 26. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion, and we overrule Jenkins\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\nJenkins, supra, \u00b6 35-45.\n\n{\u00b618} The doctrine of res judicata bars Jenkins from once again raising the issues of improper in-court identification and limiting instructions to the jury with regard to in-court identification, because the issues were previously adjudicated before this court on direct appeal.

BOYLE, J.:\n\n\u00b61 Trevonte Jenkins has filed a timely application for reopening pursuant to App.R. 26(B). Jenkins is attempting to reopen the appellate judgment, rendered in State v. Jenkins, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105881, 2018-Ohio-2397, that affirmed his convictions and sentence of incarceration for two counts of attempted murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02 and 2923.02, two counts of felonious assault in violation R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), two counts of discharging a firearm on or near prohibited premises in violation of R.C. 2923.162(A)(3), two counts of improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle in violation of R.C. 2923.16(A) and (B), one count of having weapons while under disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(2), one count of criminal damaging or endangering in violation of R.C. 2909.06(A)(1), and one count of domestic violence in violation of R.C. 2919.25(A). We decline to reopen Jenkins\u2019s original appeal.\n\nI. Standard of Review Applicable to App.R. 26(B) Application for Reopening\nIn order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, Jenkins is required to establish that the performance of his appellate counsel was deficient and the deficiency resulted in prejudice. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); *State v. Bradley*, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), *cert. denied*, 497 U.S. 1011, 110 S.Ct. 3258, 111 L.Ed.2d 767 (1990).\n\nIn *Strickland*, the United States Supreme Court held that a court\u2019s scrutiny of an attorney\u2019s work must be highly deferential. The court further stated that it is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess his attorney after conviction and that it would be too easy for a court to conclude that a specific act or omission was deficient, especially when examining the matter in hindsight. Thus, a court must indulge in a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy. *Strickland*.\n\n**II. Prosecutorial Misconduct**\n\nJenkins has raised four proposed assignments of error in support of his application for reopening. Having a common basis in law and fact, we shall simultaneously consider the first and third proposed assignments of error.\n\nJenkins\u2019s first proposed assignment of error is that:\n\nAppellate counsel failed to argue that appellant was prejudiced by the state\u2019s misconduct in vouching for the state\u2019s key witness.\n\nJenkins\u2019s third proposed assignment of error is that:\n\nAppellate counsel failed to argue that the prosecutor committed misconduct when the jury was misled by improper statements regarding the standard of evidence and the law.\nJenkins, through his first and third proposed assignments of error, argues that appellate counsel failed to argue on appeal the issue of prosecutorial misconduct. Specifically, Jenkins argues that prosecutorial misconduct resulted from: 1) prosecutor vouching for the credibility of a state\u2019s witness during closing argument; 2) prosecutor instructing jury that a lesser standard than reasonable doubt could be employed to convict Jenkins during closing argument; and 3) prosecutor misleading the jury regarding the evidence presented at trial during closing argument.\n\nA prosecuting attorney possesses wide latitude to summarize the evidence and zealously advocate the state\u2019s position during closing argument. State v. Richey, 64 Ohio St.3d 353, 362, 595 N.E.2d 915 (1992). The individual specific remarks by a prosecutor, made during closing argument, cannot be judged in isolation, but must be examined in light of the tenor and context of the entire closing argument. State v. Slagle, 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 607, 605 N.E.2d 916 (1992). Improper remarks made by a prosecuting attorney during closing argument are grounds for reversal only when the remarks serve to deny the defendant a fair trial. State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 266, 15 Ohio B. 379, 473 N.E.2d 768 (1984).\n\nWhen the closing arguments made by the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel are viewed in their entirety, we find that Jenkins was not denied a fair trial: 1) both the prosecutor and defense counsel simply argued that the jury was charged with determining the credibility of each witness, and the prosecutor did not vouch for the credibility of any witness; 2) the prosecutor did not instruct the jury as to a lesser standard of proof; and 3) the prosecutor did not mislead the jury with regard to the evidence presented during the course of trial. The remarks of the prosecutor during closing argument did not deny Jenkins a fair trial. Thus, Jenkins has\nfailed to establish that he was prejudiced through his first and third proposed assignments of error.\n\nIII. Defective Arrest Warrant and Indictment\n\n\u00b610 Jenkins\u2019s second proposed assignment of error is that:\n\nAppellant\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to argue ineffective assistance of trial counsel related to appellant\u2019s indictment and arrest warrant.\n\n\u00b611 Jenkins, through his second proposed assignment of error, argues that appellate counsel failed to argue on appeal the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Specifically, Jenkins argues that the warrant for his arrest and the indictment were defective.\n\n\u00b612 Probable cause to obtain and execute an arrest warrant exists where the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer\u2019s knowledge are sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that an offense was committed. Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142,(1964). Probable cause has been defined as \u201ca fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found.\u201d Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).\n\n\u00b613 Herein, the record demonstrates that sufficient probable cause existed for the Lakewood Police Dept. to obtain and execute an arrest warrant for Jenkins. Lakewood Police detective McLaughlin testified that: 1) there was a shooting at a bar located in Lakewood, Ohio, tr. 903; 2) the suspect motor vehicle involved in the shooting was identified through a city of Lakewood surveillance video, tr. 903; 3) the surveillance video revealed that the suspected motor vehicle was a white Hyundai Accent, tr. 903; 4) the license plate number for the white Hyundai Accent was identified through the surveillance video, tr. 903; 5) the white Hyundai Accent was rented by Jenkins from Enterprise Rent-A-Car, tr. 903; and 6) an arrest warrant was obtained for\nthe arrest of Jenkins based upon the facts gathered by the Lakewood police, tr. 908. We find that there existed probable cause to issue and execute an arrest warrant for Jenkins.\n\n{\u00b614} Any argument with regard to defective grand jury proceedings and an invalid indictment cannot be addressed through an App.R. 26(B) application for reopening. The record before this court does not indicate the type of testimony that was presented before the grand jury."}

The record before this court does not indicate the type of testimony that was presented before the grand jury.\n\nIt is well settled that matters outside the record do not provide a basis for reopening. State v. Madrigal, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000); State v. Hicks, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 83981, 2005-Ohio-1842.

Jenkins has failed to establish that he was prejudiced through his second proposed assignment of error.\n\nIV. In-court identification of Jenkins\n\n{\u00b615} Jenkins\u2019s fourth proposed assignment of error is that:\n\nAppellate counsel failed to effectively argue the issue of the impermissible first-time in-court identification of appellant.\n\n{\u00b616} Jenkins, through his fourth proposed assignment of error, argues that appellate counsel failed to effectively challenge on appeal the in-court identification of Jenkins by a state\u2019s witness. In addition, Jenkins argues that appellate counsel should have challenged the failure of the trial court to provide limiting instructions to the jury with regard to in-court identification.\n\n{\u00b617} The issues raised by Jenkins through his fourth proposed assignments of error have already been addressed on direct appeal. This court held that:\nIn his first assignment of error, Jenkins argues that the court erred when it denied his motion in limine, overruled his objection during trial, and allowed Eanes to identify Jenkins as the shooter during trial. Specifically, Jenkins argues that Eanes\u2019s in-court identification of him as the shooter was impermissibly suggestive and that Eanes\u2019s \u201climited ability to view the shooter,\u201d lack of attention, and description shows that his identification is unreliable.\n\n***\n\nHere, while Eanes did not identify Jenkins as the shooter before trial, the record reflects that his in-court identification was reliable.

Interestingly, Appellant does not specify which trial counsel was ineffective. However, it appears from this assignment that Appellant questions the effectiveness of his trial counsel.\nAppellant initially argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because trial counsel failed to object to any of the hearsay regarding Appellant residing in the residence during the raid by police officers, as charged in case number CR 2015 0361. However, we note that the failure to make objections is not alone enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v.

Holloway*, 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831 (1988) (failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); *State v. Gumm*, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 428, 1995-Ohio-24, 653 N.E.2d 253 holding modified by *State v. Wogenstahl*, 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 1996-Ohio-219, 662 N.E.2d 311 (the failure to make objections does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel *per se*, as that failure may be justified as a tactical decision).\n\nNext, Appellant argues that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective because trial counsel did not *voir dire* Sergeant Dana Sutherland (\u201cSutherland\u201d), the State\u2019s marijuana expert witness. This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, the record reveals, and the Appellant concedes, that trial counsel objected to the expert being certified as an expert witness, and the trial court overruled the objection. (*See, Trial Tr., Vol. II, at 286*). And second, the record reveals that the Appellant\u2019s concerns with Sutherland\u2019s qualifications to testify as an expert were addressed by the trial court prior to trial. (*Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol.*\nI, at 11). Given the trial court\u2019s rulings, we do not find that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation under the facts presented.\n\nLastly, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective because his trial counsel failed to file a proper motion to sever the counts at the appropriate time during trial. However, the record is clear, and the Appellant concedes, that objections to the State\u2019s motions to consolidate were made and a motion to sever was filed prior to trial. (See, CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 139; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 48). Despite Appellant\u2019s objections and motion, the trial court found that the charges were of similar character and part of a common scheme or course of criminal conduct, then consolidated the cases and joined them for purposes of trial. (CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 163; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 82). Thus, because the trial court had already ruled on Appellant\u2019s motion to sever, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that a subsequent trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness by failing to file an additional motion to sever, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fourth Assignment of Error\n\nIn his fourth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss his cases based upon a speedy trial violation. Specifically, Appellant argues that the continuance granted at the request of the\nState beyond the February 21, 2017 trial date was unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b682 \u201cOur standard of review upon an appeal raising a speedy trial issue is to count the expired days as directed by R.C. 2945.71, et seq.\u201d State v. King, 3rd Dist. Marion No. 9-06-18, 2007-Ohio-335, \u00b6 30. See also, State v. DePue, 96 Ohio App.3d 513, 516, 645 N.E.2d 745 (4th Dist.1994). \u201cIf any ambiguity exists, we construe the record in favor of the accused.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b683 The applicable statutory speedy trial provision, R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), provides that a person charged with a felony shall be brought to trial within two hundred and seventy (270) days after the person\u2019s arrest. R.C. 2945.71(C)(2). In computing time under division (C)(2), \u201ceach day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charges shall be counted as three days.\u201d R.C. 2945.71(E).\n\n\u00b684 Further, R.C. 2945.73(B) provides:\n\nUpon motion made at or prior to the commencement of trial, a person charged with an offense shall be discharged if he is not brought to trial within the time required by sections 2945.71 and 2945.72 of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b659} After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes charged proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Second Assignment of Error\n\n{\u00b660} Appellant argues that his convictions in both case number CR 2014 0118 and CR 2015 0361 were against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nStandard of Review\n\n{\u00b661} The Ohio Supreme Court has \u201c\u2018carefully distinguished the terms \u2018sufficiency\u2019 and \u2018weight\u2019 in criminal cases, declaring that \u2018manifest weight\u2019 and \u2018legal sufficiency\u2019 are \u2018both quantitatively and qualitatively different.\u2019\u201d Lyle, 3rd Dist.

The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against conviction.\u2019\u201d\n\nState v. Johnson, 3rd Dist.

However, in sitting as the thirteenth juror the appellate court should give due deference to the findings made by the jury. Id.\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b663} The Eighth District Court of Appeals identified the following eight factors as a guide to assist a reviewing court in determining whether a decision of the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence:\n\n1. A reviewing court is not required to accept the incredible as true;\n2. Whether the evidence is uncontradicted;\n3. Whether a witness was impeached;\n4. What was not proved;\n5. Certainty of evidence;\n6. Reliability of evidence;\n7. Whether witness\u2019 testimony is self-serving;\n8. And whether evidence is vague, uncertain, conflicting, or fragmentary.\n\nState v. Mattison, 23 Ohio App.3d 10, 14, 490 N.E.2d 926 (8th Dist.1985). We discuss the relevant factors to each underlying case below.\n\nUncontradicted Evidence\n\n{\u00b664} Initially, we note that Appellant failed to introduce any evidence that contradicted the State\u2019s evidence at trial. In respect to case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant produced no evidence to contradict the State\u2019s testimony that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:00 a.m., the Lima Police Department was dispatched to 234 North Main Street in Lima, Ohio for a call of a suspicious vehicle sitting in\nthe parking lot. It is not disputed that the Appellant exited his vehicle when officers arrived, and when Kunkleman approached him, Appellant turned back and leaned into the car on the driver\u2019s side. It is further undisputed that officers could smell the smell of raw marijuana at this time and that officers grabbed Appellant and pulled him away from the vehicle for their safety.\n\n{\u00b665} There is no dispute that the Appellant, when ordered to put his hands up in the air, disregarded the officer\u2019s commands, which led to him being detained. A pat down of Appellant produced a large sum of money and marijuana, which led to his arrest and the subsequent search of the vehicle, which produced a large amount of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, digital scales, and Appellant\u2019s billfold. With no testimony or evidence produced at trial to cast doubt upon this version of events, Appellant cannot contradict the elements of possession of cocaine and possession of heroin as established by the State in case number CR 2014 0118.\n\n{\u00b666} In regards to case number CR 2015 0361, the State\u2019s uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that on January 17, 2015, after receiving an anonymous tip and surveilling the premises, law enforcement entered 1222 Catalpa Street after repeatedly requesting that Appellant come to the front door. Once inside the premises, and while conducting a protective sweep of the home, officers viewed a marijuana grow tent in plain view. Based on the information collected, officers obtained a search warrant and searched the premises in its entirety. During the\nsearch, officers located credit cards, mail, and other personal effects bearing Appellant\u2019s name.\n\n{\u00b667} While Appellant contends that no witness had personal knowledge that he occupied the premises, the evidence indicates otherwise. Specifically, many of Appellant\u2019s personal effects were found within the residence, which is indicative of occupation. Accordingly, we find that the uncontradicted evidence supports that Appellant was occupying the residence on January 17, 2015.\n\nImpeached Witness\n\n{\u00b668} A review of the record reveals that no witness for the State was impeached in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361.\n\nReliability of Evidence\n\n{\u00b669} With respect to case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant attempts to discredit the reliability of the testimony and evidence produced at trial, because \u201cnot one single witness [***] actually had personal knowledge of Appellant allegedly occupying the premises testified [to] at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). Appellant further classifies all of the testimony produced regarding occupation of the premises as \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\n{\u00b670} However, we find that the State produced competent and credible evidence that Appellant was occupying 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio at the time the officers conducted their raid. Specifically, officers testified that they\nobserved Appellant leave the back of the duplex in an attempt to flee, and then run back inside once he saw that officers had the duplex surrounded. Furthermore, the evidence established that officers personally observed Appellant leave out of the back of the residence prior to it being breached. With eyewitness testimony confirming that Appellant was, in fact, inside the residence, we find no merit in Appellant\u2019s argument in regards to reliability.\n\n**Self-Serving Testimony**\n\n{\u00b671} The record reveals that the trial court did not characterize any witness\u2019s testimony as self-serving in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, on review, we do not find any indicia of self-serving testimony in either case and Appellant does not argue that testimony was self-serving on appeal.\n\n**Vague, Uncertain, Conflicting, or Fragmentary Evidence**\n\n{\u00b672} In case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant points to the evidence produced at the suppression hearing to cast into doubt officers\u2019 testimony at trial. Specifically, Appellant argues that the officers, when testifying at the suppression hearing, described a \u201cmuch more leisurely encounter at the suppression hearing than they did at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). However, Appellant fails to develop this argument and further fails to demonstrate how this \u201cconflict\u201d in testimonies between the suppression hearing and trial creates a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting\nreversal. Even should Appellant establish that a true \u201cconflict\u201d exists in the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and the trial, and that such issue was properly before this Court, we find that the record contains competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. *Phelps v. Horn\u2019s Crop Serv. Ctr.*, 3rd Dist. Wyandot No. 16-89-8, 1990 WL 157282, * 2 (holding that the choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nIN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\nTHIRD APPELLATE DISTRICT\nALLEN COUNTY\n\nSTATE OF OHIO,\n\nPLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,\n\nv.\n\nRAYLON A.

Davis (\u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals his convictions from the Allen County Common Pleas Court for one count of possession of cocaine and one count of possession of heroin in case number CR 2014 0118; and one count of possession of cocaine, one count of possession of heroin, one count of possession of marijuana, one count of illegal cultivation of marijuana and one count of having weapons while under disability in case number CR 2015 0361. On appeal, Appellant asserts, in each case, that: 1) his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence; 2) his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence; 3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel; 4) the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss; 5) the trial court erred by permitting appellee to present the testimony of an expert witness who had not provided the defense with a report; 6) the trial court erred by consolidating his two cases for trials; and 7), 8) the trial court erred by denying Appellant\u2019s motions to suppress evidence in each case. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n\nFactual Background - Case Number CR 2014 0118\n\n{\u00b62} On March 14, 2014, (then) Lima Police Department Patrolman Trent Kunkleman (\u201cKunkleman\u201d) was on third shift patrol in the city of Lima, Ohio. (Doc. No. 146). Around 3:20 a.m., Kunkleman responded to a police dispatch to a\ndowntown parking lot in Lima in regards to a suspicious silver vehicle. (Id.). Upon arriving at the parking lot, Kunkleman located a grey Hyundai. (Id.). Kunkleman testified that the Hyundai was the only vehicle in the parking lot, so he shined his spotlight into the vehicle, identifying the Appellant as its sole occupant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b63} A second Lima police officer, Sergeant Hillard (\u201cHillard\u201d), arrived at the parking lot shortly after Kunkleman. (Id.). Hillard testified that he received a police dispatch that a suspicious vehicle\u2019s car alarm was going off\\(^1\\) in the Lima parking lot in question. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b64} After Hillard arrived, Kunkleman walked up to the Appellant\u2019s vehicle in an attempt to engage Appellant in conversation, but Appellant did not respond. (Id.). Instead, Appellant exited his vehicle, turned his back to Kunkleman, and then leaned back into the vehicle. (Id.). Kunkleman testified that he was unable to see Appellant\u2019s hands, but was able to smell an overwhelming odor of raw marijuana. (Id.). At this point, Kunkleman became alarmed that Appellant might be reaching into his vehicle for a weapon, so he pulled Appellant away from the car. (Id.). Officers Kunkleman and Hillard testified that they saw the Appellant placing his hand down into his pants pocket at this point. (Id.). Two additional law enforcement officers, who had also arrived on the scene, then grabbed Appellant and patted him down for officer safety. (Id.). During the pat down, officers testified that there was\n\n\\(^1\\) Dash-cam video entered into evidence confirms that a car alarm was going off. (Id.; Mot. To Suppress Hearing, 06/30/2016, State\u2019s Ex. 2).\na strong odor of marijuana coming from Appellant. (Id.). Officers testified that they felt a \u201cbaggie\u201d in Appellant\u2019s left pocket. (Id.). Officers removed the baggie, which contained drugs. (Id.). Appellant was then arrested. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b65} After Appellant\u2019s arrest, Kunkleman returned to the vehicle to investigate the odor of marijuana coming from it. (Id.). Hillard, who was also at the vehicle at this time, searched the vehicle, and found a paper sack under the driver\u2019s seat that contained a large amount of cocaine. (Id.). In addition to the cocaine, officers located heroin, marijuana, ecstasy pills, a digital scale, and a ledger in the vehicle. (Id.).\n\nProcedural Background - Case Number CR 2014 0118\n\n{\u00b66} On May 15, 2014, the Allen County Grand Jury indicted Appellant on three (3) counts, including: Count One, possession of drugs (cocaine) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(4)(e), a first degree felony; Count Two, possession of drugs (heroin) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(6)(b), a fourth degree felony; and Count Three, aggravated possession of drugs (ecstasy) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(1)(a), a fifth degree felony. (Doc. No. 3).\n\n{\u00b67} Ultimately, Appellant was arraigned in the Allen County Common Pleas Court on January 23, 2015.\u00b2 (Doc. No. 13). Appellant\u2019s recognizance bond\n\n\u00b2 The record reveals a significant gap in time between Appellant\u2019s indictment and his arraignment. However, the record also reveals that Appellant made his initial appearance in the Lima Municipal Court on March 21, 2014, wherein he posted a $500,000 cash surety bond and was released. (Doc. No. 2).\nwas set at $100,000 cash or surety, which Appellant posted. (Doc. No. 11). However, on October 1, 2015, the trial court ordered that Appellant\u2019s bond be forfeited because he failed to appear for a pre-trial conference. (Doc. No. 32). A bench warrant for Appellant\u2019s arrest was then issued by the trial court. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b68} On September 17, 2015, Appellant was indicted on new charges in Allen County.3\n\n{\u00b69} On February 19, 2016, Appellant was apprehended by the US Marshall\u2019s Service in Detroit, Michigan. (Doc. No. 34). After returning to Allen County, the trial court ordered that the Appellant be held in the Allen County Jail, without bond, until further order of the Court. (Doc. No. 38). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was then scheduled for April 19, 2016. (Doc. No. 69).\n\n{\u00b610} On April 12, 2016, Appellant filed a motion to suppress in the trial court. (Doc. No. 87). On May 5, 2016, Appellant executed a waiver of his right to speedy trial. (Doc. No. 115).\n\n{\u00b611} A hearing on the motion to suppress occurred on June 30, 2016. (Doc. No. 138). And, on July 21, 2016, the trial court issued its ruling overruling Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. (Doc. No. 146).\n\n{\u00b612} On July 7, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate Appellant\u2019s cases. (Doc. No. 137). Appellant filed his oppositions to the State\u2019s motion to\n\n---\n\n3 This is Case Number CR 2015 0361, which we will address infra.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nconsolidate on July 15, 2016 and on August 22, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 139; 159). On August 26, 2016 the trial court consolidated the cases. (Doc. No. 163).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b638} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 147). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 150).\nOn July 24, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel.\u201d (Doc. No. 173). On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed an additional \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d as well as a \u201cmotion for continuance of the trial date,\u201d \u201cmotion for specific discovery,\u201d and \u201cmotion to suppress evidence.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 180; 181; 182; 183). Appellant, through his various motions, alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena witnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The Appellant further alleged that the State had failed to provide specific discovery. (Doc. No. 182). On August 1, 2017, the trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions, finding that the Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the case. (Doc. No. 186).\n\nAppellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 194). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2015 0361, the State made an oral motion to amend Count Three in the indictment, possession of marijuana, a felony of the third degree, to possession of marijuana, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court granted. (Id.) The Appellant did not oppose the amendment. (Id.).\n\nAppellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding Appellant guilty of all charges. (Id.). Further, Appellant was found guilty of all specifications except for the specification for property (electronics) contained in Count One and Count Two. (Id.).\nAppellant was sentenced on September 14, 2017 in the trial court and was ordered to serve a prison term of: seven (7) years in prison under Count One; seven (7) years in prison under Count Two; twelve (12) months in prison under Count Three; thirty (30) months in prison under Count Four; and thirty-six (36) months in prison under Count Five. (Doc. No. 200). The trial court further ordered that all counts be served consecutively to each other and consecutively to the prison sentence imposed in case number CR 2014 0118. (Id.). With regards to the specifications, the firearms were ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; the money was ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; and the electronics (subject to the specification in Counts Three and Four) were ordered forfeited to the WCOCTF. (Id.). Appellant\u2019s prison sentences totaled twenty-eight (28) and a half years. (Id.).\n\nFrom the judgments in case number CR 2014 0118 and case number CR 2015 0361 Appellant timely appeals, and presents the following assignments of error for our review:\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO.

For the reasons outlined below, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n\u201cWhether there is legally sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict is a question of law.\u201d *State v. Lyle*, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-14-41, 2015-Ohio-1181, \u00b6 8 citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 1997-Ohio-52, 678 N.E.2d 541. Sufficiency is a test of adequacy. *Id.* Under a challenge alleging insufficient evidence, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *Id.* quoting *State v. Leonard*, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 77.\n\n**Analysis \u2013 Case Number CR 2014 0118**\n\nIn case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant was found guilty in Count I of possession of drugs (cocaine) and guilty in Count II of possession of drugs (heroin), both in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which states:\n(A) No person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2925.11(A).\n\n{\u00b648} On appeal, Appellant argues that the State failed to produce any evidence proving that Appellant owned or possessed the contents (i.e. heroin and cocaine) of the motor vehicle in question. \u201c\u2018Possess\u2019 or \u2018possession\u2019 means having control over a thing or substance, but may not be inferred solely from mere access to the thing or substance through ownership or occupation of the premises upon which the thing or substance is found.\u201d R.C. 2925.01(K). \u201c\u2018The issue of whether a person charged with drug possession knowingly possessed a controlled substance is to be determined from all the attendant facts and circumstances available.\u2019\u201d State v. Frye, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-17-30, 2018-Ohio-894, \u00b6 50 quoting State v. Brooks, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-11-11, 2012-Ohio-5235, \u00b6 45. See also, State v. Teamer, 82 Ohio St.3d 490, 492, 1998-Ohio-193, 696 N.E.2d 1049 (1998).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b612} On July 7, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate Appellant\u2019s cases. (Doc. No. 137). Appellant filed his oppositions to the State\u2019s motion to\n\n---\n\n3 This is Case Number CR 2015 0361, which we will address infra.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nconsolidate on July 15, 2016 and on August 22, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 139; 159). On August 26, 2016 the trial court consolidated the cases. (Doc. No. 163).\n\n{\u00b613} On August 3, 2016, Appellant signed and filed a second waiver of his speedy trial rights in the trial court. (Doc. No. 155). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was rescheduled for December 20, 2016. (Doc. No. 169). On November 28, 2016, Appellant, through counsel, filed a motion to continue. (Doc. No. 171). Specifically, Appellant\u2019s trial counsel represented to the court that he had encountered difficulty contacting potential defense witnesses in preparation for trial. (Id.). A hearing was held on Appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance on November 30, 2016. (Doc. No. 174). At the hearing, Appellant refused to further waive his right to a speedy trial beyond the January 1, 2017 date set forth in Appellant\u2019s previous waiver. (Id. at 2). Despite Appellant\u2019s refusal, the trial court found that a sixty (60) day continuance was necessary and not unreasonable under the circumstances. (Id. at 8). Appellant\u2019s trial was set for February 21, 2017. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b614} On February 3, 2017, the State filed its motion for a continuance, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in State v. Gonzales, requiring that the State must prove the actual weight of a drug in question, (excluding any filler materials) to meet the statutory weight requirement. (Doc. No. 180). Stated better, based on the change in the prosecution of drug offenses under State v. Gonzales, the State requested additional time to determine the actual weight of the cocaine\npossessed by Appellant. Appellant objected to the State\u2019s motion for continuance. (Doc. No. 181). The trial court, finding that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom in drug prosecutions, granted the State\u2019s motion. (Doc. No. 182). Ultimately, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017. (Doc. No. 184).\n\n{\u00b615} On April 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss in the trial court. (Doc. No. 202). Specifically, Appellant requested that his cases be dismissed, pursuant to R.C. 2945.73(B) and R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), because he had been held in custody for 276 days, which exceeded the statutorily permissible 270 days. (Id.). The State responded to Appellant\u2019s motion, arguing that the time involving its continuance (of February 3, 2017) should not count against it, because that continuance was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d under the circumstances of the case. (Doc. No. 205). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motion on April 19, 2017. (Doc. No. 206).\n\n{\u00b616} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 211). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 214).\n\n{\u00b617} On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d and a \u201cmotion for continuance of trial date.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 237; 238). Appellant alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nwitnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions on August 1, 2017, finding that Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the cases. (Doc. No. 239).\n\n\u00b618 Appellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 243). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2014 0118, the State made an oral motion to amend Count One in the indictment, possession of cocaine, a felony of the first degree, to possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree. (Id.). The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion. (Id.) Further, the State made an oral motion to dismiss Count Three in the indictment, aggravated possession of drugs, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court also granted. (Id.). The Appellant did not object to either motion.\n\n\u00b619 Appellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding the Appellant guilty of Count I, possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree and of Count II, possession of heroin, a felony of the first degree. (Id.).\n\n\u00b620 Ultimately, and in case number CR 2014 0118, the trial court sentenced the Appellant to consecutive prison terms of six (6) years (Count I) and twelve (12) months (Count II) on September 14, 2017. (Doc. No. 244).\nFactual Background - Case Number 2015 CR 0361\n\n{\u00b621} On January 12 or 13, 2015, investigators with the West Central Ohio Criminal Task Force (\u201cWCOCTF\u201d) commenced an investigation to locate the Appellant, due to Appellant\u2019s outstanding warrants. (Doc. No. 100). On January 12, 2015, the Lima Police Department received an anonymous telephone call\\(^4\\) that Appellant was staying at 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio. (Id.). The caller further advised officers that Appellant was not a tenant on the lease at that location. (Id.). Sgt. Charles Godfrey, (\u201cGodfrey\u201d) then a supervisor at WCOCTF, attempted to contact the anonymous caller to verify the information provided, but was unable to do so. (Id.). So, based on the information provided (by the anonymous caller), Godfrey set up an undercover operation on January 13, 2015 to monitor the 1222 Catalpa Street residence in an attempt to locate Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b622} On January 17, 2015, Godfrey observed a Chrysler 300 parked at the Catalpa Street residence. (Id.). Later that day, an individual in a hooded sweatshirt left the residence in that vehicle. (Id.). Since the vehicle\u2019s windows were heavily tinted, and because Godfrey could not see inside it, Godfrey arranged for the Ohio State Highway Patrol to stop the vehicle for a tinted windows violation. (Id.). When the Chrysler was stopped a person identified as \u201cWatkins\u201d was located as a passenger in the vehicle. (Id.). Watkins told law enforcement officials that he and\n\n\\(^4\\) The anonymous caller was later identified as the landlord of the duplex wherein Appellant was staying. (See, Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 10/20/2016 Tr. at 7).\nthe driver had been visiting \u201cRay\u201d at 1222 Catalpa Street. (Id.). When shown a picture of Appellant, Watkins confirmed that \u201cRay\u201d was the Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b623} With that information (from Watkins), Godfrey returned to 1222 Catalpa Street, believing that Appellant was present in the residence. (Id.). And, after verifying that Appellant still had active outstanding warrants, Godfrey went to the residence\u2019s front door while law enforcement set up a perimeter around the house. (Id.). Godfrey knocked on the door, identified that he was a police officer, and that he had a warrant for Appellant\u2019s arrest. (Id.). Godfrey further advised that if the door wasn\u2019t opened it would be knocked down. (Id.)."}

Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Second Assignment of Error\n\n{\u00b660} Appellant argues that his convictions in both case number CR 2014 0118 and CR 2015 0361 were against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nStandard of Review\n\n{\u00b661} The Ohio Supreme Court has \u201c\u2018carefully distinguished the terms \u2018sufficiency\u2019 and \u2018weight\u2019 in criminal cases, declaring that \u2018manifest weight\u2019 and \u2018legal sufficiency\u2019 are \u2018both quantitatively and qualitatively different.\u2019\u201d Lyle, 3rd Dist.

The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against conviction.\u2019\u201d\n\nState v. Johnson, 3rd Dist.

However, in sitting as the thirteenth juror the appellate court should give due deference to the findings made by the jury. Id.\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b663} The Eighth District Court of Appeals identified the following eight factors as a guide to assist a reviewing court in determining whether a decision of the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence:\n\n1. A reviewing court is not required to accept the incredible as true;\n2. Whether the evidence is uncontradicted;\n3. Whether a witness was impeached;\n4. What was not proved;\n5. Certainty of evidence;\n6. Reliability of evidence;\n7. Whether witness\u2019 testimony is self-serving;\n8. And whether evidence is vague, uncertain, conflicting, or fragmentary.\n\nState v. Mattison, 23 Ohio App.3d 10, 14, 490 N.E.2d 926 (8th Dist.1985). We discuss the relevant factors to each underlying case below.\n\nUncontradicted Evidence\n\n{\u00b664} Initially, we note that Appellant failed to introduce any evidence that contradicted the State\u2019s evidence at trial. In respect to case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant produced no evidence to contradict the State\u2019s testimony that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:00 a.m., the Lima Police Department was dispatched to 234 North Main Street in Lima, Ohio for a call of a suspicious vehicle sitting in\nthe parking lot. It is not disputed that the Appellant exited his vehicle when officers arrived, and when Kunkleman approached him, Appellant turned back and leaned into the car on the driver\u2019s side. It is further undisputed that officers could smell the smell of raw marijuana at this time and that officers grabbed Appellant and pulled him away from the vehicle for their safety.\n\n{\u00b665} There is no dispute that the Appellant, when ordered to put his hands up in the air, disregarded the officer\u2019s commands, which led to him being detained. A pat down of Appellant produced a large sum of money and marijuana, which led to his arrest and the subsequent search of the vehicle, which produced a large amount of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, digital scales, and Appellant\u2019s billfold. With no testimony or evidence produced at trial to cast doubt upon this version of events, Appellant cannot contradict the elements of possession of cocaine and possession of heroin as established by the State in case number CR 2014 0118.\n\n{\u00b666} In regards to case number CR 2015 0361, the State\u2019s uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that on January 17, 2015, after receiving an anonymous tip and surveilling the premises, law enforcement entered 1222 Catalpa Street after repeatedly requesting that Appellant come to the front door. Once inside the premises, and while conducting a protective sweep of the home, officers viewed a marijuana grow tent in plain view. Based on the information collected, officers obtained a search warrant and searched the premises in its entirety. During the\nsearch, officers located credit cards, mail, and other personal effects bearing Appellant\u2019s name.\n\n{\u00b667} While Appellant contends that no witness had personal knowledge that he occupied the premises, the evidence indicates otherwise. Specifically, many of Appellant\u2019s personal effects were found within the residence, which is indicative of occupation. Accordingly, we find that the uncontradicted evidence supports that Appellant was occupying the residence on January 17, 2015.\n\nImpeached Witness\n\n{\u00b668} A review of the record reveals that no witness for the State was impeached in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361.\n\nReliability of Evidence\n\n{\u00b669} With respect to case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant attempts to discredit the reliability of the testimony and evidence produced at trial, because \u201cnot one single witness [***] actually had personal knowledge of Appellant allegedly occupying the premises testified [to] at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). Appellant further classifies all of the testimony produced regarding occupation of the premises as \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\n{\u00b670} However, we find that the State produced competent and credible evidence that Appellant was occupying 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio at the time the officers conducted their raid. Specifically, officers testified that they\nobserved Appellant leave the back of the duplex in an attempt to flee, and then run back inside once he saw that officers had the duplex surrounded. Furthermore, the evidence established that officers personally observed Appellant leave out of the back of the residence prior to it being breached. With eyewitness testimony confirming that Appellant was, in fact, inside the residence, we find no merit in Appellant\u2019s argument in regards to reliability.\n\n**Self-Serving Testimony**\n\n{\u00b671} The record reveals that the trial court did not characterize any witness\u2019s testimony as self-serving in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, on review, we do not find any indicia of self-serving testimony in either case and Appellant does not argue that testimony was self-serving on appeal.\n\n**Vague, Uncertain, Conflicting, or Fragmentary Evidence**\n\n{\u00b672} In case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant points to the evidence produced at the suppression hearing to cast into doubt officers\u2019 testimony at trial. Specifically, Appellant argues that the officers, when testifying at the suppression hearing, described a \u201cmuch more leisurely encounter at the suppression hearing than they did at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). However, Appellant fails to develop this argument and further fails to demonstrate how this \u201cconflict\u201d in testimonies between the suppression hearing and trial creates a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting\nreversal. Even should Appellant establish that a true \u201cconflict\u201d exists in the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and the trial, and that such issue was properly before this Court, we find that the record contains competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. *Phelps v. Horn\u2019s Crop Serv. Ctr.*, 3rd Dist. Wyandot No. 16-89-8, 1990 WL 157282, * 2 (holding that the choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b673} Accordingly, we find that the weight of the evidence supports Appellant\u2019s convictions. We further find that the jury did not lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting Appellant of possession of cocaine and heroin in case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n**Appellant\u2019s Third Assignment of Error**\n\n{\u00b674} In his third assignment of error, Appellant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective, in part, because trial counsel failed to object to hearsay statements during trial. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n{\u00b675} \u201c\u2018When a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that the counsel\u2019s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d State v. Sanders, 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151, 2002-Ohio-350, 761 N.E.2d 18 quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). Additionally, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d Id., at 694. See also, State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 137, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).\n\n{\u00b676} In analyzing a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, this court\u2019s scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential, with a \u201c\u2018strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019\u201d Bradley, supra, at 142, quoting Strickland, supra, at 687-88. \u201cCounsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d Id.\n\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b677} At the outset, we note that Appellant, during the course of the proceedings below, had five (5) different attorneys represent him. Interestingly, Appellant does not specify which trial counsel was ineffective. However, it appears from this assignment that Appellant questions the effectiveness of his trial counsel.\nAppellant initially argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because trial counsel failed to object to any of the hearsay regarding Appellant residing in the residence during the raid by police officers, as charged in case number CR 2015 0361. However, we note that the failure to make objections is not alone enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Conway*, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 103. *See also, State v. Holloway*, 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831 (1988) (failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); *State v. Gumm*, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 428, 1995-Ohio-24, 653 N.E.2d 253 holding modified by *State v. Wogenstahl*, 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 1996-Ohio-219, 662 N.E.2d 311 (the failure to make objections does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel *per se*, as that failure may be justified as a tactical decision).\n\nNext, Appellant argues that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective because trial counsel did not *voir dire* Sergeant Dana Sutherland (\u201cSutherland\u201d), the State\u2019s marijuana expert witness. This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, the record reveals, and the Appellant concedes, that trial counsel objected to the expert being certified as an expert witness, and the trial court overruled the objection. (*See, Trial Tr., Vol. II, at 286*). And second, the record reveals that the Appellant\u2019s concerns with Sutherland\u2019s qualifications to testify as an expert were addressed by the trial court prior to trial. (*Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol.*\nI, at 11). Given the trial court\u2019s rulings, we do not find that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation under the facts presented.\n\nLastly, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective because his trial counsel failed to file a proper motion to sever the counts at the appropriate time during trial. However, the record is clear, and the Appellant concedes, that objections to the State\u2019s motions to consolidate were made and a motion to sever was filed prior to trial. (See, CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 139; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 48). Despite Appellant\u2019s objections and motion, the trial court found that the charges were of similar character and part of a common scheme or course of criminal conduct, then consolidated the cases and joined them for purposes of trial. (CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 163; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 82). Thus, because the trial court had already ruled on Appellant\u2019s motion to sever, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that a subsequent trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness by failing to file an additional motion to sever, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fourth Assignment of Error\n\nIn his fourth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss his cases based upon a speedy trial violation. Specifically, Appellant argues that the continuance granted at the request of the\nState beyond the February 21, 2017 trial date was unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b682 \u201cOur standard of review upon an appeal raising a speedy trial issue is to count the expired days as directed by R.C. 2945.71, et seq.\u201d State v. King, 3rd Dist. Marion No. 9-06-18, 2007-Ohio-335, \u00b6 30. See also, State v. DePue, 96 Ohio App.3d 513, 516, 645 N.E.2d 745 (4th Dist.1994). \u201cIf any ambiguity exists, we construe the record in favor of the accused.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b683 The applicable statutory speedy trial provision, R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), provides that a person charged with a felony shall be brought to trial within two hundred and seventy (270) days after the person\u2019s arrest. R.C. 2945.71(C)(2). In computing time under division (C)(2), \u201ceach day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charges shall be counted as three days.\u201d R.C. 2945.71(E).\n\n\u00b684 Further, R.C. 2945.73(B) provides:\n\nUpon motion made at or prior to the commencement of trial, a person charged with an offense shall be discharged if he is not brought to trial within the time required by sections 2945.71 and 2945.72 of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nIN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\nTHIRD APPELLATE DISTRICT\nALLEN COUNTY\n\nSTATE OF OHIO,\n\nPLAINTIFF-APPELLEE,\n\nv.\n\nRAYLON A.

For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n\nFactual Background - Case Number CR 2014 0118\n\n{\u00b62} On March 14, 2014, (then) Lima Police Department Patrolman Trent Kunkleman (\u201cKunkleman\u201d) was on third shift patrol in the city of Lima, Ohio. (Doc. No. 146). Around 3:20 a.m., Kunkleman responded to a police dispatch to a\ndowntown parking lot in Lima in regards to a suspicious silver vehicle. (Id.). Upon arriving at the parking lot, Kunkleman located a grey Hyundai. (Id.). Kunkleman testified that the Hyundai was the only vehicle in the parking lot, so he shined his spotlight into the vehicle, identifying the Appellant as its sole occupant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b63} A second Lima police officer, Sergeant Hillard (\u201cHillard\u201d), arrived at the parking lot shortly after Kunkleman. (Id.). Hillard testified that he received a police dispatch that a suspicious vehicle\u2019s car alarm was going off\\(^1\\) in the Lima parking lot in question. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b64} After Hillard arrived, Kunkleman walked up to the Appellant\u2019s vehicle in an attempt to engage Appellant in conversation, but Appellant did not respond. (Id.). Instead, Appellant exited his vehicle, turned his back to Kunkleman, and then leaned back into the vehicle. (Id.). Kunkleman testified that he was unable to see Appellant\u2019s hands, but was able to smell an overwhelming odor of raw marijuana. (Id.). At this point, Kunkleman became alarmed that Appellant might be reaching into his vehicle for a weapon, so he pulled Appellant away from the car. (Id.). Officers Kunkleman and Hillard testified that they saw the Appellant placing his hand down into his pants pocket at this point. (Id.). Two additional law enforcement officers, who had also arrived on the scene, then grabbed Appellant and patted him down for officer safety. (Id.). During the pat down, officers testified that there was\n\n\\(^1\\) Dash-cam video entered into evidence confirms that a car alarm was going off. (Id.; Mot. To Suppress Hearing, 06/30/2016, State\u2019s Ex. 2).\na strong odor of marijuana coming from Appellant. (Id.). Officers testified that they felt a \u201cbaggie\u201d in Appellant\u2019s left pocket. (Id.). Officers removed the baggie, which contained drugs. (Id.). Appellant was then arrested. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b65} After Appellant\u2019s arrest, Kunkleman returned to the vehicle to investigate the odor of marijuana coming from it. (Id.). Hillard, who was also at the vehicle at this time, searched the vehicle, and found a paper sack under the driver\u2019s seat that contained a large amount of cocaine. (Id.). In addition to the cocaine, officers located heroin, marijuana, ecstasy pills, a digital scale, and a ledger in the vehicle. (Id.).\n\nProcedural Background - Case Number CR 2014 0118\n\n{\u00b66} On May 15, 2014, the Allen County Grand Jury indicted Appellant on three (3) counts, including: Count One, possession of drugs (cocaine) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(4)(e), a first degree felony; Count Two, possession of drugs (heroin) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(6)(b), a fourth degree felony; and Count Three, aggravated possession of drugs (ecstasy) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(1)(a), a fifth degree felony. (Doc. No. 3).\n\n{\u00b67} Ultimately, Appellant was arraigned in the Allen County Common Pleas Court on January 23, 2015.\u00b2 (Doc. No. 13). Appellant\u2019s recognizance bond\n\n\u00b2 The record reveals a significant gap in time between Appellant\u2019s indictment and his arraignment. However, the record also reveals that Appellant made his initial appearance in the Lima Municipal Court on March 21, 2014, wherein he posted a $500,000 cash surety bond and was released. (Doc. No. 2).\nwas set at $100,000 cash or surety, which Appellant posted. (Doc. No. 11). However, on October 1, 2015, the trial court ordered that Appellant\u2019s bond be forfeited because he failed to appear for a pre-trial conference. (Doc. No. 32). A bench warrant for Appellant\u2019s arrest was then issued by the trial court. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b68} On September 17, 2015, Appellant was indicted on new charges in Allen County.3\n\n{\u00b69} On February 19, 2016, Appellant was apprehended by the US Marshall\u2019s Service in Detroit, Michigan. (Doc. No. 34). After returning to Allen County, the trial court ordered that the Appellant be held in the Allen County Jail, without bond, until further order of the Court. (Doc. No. 38). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was then scheduled for April 19, 2016. (Doc. No. 69).\n\n{\u00b610} On April 12, 2016, Appellant filed a motion to suppress in the trial court. (Doc. No. 87). On May 5, 2016, Appellant executed a waiver of his right to speedy trial. (Doc. No. 115).\n\n{\u00b611} A hearing on the motion to suppress occurred on June 30, 2016. (Doc. No. 138). And, on July 21, 2016, the trial court issued its ruling overruling Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. (Doc. No. 146).\n\n{\u00b612} On July 7, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate Appellant\u2019s cases. (Doc. No. 137). Appellant filed his oppositions to the State\u2019s motion to\n\n---\n\n3 This is Case Number CR 2015 0361, which we will address infra.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nconsolidate on July 15, 2016 and on August 22, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 139; 159). On August 26, 2016 the trial court consolidated the cases. (Doc. No. 163).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b638} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 147). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 150).\nOn July 24, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel.\u201d (Doc. No. 173). On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed an additional \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d as well as a \u201cmotion for continuance of the trial date,\u201d \u201cmotion for specific discovery,\u201d and \u201cmotion to suppress evidence.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 180; 181; 182; 183). Appellant, through his various motions, alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena witnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The Appellant further alleged that the State had failed to provide specific discovery. (Doc. No. 182). On August 1, 2017, the trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions, finding that the Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the case. (Doc. No. 186).\n\nAppellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 194). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2015 0361, the State made an oral motion to amend Count Three in the indictment, possession of marijuana, a felony of the third degree, to possession of marijuana, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court granted. (Id.) The Appellant did not oppose the amendment. (Id.).\n\nAppellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding Appellant guilty of all charges. (Id.). Further, Appellant was found guilty of all specifications except for the specification for property (electronics) contained in Count One and Count Two. (Id.).\nAppellant was sentenced on September 14, 2017 in the trial court and was ordered to serve a prison term of: seven (7) years in prison under Count One; seven (7) years in prison under Count Two; twelve (12) months in prison under Count Three; thirty (30) months in prison under Count Four; and thirty-six (36) months in prison under Count Five. (Doc. No. 200). The trial court further ordered that all counts be served consecutively to each other and consecutively to the prison sentence imposed in case number CR 2014 0118. (Id.). With regards to the specifications, the firearms were ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; the money was ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; and the electronics (subject to the specification in Counts Three and Four) were ordered forfeited to the WCOCTF. (Id.). Appellant\u2019s prison sentences totaled twenty-eight (28) and a half years. (Id.).\n\nFrom the judgments in case number CR 2014 0118 and case number CR 2015 0361 Appellant timely appeals, and presents the following assignments of error for our review:\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. I\n\nAPPELLANTS [SIC] CONVICTIONS ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO.

VIII\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, TO THE PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT, BY DENYING APPELLANTS [SIC] MOTION TO SUPPRESS ALL EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN CASE NUMBER 0361.\nFor ease of discussion, we elect to address interrelated assignments together.\n\n**Appellant\u2019s First Assignment of Error**\n\nIn his first assignment of error, Appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence in both case number CR 2014 0118 and CR 2015 0361 to sustain his convictions. For the reasons outlined below, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n\u201cWhether there is legally sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict is a question of law.\u201d *State v. Lyle*, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-14-41, 2015-Ohio-1181, \u00b6 8 citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 1997-Ohio-52, 678 N.E.2d 541. Sufficiency is a test of adequacy. *Id.* Under a challenge alleging insufficient evidence, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *Id.* quoting *State v. Leonard*, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 77.\n\n**Analysis \u2013 Case Number CR 2014 0118**\n\nIn case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant was found guilty in Count I of possession of drugs (cocaine) and guilty in Count II of possession of drugs (heroin), both in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which states:\n(A) No person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2925.11(A).\n\n{\u00b648} On appeal, Appellant argues that the State failed to produce any evidence proving that Appellant owned or possessed the contents (i.e. heroin and cocaine) of the motor vehicle in question. \u201c\u2018Possess\u2019 or \u2018possession\u2019 means having control over a thing or substance, but may not be inferred solely from mere access to the thing or substance through ownership or occupation of the premises upon which the thing or substance is found.\u201d R.C. 2925.01(K). \u201c\u2018The issue of whether a person charged with drug possession knowingly possessed a controlled substance is to be determined from all the attendant facts and circumstances available.\u2019\u201d State v. Frye, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-17-30, 2018-Ohio-894, \u00b6 50 quoting State v. Brooks, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-11-11, 2012-Ohio-5235, \u00b6 45. See also, State v. Teamer, 82 Ohio St.3d 490, 492, 1998-Ohio-193, 696 N.E.2d 1049 (1998).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b612} On July 7, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate Appellant\u2019s cases. (Doc. No. 137). Appellant filed his oppositions to the State\u2019s motion to\n\n---\n\n3 This is Case Number CR 2015 0361, which we will address infra.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nconsolidate on July 15, 2016 and on August 22, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 139; 159). On August 26, 2016 the trial court consolidated the cases. (Doc. No. 163).\n\n{\u00b613} On August 3, 2016, Appellant signed and filed a second waiver of his speedy trial rights in the trial court. (Doc. No. 155). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was rescheduled for December 20, 2016. (Doc. No. 169). On November 28, 2016, Appellant, through counsel, filed a motion to continue. (Doc. No. 171). Specifically, Appellant\u2019s trial counsel represented to the court that he had encountered difficulty contacting potential defense witnesses in preparation for trial. (Id.). A hearing was held on Appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance on November 30, 2016. (Doc. No. 174). At the hearing, Appellant refused to further waive his right to a speedy trial beyond the January 1, 2017 date set forth in Appellant\u2019s previous waiver. (Id. at 2). Despite Appellant\u2019s refusal, the trial court found that a sixty (60) day continuance was necessary and not unreasonable under the circumstances. (Id. at 8). Appellant\u2019s trial was set for February 21, 2017. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b614} On February 3, 2017, the State filed its motion for a continuance, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in State v. Gonzales, requiring that the State must prove the actual weight of a drug in question, (excluding any filler materials) to meet the statutory weight requirement. (Doc. No. 180). Stated better, based on the change in the prosecution of drug offenses under State v. Gonzales, the State requested additional time to determine the actual weight of the cocaine\npossessed by Appellant. Appellant objected to the State\u2019s motion for continuance. (Doc. No. 181). The trial court, finding that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom in drug prosecutions, granted the State\u2019s motion. (Doc. No. 182). Ultimately, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017. (Doc. No. 184).\n\n{\u00b615} On April 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss in the trial court. (Doc. No. 202). Specifically, Appellant requested that his cases be dismissed, pursuant to R.C. 2945.73(B) and R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), because he had been held in custody for 276 days, which exceeded the statutorily permissible 270 days. (Id.). The State responded to Appellant\u2019s motion, arguing that the time involving its continuance (of February 3, 2017) should not count against it, because that continuance was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d under the circumstances of the case. (Doc. No. 205). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motion on April 19, 2017. (Doc. No. 206).\n\n{\u00b616} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 211). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 214).\n\n{\u00b617} On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d and a \u201cmotion for continuance of trial date.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 237; 238). Appellant alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nwitnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions on August 1, 2017, finding that Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the cases. (Doc. No. 239).\n\n\u00b618 Appellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 243). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2014 0118, the State made an oral motion to amend Count One in the indictment, possession of cocaine, a felony of the first degree, to possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree. (Id.). The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion. (Id.) Further, the State made an oral motion to dismiss Count Three in the indictment, aggravated possession of drugs, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court also granted. (Id.). The Appellant did not object to either motion.\n\n\u00b619 Appellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding the Appellant guilty of Count I, possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree and of Count II, possession of heroin, a felony of the first degree. (Id.).\n\n\u00b620 Ultimately, and in case number CR 2014 0118, the trial court sentenced the Appellant to consecutive prison terms of six (6) years (Count I) and twelve (12) months (Count II) on September 14, 2017. (Doc. No. 244).\nFactual Background - Case Number 2015 CR 0361\n\n{\u00b621} On January 12 or 13, 2015, investigators with the West Central Ohio Criminal Task Force (\u201cWCOCTF\u201d) commenced an investigation to locate the Appellant, due to Appellant\u2019s outstanding warrants. (Doc. No. 100). On January 12, 2015, the Lima Police Department received an anonymous telephone call\\(^4\\) that Appellant was staying at 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio. (Id.). The caller further advised officers that Appellant was not a tenant on the lease at that location. (Id.). Sgt. Charles Godfrey, (\u201cGodfrey\u201d) then a supervisor at WCOCTF, attempted to contact the anonymous caller to verify the information provided, but was unable to do so. (Id.). So, based on the information provided (by the anonymous caller), Godfrey set up an undercover operation on January 13, 2015 to monitor the 1222 Catalpa Street residence in an attempt to locate Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b622} On January 17, 2015, Godfrey observed a Chrysler 300 parked at the Catalpa Street residence. (Id.). Later that day, an individual in a hooded sweatshirt left the residence in that vehicle. (Id.). Since the vehicle\u2019s windows were heavily tinted, and because Godfrey could not see inside it, Godfrey arranged for the Ohio State Highway Patrol to stop the vehicle for a tinted windows violation. (Id.). When the Chrysler was stopped a person identified as \u201cWatkins\u201d was located as a passenger in the vehicle. (Id.). Watkins told law enforcement officials that he and\n\n\\(^4\\) The anonymous caller was later identified as the landlord of the duplex wherein Appellant was staying. (See, Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 10/20/2016 Tr. at 7).\nthe driver had been visiting \u201cRay\u201d at 1222 Catalpa Street. (Id.). When shown a picture of Appellant, Watkins confirmed that \u201cRay\u201d was the Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b623} With that information (from Watkins), Godfrey returned to 1222 Catalpa Street, believing that Appellant was present in the residence. (Id.). And, after verifying that Appellant still had active outstanding warrants, Godfrey went to the residence\u2019s front door while law enforcement set up a perimeter around the house. (Id.). Godfrey knocked on the door, identified that he was a police officer, and that he had a warrant for Appellant\u2019s arrest. (Id.). Godfrey further advised that if the door wasn\u2019t opened it would be knocked down. (Id.)."}
{"Index": "084-Davis", "allegation": "APPELLANT RECEIVED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF TRIAL COUNSEL IN VIOLATION OF HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IN THAT REGARD.", "evidence": "{\u00b673} Accordingly, we find that the weight of the evidence supports Appellant\u2019s convictions. We further find that the jury did not lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting Appellant of possession of cocaine and heroin in case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n**Appellant\u2019s Third Assignment of Error**\n\n{\u00b674} In his third assignment of error, Appellant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective, in part, because trial counsel failed to object to hearsay statements during trial. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n{\u00b675} \u201c\u2018When a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that the counsel\u2019s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d State v. Sanders, 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151, 2002-Ohio-350, 761 N.E.2d 18 quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). Additionally, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d Id., at 694. See also, State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 137, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).\n\n{\u00b676} In analyzing a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, this court\u2019s scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential, with a \u201c\u2018strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019\u201d Bradley, supra, at 142, quoting Strickland, supra, at 687-88. \u201cCounsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d Id.\n\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b677} At the outset, we note that Appellant, during the course of the proceedings below, had five (5) different attorneys represent him. Interestingly, Appellant does not specify which trial counsel was ineffective. However, it appears from this assignment that Appellant questions the effectiveness of his trial counsel.\nAppellant initially argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because trial counsel failed to object to any of the hearsay regarding Appellant residing in the residence during the raid by police officers, as charged in case number CR 2015 0361. However, we note that the failure to make objections is not alone enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Conway*, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 103. *See also, State v. Holloway*, 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831 (1988) (failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); *State v. Gumm*, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 428, 1995-Ohio-24, 653 N.E.2d 253 holding modified by *State v. Wogenstahl*, 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 1996-Ohio-219, 662 N.E.2d 311 (the failure to make objections does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel *per se*, as that failure may be justified as a tactical decision).\n\nNext, Appellant argues that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective because trial counsel did not *voir dire* Sergeant Dana Sutherland (\u201cSutherland\u201d), the State\u2019s marijuana expert witness. This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, the record reveals, and the Appellant concedes, that trial counsel objected to the expert being certified as an expert witness, and the trial court overruled the objection. (*See, Trial Tr., Vol. II, at 286*). And second, the record reveals that the Appellant\u2019s concerns with Sutherland\u2019s qualifications to testify as an expert were addressed by the trial court prior to trial. (*Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol.*\nI, at 11). Given the trial court\u2019s rulings, we do not find that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation under the facts presented.\n\nLastly, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective because his trial counsel failed to file a proper motion to sever the counts at the appropriate time during trial. However, the record is clear, and the Appellant concedes, that objections to the State\u2019s motions to consolidate were made and a motion to sever was filed prior to trial. (See, CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 139; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 48). Despite Appellant\u2019s objections and motion, the trial court found that the charges were of similar character and part of a common scheme or course of criminal conduct, then consolidated the cases and joined them for purposes of trial. (CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 163; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 82). Thus, because the trial court had already ruled on Appellant\u2019s motion to sever, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that a subsequent trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness by failing to file an additional motion to sever, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fourth Assignment of Error\n\nIn his fourth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss his cases based upon a speedy trial violation. Specifically, Appellant argues that the continuance granted at the request of the\nState beyond the February 21, 2017 trial date was unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b682 \u201cOur standard of review upon an appeal raising a speedy trial issue is to count the expired days as directed by R.C. 2945.71, et seq.\u201d State v. King, 3rd Dist. Marion No. 9-06-18, 2007-Ohio-335, \u00b6 30. See also, State v. DePue, 96 Ohio App.3d 513, 516, 645 N.E.2d 745 (4th Dist.1994). \u201cIf any ambiguity exists, we construe the record in favor of the accused.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b683 The applicable statutory speedy trial provision, R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), provides that a person charged with a felony shall be brought to trial within two hundred and seventy (270) days after the person\u2019s arrest. R.C. 2945.71(C)(2). In computing time under division (C)(2), \u201ceach day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charges shall be counted as three days.\u201d R.C. 2945.71(E).\n\n\u00b684 Further, R.C. 2945.73(B) provides:\n\nUpon motion made at or prior to the commencement of trial, a person charged with an offense shall be discharged if he is not brought to trial within the time required by sections 2945.71 and 2945.72 of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b612} On July 7, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate Appellant\u2019s cases. (Doc. No. 137). Appellant filed his oppositions to the State\u2019s motion to\n\n---\n\n3 This is Case Number CR 2015 0361, which we will address infra.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nconsolidate on July 15, 2016 and on August 22, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 139; 159). On August 26, 2016 the trial court consolidated the cases. (Doc. No. 163).\n\n{\u00b613} On August 3, 2016, Appellant signed and filed a second waiver of his speedy trial rights in the trial court. (Doc. No. 155). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was rescheduled for December 20, 2016. (Doc. No. 169). On November 28, 2016, Appellant, through counsel, filed a motion to continue. (Doc. No. 171). Specifically, Appellant\u2019s trial counsel represented to the court that he had encountered difficulty contacting potential defense witnesses in preparation for trial. (Id.). A hearing was held on Appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance on November 30, 2016. (Doc. No. 174). At the hearing, Appellant refused to further waive his right to a speedy trial beyond the January 1, 2017 date set forth in Appellant\u2019s previous waiver. (Id. at 2). Despite Appellant\u2019s refusal, the trial court found that a sixty (60) day continuance was necessary and not unreasonable under the circumstances. (Id. at 8). Appellant\u2019s trial was set for February 21, 2017. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b614} On February 3, 2017, the State filed its motion for a continuance, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in State v. Gonzales, requiring that the State must prove the actual weight of a drug in question, (excluding any filler materials) to meet the statutory weight requirement. (Doc. No. 180). Stated better, based on the change in the prosecution of drug offenses under State v. Gonzales, the State requested additional time to determine the actual weight of the cocaine\npossessed by Appellant. Appellant objected to the State\u2019s motion for continuance. (Doc. No. 181). The trial court, finding that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom in drug prosecutions, granted the State\u2019s motion. (Doc. No. 182). Ultimately, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017. (Doc. No. 184).\n\n{\u00b615} On April 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss in the trial court. (Doc. No. 202). Specifically, Appellant requested that his cases be dismissed, pursuant to R.C. 2945.73(B) and R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), because he had been held in custody for 276 days, which exceeded the statutorily permissible 270 days. (Id.). The State responded to Appellant\u2019s motion, arguing that the time involving its continuance (of February 3, 2017) should not count against it, because that continuance was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d under the circumstances of the case. (Doc. No. 205). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motion on April 19, 2017. (Doc. No. 206).\n\n{\u00b616} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 211). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 214).\n\n{\u00b617} On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d and a \u201cmotion for continuance of trial date.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 237; 238). Appellant alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nwitnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions on August 1, 2017, finding that Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the cases. (Doc. No. 239).\n\n\u00b618 Appellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 243). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2014 0118, the State made an oral motion to amend Count One in the indictment, possession of cocaine, a felony of the first degree, to possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree. (Id.). The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion. (Id.) Further, the State made an oral motion to dismiss Count Three in the indictment, aggravated possession of drugs, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court also granted. (Id.). The Appellant did not object to either motion.\n\n\u00b619 Appellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding the Appellant guilty of Count I, possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree and of Count II, possession of heroin, a felony of the first degree. (Id.).\n\n\u00b620 Ultimately, and in case number CR 2014 0118, the trial court sentenced the Appellant to consecutive prison terms of six (6) years (Count I) and twelve (12) months (Count II) on September 14, 2017. (Doc. No. 244).\nFactual Background - Case Number 2015 CR 0361\n\n{\u00b621} On January 12 or 13, 2015, investigators with the West Central Ohio Criminal Task Force (\u201cWCOCTF\u201d) commenced an investigation to locate the Appellant, due to Appellant\u2019s outstanding warrants. (Doc. No. 100). On January 12, 2015, the Lima Police Department received an anonymous telephone call\\(^4\\) that Appellant was staying at 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio. (Id.). The caller further advised officers that Appellant was not a tenant on the lease at that location. (Id.). Sgt. Charles Godfrey, (\u201cGodfrey\u201d) then a supervisor at WCOCTF, attempted to contact the anonymous caller to verify the information provided, but was unable to do so. (Id.). So, based on the information provided (by the anonymous caller), Godfrey set up an undercover operation on January 13, 2015 to monitor the 1222 Catalpa Street residence in an attempt to locate Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b622} On January 17, 2015, Godfrey observed a Chrysler 300 parked at the Catalpa Street residence. (Id.). Later that day, an individual in a hooded sweatshirt left the residence in that vehicle. (Id.). Since the vehicle\u2019s windows were heavily tinted, and because Godfrey could not see inside it, Godfrey arranged for the Ohio State Highway Patrol to stop the vehicle for a tinted windows violation. (Id.). When the Chrysler was stopped a person identified as \u201cWatkins\u201d was located as a passenger in the vehicle. (Id.). Watkins told law enforcement officials that he and\n\n\\(^4\\) The anonymous caller was later identified as the landlord of the duplex wherein Appellant was staying. (See, Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 10/20/2016 Tr. at 7).\nthe driver had been visiting \u201cRay\u201d at 1222 Catalpa Street. (Id.). When shown a picture of Appellant, Watkins confirmed that \u201cRay\u201d was the Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b623} With that information (from Watkins), Godfrey returned to 1222 Catalpa Street, believing that Appellant was present in the residence. (Id.). And, after verifying that Appellant still had active outstanding warrants, Godfrey went to the residence\u2019s front door while law enforcement set up a perimeter around the house. (Id.). Godfrey knocked on the door, identified that he was a police officer, and that he had a warrant for Appellant\u2019s arrest. (Id.). Godfrey further advised that if the door wasn\u2019t opened it would be knocked down. (Id.).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b638} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 147). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 150).\nOn July 24, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel.\u201d (Doc. No. 173). On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed an additional \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d as well as a \u201cmotion for continuance of the trial date,\u201d \u201cmotion for specific discovery,\u201d and \u201cmotion to suppress evidence.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 180; 181; 182; 183). Appellant, through his various motions, alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena witnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The Appellant further alleged that the State had failed to provide specific discovery. (Doc. No. 182). On August 1, 2017, the trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions, finding that the Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the case. (Doc. No. 186).\n\nAppellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 194). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2015 0361, the State made an oral motion to amend Count Three in the indictment, possession of marijuana, a felony of the third degree, to possession of marijuana, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court granted. (Id.) The Appellant did not oppose the amendment. (Id.).\n\nAppellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding Appellant guilty of all charges. (Id.). Further, Appellant was found guilty of all specifications except for the specification for property (electronics) contained in Count One and Count Two. (Id.).\nAppellant was sentenced on September 14, 2017 in the trial court and was ordered to serve a prison term of: seven (7) years in prison under Count One; seven (7) years in prison under Count Two; twelve (12) months in prison under Count Three; thirty (30) months in prison under Count Four; and thirty-six (36) months in prison under Count Five. (Doc. No. 200). The trial court further ordered that all counts be served consecutively to each other and consecutively to the prison sentence imposed in case number CR 2014 0118. (Id.). With regards to the specifications, the firearms were ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; the money was ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; and the electronics (subject to the specification in Counts Three and Four) were ordered forfeited to the WCOCTF. (Id.). Appellant\u2019s prison sentences totaled twenty-eight (28) and a half years. (Id.).\n\nFrom the judgments in case number CR 2014 0118 and case number CR 2015 0361 Appellant timely appeals, and presents the following assignments of error for our review:\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. I\n\nAPPELLANTS [SIC] CONVICTIONS ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. II\n\nAPPELLANTS [SIC] CONVICTIONS ARE AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO.

VIII\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, TO THE PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT, BY DENYING APPELLANTS [SIC] MOTION TO SUPPRESS ALL EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN CASE NUMBER 0361.\nFor ease of discussion, we elect to address interrelated assignments together.\n\n**Appellant\u2019s First Assignment of Error**\n\nIn his first assignment of error, Appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence in both case number CR 2014 0118 and CR 2015 0361 to sustain his convictions. For the reasons outlined below, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n\u201cWhether there is legally sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict is a question of law.\u201d *State v. Lyle*, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-14-41, 2015-Ohio-1181, \u00b6 8 citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 1997-Ohio-52, 678 N.E.2d 541. Sufficiency is a test of adequacy. *Id.* Under a challenge alleging insufficient evidence, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *Id.* quoting *State v. Leonard*, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 77.\n\n**Analysis \u2013 Case Number CR 2014 0118**\n\nIn case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant was found guilty in Count I of possession of drugs (cocaine) and guilty in Count II of possession of drugs (heroin), both in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which states:\n(A) No person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2925.11(A).\n\n{\u00b648} On appeal, Appellant argues that the State failed to produce any evidence proving that Appellant owned or possessed the contents (i.e. heroin and cocaine) of the motor vehicle in question. \u201c\u2018Possess\u2019 or \u2018possession\u2019 means having control over a thing or substance, but may not be inferred solely from mere access to the thing or substance through ownership or occupation of the premises upon which the thing or substance is found.\u201d R.C. 2925.01(K). \u201c\u2018The issue of whether a person charged with drug possession knowingly possessed a controlled substance is to be determined from all the attendant facts and circumstances available.\u2019\u201d State v. Frye, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-17-30, 2018-Ohio-894, \u00b6 50 quoting State v. Brooks, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-11-11, 2012-Ohio-5235, \u00b6 45. See also, State v. Teamer, 82 Ohio St.3d 490, 492, 1998-Ohio-193, 696 N.E.2d 1049 (1998).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n{\u00b685} In the instant matter, both the State and Appellant agree that Appellant\u2019s speedy trial rights were upheld throughout the proceedings up until Appellant\u2019s scheduled jury trial on February 21, 2017. However, at the request of the State, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017, outside of the Appellant\u2019s statutory speedy trial period. Thus, the question before us is not whether Appellant was brought to trial within the statutorily permitted time frame, but rather, was the speedy trial violation permissible under the circumstances of the case. We answer that question in the affirmative.\n\n{\u00b686} R.C. 2945.72, entitled \u201cextension of time for hearing or trial,\u201d allows for an extension of time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances. R.C. 2945.72(H) provides:\n\nThe time within which an accused must be brought to trial, or, in the case of felony, to preliminary hearing and trial, may be extended only by the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(H) The period of any continuance granted on the accused\u2019s own motion, and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused\u2019s own motion.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2945.72(H).\nThe resolution of this issue, therefore, depends upon whether the trial court\u2019s continuance was reasonable. \u201cDetermining the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of the continuance beyond the ninety-day stricture of R.C. 2945.71, invariably, \u2018depends on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u2019\u201d State v. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, \u00b6 10, quoting State v. Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988). \u201c\u2018In addition, precedent requires that such a continuance be necessary under the circumstances of the case.\u2019\u201d Id. quoting Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988) citing City of Aurora v. Patrick, 61 Ohio St.2d 107, 108-09, 399 N.E.2d 1220 (1980).\n\nOn February 3, 2017, the State requested a continuance of the trial date, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in State v. Gonzales. See, State v. Gonzales, 150 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-Ohio-8319, 81 N.E.3d 405, reconsideration granted, decision vacated, 150 Ohio St.3d 276, 2017-Ohio-777, 81 N.E.3d 419, reconsideration denied, 149 Ohio St.3d 1409, 2017-Ohio-2822, 74 N.E.3d 466. In Gonzales, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the offense level for possession of cocaine was determined only by the weight of the actual cocaine, not by the total weight of cocaine plus any filler. Id. at \u00b6 22. This opinion was inconsistent with prior case law on the same topic. Id. at \u00b6 51. Given the new purity requirements, the State requested a continuance to send Appellant\u2019s cocaine to a lab equipped to determine the weight of actual cocaine, separate from the filler weight.\nThe trial court, on February 9, 2017, granted the State\u2019s request for a continuance and set Appellant\u2019s jury trial for May 16, 2017. (Case number CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 182; case number CR 2015, Doc. No. 109). In granting the continuance, the trial court acknowledged that State v. Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom. Furthermore, the trial court relied on the Seventh District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in State v. High, wherein the Appellate court held that an extension request by the State for testing of evidence was reasonable. State v. High, 143 Ohio App.3d 232, 242, 2001-Ohio-3530, 757 N.E.2d 1176.\n\nWe find that the continuance was reasonable in light of the need for additional time to conduct testing (of the drugs in question) in accordance with Gonzales. While Appellant argues that the State took \u201ctoo long\u201d (after the Gonzales decision was announced) to request the continuance, we find that the State\u2019s request was made prior to the already scheduled jury trial.\n\nAppellant further argues that the continuance was unreasonable because the trial court focused on its schedule in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss. However, \u201cscheduling and docketing conflicts have been held to be reasonable grounds for extending an accused\u2019s trial date beyond the speedy trial limit date by both [the Appellate Court] and the Supreme Court of Ohio. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, \u00b6 11. See also, State v. Lee, 48 Ohio\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nSt.2d 208, 210, 357 N.E.2d 1095 (1976) (continuance due to \u201ccrowded docket & judge\u2019s conference\u201d was reasonable). Thus, we find that the continuance was reasonable, and therefore met the exception requirement listed in R.C. 2945.72(H).\n\n\u00b692 For the foregoing reasons, we find Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error not well taken and overrule the same.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fifth Assignment of Error\n\n\u00b693 In Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court was required to exclude Identification Officer Michael Carman\u2019s (\u201cCarman\u201d) expert testimony, because the State did not comply with Crim.R. 16(K). For the reasons that follow, we find that the trial court did not err in allowing the State\u2019s expert witness to testify.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b694 \u201cThe trial court has broad discretion over evidentiary rulings, and such rulings will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d State v. Workman, 3rd Dist. Van Wert No. 15-06-09, 171 Ohio App.3d 89, 2007-Ohio-1360, 869 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 10. See also, In re Sherman, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 05-04-47, 2005-Ohio-5888, \u00b6 27. An \u201c\u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 implies that the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably.\u201d Id. quoting Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). \u201cWhen applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, a reviewing court may not simply substitute its judgment for\nthat of the trial court. *Dindal v. Dindal*, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-09-06, 2009-Ohio-3528, \u00b6 6 citing *Blakemore*, supra.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n{\u00b695} Appellant alleges that the State violated Crim.R. 16(K) when it failed to provide an expert witness\u2019 report prior to the start of Appellant\u2019s jury trial.

On appeal, Appellant asserts, in each case, that: 1) his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence; 2) his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence; 3) he received ineffective assistance of counsel; 4) the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss; 5) the trial court erred by permitting appellee to present the testimony of an expert witness who had not provided the defense with a report; 6) the trial court erred by consolidating his two cases for trials; and 7), 8) the trial court erred by denying Appellant\u2019s motions to suppress evidence in each case. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n\nFactual Background - Case Number CR 2014 0118\n\n{\u00b62} On March 14, 2014, (then) Lima Police Department Patrolman Trent Kunkleman (\u201cKunkleman\u201d) was on third shift patrol in the city of Lima, Ohio. (Doc. No. 146). Around 3:20 a.m., Kunkleman responded to a police dispatch to a\ndowntown parking lot in Lima in regards to a suspicious silver vehicle. (Id.). Upon arriving at the parking lot, Kunkleman located a grey Hyundai. (Id.). Kunkleman testified that the Hyundai was the only vehicle in the parking lot, so he shined his spotlight into the vehicle, identifying the Appellant as its sole occupant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b63} A second Lima police officer, Sergeant Hillard (\u201cHillard\u201d), arrived at the parking lot shortly after Kunkleman. (Id.). Hillard testified that he received a police dispatch that a suspicious vehicle\u2019s car alarm was going off\\(^1\\) in the Lima parking lot in question. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b64} After Hillard arrived, Kunkleman walked up to the Appellant\u2019s vehicle in an attempt to engage Appellant in conversation, but Appellant did not respond. (Id.). Instead, Appellant exited his vehicle, turned his back to Kunkleman, and then leaned back into the vehicle. (Id.). Kunkleman testified that he was unable to see Appellant\u2019s hands, but was able to smell an overwhelming odor of raw marijuana. (Id.). At this point, Kunkleman became alarmed that Appellant might be reaching into his vehicle for a weapon, so he pulled Appellant away from the car. (Id.). Officers Kunkleman and Hillard testified that they saw the Appellant placing his hand down into his pants pocket at this point. (Id.). Two additional law enforcement officers, who had also arrived on the scene, then grabbed Appellant and patted him down for officer safety. (Id.). During the pat down, officers testified that there was\n\n\\(^1\\) Dash-cam video entered into evidence confirms that a car alarm was going off. (Id.; Mot. To Suppress Hearing, 06/30/2016, State\u2019s Ex. 2).\na strong odor of marijuana coming from Appellant. (Id.). Officers testified that they felt a \u201cbaggie\u201d in Appellant\u2019s left pocket. (Id.). Officers removed the baggie, which contained drugs. (Id.). Appellant was then arrested. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b65} After Appellant\u2019s arrest, Kunkleman returned to the vehicle to investigate the odor of marijuana coming from it. (Id.). Hillard, who was also at the vehicle at this time, searched the vehicle, and found a paper sack under the driver\u2019s seat that contained a large amount of cocaine. (Id.). In addition to the cocaine, officers located heroin, marijuana, ecstasy pills, a digital scale, and a ledger in the vehicle. (Id.).\n\nProcedural Background - Case Number CR 2014 0118\n\n{\u00b66} On May 15, 2014, the Allen County Grand Jury indicted Appellant on three (3) counts, including: Count One, possession of drugs (cocaine) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(4)(e), a first degree felony; Count Two, possession of drugs (heroin) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(6)(b), a fourth degree felony; and Count Three, aggravated possession of drugs (ecstasy) in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)&(C)(1)(a), a fifth degree felony. (Doc. No. 3).\n\n{\u00b67} Ultimately, Appellant was arraigned in the Allen County Common Pleas Court on January 23, 2015.\u00b2 (Doc. No. 13). Appellant\u2019s recognizance bond\n\n\u00b2 The record reveals a significant gap in time between Appellant\u2019s indictment and his arraignment. However, the record also reveals that Appellant made his initial appearance in the Lima Municipal Court on March 21, 2014, wherein he posted a $500,000 cash surety bond and was released. (Doc. No. 2).\nwas set at $100,000 cash or surety, which Appellant posted. (Doc. No. 11). However, on October 1, 2015, the trial court ordered that Appellant\u2019s bond be forfeited because he failed to appear for a pre-trial conference. (Doc. No. 32). A bench warrant for Appellant\u2019s arrest was then issued by the trial court. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b68} On September 17, 2015, Appellant was indicted on new charges in Allen County.3\n\n{\u00b69} On February 19, 2016, Appellant was apprehended by the US Marshall\u2019s Service in Detroit, Michigan. (Doc. No. 34). After returning to Allen County, the trial court ordered that the Appellant be held in the Allen County Jail, without bond, until further order of the Court. (Doc. No. 38). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was then scheduled for April 19, 2016. (Doc. No. 69).\n\n{\u00b610} On April 12, 2016, Appellant filed a motion to suppress in the trial court. (Doc. No. 87). On May 5, 2016, Appellant executed a waiver of his right to speedy trial. (Doc. No. 115).\n\n{\u00b611} A hearing on the motion to suppress occurred on June 30, 2016. (Doc. No. 138). And, on July 21, 2016, the trial court issued its ruling overruling Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. (Doc. No. 146).\n\n{\u00b612} On July 7, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate Appellant\u2019s cases. (Doc. No. 137). Appellant filed his oppositions to the State\u2019s motion to\n\n---\n\n3 This is Case Number CR 2015 0361, which we will address infra.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nconsolidate on July 15, 2016 and on August 22, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 139; 159). On August 26, 2016 the trial court consolidated the cases. (Doc. No. 163)."}
{"Index": "084-Davis", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE APPELLANTS [SIC] MOTION TO DISMISS THE CASE BASED UPON VIOLATION OF HIS RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL.", "evidence": "{\u00b612} On July 7, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate Appellant\u2019s cases. (Doc. No. 137). Appellant filed his oppositions to the State\u2019s motion to\n\n---\n\n3 This is Case Number CR 2015 0361, which we will address infra.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nconsolidate on July 15, 2016 and on August 22, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 139; 159). On August 26, 2016 the trial court consolidated the cases. (Doc. No. 163).\n\n{\u00b613} On August 3, 2016, Appellant signed and filed a second waiver of his speedy trial rights in the trial court. (Doc. No. 155). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was rescheduled for December 20, 2016. (Doc. No. 169). On November 28, 2016, Appellant, through counsel, filed a motion to continue. (Doc. No. 171). Specifically, Appellant\u2019s trial counsel represented to the court that he had encountered difficulty contacting potential defense witnesses in preparation for trial. (Id.). A hearing was held on Appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance on November 30, 2016. (Doc. No. 174). At the hearing, Appellant refused to further waive his right to a speedy trial beyond the January 1, 2017 date set forth in Appellant\u2019s previous waiver. (Id. at 2). Despite Appellant\u2019s refusal, the trial court found that a sixty (60) day continuance was necessary and not unreasonable under the circumstances. (Id. at 8). Appellant\u2019s trial was set for February 21, 2017. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b614} On February 3, 2017, the State filed its motion for a continuance, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in State v. Gonzales, requiring that the State must prove the actual weight of a drug in question, (excluding any filler materials) to meet the statutory weight requirement. (Doc. No. 180). Stated better, based on the change in the prosecution of drug offenses under State v. Gonzales, the State requested additional time to determine the actual weight of the cocaine\npossessed by Appellant. Appellant objected to the State\u2019s motion for continuance. (Doc. No. 181). The trial court, finding that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom in drug prosecutions, granted the State\u2019s motion. (Doc. No. 182). Ultimately, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017. (Doc. No. 184).\n\n{\u00b615} On April 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss in the trial court. (Doc. No. 202). Specifically, Appellant requested that his cases be dismissed, pursuant to R.C. 2945.73(B) and R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), because he had been held in custody for 276 days, which exceeded the statutorily permissible 270 days. (Id.). The State responded to Appellant\u2019s motion, arguing that the time involving its continuance (of February 3, 2017) should not count against it, because that continuance was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d under the circumstances of the case. (Doc. No. 205). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motion on April 19, 2017. (Doc. No. 206).\n\n{\u00b616} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 211). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 214).\n\n{\u00b617} On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d and a \u201cmotion for continuance of trial date.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 237; 238). Appellant alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nwitnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions on August 1, 2017, finding that Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the cases. (Doc. No. 239).\n\n\u00b618 Appellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 243). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2014 0118, the State made an oral motion to amend Count One in the indictment, possession of cocaine, a felony of the first degree, to possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree. (Id.). The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion. (Id.) Further, the State made an oral motion to dismiss Count Three in the indictment, aggravated possession of drugs, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court also granted. (Id.). The Appellant did not object to either motion.\n\n\u00b619 Appellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding the Appellant guilty of Count I, possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree and of Count II, possession of heroin, a felony of the first degree. (Id.).\n\n\u00b620 Ultimately, and in case number CR 2014 0118, the trial court sentenced the Appellant to consecutive prison terms of six (6) years (Count I) and twelve (12) months (Count II) on September 14, 2017. (Doc. No. 244).\nFactual Background - Case Number 2015 CR 0361\n\n{\u00b621} On January 12 or 13, 2015, investigators with the West Central Ohio Criminal Task Force (\u201cWCOCTF\u201d) commenced an investigation to locate the Appellant, due to Appellant\u2019s outstanding warrants. (Doc. No. 100). On January 12, 2015, the Lima Police Department received an anonymous telephone call\\(^4\\) that Appellant was staying at 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio. (Id.). The caller further advised officers that Appellant was not a tenant on the lease at that location. (Id.). Sgt. Charles Godfrey, (\u201cGodfrey\u201d) then a supervisor at WCOCTF, attempted to contact the anonymous caller to verify the information provided, but was unable to do so. (Id.). So, based on the information provided (by the anonymous caller), Godfrey set up an undercover operation on January 13, 2015 to monitor the 1222 Catalpa Street residence in an attempt to locate Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b622} On January 17, 2015, Godfrey observed a Chrysler 300 parked at the Catalpa Street residence. (Id.). Later that day, an individual in a hooded sweatshirt left the residence in that vehicle. (Id.). Since the vehicle\u2019s windows were heavily tinted, and because Godfrey could not see inside it, Godfrey arranged for the Ohio State Highway Patrol to stop the vehicle for a tinted windows violation. (Id.). When the Chrysler was stopped a person identified as \u201cWatkins\u201d was located as a passenger in the vehicle. (Id.). Watkins told law enforcement officials that he and\n\n\\(^4\\) The anonymous caller was later identified as the landlord of the duplex wherein Appellant was staying. (See, Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 10/20/2016 Tr. at 7).\nthe driver had been visiting \u201cRay\u201d at 1222 Catalpa Street. (Id.). When shown a picture of Appellant, Watkins confirmed that \u201cRay\u201d was the Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b623} With that information (from Watkins), Godfrey returned to 1222 Catalpa Street, believing that Appellant was present in the residence. (Id.). And, after verifying that Appellant still had active outstanding warrants, Godfrey went to the residence\u2019s front door while law enforcement set up a perimeter around the house. (Id.). Godfrey knocked on the door, identified that he was a police officer, and that he had a warrant for Appellant\u2019s arrest. (Id.). Godfrey further advised that if the door wasn\u2019t opened it would be knocked down. (Id.).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b638} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 147). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 150).\nOn July 24, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel.\u201d (Doc. No. 173). On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed an additional \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d as well as a \u201cmotion for continuance of the trial date,\u201d \u201cmotion for specific discovery,\u201d and \u201cmotion to suppress evidence.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 180; 181; 182; 183). Appellant, through his various motions, alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena witnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The Appellant further alleged that the State had failed to provide specific discovery. (Doc. No. 182). On August 1, 2017, the trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions, finding that the Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the case. (Doc. No. 186).\n\nAppellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 194). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2015 0361, the State made an oral motion to amend Count Three in the indictment, possession of marijuana, a felony of the third degree, to possession of marijuana, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court granted. (Id.) The Appellant did not oppose the amendment. (Id.).\n\nAppellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding Appellant guilty of all charges. (Id.). Further, Appellant was found guilty of all specifications except for the specification for property (electronics) contained in Count One and Count Two. (Id.).\nAppellant was sentenced on September 14, 2017 in the trial court and was ordered to serve a prison term of: seven (7) years in prison under Count One; seven (7) years in prison under Count Two; twelve (12) months in prison under Count Three; thirty (30) months in prison under Count Four; and thirty-six (36) months in prison under Count Five. (Doc. No. 200). The trial court further ordered that all counts be served consecutively to each other and consecutively to the prison sentence imposed in case number CR 2014 0118. (Id.). With regards to the specifications, the firearms were ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; the money was ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; and the electronics (subject to the specification in Counts Three and Four) were ordered forfeited to the WCOCTF. (Id.). Appellant\u2019s prison sentences totaled twenty-eight (28) and a half years. (Id.).\n\nFrom the judgments in case number CR 2014 0118 and case number CR 2015 0361 Appellant timely appeals, and presents the following assignments of error for our review:\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. I\n\nAPPELLANTS [SIC] CONVICTIONS ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO.

VIII\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, TO THE PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT, BY DENYING APPELLANTS [SIC] MOTION TO SUPPRESS ALL EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN CASE NUMBER 0361.\nFor ease of discussion, we elect to address interrelated assignments together.\n\n**Appellant\u2019s First Assignment of Error**\n\nIn his first assignment of error, Appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence in both case number CR 2014 0118 and CR 2015 0361 to sustain his convictions. For the reasons outlined below, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n\u201cWhether there is legally sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict is a question of law.\u201d *State v. Lyle*, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-14-41, 2015-Ohio-1181, \u00b6 8 citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 1997-Ohio-52, 678 N.E.2d 541. Sufficiency is a test of adequacy. *Id.* Under a challenge alleging insufficient evidence, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *Id.* quoting *State v. Leonard*, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 77.\n\n**Analysis \u2013 Case Number CR 2014 0118**\n\nIn case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant was found guilty in Count I of possession of drugs (cocaine) and guilty in Count II of possession of drugs (heroin), both in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which states:\n(A) No person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2925.11(A).\n\n{\u00b648} On appeal, Appellant argues that the State failed to produce any evidence proving that Appellant owned or possessed the contents (i.e. heroin and cocaine) of the motor vehicle in question. \u201c\u2018Possess\u2019 or \u2018possession\u2019 means having control over a thing or substance, but may not be inferred solely from mere access to the thing or substance through ownership or occupation of the premises upon which the thing or substance is found.\u201d R.C. 2925.01(K). \u201c\u2018The issue of whether a person charged with drug possession knowingly possessed a controlled substance is to be determined from all the attendant facts and circumstances available.\u2019\u201d State v. Frye, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-17-30, 2018-Ohio-894, \u00b6 50 quoting State v. Brooks, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-11-11, 2012-Ohio-5235, \u00b6 45. See also, State v. Teamer, 82 Ohio St.3d 490, 492, 1998-Ohio-193, 696 N.E.2d 1049 (1998).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n{\u00b685} In the instant matter, both the State and Appellant agree that Appellant\u2019s speedy trial rights were upheld throughout the proceedings up until Appellant\u2019s scheduled jury trial on February 21, 2017. However, at the request of the State, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017, outside of the Appellant\u2019s statutory speedy trial period. Thus, the question before us is not whether Appellant was brought to trial within the statutorily permitted time frame, but rather, was the speedy trial violation permissible under the circumstances of the case. We answer that question in the affirmative.\n\n{\u00b686} R.C. 2945.72, entitled \u201cextension of time for hearing or trial,\u201d allows for an extension of time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances. R.C. 2945.72(H) provides:\n\nThe time within which an accused must be brought to trial, or, in the case of felony, to preliminary hearing and trial, may be extended only by the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(H) The period of any continuance granted on the accused\u2019s own motion, and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused\u2019s own motion.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2945.72(H).\nThe resolution of this issue, therefore, depends upon whether the trial court\u2019s continuance was reasonable. \u201cDetermining the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of the continuance beyond the ninety-day stricture of R.C. 2945.71, invariably, \u2018depends on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u2019\u201d State v. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, \u00b6 10, quoting State v. Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988). \u201c\u2018In addition, precedent requires that such a continuance be necessary under the circumstances of the case.\u2019\u201d Id. quoting Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988) citing City of Aurora v. Patrick, 61 Ohio St.2d 107, 108-09, 399 N.E.2d 1220 (1980).\n\nOn February 3, 2017, the State requested a continuance of the trial date, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in State v. Gonzales. See, State v. Gonzales, 150 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-Ohio-8319, 81 N.E.3d 405, reconsideration granted, decision vacated, 150 Ohio St.3d 276, 2017-Ohio-777, 81 N.E.3d 419, reconsideration denied, 149 Ohio St.3d 1409, 2017-Ohio-2822, 74 N.E.3d 466. In Gonzales, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the offense level for possession of cocaine was determined only by the weight of the actual cocaine, not by the total weight of cocaine plus any filler. Id. at \u00b6 22. This opinion was inconsistent with prior case law on the same topic. Id. at \u00b6 51. Given the new purity requirements, the State requested a continuance to send Appellant\u2019s cocaine to a lab equipped to determine the weight of actual cocaine, separate from the filler weight.\nThe trial court, on February 9, 2017, granted the State\u2019s request for a continuance and set Appellant\u2019s jury trial for May 16, 2017. (Case number CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 182; case number CR 2015, Doc. No. 109). In granting the continuance, the trial court acknowledged that State v. Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom. Furthermore, the trial court relied on the Seventh District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in State v. High, wherein the Appellate court held that an extension request by the State for testing of evidence was reasonable. State v. High, 143 Ohio App.3d 232, 242, 2001-Ohio-3530, 757 N.E.2d 1176.\n\nWe find that the continuance was reasonable in light of the need for additional time to conduct testing (of the drugs in question) in accordance with Gonzales. While Appellant argues that the State took \u201ctoo long\u201d (after the Gonzales decision was announced) to request the continuance, we find that the State\u2019s request was made prior to the already scheduled jury trial.\n\nAppellant further argues that the continuance was unreasonable because the trial court focused on its schedule in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss. However, \u201cscheduling and docketing conflicts have been held to be reasonable grounds for extending an accused\u2019s trial date beyond the speedy trial limit date by both [the Appellate Court] and the Supreme Court of Ohio.

Thus, we find that the continuance was reasonable, and therefore met the exception requirement listed in R.C. 2945.72(H).\n\n\u00b692 For the foregoing reasons, we find Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error not well taken and overrule the same.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fifth Assignment of Error\n\n\u00b693 In Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court was required to exclude Identification Officer Michael Carman\u2019s (\u201cCarman\u201d) expert testimony, because the State did not comply with Crim.R. 16(K). For the reasons that follow, we find that the trial court did not err in allowing the State\u2019s expert witness to testify.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b694 \u201cThe trial court has broad discretion over evidentiary rulings, and such rulings will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d State v. Workman, 3rd Dist. Van Wert No. 15-06-09, 171 Ohio App.3d 89, 2007-Ohio-1360, 869 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 10. See also, In re Sherman, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 05-04-47, 2005-Ohio-5888, \u00b6 27. An \u201c\u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 implies that the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably.\u201d Id. quoting Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). \u201cWhen applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, a reviewing court may not simply substitute its judgment for\nthat of the trial court. *Dindal v. Dindal*, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-09-06, 2009-Ohio-3528, \u00b6 6 citing *Blakemore*, supra.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n{\u00b695} Appellant alleges that the State violated Crim.R. 16(K) when it failed to provide an expert witness\u2019 report prior to the start of Appellant\u2019s jury trial. Crim.R. 16(K) states:\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b673} Accordingly, we find that the weight of the evidence supports Appellant\u2019s convictions. We further find that the jury did not lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting Appellant of possession of cocaine and heroin in case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n**Appellant\u2019s Third Assignment of Error**\n\n{\u00b674} In his third assignment of error, Appellant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective, in part, because trial counsel failed to object to hearsay statements during trial. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n{\u00b675} \u201c\u2018When a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that the counsel\u2019s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d State v. Sanders, 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151, 2002-Ohio-350, 761 N.E.2d 18 quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). Additionally, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d Id., at 694. See also, State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 137, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).\n\n{\u00b676} In analyzing a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, this court\u2019s scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential, with a \u201c\u2018strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019\u201d Bradley, supra, at 142, quoting Strickland, supra, at 687-88. \u201cCounsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d Id.\n\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b677} At the outset, we note that Appellant, during the course of the proceedings below, had five (5) different attorneys represent him. Interestingly, Appellant does not specify which trial counsel was ineffective. However, it appears from this assignment that Appellant questions the effectiveness of his trial counsel.\nAppellant initially argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because trial counsel failed to object to any of the hearsay regarding Appellant residing in the residence during the raid by police officers, as charged in case number CR 2015 0361. However, we note that the failure to make objections is not alone enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Conway*, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 103. *See also, State v. Holloway*, 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831 (1988) (failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); *State v. Gumm*, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 428, 1995-Ohio-24, 653 N.E.2d 253 holding modified by *State v. Wogenstahl*, 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 1996-Ohio-219, 662 N.E.2d 311 (the failure to make objections does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel *per se*, as that failure may be justified as a tactical decision).\n\nNext, Appellant argues that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective because trial counsel did not *voir dire* Sergeant Dana Sutherland (\u201cSutherland\u201d), the State\u2019s marijuana expert witness. This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, the record reveals, and the Appellant concedes, that trial counsel objected to the expert being certified as an expert witness, and the trial court overruled the objection. (*See, Trial Tr., Vol. II, at 286*). And second, the record reveals that the Appellant\u2019s concerns with Sutherland\u2019s qualifications to testify as an expert were addressed by the trial court prior to trial. (*Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol.*\nI, at 11). Given the trial court\u2019s rulings, we do not find that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation under the facts presented.\n\nLastly, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective because his trial counsel failed to file a proper motion to sever the counts at the appropriate time during trial. However, the record is clear, and the Appellant concedes, that objections to the State\u2019s motions to consolidate were made and a motion to sever was filed prior to trial. (See, CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 139; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 48). Despite Appellant\u2019s objections and motion, the trial court found that the charges were of similar character and part of a common scheme or course of criminal conduct, then consolidated the cases and joined them for purposes of trial. (CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 163; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 82). Thus, because the trial court had already ruled on Appellant\u2019s motion to sever, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that a subsequent trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness by failing to file an additional motion to sever, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fourth Assignment of Error\n\nIn his fourth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss his cases based upon a speedy trial violation. Specifically, Appellant argues that the continuance granted at the request of the\nState beyond the February 21, 2017 trial date was unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b682 \u201cOur standard of review upon an appeal raising a speedy trial issue is to count the expired days as directed by R.C. 2945.71, et seq.\u201d State v. King, 3rd Dist. Marion No. 9-06-18, 2007-Ohio-335, \u00b6 30. See also, State v. DePue, 96 Ohio App.3d 513, 516, 645 N.E.2d 745 (4th Dist.1994). \u201cIf any ambiguity exists, we construe the record in favor of the accused.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b683 The applicable statutory speedy trial provision, R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), provides that a person charged with a felony shall be brought to trial within two hundred and seventy (270) days after the person\u2019s arrest. R.C. 2945.71(C)(2). In computing time under division (C)(2), \u201ceach day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charges shall be counted as three days.\u201d R.C. 2945.71(E).\n\n\u00b684 Further, R.C. 2945.73(B) provides:\n\nUpon motion made at or prior to the commencement of trial, a person charged with an offense shall be discharged if he is not brought to trial within the time required by sections 2945.71 and 2945.72 of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6115 However, in crafting exceptions to Fourth Amendment violation claims, \u201cthe United States Supreme Court [in *Terry*] held that a police officer may stop and investigate unusual behavior, even without probable cause to arrest, when he reasonably concluded that the individual is engaged in criminal activity.\u201d *Id. citing Terry*, 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868 (1968). \u201cIn assessing that conclusion,\nthe officer \u2018must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u2019\u201d *Id.* quoting *Terry*, at 21.\n\n{\u00b6116} Upon reviewing the record, we find that the State produced competent and credible evidence that the officers had specific and articulable facts, along with the rational inferences from those facts, to reasonably warrant the intrusion into Appellant\u2019s vehicle. The evidence produced at the suppression hearing demonstrated that law enforcement responded to a call that a suspicious vehicle (with its car alarm going off\\(^5\\)) was parked in the parking lot of 234 North Main Street in Lima, Ohio in the early morning hours of March 21, 2014. (Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 06/30/2016 Tr. at 8-9). Kunkleman, who was the first officer to respond to the call, testified that Appellant was out of the vehicle when he (Kunkleman) exited his vehicle, and refused to engage him (Kunkleman) in conversation. (Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 06/30/2016 Tr. at 10). Rather, Appellant turned back to the vehicle and started to lean into the driver\u2019s area, where Kunkleman was unable to observe what Appellant was doing with his hands. (*Id.*). Kunkleman also testified that when he approached Appellant\u2019s vehicle, he smelled\n\n---\n\n\\(^5\\) Dash cam video footage entered into evidence revealed that a car alarm was going off when officers arrived. (See, Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 06/30/2016, State\u2019s Ex. 2 at 3:26:20 AM).\nan overwhelming odor of marijuana\\(^6\\) emanating from the vehicle. (Id.). Kunkleman then shined his flashlight into Appellant\u2019s vehicle and observed a digital scale laying on the driver\u2019s side floorboard. (Id. at 11). Kunkleman testified that as a result of Appellant\u2019s actions, the smell of marijuana, and the observation of a digital scale on the floorboard, he decided to detain Appellant for his safety. (Id. at 11-12).\n\n\\{\u00b6117\\} Hillard, who observed the interaction between Appellant with Kunkleman, testified that he smelled the odor of marijuana coming from Appellant\u2019s vehicle. (Id. at 42). Hillard testified that when he looked inside the vehicle he saw, in plain view, cellphones, a digital scale, and raw marijuana in the center console, as well as a brown paper bag partially sticking out from under the seat. (Id. at 42-43). Hillard opened the brown paper bag and saw what he believed to be crack cocaine in it. (Id. at 43). Based on what was located in the vehicle, Appellant was placed under arrest. (Id.).\n\n\\{\u00b6118\\} We find, upon the totality of the circumstances, that Kunkleman and Hillard had probable cause to suspect that criminal activity was afoot, warranting further investigation. We further find that the search was not based solely upon \u201can unlawful arrest\u201d of the Appellant, but upon Appellant\u2019s actions, coupled with observations of the officers and the smell of raw marijuana. Thus, the trial court did\n\n\\(^6\\) We note that the smell of marijuana, alone, by a person qualified to recognize the odor, sufficiently establishes probable cause to search the vehicle from which the marijuana odor is detected.

Moore, 90 Ohio St.3d 47, 2000-Ohio-10, 734 N.E.2d 804.\nnot err in denying the motion to suppress based upon the warrantless search of the vehicle and the seventh assignment of error is overruled.\n\nAnalysis \u2013 Motion to Suppress in Case Number CR 2015 0361\n\nTestimony from the suppression hearing in case number CR 2015 0361 revealed the following: On January 12, 2015, Godfrey, a member of the West Central Ohio Crime Task Force, received a telephone call from the landlord of 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio regarding Appellant living in part of the duplex that was not rented to him. 7 (Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 10/20/2018 Tr. at 6-7). Godfrey was further informed that a maintenance man for the Catalpa residence had attempted to inspect the residence but was denied entry by Appellant. (Id. at 8). Godfrey knew Appellant had active warrants for his arrest, so he set up a surveillance of 1222 Catalpa Street on January 13, 2015. (Id. at 8-9). On January 17, 2015, Godfrey observed a Chrysler 300 in the driveway with temporary tags. (Id. at 10). When the Chrysler 300 left the residence, Godfrey followed the vehicle. (Id. at 11). The Ohio State Highway Patrol, in conjunction with the West Central Ohio Crime Task force, conducted a traffic stop of the vehicle due to a window tint violation. (Id.). Kunkleman, who was assisting Godfrey with 1222 Catalpa Street surveillance, spoke with the individuals in the Chrysler 300 and learned that they were visiting their friend \u201cRay\u201d at the Catalpa residence in question. (Id. at 12).\n\n7 The record suggests that the landlord identified the Appellant after seeing a local \u201cmost wanted\u201d television news report.\nThe passenger of the Chrysler identified \u201cRay\u201d as Appellant, and informed officers that Appellant had been living at the address for about a month. (Id. at 12). Because of this information, Godfrey verified that Appellant had active warrants and then set up a perimeter around 1222 Catalpa Street to arrest Appellant. (Id.).\n\nAfter the residence was surrounded, Godfrey knocked on the front door and ordered Appellant to come out. (Id. at 13). Instead, Appellant exited the rear of the house, but quickly ran back to the residence after observing law enforcement officials surrounding the duplex. (Id.). Officers eventually gained entry into the house, and the Appellant was arrested without incident. (Id. at 15). After Appellant\u2019s arrest, law enforcement officers conducted a protective sweep of the residence to make sure that there were no other individuals or threats within the house. (Id.). In conducting the protective sweep of the residence, law enforcement officials observed a black tent in one of the rooms. (Id.). Because the tent was large enough for someone to hide in, officers looked inside it, finding marijuana plants and a \u201cgrow operation\u201d inside. (Id. at 15-16).\n\nBased on observing the marijuana grow tent in the residence, officers secured the residence and sought out a search warrant for the premises. (Id. at 17-18). The reviewing judge found probable cause and signed the affidavit/search warrant for the residence. (Id. at 39-40; State\u2019s Ex. 1). Based on the search of the\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nresidence, law enforcement officials found guns, drugs, electronics, I.D.\u2019s, and paperwork. (Id. at 41; State\u2019s Ex. 1)."}
{"Index": "084-Davis", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, AS A MATTER OF LAW, BY PERMITTING THE APPELLEE TO PRESENT EXPERT TESTIMONY BY AN EXPERT WITNESS THAT HAD NOT PROVIDED A REPORT.", "evidence": "**Analysis**\n\n{\u00b695} Appellant alleges that the State violated Crim.R. 16(K) when it failed to provide an expert witness\u2019 report prior to the start of Appellant\u2019s jury trial. Crim.R. 16(K) states:\n\nAn expert witness for either side shall prepare a written report summarizing the expert witness\u2019s testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinion, and shall include a summary of the expert\u2019s qualifications. The written report and summary of qualifications shall be subject to disclosure under this rule no later than twenty-one days prior to trial, which period may be modified by the court for good cause shown, which does not prejudice any other party. Failure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert\u2019s testimony at trial.\n\nCrim.R. 16(K). Additionally, Crim.R. 16(L), entitled regulation of discovery, goes on to provide:\n\nThe trial court may make orders regulating discovery not inconsistent with this rule. If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\n\nCrim. R. 16(L).\n\n{\u00b696} Initially, we note that the State concedes that they should have provided Appellant with an expert report prior to Appellant\u2019s jury trial, pursuant to\nCrim. R. 16(K). We also note that the Appellant does not allege that the exclusion of Carman\u2019s testimony would have changed the outcome of the trial. Rather, Appellant argues that Carman\u2019s testimony was \u201cvery important\u201d to the State\u2019s case and its inclusion (over objection) warrants him a new trial. Appellant directs this Court to the Eleventh District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in State v. McGhee. State v. McGhee, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2014-T-0106, 2017-Ohio-5773. In McGhee, the Eleventh District held that the purpose of Crim.R. 16(K) is to prevent surprise and trial by ambush. Id. at \u00b6 19. While the State, in McGhee, had provided their expert witness\u2019 name to defense counsel at the appropriate time, it had failed to provide the expert\u2019s report to defense counsel until a couple days prior to trial. Id. Finding that the expert testimony was \u201cvital\u201d to the State\u2019s case, the court of appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and ordered a new trial. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\nHowever, Appellant\u2019s reliance on McGhee ignores precedent from this Court regarding the failure to provide an expert report. Specifically, in State v. Opp, under circumstances factually similar to the case sub judice, the State failed to provide an expert report. State v. Opp, 3rd Dist. Seneca No. 13-13-33, 2014-Ohio-1138, \u00b6 7. Relying, in part, on the Fifth District\u2019s decision in State v. Viera, we concluded that while Crim.R. 16(K) contains mandatory language for compliance, such language, when read in context with Crim.R. 16(L), does not abolish the trial court\u2019s discretion in regards to evidentiary matters. Id. at \u00b6 10. See, State v. Viera,\n5th Dist. Delaware No. 11CAA020020, 2011-Ohio-5263, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23 (Appellate court found that the trial court did not err in allowing an expert to testify in spite of an untimely expert\u2019s report). We then went on to analyze other cases involving a discovery violation with respect to an expert\u2019s report in accordance with Crim.R. 16(K). Opp, after its examination of precedent from various appellate courts in Ohio, found that while the State committed a discovery violation, that trial court did not err in allowing the State\u2019s expert witness to testify on a very limited issue which did not prejudice the defendant. Id. at \u00b6 20.\n\n\u00b698 Relying on Opp, we find that the trial court did not err in allowing the State to present Carman\u2019s limited expert testimony at trial. Specifically, the record reveals that Carman was not testifying on the specifics of the case at hand, but rather, provided testimony regarding his experience, in general, involving why fingerprints may or may not exist on a handgun. (Trial, 08/02/2018 Tr., Vol. I, at 209). Moreover, the trial court specifically found that Carman was not testifying about the evidence in Appellant\u2019s case, but merely on generalities involving a lack of fingerprints on a handgun. (Id.). Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling Appellant\u2019s Crim.R. 16(K) objection.\n\n\u00b699 Lastly, even if we were to find that the trial court erred in admitting Carman\u2019s testimony, we would affirm the ruling under the harmless error doctrine. Harmless error is \u201c\u2018any error, defect, irregularity, or variance, which does not affect\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\n[a] substantial right[ ] [***]\u201d\u2019. State v. Wilson, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-09-53, 2010-Ohio-2947, \u00b6 26 quoting Crim.R. 52(A). Furthermore, \u201charmless error does not affect the outcome of the case and, thus, does not warrant a judgment to be overturned or set aside.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b6100 For the reasons discussed above, we overrule Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Sixth Assignment of Error\n\n\u00b6101 In his sixth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by consolidating his two trials. Specifically, Appellant argues that the evidence was not \u201csimple and direct,\u201d which would permit joinder of the cases. We disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b6102 \u201cA defendant who asserts that joinder is improper has the burden of making an affirmative showing that his rights will be prejudiced thereby.\u201d State v.

Absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion, a trial court\u2019s decision regarding joinder will not be disturbed. Torres, supra.\n\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b6103} Crim.R. 13, entitled \u201ctrial together of indictments or information or complaints,\u201d provides the statutory authority for joinder, which states:\n\nThe court may order two or more indictments or informations or both to be tried together, if the offenses or the defendants could have been joined in a single indictment or information. The procedure shall be the same as if the prosecution were under such single indictment or information.\n\nThe court may order two or more complaints to be tried together, if the offenses or the defendants could have been joined in a single complaint. The procedure shall be the same as if the prosecution were under such single complaint.\n\nCrim.R. 13.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b673} Accordingly, we find that the weight of the evidence supports Appellant\u2019s convictions.

Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 137, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).\n\n{\u00b676} In analyzing a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, this court\u2019s scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential, with a \u201c\u2018strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019\u201d Bradley, supra, at 142, quoting Strickland, supra, at 687-88. \u201cCounsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d Id.\n\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b677} At the outset, we note that Appellant, during the course of the proceedings below, had five (5) different attorneys represent him. Interestingly, Appellant does not specify which trial counsel was ineffective. However, it appears from this assignment that Appellant questions the effectiveness of his trial counsel.\nAppellant initially argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because trial counsel failed to object to any of the hearsay regarding Appellant residing in the residence during the raid by police officers, as charged in case number CR 2015 0361. However, we note that the failure to make objections is not alone enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Conway*, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 103. *See also, State v. Holloway*, 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831 (1988) (failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); *State v. Gumm*, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 428, 1995-Ohio-24, 653 N.E.2d 253 holding modified by *State v. Wogenstahl*, 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 1996-Ohio-219, 662 N.E.2d 311 (the failure to make objections does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel *per se*, as that failure may be justified as a tactical decision).\n\nNext, Appellant argues that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective because trial counsel did not *voir dire* Sergeant Dana Sutherland (\u201cSutherland\u201d), the State\u2019s marijuana expert witness. This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, the record reveals, and the Appellant concedes, that trial counsel objected to the expert being certified as an expert witness, and the trial court overruled the objection. (*See, Trial Tr., Vol. II, at 286*). And second, the record reveals that the Appellant\u2019s concerns with Sutherland\u2019s qualifications to testify as an expert were addressed by the trial court prior to trial. (*Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol.*\nI, at 11). Given the trial court\u2019s rulings, we do not find that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation under the facts presented.\n\nLastly, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective because his trial counsel failed to file a proper motion to sever the counts at the appropriate time during trial. However, the record is clear, and the Appellant concedes, that objections to the State\u2019s motions to consolidate were made and a motion to sever was filed prior to trial. (See, CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 139; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 48). Despite Appellant\u2019s objections and motion, the trial court found that the charges were of similar character and part of a common scheme or course of criminal conduct, then consolidated the cases and joined them for purposes of trial. (CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 163; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 82). Thus, because the trial court had already ruled on Appellant\u2019s motion to sever, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that a subsequent trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness by failing to file an additional motion to sever, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fourth Assignment of Error\n\nIn his fourth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss his cases based upon a speedy trial violation. Specifically, Appellant argues that the continuance granted at the request of the\nState beyond the February 21, 2017 trial date was unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b682 \u201cOur standard of review upon an appeal raising a speedy trial issue is to count the expired days as directed by R.C. 2945.71, et seq.\u201d State v. King, 3rd Dist. Marion No. 9-06-18, 2007-Ohio-335, \u00b6 30. See also, State v. DePue, 96 Ohio App.3d 513, 516, 645 N.E.2d 745 (4th Dist.1994). \u201cIf any ambiguity exists, we construe the record in favor of the accused.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b683 The applicable statutory speedy trial provision, R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), provides that a person charged with a felony shall be brought to trial within two hundred and seventy (270) days after the person\u2019s arrest. R.C. 2945.71(C)(2). In computing time under division (C)(2), \u201ceach day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charges shall be counted as three days.\u201d R.C. 2945.71(E).\n\n\u00b684 Further, R.C. 2945.73(B) provides:\n\nUpon motion made at or prior to the commencement of trial, a person charged with an offense shall be discharged if he is not brought to trial within the time required by sections 2945.71 and 2945.72 of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b638} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 147). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 150).\nOn July 24, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel.\u201d (Doc. No. 173). On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed an additional \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d as well as a \u201cmotion for continuance of the trial date,\u201d \u201cmotion for specific discovery,\u201d and \u201cmotion to suppress evidence.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 180; 181; 182; 183). Appellant, through his various motions, alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena witnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The Appellant further alleged that the State had failed to provide specific discovery. (Doc. No. 182). On August 1, 2017, the trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions, finding that the Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the case. (Doc. No. 186).\n\nAppellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 194). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2015 0361, the State made an oral motion to amend Count Three in the indictment, possession of marijuana, a felony of the third degree, to possession of marijuana, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court granted. (Id.) The Appellant did not oppose the amendment. (Id.).\n\nAppellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding Appellant guilty of all charges. (Id.). Further, Appellant was found guilty of all specifications except for the specification for property (electronics) contained in Count One and Count Two. (Id.).\nAppellant was sentenced on September 14, 2017 in the trial court and was ordered to serve a prison term of: seven (7) years in prison under Count One; seven (7) years in prison under Count Two; twelve (12) months in prison under Count Three; thirty (30) months in prison under Count Four; and thirty-six (36) months in prison under Count Five. (Doc. No. 200). The trial court further ordered that all counts be served consecutively to each other and consecutively to the prison sentence imposed in case number CR 2014 0118. (Id.). With regards to the specifications, the firearms were ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; the money was ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; and the electronics (subject to the specification in Counts Three and Four) were ordered forfeited to the WCOCTF. (Id.). Appellant\u2019s prison sentences totaled twenty-eight (28) and a half years. (Id.).\n\nFrom the judgments in case number CR 2014 0118 and case number CR 2015 0361 Appellant timely appeals, and presents the following assignments of error for our review:\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO.

For the reasons outlined below, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n\u201cWhether there is legally sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict is a question of law.\u201d *State v. Lyle*, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-14-41, 2015-Ohio-1181, \u00b6 8 citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 1997-Ohio-52, 678 N.E.2d 541. Sufficiency is a test of adequacy. *Id.* Under a challenge alleging insufficient evidence, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *Id.* quoting *State v. Leonard*, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 77.\n\n**Analysis \u2013 Case Number CR 2014 0118**\n\nIn case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant was found guilty in Count I of possession of drugs (cocaine) and guilty in Count II of possession of drugs (heroin), both in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which states:\n(A) No person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2925.11(A).\n\n{\u00b648} On appeal, Appellant argues that the State failed to produce any evidence proving that Appellant owned or possessed the contents (i.e. heroin and cocaine) of the motor vehicle in question. \u201c\u2018Possess\u2019 or \u2018possession\u2019 means having control over a thing or substance, but may not be inferred solely from mere access to the thing or substance through ownership or occupation of the premises upon which the thing or substance is found.\u201d R.C. 2925.01(K). \u201c\u2018The issue of whether a person charged with drug possession knowingly possessed a controlled substance is to be determined from all the attendant facts and circumstances available.\u2019\u201d State v. Frye, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-17-30, 2018-Ohio-894, \u00b6 50 quoting State v. Brooks, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-11-11, 2012-Ohio-5235, \u00b6 45. See also, State v. Teamer, 82 Ohio St.3d 490, 492, 1998-Ohio-193, 696 N.E.2d 1049 (1998).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b612} On July 7, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate Appellant\u2019s cases. (Doc. No. 137). Appellant filed his oppositions to the State\u2019s motion to\n\n---\n\n3 This is Case Number CR 2015 0361, which we will address infra.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nconsolidate on July 15, 2016 and on August 22, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 139; 159). On August 26, 2016 the trial court consolidated the cases. (Doc. No. 163).\n\n{\u00b613} On August 3, 2016, Appellant signed and filed a second waiver of his speedy trial rights in the trial court. (Doc. No. 155). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was rescheduled for December 20, 2016. (Doc. No. 169). On November 28, 2016, Appellant, through counsel, filed a motion to continue. (Doc. No. 171). Specifically, Appellant\u2019s trial counsel represented to the court that he had encountered difficulty contacting potential defense witnesses in preparation for trial. (Id.). A hearing was held on Appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance on November 30, 2016. (Doc. No. 174). At the hearing, Appellant refused to further waive his right to a speedy trial beyond the January 1, 2017 date set forth in Appellant\u2019s previous waiver. (Id. at 2). Despite Appellant\u2019s refusal, the trial court found that a sixty (60) day continuance was necessary and not unreasonable under the circumstances. (Id. at 8). Appellant\u2019s trial was set for February 21, 2017. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b614} On February 3, 2017, the State filed its motion for a continuance, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in State v. Gonzales, requiring that the State must prove the actual weight of a drug in question, (excluding any filler materials) to meet the statutory weight requirement. (Doc. No. 180). Stated better, based on the change in the prosecution of drug offenses under State v. Gonzales, the State requested additional time to determine the actual weight of the cocaine\npossessed by Appellant. Appellant objected to the State\u2019s motion for continuance. (Doc. No. 181). The trial court, finding that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom in drug prosecutions, granted the State\u2019s motion. (Doc. No. 182). Ultimately, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017. (Doc. No. 184).\n\n{\u00b615} On April 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss in the trial court. (Doc. No. 202). Specifically, Appellant requested that his cases be dismissed, pursuant to R.C. 2945.73(B) and R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), because he had been held in custody for 276 days, which exceeded the statutorily permissible 270 days. (Id.). The State responded to Appellant\u2019s motion, arguing that the time involving its continuance (of February 3, 2017) should not count against it, because that continuance was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d under the circumstances of the case. (Doc. No. 205). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motion on April 19, 2017. (Doc. No. 206).\n\n{\u00b616} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 211). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 214).\n\n{\u00b617} On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d and a \u201cmotion for continuance of trial date.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 237; 238). Appellant alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nwitnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions on August 1, 2017, finding that Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the cases. (Doc. No. 239).\n\n\u00b618 Appellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 243). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2014 0118, the State made an oral motion to amend Count One in the indictment, possession of cocaine, a felony of the first degree, to possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree. (Id.). The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion. (Id.) Further, the State made an oral motion to dismiss Count Three in the indictment, aggravated possession of drugs, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court also granted. (Id.). The Appellant did not object to either motion.\n\n\u00b619 Appellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding the Appellant guilty of Count I, possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree and of Count II, possession of heroin, a felony of the first degree. (Id.).\n\n\u00b620 Ultimately, and in case number CR 2014 0118, the trial court sentenced the Appellant to consecutive prison terms of six (6) years (Count I) and twelve (12) months (Count II) on September 14, 2017. (Doc. No. 244).\nFactual Background - Case Number 2015 CR 0361\n\n{\u00b621} On January 12 or 13, 2015, investigators with the West Central Ohio Criminal Task Force (\u201cWCOCTF\u201d) commenced an investigation to locate the Appellant, due to Appellant\u2019s outstanding warrants. (Doc. No. 100). On January 12, 2015, the Lima Police Department received an anonymous telephone call\\(^4\\) that Appellant was staying at 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio. (Id.). The caller further advised officers that Appellant was not a tenant on the lease at that location. (Id.). Sgt. Charles Godfrey, (\u201cGodfrey\u201d) then a supervisor at WCOCTF, attempted to contact the anonymous caller to verify the information provided, but was unable to do so. (Id.). So, based on the information provided (by the anonymous caller), Godfrey set up an undercover operation on January 13, 2015 to monitor the 1222 Catalpa Street residence in an attempt to locate Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b622} On January 17, 2015, Godfrey observed a Chrysler 300 parked at the Catalpa Street residence. (Id.). Later that day, an individual in a hooded sweatshirt left the residence in that vehicle. (Id.). Since the vehicle\u2019s windows were heavily tinted, and because Godfrey could not see inside it, Godfrey arranged for the Ohio State Highway Patrol to stop the vehicle for a tinted windows violation. (Id.). When the Chrysler was stopped a person identified as \u201cWatkins\u201d was located as a passenger in the vehicle. (Id.). Watkins told law enforcement officials that he and\n\n\\(^4\\) The anonymous caller was later identified as the landlord of the duplex wherein Appellant was staying. (See, Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 10/20/2016 Tr. at 7).\nthe driver had been visiting \u201cRay\u201d at 1222 Catalpa Street. (Id.). When shown a picture of Appellant, Watkins confirmed that \u201cRay\u201d was the Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b623} With that information (from Watkins), Godfrey returned to 1222 Catalpa Street, believing that Appellant was present in the residence. (Id.). And, after verifying that Appellant still had active outstanding warrants, Godfrey went to the residence\u2019s front door while law enforcement set up a perimeter around the house. (Id.). Godfrey knocked on the door, identified that he was a police officer, and that he had a warrant for Appellant\u2019s arrest. (Id.). Godfrey further advised that if the door wasn\u2019t opened it would be knocked down. (Id.).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b659} After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes charged proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Second Assignment of Error\n\n{\u00b660} Appellant argues that his convictions in both case number CR 2014 0118 and CR 2015 0361 were against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nStandard of Review\n\n{\u00b661} The Ohio Supreme Court has \u201c\u2018carefully distinguished the terms \u2018sufficiency\u2019 and \u2018weight\u2019 in criminal cases, declaring that \u2018manifest weight\u2019 and \u2018legal sufficiency\u2019 are \u2018both quantitatively and qualitatively different.\u2019\u201d Lyle, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-14-41, 2015-Ohio-1181, \u00b6 9 quoting Eastley v. Volkman, 132 Ohio St.3d 328, 2010-Ohio-2179, 972 N.E.2d 517, \u00b6 10.\n\n{\u00b662} In analyzing a claim that a conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court:\n\nsits as the \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d and may disagree with the fact finder\u2019s resolution of the conflicting testimony. * * * The appellate court, \u201c\u2018reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against conviction.\u2019\u201d\n\nState v. Johnson, 3rd Dist. Shelby No. 17-08-06, 2008-Ohio-4784, \u00b6 4 quoting State v. Jackson, 169 Ohio App.3d 440, 2006-Ohio-6059, 863 N.E.2d 223, \u00b614 (citations omitted). However, in sitting as the thirteenth juror the appellate court should give due deference to the findings made by the jury. Id.\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b663} The Eighth District Court of Appeals identified the following eight factors as a guide to assist a reviewing court in determining whether a decision of the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence:\n\n1. A reviewing court is not required to accept the incredible as true;\n2. Whether the evidence is uncontradicted;\n3. Whether a witness was impeached;\n4. What was not proved;\n5. Certainty of evidence;\n6. Reliability of evidence;\n7. Whether witness\u2019 testimony is self-serving;\n8. And whether evidence is vague, uncertain, conflicting, or fragmentary.\n\nState v. Mattison, 23 Ohio App.3d 10, 14, 490 N.E.2d 926 (8th Dist.1985). We discuss the relevant factors to each underlying case below.\n\nUncontradicted Evidence\n\n{\u00b664} Initially, we note that Appellant failed to introduce any evidence that contradicted the State\u2019s evidence at trial. In respect to case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant produced no evidence to contradict the State\u2019s testimony that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:00 a.m., the Lima Police Department was dispatched to 234 North Main Street in Lima, Ohio for a call of a suspicious vehicle sitting in\nthe parking lot. It is not disputed that the Appellant exited his vehicle when officers arrived, and when Kunkleman approached him, Appellant turned back and leaned into the car on the driver\u2019s side. It is further undisputed that officers could smell the smell of raw marijuana at this time and that officers grabbed Appellant and pulled him away from the vehicle for their safety.\n\n{\u00b665} There is no dispute that the Appellant, when ordered to put his hands up in the air, disregarded the officer\u2019s commands, which led to him being detained. A pat down of Appellant produced a large sum of money and marijuana, which led to his arrest and the subsequent search of the vehicle, which produced a large amount of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, digital scales, and Appellant\u2019s billfold. With no testimony or evidence produced at trial to cast doubt upon this version of events, Appellant cannot contradict the elements of possession of cocaine and possession of heroin as established by the State in case number CR 2014 0118.\n\n{\u00b666} In regards to case number CR 2015 0361, the State\u2019s uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that on January 17, 2015, after receiving an anonymous tip and surveilling the premises, law enforcement entered 1222 Catalpa Street after repeatedly requesting that Appellant come to the front door. Once inside the premises, and while conducting a protective sweep of the home, officers viewed a marijuana grow tent in plain view. Based on the information collected, officers obtained a search warrant and searched the premises in its entirety. During the\nsearch, officers located credit cards, mail, and other personal effects bearing Appellant\u2019s name.\n\n{\u00b667} While Appellant contends that no witness had personal knowledge that he occupied the premises, the evidence indicates otherwise. Specifically, many of Appellant\u2019s personal effects were found within the residence, which is indicative of occupation. Accordingly, we find that the uncontradicted evidence supports that Appellant was occupying the residence on January 17, 2015.\n\nImpeached Witness\n\n{\u00b668} A review of the record reveals that no witness for the State was impeached in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361.\n\nReliability of Evidence\n\n{\u00b669} With respect to case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant attempts to discredit the reliability of the testimony and evidence produced at trial, because \u201cnot one single witness [***] actually had personal knowledge of Appellant allegedly occupying the premises testified [to] at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). Appellant further classifies all of the testimony produced regarding occupation of the premises as \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\n{\u00b670} However, we find that the State produced competent and credible evidence that Appellant was occupying 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio at the time the officers conducted their raid. Specifically, officers testified that they\nobserved Appellant leave the back of the duplex in an attempt to flee, and then run back inside once he saw that officers had the duplex surrounded. Furthermore, the evidence established that officers personally observed Appellant leave out of the back of the residence prior to it being breached. With eyewitness testimony confirming that Appellant was, in fact, inside the residence, we find no merit in Appellant\u2019s argument in regards to reliability.\n\n**Self-Serving Testimony**\n\n{\u00b671} The record reveals that the trial court did not characterize any witness\u2019s testimony as self-serving in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, on review, we do not find any indicia of self-serving testimony in either case and Appellant does not argue that testimony was self-serving on appeal.\n\n**Vague, Uncertain, Conflicting, or Fragmentary Evidence**\n\n{\u00b672} In case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant points to the evidence produced at the suppression hearing to cast into doubt officers\u2019 testimony at trial. Specifically, Appellant argues that the officers, when testifying at the suppression hearing, described a \u201cmuch more leisurely encounter at the suppression hearing than they did at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). However, Appellant fails to develop this argument and further fails to demonstrate how this \u201cconflict\u201d in testimonies between the suppression hearing and trial creates a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting\nreversal. Even should Appellant establish that a true \u201cconflict\u201d exists in the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and the trial, and that such issue was properly before this Court, we find that the record contains competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. *Phelps v. Horn\u2019s Crop Serv. Ctr.*, 3rd Dist. Wyandot No. 16-89-8, 1990 WL 157282, * 2 (holding that the choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact)."}
{"Index": "084-Davis", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, TO THE PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT, BY CONSOLIDATING THE TWO TRIALS FOR SEPARATE AND DISTINCT CASES AGAINST APPELLANT.", "evidence": "{\u00b612} On July 7, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate Appellant\u2019s cases. (Doc. No. 137). Appellant filed his oppositions to the State\u2019s motion to\n\n---\n\n3 This is Case Number CR 2015 0361, which we will address infra.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nconsolidate on July 15, 2016 and on August 22, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 139; 159). On August 26, 2016 the trial court consolidated the cases. (Doc. No. 163).\n\n{\u00b613} On August 3, 2016, Appellant signed and filed a second waiver of his speedy trial rights in the trial court. (Doc. No. 155). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was rescheduled for December 20, 2016. (Doc. No. 169). On November 28, 2016, Appellant, through counsel, filed a motion to continue. (Doc. No. 171). Specifically, Appellant\u2019s trial counsel represented to the court that he had encountered difficulty contacting potential defense witnesses in preparation for trial. (Id.). A hearing was held on Appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance on November 30, 2016. (Doc. No. 174). At the hearing, Appellant refused to further waive his right to a speedy trial beyond the January 1, 2017 date set forth in Appellant\u2019s previous waiver. (Id. at 2). Despite Appellant\u2019s refusal, the trial court found that a sixty (60) day continuance was necessary and not unreasonable under the circumstances. (Id. at 8). Appellant\u2019s trial was set for February 21, 2017. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b614} On February 3, 2017, the State filed its motion for a continuance, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in State v. Gonzales, requiring that the State must prove the actual weight of a drug in question, (excluding any filler materials) to meet the statutory weight requirement. (Doc. No. 180). Stated better, based on the change in the prosecution of drug offenses under State v. Gonzales, the State requested additional time to determine the actual weight of the cocaine\npossessed by Appellant. Appellant objected to the State\u2019s motion for continuance. (Doc. No. 181). The trial court, finding that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom in drug prosecutions, granted the State\u2019s motion. (Doc. No. 182). Ultimately, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017. (Doc. No. 184).\n\n{\u00b615} On April 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss in the trial court. (Doc. No. 202). Specifically, Appellant requested that his cases be dismissed, pursuant to R.C. 2945.73(B) and R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), because he had been held in custody for 276 days, which exceeded the statutorily permissible 270 days. (Id.). The State responded to Appellant\u2019s motion, arguing that the time involving its continuance (of February 3, 2017) should not count against it, because that continuance was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d under the circumstances of the case. (Doc. No. 205). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motion on April 19, 2017. (Doc. No. 206).\n\n{\u00b616} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 211). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 214).\n\n{\u00b617} On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d and a \u201cmotion for continuance of trial date.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 237; 238). Appellant alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nwitnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions on August 1, 2017, finding that Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the cases. (Doc. No. 239).\n\n\u00b618 Appellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 243). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2014 0118, the State made an oral motion to amend Count One in the indictment, possession of cocaine, a felony of the first degree, to possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree. (Id.). The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion. (Id.) Further, the State made an oral motion to dismiss Count Three in the indictment, aggravated possession of drugs, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court also granted. (Id.). The Appellant did not object to either motion.\n\n\u00b619 Appellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding the Appellant guilty of Count I, possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree and of Count II, possession of heroin, a felony of the first degree. (Id.).\n\n\u00b620 Ultimately, and in case number CR 2014 0118, the trial court sentenced the Appellant to consecutive prison terms of six (6) years (Count I) and twelve (12) months (Count II) on September 14, 2017. (Doc. No. 244).\nFactual Background - Case Number 2015 CR 0361\n\n{\u00b621} On January 12 or 13, 2015, investigators with the West Central Ohio Criminal Task Force (\u201cWCOCTF\u201d) commenced an investigation to locate the Appellant, due to Appellant\u2019s outstanding warrants. (Doc. No. 100). On January 12, 2015, the Lima Police Department received an anonymous telephone call\\(^4\\) that Appellant was staying at 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio. (Id.). The caller further advised officers that Appellant was not a tenant on the lease at that location. (Id.). Sgt. Charles Godfrey, (\u201cGodfrey\u201d) then a supervisor at WCOCTF, attempted to contact the anonymous caller to verify the information provided, but was unable to do so. (Id.). So, based on the information provided (by the anonymous caller), Godfrey set up an undercover operation on January 13, 2015 to monitor the 1222 Catalpa Street residence in an attempt to locate Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b622} On January 17, 2015, Godfrey observed a Chrysler 300 parked at the Catalpa Street residence. (Id.). Later that day, an individual in a hooded sweatshirt left the residence in that vehicle. (Id.). Since the vehicle\u2019s windows were heavily tinted, and because Godfrey could not see inside it, Godfrey arranged for the Ohio State Highway Patrol to stop the vehicle for a tinted windows violation. (Id.). When the Chrysler was stopped a person identified as \u201cWatkins\u201d was located as a passenger in the vehicle. (Id.). Watkins told law enforcement officials that he and\n\n\\(^4\\) The anonymous caller was later identified as the landlord of the duplex wherein Appellant was staying. (See, Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 10/20/2016 Tr. at 7).\nthe driver had been visiting \u201cRay\u201d at 1222 Catalpa Street. (Id.). When shown a picture of Appellant, Watkins confirmed that \u201cRay\u201d was the Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b623} With that information (from Watkins), Godfrey returned to 1222 Catalpa Street, believing that Appellant was present in the residence. (Id.). And, after verifying that Appellant still had active outstanding warrants, Godfrey went to the residence\u2019s front door while law enforcement set up a perimeter around the house. (Id.). Godfrey knocked on the door, identified that he was a police officer, and that he had a warrant for Appellant\u2019s arrest. (Id.). Godfrey further advised that if the door wasn\u2019t opened it would be knocked down. (Id.).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b638} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 147). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 150).\nOn July 24, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel.\u201d (Doc. No. 173). On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed an additional \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d as well as a \u201cmotion for continuance of the trial date,\u201d \u201cmotion for specific discovery,\u201d and \u201cmotion to suppress evidence.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 180; 181; 182; 183). Appellant, through his various motions, alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena witnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The Appellant further alleged that the State had failed to provide specific discovery. (Doc. No. 182). On August 1, 2017, the trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions, finding that the Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the case. (Doc. No. 186).\n\nAppellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 194). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2015 0361, the State made an oral motion to amend Count Three in the indictment, possession of marijuana, a felony of the third degree, to possession of marijuana, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court granted. (Id.) The Appellant did not oppose the amendment. (Id.).\n\nAppellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding Appellant guilty of all charges. (Id.). Further, Appellant was found guilty of all specifications except for the specification for property (electronics) contained in Count One and Count Two. (Id.).\nAppellant was sentenced on September 14, 2017 in the trial court and was ordered to serve a prison term of: seven (7) years in prison under Count One; seven (7) years in prison under Count Two; twelve (12) months in prison under Count Three; thirty (30) months in prison under Count Four; and thirty-six (36) months in prison under Count Five. (Doc. No. 200). The trial court further ordered that all counts be served consecutively to each other and consecutively to the prison sentence imposed in case number CR 2014 0118. (Id.). With regards to the specifications, the firearms were ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; the money was ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; and the electronics (subject to the specification in Counts Three and Four) were ordered forfeited to the WCOCTF. (Id.). Appellant\u2019s prison sentences totaled twenty-eight (28) and a half years. (Id.).\n\nFrom the judgments in case number CR 2014 0118 and case number CR 2015 0361 Appellant timely appeals, and presents the following assignments of error for our review:\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. I\n\nAPPELLANTS [SIC] CONVICTIONS ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. II\n\nAPPELLANTS [SIC] CONVICTIONS ARE AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO.

VIII\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, TO THE PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT, BY DENYING APPELLANTS [SIC] MOTION TO SUPPRESS ALL EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN CASE NUMBER 0361.\nFor ease of discussion, we elect to address interrelated assignments together.\n\n**Appellant\u2019s First Assignment of Error**\n\nIn his first assignment of error, Appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence in both case number CR 2014 0118 and CR 2015 0361 to sustain his convictions. For the reasons outlined below, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n\u201cWhether there is legally sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict is a question of law.\u201d *State v. Lyle*, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-14-41, 2015-Ohio-1181, \u00b6 8 citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 1997-Ohio-52, 678 N.E.2d 541. Sufficiency is a test of adequacy. *Id.* Under a challenge alleging insufficient evidence, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *Id.* quoting *State v. Leonard*, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 77.\n\n**Analysis \u2013 Case Number CR 2014 0118**\n\nIn case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant was found guilty in Count I of possession of drugs (cocaine) and guilty in Count II of possession of drugs (heroin), both in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which states:\n(A) No person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2925.11(A).\n\n{\u00b648} On appeal, Appellant argues that the State failed to produce any evidence proving that Appellant owned or possessed the contents (i.e. heroin and cocaine) of the motor vehicle in question. \u201c\u2018Possess\u2019 or \u2018possession\u2019 means having control over a thing or substance, but may not be inferred solely from mere access to the thing or substance through ownership or occupation of the premises upon which the thing or substance is found.\u201d R.C. 2925.01(K). \u201c\u2018The issue of whether a person charged with drug possession knowingly possessed a controlled substance is to be determined from all the attendant facts and circumstances available.\u2019\u201d State v. Frye, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-17-30, 2018-Ohio-894, \u00b6 50 quoting State v. Brooks, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-11-11, 2012-Ohio-5235, \u00b6 45. See also, State v. Teamer, 82 Ohio St.3d 490, 492, 1998-Ohio-193, 696 N.E.2d 1049 (1998).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b673} Accordingly, we find that the weight of the evidence supports Appellant\u2019s convictions. We further find that the jury did not lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting Appellant of possession of cocaine and heroin in case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n**Appellant\u2019s Third Assignment of Error**\n\n{\u00b674} In his third assignment of error, Appellant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective, in part, because trial counsel failed to object to hearsay statements during trial. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n{\u00b675} \u201c\u2018When a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that the counsel\u2019s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d State v. Sanders, 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151, 2002-Ohio-350, 761 N.E.2d 18 quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). Additionally, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d Id., at 694. See also, State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 137, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).\n\n{\u00b676} In analyzing a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, this court\u2019s scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential, with a \u201c\u2018strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019\u201d Bradley, supra, at 142, quoting Strickland, supra, at 687-88. \u201cCounsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d Id.\n\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b677} At the outset, we note that Appellant, during the course of the proceedings below, had five (5) different attorneys represent him. Interestingly, Appellant does not specify which trial counsel was ineffective. However, it appears from this assignment that Appellant questions the effectiveness of his trial counsel.\nAppellant initially argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because trial counsel failed to object to any of the hearsay regarding Appellant residing in the residence during the raid by police officers, as charged in case number CR 2015 0361. However, we note that the failure to make objections is not alone enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Conway*, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 103. *See also, State v. Holloway*, 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831 (1988) (failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); *State v. Gumm*, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 428, 1995-Ohio-24, 653 N.E.2d 253 holding modified by *State v. Wogenstahl*, 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 1996-Ohio-219, 662 N.E.2d 311 (the failure to make objections does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel *per se*, as that failure may be justified as a tactical decision).\n\nNext, Appellant argues that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective because trial counsel did not *voir dire* Sergeant Dana Sutherland (\u201cSutherland\u201d), the State\u2019s marijuana expert witness. This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, the record reveals, and the Appellant concedes, that trial counsel objected to the expert being certified as an expert witness, and the trial court overruled the objection. (*See, Trial Tr., Vol. II, at 286*). And second, the record reveals that the Appellant\u2019s concerns with Sutherland\u2019s qualifications to testify as an expert were addressed by the trial court prior to trial. (*Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol.*\nI, at 11). Given the trial court\u2019s rulings, we do not find that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation under the facts presented.\n\nLastly, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective because his trial counsel failed to file a proper motion to sever the counts at the appropriate time during trial. However, the record is clear, and the Appellant concedes, that objections to the State\u2019s motions to consolidate were made and a motion to sever was filed prior to trial. (See, CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 139; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 48). Despite Appellant\u2019s objections and motion, the trial court found that the charges were of similar character and part of a common scheme or course of criminal conduct, then consolidated the cases and joined them for purposes of trial. (CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 163; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 82). Thus, because the trial court had already ruled on Appellant\u2019s motion to sever, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that a subsequent trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness by failing to file an additional motion to sever, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fourth Assignment of Error\n\nIn his fourth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss his cases based upon a speedy trial violation. Specifically, Appellant argues that the continuance granted at the request of the\nState beyond the February 21, 2017 trial date was unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b682 \u201cOur standard of review upon an appeal raising a speedy trial issue is to count the expired days as directed by R.C. 2945.71, et seq.\u201d State v. King, 3rd Dist. Marion No. 9-06-18, 2007-Ohio-335, \u00b6 30. See also, State v. DePue, 96 Ohio App.3d 513, 516, 645 N.E.2d 745 (4th Dist.1994). \u201cIf any ambiguity exists, we construe the record in favor of the accused.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b683 The applicable statutory speedy trial provision, R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), provides that a person charged with a felony shall be brought to trial within two hundred and seventy (270) days after the person\u2019s arrest. R.C. 2945.71(C)(2). In computing time under division (C)(2), \u201ceach day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charges shall be counted as three days.\u201d R.C. 2945.71(E).\n\n\u00b684 Further, R.C. 2945.73(B) provides:\n\nUpon motion made at or prior to the commencement of trial, a person charged with an offense shall be discharged if he is not brought to trial within the time required by sections 2945.71 and 2945.72 of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n{\u00b685} In the instant matter, both the State and Appellant agree that Appellant\u2019s speedy trial rights were upheld throughout the proceedings up until Appellant\u2019s scheduled jury trial on February 21, 2017. However, at the request of the State, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017, outside of the Appellant\u2019s statutory speedy trial period. Thus, the question before us is not whether Appellant was brought to trial within the statutorily permitted time frame, but rather, was the speedy trial violation permissible under the circumstances of the case. We answer that question in the affirmative.\n\n{\u00b686} R.C. 2945.72, entitled \u201cextension of time for hearing or trial,\u201d allows for an extension of time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances. R.C. 2945.72(H) provides:\n\nThe time within which an accused must be brought to trial, or, in the case of felony, to preliminary hearing and trial, may be extended only by the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(H) The period of any continuance granted on the accused\u2019s own motion, and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused\u2019s own motion.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2945.72(H).\nThe resolution of this issue, therefore, depends upon whether the trial court\u2019s continuance was reasonable. \u201cDetermining the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of the continuance beyond the ninety-day stricture of R.C. 2945.71, invariably, \u2018depends on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u2019\u201d State v. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, \u00b6 10, quoting State v. Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988). \u201c\u2018In addition, precedent requires that such a continuance be necessary under the circumstances of the case.\u2019\u201d Id. quoting Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988) citing City of Aurora v. Patrick, 61 Ohio St.2d 107, 108-09, 399 N.E.2d 1220 (1980).\n\nOn February 3, 2017, the State requested a continuance of the trial date, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in State v. Gonzales. See, State v. Gonzales, 150 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-Ohio-8319, 81 N.E.3d 405, reconsideration granted, decision vacated, 150 Ohio St.3d 276, 2017-Ohio-777, 81 N.E.3d 419, reconsideration denied, 149 Ohio St.3d 1409, 2017-Ohio-2822, 74 N.E.3d 466. In Gonzales, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the offense level for possession of cocaine was determined only by the weight of the actual cocaine, not by the total weight of cocaine plus any filler. Id. at \u00b6 22. This opinion was inconsistent with prior case law on the same topic. Id. at \u00b6 51. Given the new purity requirements, the State requested a continuance to send Appellant\u2019s cocaine to a lab equipped to determine the weight of actual cocaine, separate from the filler weight.\nThe trial court, on February 9, 2017, granted the State\u2019s request for a continuance and set Appellant\u2019s jury trial for May 16, 2017. (Case number CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 182; case number CR 2015, Doc. No. 109). In granting the continuance, the trial court acknowledged that State v. Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom. Furthermore, the trial court relied on the Seventh District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in State v. High, wherein the Appellate court held that an extension request by the State for testing of evidence was reasonable. State v. High, 143 Ohio App.3d 232, 242, 2001-Ohio-3530, 757 N.E.2d 1176.\n\nWe find that the continuance was reasonable in light of the need for additional time to conduct testing (of the drugs in question) in accordance with Gonzales. While Appellant argues that the State took \u201ctoo long\u201d (after the Gonzales decision was announced) to request the continuance, we find that the State\u2019s request was made prior to the already scheduled jury trial.\n\nAppellant further argues that the continuance was unreasonable because the trial court focused on its schedule in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss. However, \u201cscheduling and docketing conflicts have been held to be reasonable grounds for extending an accused\u2019s trial date beyond the speedy trial limit date by both [the Appellate Court] and the Supreme Court of Ohio. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, \u00b6 11. See also, State v. Lee, 48 Ohio\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nSt.2d 208, 210, 357 N.E.2d 1095 (1976) (continuance due to \u201ccrowded docket & judge\u2019s conference\u201d was reasonable). Thus, we find that the continuance was reasonable, and therefore met the exception requirement listed in R.C. 2945.72(H).\n\n\u00b692 For the foregoing reasons, we find Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error not well taken and overrule the same.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fifth Assignment of Error\n\n\u00b693 In Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court was required to exclude Identification Officer Michael Carman\u2019s (\u201cCarman\u201d) expert testimony, because the State did not comply with Crim.R. 16(K). For the reasons that follow, we find that the trial court did not err in allowing the State\u2019s expert witness to testify.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b694 \u201cThe trial court has broad discretion over evidentiary rulings, and such rulings will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d State v. Workman, 3rd Dist. Van Wert No. 15-06-09, 171 Ohio App.3d 89, 2007-Ohio-1360, 869 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 10. See also, In re Sherman, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 05-04-47, 2005-Ohio-5888, \u00b6 27. An \u201c\u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 implies that the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably.\u201d Id. quoting Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). \u201cWhen applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, a reviewing court may not simply substitute its judgment for\nthat of the trial court. *Dindal v. Dindal*, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-09-06, 2009-Ohio-3528, \u00b6 6 citing *Blakemore*, supra.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n{\u00b695} Appellant alleges that the State violated Crim.R. 16(K) when it failed to provide an expert witness\u2019 report prior to the start of Appellant\u2019s jury trial. Crim.R. 16(K) states:\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b659} After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes charged proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Second Assignment of Error\n\n{\u00b660} Appellant argues that his convictions in both case number CR 2014 0118 and CR 2015 0361 were against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nStandard of Review\n\n{\u00b661} The Ohio Supreme Court has \u201c\u2018carefully distinguished the terms \u2018sufficiency\u2019 and \u2018weight\u2019 in criminal cases, declaring that \u2018manifest weight\u2019 and \u2018legal sufficiency\u2019 are \u2018both quantitatively and qualitatively different.\u2019\u201d Lyle, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-14-41, 2015-Ohio-1181, \u00b6 9 quoting Eastley v. Volkman, 132 Ohio St.3d 328, 2010-Ohio-2179, 972 N.E.2d 517, \u00b6 10.\n\n{\u00b662} In analyzing a claim that a conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court:\n\nsits as the \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d and may disagree with the fact finder\u2019s resolution of the conflicting testimony. * * * The appellate court, \u201c\u2018reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against conviction.\u2019\u201d\n\nState v. Johnson, 3rd Dist. Shelby No. 17-08-06, 2008-Ohio-4784, \u00b6 4 quoting State v. Jackson, 169 Ohio App.3d 440, 2006-Ohio-6059, 863 N.E.2d 223, \u00b614 (citations omitted). However, in sitting as the thirteenth juror the appellate court should give due deference to the findings made by the jury. Id.\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b663} The Eighth District Court of Appeals identified the following eight factors as a guide to assist a reviewing court in determining whether a decision of the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence:\n\n1. A reviewing court is not required to accept the incredible as true;\n2. Whether the evidence is uncontradicted;\n3. Whether a witness was impeached;\n4. What was not proved;\n5. Certainty of evidence;\n6. Reliability of evidence;\n7. Whether witness\u2019 testimony is self-serving;\n8. And whether evidence is vague, uncertain, conflicting, or fragmentary.\n\nState v. Mattison, 23 Ohio App.3d 10, 14, 490 N.E.2d 926 (8th Dist.1985). We discuss the relevant factors to each underlying case below.\n\nUncontradicted Evidence\n\n{\u00b664} Initially, we note that Appellant failed to introduce any evidence that contradicted the State\u2019s evidence at trial. In respect to case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant produced no evidence to contradict the State\u2019s testimony that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:00 a.m., the Lima Police Department was dispatched to 234 North Main Street in Lima, Ohio for a call of a suspicious vehicle sitting in\nthe parking lot. It is not disputed that the Appellant exited his vehicle when officers arrived, and when Kunkleman approached him, Appellant turned back and leaned into the car on the driver\u2019s side. It is further undisputed that officers could smell the smell of raw marijuana at this time and that officers grabbed Appellant and pulled him away from the vehicle for their safety.\n\n{\u00b665} There is no dispute that the Appellant, when ordered to put his hands up in the air, disregarded the officer\u2019s commands, which led to him being detained. A pat down of Appellant produced a large sum of money and marijuana, which led to his arrest and the subsequent search of the vehicle, which produced a large amount of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, digital scales, and Appellant\u2019s billfold. With no testimony or evidence produced at trial to cast doubt upon this version of events, Appellant cannot contradict the elements of possession of cocaine and possession of heroin as established by the State in case number CR 2014 0118.\n\n{\u00b666} In regards to case number CR 2015 0361, the State\u2019s uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that on January 17, 2015, after receiving an anonymous tip and surveilling the premises, law enforcement entered 1222 Catalpa Street after repeatedly requesting that Appellant come to the front door. Once inside the premises, and while conducting a protective sweep of the home, officers viewed a marijuana grow tent in plain view. Based on the information collected, officers obtained a search warrant and searched the premises in its entirety. During the\nsearch, officers located credit cards, mail, and other personal effects bearing Appellant\u2019s name.\n\n{\u00b667} While Appellant contends that no witness had personal knowledge that he occupied the premises, the evidence indicates otherwise. Specifically, many of Appellant\u2019s personal effects were found within the residence, which is indicative of occupation. Accordingly, we find that the uncontradicted evidence supports that Appellant was occupying the residence on January 17, 2015.\n\nImpeached Witness\n\n{\u00b668} A review of the record reveals that no witness for the State was impeached in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361.\n\nReliability of Evidence\n\n{\u00b669} With respect to case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant attempts to discredit the reliability of the testimony and evidence produced at trial, because \u201cnot one single witness [***] actually had personal knowledge of Appellant allegedly occupying the premises testified [to] at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). Appellant further classifies all of the testimony produced regarding occupation of the premises as \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\n{\u00b670} However, we find that the State produced competent and credible evidence that Appellant was occupying 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio at the time the officers conducted their raid. Specifically, officers testified that they\nobserved Appellant leave the back of the duplex in an attempt to flee, and then run back inside once he saw that officers had the duplex surrounded. Furthermore, the evidence established that officers personally observed Appellant leave out of the back of the residence prior to it being breached. With eyewitness testimony confirming that Appellant was, in fact, inside the residence, we find no merit in Appellant\u2019s argument in regards to reliability.\n\n**Self-Serving Testimony**\n\n{\u00b671} The record reveals that the trial court did not characterize any witness\u2019s testimony as self-serving in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, on review, we do not find any indicia of self-serving testimony in either case and Appellant does not argue that testimony was self-serving on appeal.\n\n**Vague, Uncertain, Conflicting, or Fragmentary Evidence**\n\n{\u00b672} In case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant points to the evidence produced at the suppression hearing to cast into doubt officers\u2019 testimony at trial. Specifically, Appellant argues that the officers, when testifying at the suppression hearing, described a \u201cmuch more leisurely encounter at the suppression hearing than they did at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). However, Appellant fails to develop this argument and further fails to demonstrate how this \u201cconflict\u201d in testimonies between the suppression hearing and trial creates a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting\nreversal. Even should Appellant establish that a true \u201cconflict\u201d exists in the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and the trial, and that such issue was properly before this Court, we find that the record contains competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. *Phelps v. Horn\u2019s Crop Serv. Ctr.*, 3rd Dist. Wyandot No. 16-89-8, 1990 WL 157282, * 2 (holding that the choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact)."}
{"Index": "084-Davis", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, TO THE PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT, BY DENYING APPELLANTS [SIC] MOTION TO SUPPRESS ALL EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN CASE NUMBER 0118.", "evidence": "{\u00b612} On July 7, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate Appellant\u2019s cases. (Doc. No. 137). Appellant filed his oppositions to the State\u2019s motion to\n\n---\n\n3 This is Case Number CR 2015 0361, which we will address infra.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nconsolidate on July 15, 2016 and on August 22, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 139; 159). On August 26, 2016 the trial court consolidated the cases. (Doc. No. 163).\n\n{\u00b613} On August 3, 2016, Appellant signed and filed a second waiver of his speedy trial rights in the trial court. (Doc. No. 155). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was rescheduled for December 20, 2016. (Doc. No. 169). On November 28, 2016, Appellant, through counsel, filed a motion to continue. (Doc. No. 171). Specifically, Appellant\u2019s trial counsel represented to the court that he had encountered difficulty contacting potential defense witnesses in preparation for trial. (Id.). A hearing was held on Appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance on November 30, 2016. (Doc. No. 174). At the hearing, Appellant refused to further waive his right to a speedy trial beyond the January 1, 2017 date set forth in Appellant\u2019s previous waiver. (Id. at 2). Despite Appellant\u2019s refusal, the trial court found that a sixty (60) day continuance was necessary and not unreasonable under the circumstances. (Id. at 8). Appellant\u2019s trial was set for February 21, 2017. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b614} On February 3, 2017, the State filed its motion for a continuance, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in State v. Gonzales, requiring that the State must prove the actual weight of a drug in question, (excluding any filler materials) to meet the statutory weight requirement. (Doc. No. 180). Stated better, based on the change in the prosecution of drug offenses under State v. Gonzales, the State requested additional time to determine the actual weight of the cocaine\npossessed by Appellant. Appellant objected to the State\u2019s motion for continuance. (Doc. No. 181). The trial court, finding that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom in drug prosecutions, granted the State\u2019s motion. (Doc. No. 182). Ultimately, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017. (Doc. No. 184).\n\n{\u00b615} On April 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss in the trial court. (Doc. No. 202). Specifically, Appellant requested that his cases be dismissed, pursuant to R.C. 2945.73(B) and R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), because he had been held in custody for 276 days, which exceeded the statutorily permissible 270 days. (Id.). The State responded to Appellant\u2019s motion, arguing that the time involving its continuance (of February 3, 2017) should not count against it, because that continuance was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d under the circumstances of the case. (Doc. No. 205). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motion on April 19, 2017. (Doc. No. 206).\n\n{\u00b616} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 211). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 214).\n\n{\u00b617} On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d and a \u201cmotion for continuance of trial date.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 237; 238). Appellant alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nwitnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions on August 1, 2017, finding that Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the cases. (Doc. No. 239).\n\n\u00b618 Appellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 243). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2014 0118, the State made an oral motion to amend Count One in the indictment, possession of cocaine, a felony of the first degree, to possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree. (Id.). The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion. (Id.) Further, the State made an oral motion to dismiss Count Three in the indictment, aggravated possession of drugs, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court also granted. (Id.). The Appellant did not object to either motion.\n\n\u00b619 Appellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding the Appellant guilty of Count I, possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree and of Count II, possession of heroin, a felony of the first degree. (Id.).\n\n\u00b620 Ultimately, and in case number CR 2014 0118, the trial court sentenced the Appellant to consecutive prison terms of six (6) years (Count I) and twelve (12) months (Count II) on September 14, 2017. (Doc. No. 244).\nFactual Background - Case Number 2015 CR 0361\n\n{\u00b621} On January 12 or 13, 2015, investigators with the West Central Ohio Criminal Task Force (\u201cWCOCTF\u201d) commenced an investigation to locate the Appellant, due to Appellant\u2019s outstanding warrants. (Doc. No. 100). On January 12, 2015, the Lima Police Department received an anonymous telephone call\\(^4\\) that Appellant was staying at 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio. (Id.). The caller further advised officers that Appellant was not a tenant on the lease at that location. (Id.). Sgt. Charles Godfrey, (\u201cGodfrey\u201d) then a supervisor at WCOCTF, attempted to contact the anonymous caller to verify the information provided, but was unable to do so. (Id.). So, based on the information provided (by the anonymous caller), Godfrey set up an undercover operation on January 13, 2015 to monitor the 1222 Catalpa Street residence in an attempt to locate Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b622} On January 17, 2015, Godfrey observed a Chrysler 300 parked at the Catalpa Street residence. (Id.). Later that day, an individual in a hooded sweatshirt left the residence in that vehicle. (Id.). Since the vehicle\u2019s windows were heavily tinted, and because Godfrey could not see inside it, Godfrey arranged for the Ohio State Highway Patrol to stop the vehicle for a tinted windows violation. (Id.). When the Chrysler was stopped a person identified as \u201cWatkins\u201d was located as a passenger in the vehicle. (Id.). Watkins told law enforcement officials that he and\n\n\\(^4\\) The anonymous caller was later identified as the landlord of the duplex wherein Appellant was staying. (See, Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 10/20/2016 Tr. at 7).\nthe driver had been visiting \u201cRay\u201d at 1222 Catalpa Street. (Id.). When shown a picture of Appellant, Watkins confirmed that \u201cRay\u201d was the Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b623} With that information (from Watkins), Godfrey returned to 1222 Catalpa Street, believing that Appellant was present in the residence. (Id.). And, after verifying that Appellant still had active outstanding warrants, Godfrey went to the residence\u2019s front door while law enforcement set up a perimeter around the house. (Id.). Godfrey knocked on the door, identified that he was a police officer, and that he had a warrant for Appellant\u2019s arrest. (Id.). Godfrey further advised that if the door wasn\u2019t opened it would be knocked down. (Id.).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b638} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 147). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 150).\nOn July 24, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel.\u201d (Doc. No. 173). On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed an additional \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d as well as a \u201cmotion for continuance of the trial date,\u201d \u201cmotion for specific discovery,\u201d and \u201cmotion to suppress evidence.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 180; 181; 182; 183). Appellant, through his various motions, alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena witnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The Appellant further alleged that the State had failed to provide specific discovery. (Doc. No. 182). On August 1, 2017, the trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions, finding that the Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the case. (Doc. No. 186).\n\nAppellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 194). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2015 0361, the State made an oral motion to amend Count Three in the indictment, possession of marijuana, a felony of the third degree, to possession of marijuana, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court granted. (Id.) The Appellant did not oppose the amendment. (Id.).\n\nAppellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding Appellant guilty of all charges. (Id.). Further, Appellant was found guilty of all specifications except for the specification for property (electronics) contained in Count One and Count Two. (Id.).\nAppellant was sentenced on September 14, 2017 in the trial court and was ordered to serve a prison term of: seven (7) years in prison under Count One; seven (7) years in prison under Count Two; twelve (12) months in prison under Count Three; thirty (30) months in prison under Count Four; and thirty-six (36) months in prison under Count Five. (Doc. No. 200). The trial court further ordered that all counts be served consecutively to each other and consecutively to the prison sentence imposed in case number CR 2014 0118. (Id.). With regards to the specifications, the firearms were ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; the money was ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; and the electronics (subject to the specification in Counts Three and Four) were ordered forfeited to the WCOCTF. (Id.). Appellant\u2019s prison sentences totaled twenty-eight (28) and a half years. (Id.).\n\nFrom the judgments in case number CR 2014 0118 and case number CR 2015 0361 Appellant timely appeals, and presents the following assignments of error for our review:\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. I\n\nAPPELLANTS [SIC] CONVICTIONS ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO.

VIII\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, TO THE PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT, BY DENYING APPELLANTS [SIC] MOTION TO SUPPRESS ALL EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN CASE NUMBER 0361.\nFor ease of discussion, we elect to address interrelated assignments together.\n\n**Appellant\u2019s First Assignment of Error**\n\nIn his first assignment of error, Appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence in both case number CR 2014 0118 and CR 2015 0361 to sustain his convictions. For the reasons outlined below, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n\u201cWhether there is legally sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict is a question of law.\u201d *State v. Lyle*, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-14-41, 2015-Ohio-1181, \u00b6 8 citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 1997-Ohio-52, 678 N.E.2d 541. Sufficiency is a test of adequacy. *Id.* Under a challenge alleging insufficient evidence, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *Id.* quoting *State v. Leonard*, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 77.\n\n**Analysis \u2013 Case Number CR 2014 0118**\n\nIn case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant was found guilty in Count I of possession of drugs (cocaine) and guilty in Count II of possession of drugs (heroin), both in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which states:\n(A) No person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2925.11(A).\n\n{\u00b648} On appeal, Appellant argues that the State failed to produce any evidence proving that Appellant owned or possessed the contents (i.e. heroin and cocaine) of the motor vehicle in question. \u201c\u2018Possess\u2019 or \u2018possession\u2019 means having control over a thing or substance, but may not be inferred solely from mere access to the thing or substance through ownership or occupation of the premises upon which the thing or substance is found.\u201d R.C. 2925.01(K). \u201c\u2018The issue of whether a person charged with drug possession knowingly possessed a controlled substance is to be determined from all the attendant facts and circumstances available.\u2019\u201d State v. Frye, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-17-30, 2018-Ohio-894, \u00b6 50 quoting State v. Brooks, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-11-11, 2012-Ohio-5235, \u00b6 45. See also, State v. Teamer, 82 Ohio St.3d 490, 492, 1998-Ohio-193, 696 N.E.2d 1049 (1998).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b673} Accordingly, we find that the weight of the evidence supports Appellant\u2019s convictions. We further find that the jury did not lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting Appellant of possession of cocaine and heroin in case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n**Appellant\u2019s Third Assignment of Error**\n\n{\u00b674} In his third assignment of error, Appellant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective, in part, because trial counsel failed to object to hearsay statements during trial. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n{\u00b675} \u201c\u2018When a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that the counsel\u2019s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d State v. Sanders, 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151, 2002-Ohio-350, 761 N.E.2d 18 quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). Additionally, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d Id., at 694. See also, State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 137, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).\n\n{\u00b676} In analyzing a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, this court\u2019s scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential, with a \u201c\u2018strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019\u201d Bradley, supra, at 142, quoting Strickland, supra, at 687-88. \u201cCounsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d Id.\n\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b677} At the outset, we note that Appellant, during the course of the proceedings below, had five (5) different attorneys represent him. Interestingly, Appellant does not specify which trial counsel was ineffective. However, it appears from this assignment that Appellant questions the effectiveness of his trial counsel.\nAppellant initially argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because trial counsel failed to object to any of the hearsay regarding Appellant residing in the residence during the raid by police officers, as charged in case number CR 2015 0361. However, we note that the failure to make objections is not alone enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Conway*, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 103. *See also, State v. Holloway*, 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831 (1988) (failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); *State v. Gumm*, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 428, 1995-Ohio-24, 653 N.E.2d 253 holding modified by *State v. Wogenstahl*, 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 1996-Ohio-219, 662 N.E.2d 311 (the failure to make objections does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel *per se*, as that failure may be justified as a tactical decision).\n\nNext, Appellant argues that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective because trial counsel did not *voir dire* Sergeant Dana Sutherland (\u201cSutherland\u201d), the State\u2019s marijuana expert witness. This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, the record reveals, and the Appellant concedes, that trial counsel objected to the expert being certified as an expert witness, and the trial court overruled the objection. (*See, Trial Tr., Vol. II, at 286*). And second, the record reveals that the Appellant\u2019s concerns with Sutherland\u2019s qualifications to testify as an expert were addressed by the trial court prior to trial. (*Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol.*\nI, at 11). Given the trial court\u2019s rulings, we do not find that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation under the facts presented.\n\nLastly, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective because his trial counsel failed to file a proper motion to sever the counts at the appropriate time during trial. However, the record is clear, and the Appellant concedes, that objections to the State\u2019s motions to consolidate were made and a motion to sever was filed prior to trial. (See, CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 139; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 48). Despite Appellant\u2019s objections and motion, the trial court found that the charges were of similar character and part of a common scheme or course of criminal conduct, then consolidated the cases and joined them for purposes of trial. (CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 163; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 82). Thus, because the trial court had already ruled on Appellant\u2019s motion to sever, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that a subsequent trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness by failing to file an additional motion to sever, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fourth Assignment of Error\n\nIn his fourth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss his cases based upon a speedy trial violation. Specifically, Appellant argues that the continuance granted at the request of the\nState beyond the February 21, 2017 trial date was unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b682 \u201cOur standard of review upon an appeal raising a speedy trial issue is to count the expired days as directed by R.C. 2945.71, et seq.\u201d State v. King, 3rd Dist. Marion No. 9-06-18, 2007-Ohio-335, \u00b6 30. See also, State v. DePue, 96 Ohio App.3d 513, 516, 645 N.E.2d 745 (4th Dist.1994). \u201cIf any ambiguity exists, we construe the record in favor of the accused.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b683 The applicable statutory speedy trial provision, R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), provides that a person charged with a felony shall be brought to trial within two hundred and seventy (270) days after the person\u2019s arrest. R.C. 2945.71(C)(2). In computing time under division (C)(2), \u201ceach day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charges shall be counted as three days.\u201d R.C. 2945.71(E).\n\n\u00b684 Further, R.C. 2945.73(B) provides:\n\nUpon motion made at or prior to the commencement of trial, a person charged with an offense shall be discharged if he is not brought to trial within the time required by sections 2945.71 and 2945.72 of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n{\u00b685} In the instant matter, both the State and Appellant agree that Appellant\u2019s speedy trial rights were upheld throughout the proceedings up until Appellant\u2019s scheduled jury trial on February 21, 2017. However, at the request of the State, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017, outside of the Appellant\u2019s statutory speedy trial period. Thus, the question before us is not whether Appellant was brought to trial within the statutorily permitted time frame, but rather, was the speedy trial violation permissible under the circumstances of the case. We answer that question in the affirmative.\n\n{\u00b686} R.C. 2945.72, entitled \u201cextension of time for hearing or trial,\u201d allows for an extension of time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances. R.C. 2945.72(H) provides:\n\nThe time within which an accused must be brought to trial, or, in the case of felony, to preliminary hearing and trial, may be extended only by the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(H) The period of any continuance granted on the accused\u2019s own motion, and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused\u2019s own motion.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2945.72(H).\nThe resolution of this issue, therefore, depends upon whether the trial court\u2019s continuance was reasonable. \u201cDetermining the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of the continuance beyond the ninety-day stricture of R.C. 2945.71, invariably, \u2018depends on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u2019\u201d State v. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, \u00b6 10, quoting State v. Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988). \u201c\u2018In addition, precedent requires that such a continuance be necessary under the circumstances of the case.\u2019\u201d Id. quoting Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988) citing City of Aurora v. Patrick, 61 Ohio St.2d 107, 108-09, 399 N.E.2d 1220 (1980).\n\nOn February 3, 2017, the State requested a continuance of the trial date, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in State v. Gonzales. See, State v. Gonzales, 150 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-Ohio-8319, 81 N.E.3d 405, reconsideration granted, decision vacated, 150 Ohio St.3d 276, 2017-Ohio-777, 81 N.E.3d 419, reconsideration denied, 149 Ohio St.3d 1409, 2017-Ohio-2822, 74 N.E.3d 466. In Gonzales, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the offense level for possession of cocaine was determined only by the weight of the actual cocaine, not by the total weight of cocaine plus any filler. Id. at \u00b6 22. This opinion was inconsistent with prior case law on the same topic. Id. at \u00b6 51. Given the new purity requirements, the State requested a continuance to send Appellant\u2019s cocaine to a lab equipped to determine the weight of actual cocaine, separate from the filler weight.\nThe trial court, on February 9, 2017, granted the State\u2019s request for a continuance and set Appellant\u2019s jury trial for May 16, 2017. (Case number CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 182; case number CR 2015, Doc. No. 109). In granting the continuance, the trial court acknowledged that State v. Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom. Furthermore, the trial court relied on the Seventh District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in State v. High, wherein the Appellate court held that an extension request by the State for testing of evidence was reasonable. State v. High, 143 Ohio App.3d 232, 242, 2001-Ohio-3530, 757 N.E.2d 1176.\n\nWe find that the continuance was reasonable in light of the need for additional time to conduct testing (of the drugs in question) in accordance with Gonzales. While Appellant argues that the State took \u201ctoo long\u201d (after the Gonzales decision was announced) to request the continuance, we find that the State\u2019s request was made prior to the already scheduled jury trial.\n\nAppellant further argues that the continuance was unreasonable because the trial court focused on its schedule in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss. However, \u201cscheduling and docketing conflicts have been held to be reasonable grounds for extending an accused\u2019s trial date beyond the speedy trial limit date by both [the Appellate Court] and the Supreme Court of Ohio. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, \u00b6 11. See also, State v. Lee, 48 Ohio\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nSt.2d 208, 210, 357 N.E.2d 1095 (1976) (continuance due to \u201ccrowded docket & judge\u2019s conference\u201d was reasonable). Thus, we find that the continuance was reasonable, and therefore met the exception requirement listed in R.C. 2945.72(H).\n\n\u00b692 For the foregoing reasons, we find Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error not well taken and overrule the same.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fifth Assignment of Error\n\n\u00b693 In Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court was required to exclude Identification Officer Michael Carman\u2019s (\u201cCarman\u201d) expert testimony, because the State did not comply with Crim.R. 16(K). For the reasons that follow, we find that the trial court did not err in allowing the State\u2019s expert witness to testify.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b694 \u201cThe trial court has broad discretion over evidentiary rulings, and such rulings will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d State v. Workman, 3rd Dist. Van Wert No. 15-06-09, 171 Ohio App.3d 89, 2007-Ohio-1360, 869 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 10. See also, In re Sherman, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 05-04-47, 2005-Ohio-5888, \u00b6 27. An \u201c\u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 implies that the trial court acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or unconscionably.\u201d Id. quoting Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). \u201cWhen applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, a reviewing court may not simply substitute its judgment for\nthat of the trial court. *Dindal v. Dindal*, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-09-06, 2009-Ohio-3528, \u00b6 6 citing *Blakemore*, supra.\n\n**Analysis**\n\n{\u00b695} Appellant alleges that the State violated Crim.R. 16(K) when it failed to provide an expert witness\u2019 report prior to the start of Appellant\u2019s jury trial. Crim.R. 16(K) states:\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b659} After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes charged proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Second Assignment of Error\n\n{\u00b660} Appellant argues that his convictions in both case number CR 2014 0118 and CR 2015 0361 were against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nStandard of Review\n\n{\u00b661} The Ohio Supreme Court has \u201c\u2018carefully distinguished the terms \u2018sufficiency\u2019 and \u2018weight\u2019 in criminal cases, declaring that \u2018manifest weight\u2019 and \u2018legal sufficiency\u2019 are \u2018both quantitatively and qualitatively different.\u2019\u201d Lyle, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-14-41, 2015-Ohio-1181, \u00b6 9 quoting Eastley v. Volkman, 132 Ohio St.3d 328, 2010-Ohio-2179, 972 N.E.2d 517, \u00b6 10.\n\n{\u00b662} In analyzing a claim that a conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court:\n\nsits as the \u201cthirteenth juror\u201d and may disagree with the fact finder\u2019s resolution of the conflicting testimony. * * * The appellate court, \u201c\u2018reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against conviction.\u2019\u201d\n\nState v. Johnson, 3rd Dist. Shelby No. 17-08-06, 2008-Ohio-4784, \u00b6 4 quoting State v. Jackson, 169 Ohio App.3d 440, 2006-Ohio-6059, 863 N.E.2d 223, \u00b614 (citations omitted). However, in sitting as the thirteenth juror the appellate court should give due deference to the findings made by the jury. Id.\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b663} The Eighth District Court of Appeals identified the following eight factors as a guide to assist a reviewing court in determining whether a decision of the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence:\n\n1. A reviewing court is not required to accept the incredible as true;\n2. Whether the evidence is uncontradicted;\n3. Whether a witness was impeached;\n4. What was not proved;\n5. Certainty of evidence;\n6. Reliability of evidence;\n7. Whether witness\u2019 testimony is self-serving;\n8. And whether evidence is vague, uncertain, conflicting, or fragmentary.\n\nState v. Mattison, 23 Ohio App.3d 10, 14, 490 N.E.2d 926 (8th Dist.1985). We discuss the relevant factors to each underlying case below.\n\nUncontradicted Evidence\n\n{\u00b664} Initially, we note that Appellant failed to introduce any evidence that contradicted the State\u2019s evidence at trial. In respect to case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant produced no evidence to contradict the State\u2019s testimony that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:00 a.m., the Lima Police Department was dispatched to 234 North Main Street in Lima, Ohio for a call of a suspicious vehicle sitting in\nthe parking lot. It is not disputed that the Appellant exited his vehicle when officers arrived, and when Kunkleman approached him, Appellant turned back and leaned into the car on the driver\u2019s side. It is further undisputed that officers could smell the smell of raw marijuana at this time and that officers grabbed Appellant and pulled him away from the vehicle for their safety.\n\n{\u00b665} There is no dispute that the Appellant, when ordered to put his hands up in the air, disregarded the officer\u2019s commands, which led to him being detained. A pat down of Appellant produced a large sum of money and marijuana, which led to his arrest and the subsequent search of the vehicle, which produced a large amount of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, digital scales, and Appellant\u2019s billfold. With no testimony or evidence produced at trial to cast doubt upon this version of events, Appellant cannot contradict the elements of possession of cocaine and possession of heroin as established by the State in case number CR 2014 0118.\n\n{\u00b666} In regards to case number CR 2015 0361, the State\u2019s uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that on January 17, 2015, after receiving an anonymous tip and surveilling the premises, law enforcement entered 1222 Catalpa Street after repeatedly requesting that Appellant come to the front door. Once inside the premises, and while conducting a protective sweep of the home, officers viewed a marijuana grow tent in plain view. Based on the information collected, officers obtained a search warrant and searched the premises in its entirety. During the\nsearch, officers located credit cards, mail, and other personal effects bearing Appellant\u2019s name.\n\n{\u00b667} While Appellant contends that no witness had personal knowledge that he occupied the premises, the evidence indicates otherwise. Specifically, many of Appellant\u2019s personal effects were found within the residence, which is indicative of occupation. Accordingly, we find that the uncontradicted evidence supports that Appellant was occupying the residence on January 17, 2015.\n\nImpeached Witness\n\n{\u00b668} A review of the record reveals that no witness for the State was impeached in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361.\n\nReliability of Evidence\n\n{\u00b669} With respect to case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant attempts to discredit the reliability of the testimony and evidence produced at trial, because \u201cnot one single witness [***] actually had personal knowledge of Appellant allegedly occupying the premises testified [to] at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). Appellant further classifies all of the testimony produced regarding occupation of the premises as \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\n{\u00b670} However, we find that the State produced competent and credible evidence that Appellant was occupying 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio at the time the officers conducted their raid. Specifically, officers testified that they\nobserved Appellant leave the back of the duplex in an attempt to flee, and then run back inside once he saw that officers had the duplex surrounded. Furthermore, the evidence established that officers personally observed Appellant leave out of the back of the residence prior to it being breached. With eyewitness testimony confirming that Appellant was, in fact, inside the residence, we find no merit in Appellant\u2019s argument in regards to reliability.\n\n**Self-Serving Testimony**\n\n{\u00b671} The record reveals that the trial court did not characterize any witness\u2019s testimony as self-serving in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, on review, we do not find any indicia of self-serving testimony in either case and Appellant does not argue that testimony was self-serving on appeal.\n\n**Vague, Uncertain, Conflicting, or Fragmentary Evidence**\n\n{\u00b672} In case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant points to the evidence produced at the suppression hearing to cast into doubt officers\u2019 testimony at trial. Specifically, Appellant argues that the officers, when testifying at the suppression hearing, described a \u201cmuch more leisurely encounter at the suppression hearing than they did at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). However, Appellant fails to develop this argument and further fails to demonstrate how this \u201cconflict\u201d in testimonies between the suppression hearing and trial creates a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting\nreversal. Even should Appellant establish that a true \u201cconflict\u201d exists in the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and the trial, and that such issue was properly before this Court, we find that the record contains competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. *Phelps v.

Wyandot No. 16-89-8, 1990 WL 157282, * 2 (holding that the choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact)."}
{"Index": "084-Davis", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT ERRED, TO THE PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT, BY DENYING APPELLANTS [SIC] MOTION TO SUPPRESS ALL EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN CASE NUMBER 0361.", "evidence": "{\u00b612} On July 7, 2016, the State filed a motion to consolidate Appellant\u2019s cases. (Doc. No. 137). Appellant filed his oppositions to the State\u2019s motion to\n\n---\n\n3 This is Case Number CR 2015 0361, which we will address infra.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nconsolidate on July 15, 2016 and on August 22, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 139; 159). On August 26, 2016 the trial court consolidated the cases. (Doc. No. 163).\n\n{\u00b613} On August 3, 2016, Appellant signed and filed a second waiver of his speedy trial rights in the trial court. (Doc. No. 155). Appellant\u2019s jury trial was rescheduled for December 20, 2016. (Doc. No. 169). On November 28, 2016, Appellant, through counsel, filed a motion to continue. (Doc. No. 171). Specifically, Appellant\u2019s trial counsel represented to the court that he had encountered difficulty contacting potential defense witnesses in preparation for trial. (Id.). A hearing was held on Appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance on November 30, 2016. (Doc. No. 174). At the hearing, Appellant refused to further waive his right to a speedy trial beyond the January 1, 2017 date set forth in Appellant\u2019s previous waiver. (Id. at 2). Despite Appellant\u2019s refusal, the trial court found that a sixty (60) day continuance was necessary and not unreasonable under the circumstances. (Id. at 8). Appellant\u2019s trial was set for February 21, 2017. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b614} On February 3, 2017, the State filed its motion for a continuance, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in State v. Gonzales, requiring that the State must prove the actual weight of a drug in question, (excluding any filler materials) to meet the statutory weight requirement. (Doc. No. 180). Stated better, based on the change in the prosecution of drug offenses under State v. Gonzales, the State requested additional time to determine the actual weight of the cocaine\npossessed by Appellant. Appellant objected to the State\u2019s motion for continuance. (Doc. No. 181). The trial court, finding that the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom in drug prosecutions, granted the State\u2019s motion. (Doc. No. 182). Ultimately, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017. (Doc. No. 184).\n\n{\u00b615} On April 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss in the trial court. (Doc. No. 202). Specifically, Appellant requested that his cases be dismissed, pursuant to R.C. 2945.73(B) and R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), because he had been held in custody for 276 days, which exceeded the statutorily permissible 270 days. (Id.). The State responded to Appellant\u2019s motion, arguing that the time involving its continuance (of February 3, 2017) should not count against it, because that continuance was \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d under the circumstances of the case. (Doc. No. 205). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motion on April 19, 2017. (Doc. No. 206).\n\n{\u00b616} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 211). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 214).\n\n{\u00b617} On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d and a \u201cmotion for continuance of trial date.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 237; 238). Appellant alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nwitnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions on August 1, 2017, finding that Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the cases. (Doc. No. 239).\n\n\u00b618 Appellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 243). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2014 0118, the State made an oral motion to amend Count One in the indictment, possession of cocaine, a felony of the first degree, to possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree. (Id.). The trial court granted the State\u2019s motion. (Id.) Further, the State made an oral motion to dismiss Count Three in the indictment, aggravated possession of drugs, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court also granted. (Id.). The Appellant did not object to either motion.\n\n\u00b619 Appellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding the Appellant guilty of Count I, possession of cocaine, a felony of the second degree and of Count II, possession of heroin, a felony of the first degree. (Id.).\n\n\u00b620 Ultimately, and in case number CR 2014 0118, the trial court sentenced the Appellant to consecutive prison terms of six (6) years (Count I) and twelve (12) months (Count II) on September 14, 2017. (Doc. No. 244).\nFactual Background - Case Number 2015 CR 0361\n\n{\u00b621} On January 12 or 13, 2015, investigators with the West Central Ohio Criminal Task Force (\u201cWCOCTF\u201d) commenced an investigation to locate the Appellant, due to Appellant\u2019s outstanding warrants. (Doc. No. 100). On January 12, 2015, the Lima Police Department received an anonymous telephone call\\(^4\\) that Appellant was staying at 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio. (Id.). The caller further advised officers that Appellant was not a tenant on the lease at that location. (Id.). Sgt. Charles Godfrey, (\u201cGodfrey\u201d) then a supervisor at WCOCTF, attempted to contact the anonymous caller to verify the information provided, but was unable to do so. (Id.). So, based on the information provided (by the anonymous caller), Godfrey set up an undercover operation on January 13, 2015 to monitor the 1222 Catalpa Street residence in an attempt to locate Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b622} On January 17, 2015, Godfrey observed a Chrysler 300 parked at the Catalpa Street residence. (Id.). Later that day, an individual in a hooded sweatshirt left the residence in that vehicle. (Id.). Since the vehicle\u2019s windows were heavily tinted, and because Godfrey could not see inside it, Godfrey arranged for the Ohio State Highway Patrol to stop the vehicle for a tinted windows violation. (Id.). When the Chrysler was stopped a person identified as \u201cWatkins\u201d was located as a passenger in the vehicle. (Id.). Watkins told law enforcement officials that he and\n\n\\(^4\\) The anonymous caller was later identified as the landlord of the duplex wherein Appellant was staying. (See, Mot. to Suppress Hrg., 10/20/2016 Tr. at 7).\nthe driver had been visiting \u201cRay\u201d at 1222 Catalpa Street. (Id.). When shown a picture of Appellant, Watkins confirmed that \u201cRay\u201d was the Appellant. (Id.).\n\n{\u00b623} With that information (from Watkins), Godfrey returned to 1222 Catalpa Street, believing that Appellant was present in the residence. (Id.). And, after verifying that Appellant still had active outstanding warrants, Godfrey went to the residence\u2019s front door while law enforcement set up a perimeter around the house. (Id.). Godfrey knocked on the door, identified that he was a police officer, and that he had a warrant for Appellant\u2019s arrest. (Id.). Godfrey further advised that if the door wasn\u2019t opened it would be knocked down. (Id.).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b638} On May 9, 2017, the Appellant fired his trial counsel and a new attorney was appointed to represent the Appellant. (Doc. No. 147). As a result, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 150).\nOn July 24, 2017, Appellant filed a pro se \u201cmotion for pro se counsel.\u201d (Doc. No. 173). On July 28, 2017, Appellant filed an additional \u201cmotion for pro se counsel\u201d as well as a \u201cmotion for continuance of the trial date,\u201d \u201cmotion for specific discovery,\u201d and \u201cmotion to suppress evidence.\u201d (Doc. Nos. 180; 181; 182; 183). Appellant, through his various motions, alleged that his current counsel had failed to file pretrial motions and subpoena witnesses in preparation for his upcoming trial. (Id.). The Appellant further alleged that the State had failed to provide specific discovery. (Doc. No. 182). On August 1, 2017, the trial court overruled Appellant\u2019s motions, finding that the Appellant had five (5) different attorneys during the pendency of his cases, and that extensive pretrial discovery had been conducted during the course of the case. (Doc. No. 186).\n\nAppellant\u2019s jury trial commenced on August 1, 2017. (Doc. No. 194). Prior to the start of the trial, in case number CR 2015 0361, the State made an oral motion to amend Count Three in the indictment, possession of marijuana, a felony of the third degree, to possession of marijuana, a felony of the fifth degree, which the trial court granted. (Id.) The Appellant did not oppose the amendment. (Id.).\n\nAppellant\u2019s trial ended August 3, 2017, with the jury finding Appellant guilty of all charges. (Id.). Further, Appellant was found guilty of all specifications except for the specification for property (electronics) contained in Count One and Count Two. (Id.).\nAppellant was sentenced on September 14, 2017 in the trial court and was ordered to serve a prison term of: seven (7) years in prison under Count One; seven (7) years in prison under Count Two; twelve (12) months in prison under Count Three; thirty (30) months in prison under Count Four; and thirty-six (36) months in prison under Count Five. (Doc. No. 200). The trial court further ordered that all counts be served consecutively to each other and consecutively to the prison sentence imposed in case number CR 2014 0118. (Id.). With regards to the specifications, the firearms were ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; the money was ordered to be forfeited to the WCOCTF; and the electronics (subject to the specification in Counts Three and Four) were ordered forfeited to the WCOCTF. (Id.). Appellant\u2019s prison sentences totaled twenty-eight (28) and a half years. (Id.).\n\nFrom the judgments in case number CR 2014 0118 and case number CR 2015 0361 Appellant timely appeals, and presents the following assignments of error for our review:\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. I\n\nAPPELLANTS [SIC] CONVICTIONS ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. II\n\nAPPELLANTS [SIC] CONVICTIONS ARE AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO.

VIII\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED, TO THE PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT, BY DENYING APPELLANTS [SIC] MOTION TO SUPPRESS ALL EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN CASE NUMBER 0361.\nFor ease of discussion, we elect to address interrelated assignments together.\n\n**Appellant\u2019s First Assignment of Error**\n\nIn his first assignment of error, Appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence in both case number CR 2014 0118 and CR 2015 0361 to sustain his convictions. For the reasons outlined below, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n\u201cWhether there is legally sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict is a question of law.\u201d *State v. Lyle*, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-14-41, 2015-Ohio-1181, \u00b6 8 citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 1997-Ohio-52, 678 N.E.2d 541. Sufficiency is a test of adequacy. *Id.* Under a challenge alleging insufficient evidence, \u201cthe relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d *Id.* quoting *State v. Leonard*, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 77.\n\n**Analysis \u2013 Case Number CR 2014 0118**\n\nIn case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant was found guilty in Count I of possession of drugs (cocaine) and guilty in Count II of possession of drugs (heroin), both in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which states:\n(A) No person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2925.11(A).\n\n{\u00b648} On appeal, Appellant argues that the State failed to produce any evidence proving that Appellant owned or possessed the contents (i.e. heroin and cocaine) of the motor vehicle in question. \u201c\u2018Possess\u2019 or \u2018possession\u2019 means having control over a thing or substance, but may not be inferred solely from mere access to the thing or substance through ownership or occupation of the premises upon which the thing or substance is found.\u201d R.C. 2925.01(K). \u201c\u2018The issue of whether a person charged with drug possession knowingly possessed a controlled substance is to be determined from all the attendant facts and circumstances available.\u2019\u201d State v. Frye, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1-17-30, 2018-Ohio-894, \u00b6 50 quoting State v. Brooks, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-11-11, 2012-Ohio-5235, \u00b6 45. See also, State v. Teamer, 82 Ohio St.3d 490, 492, 1998-Ohio-193, 696 N.E.2d 1049 (1998).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b673} Accordingly, we find that the weight of the evidence supports Appellant\u2019s convictions. We further find that the jury did not lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting Appellant of possession of cocaine and heroin in case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n**Appellant\u2019s Third Assignment of Error**\n\n{\u00b674} In his third assignment of error, Appellant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective, in part, because trial counsel failed to object to hearsay statements during trial. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n{\u00b675} \u201c\u2018When a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel\u2019s assistance, the defendant must show that the counsel\u2019s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d State v. Sanders, 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151, 2002-Ohio-350, 761 N.E.2d 18 quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). Additionally, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d Id., at 694. See also, State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 137, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).\n\n{\u00b676} In analyzing a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, this court\u2019s scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential, with a \u201c\u2018strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019\u201d Bradley, supra, at 142, quoting Strickland, supra, at 687-88. \u201cCounsel\u2019s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel\u2019s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d Id.\n\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b677} At the outset, we note that Appellant, during the course of the proceedings below, had five (5) different attorneys represent him. Interestingly, Appellant does not specify which trial counsel was ineffective. However, it appears from this assignment that Appellant questions the effectiveness of his trial counsel.\nAppellant initially argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because trial counsel failed to object to any of the hearsay regarding Appellant residing in the residence during the raid by police officers, as charged in case number CR 2015 0361. However, we note that the failure to make objections is not alone enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Conway*, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 103. *See also, State v. Holloway*, 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831 (1988) (failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); *State v. Gumm*, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 428, 1995-Ohio-24, 653 N.E.2d 253 holding modified by *State v. Wogenstahl*, 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 1996-Ohio-219, 662 N.E.2d 311 (the failure to make objections does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel *per se*, as that failure may be justified as a tactical decision).\n\nNext, Appellant argues that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective because trial counsel did not *voir dire* Sergeant Dana Sutherland (\u201cSutherland\u201d), the State\u2019s marijuana expert witness. This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, the record reveals, and the Appellant concedes, that trial counsel objected to the expert being certified as an expert witness, and the trial court overruled the objection. (*See, Trial Tr., Vol. II, at 286*). And second, the record reveals that the Appellant\u2019s concerns with Sutherland\u2019s qualifications to testify as an expert were addressed by the trial court prior to trial. (*Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol.*\nI, at 11). Given the trial court\u2019s rulings, we do not find that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation under the facts presented.\n\nLastly, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective because his trial counsel failed to file a proper motion to sever the counts at the appropriate time during trial. However, the record is clear, and the Appellant concedes, that objections to the State\u2019s motions to consolidate were made and a motion to sever was filed prior to trial. (See, CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 139; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 48). Despite Appellant\u2019s objections and motion, the trial court found that the charges were of similar character and part of a common scheme or course of criminal conduct, then consolidated the cases and joined them for purposes of trial. (CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 163; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 82). Thus, because the trial court had already ruled on Appellant\u2019s motion to sever, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that a subsequent trial counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness by failing to file an additional motion to sever, and we overrule Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fourth Assignment of Error\n\nIn his fourth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss his cases based upon a speedy trial violation. Specifically, Appellant argues that the continuance granted at the request of the\nState beyond the February 21, 2017 trial date was unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b682 \u201cOur standard of review upon an appeal raising a speedy trial issue is to count the expired days as directed by R.C. 2945.71, et seq.\u201d State v. King, 3rd Dist. Marion No. 9-06-18, 2007-Ohio-335, \u00b6 30. See also, State v. DePue, 96 Ohio App.3d 513, 516, 645 N.E.2d 745 (4th Dist.1994). \u201cIf any ambiguity exists, we construe the record in favor of the accused.\u201d Id.\n\n\u00b683 The applicable statutory speedy trial provision, R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), provides that a person charged with a felony shall be brought to trial within two hundred and seventy (270) days after the person\u2019s arrest. R.C. 2945.71(C)(2). In computing time under division (C)(2), \u201ceach day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charges shall be counted as three days.\u201d R.C. 2945.71(E).\n\n\u00b684 Further, R.C. 2945.73(B) provides:\n\nUpon motion made at or prior to the commencement of trial, a person charged with an offense shall be discharged if he is not brought to trial within the time required by sections 2945.71 and 2945.72 of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). \u201cR.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are \u2018mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.\u2019\u201d King at \u00b6 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). \u201cHowever, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.\u201d *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n{\u00b685} In the instant matter, both the State and Appellant agree that Appellant\u2019s speedy trial rights were upheld throughout the proceedings up until Appellant\u2019s scheduled jury trial on February 21, 2017. However, at the request of the State, Appellant\u2019s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017, outside of the Appellant\u2019s statutory speedy trial period. Thus, the question before us is not whether Appellant was brought to trial within the statutorily permitted time frame, but rather, was the speedy trial violation permissible under the circumstances of the case. We answer that question in the affirmative.\n\n{\u00b686} R.C. 2945.72, entitled \u201cextension of time for hearing or trial,\u201d allows for an extension of time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances. R.C. 2945.72(H) provides:\n\nThe time within which an accused must be brought to trial, or, in the case of felony, to preliminary hearing and trial, may be extended only by the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(H) The period of any continuance granted on the accused\u2019s own motion, and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused\u2019s own motion.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2945.72(H).\nThe resolution of this issue, therefore, depends upon whether the trial court\u2019s continuance was reasonable. \u201cDetermining the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of the continuance beyond the ninety-day stricture of R.C. 2945.71, invariably, \u2018depends on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u2019\u201d State v. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, \u00b6 10, quoting State v. Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988). \u201c\u2018In addition, precedent requires that such a continuance be necessary under the circumstances of the case.\u2019\u201d Id. quoting Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988) citing City of Aurora v. Patrick, 61 Ohio St.2d 107, 108-09, 399 N.E.2d 1220 (1980).\n\nOn February 3, 2017, the State requested a continuance of the trial date, due to the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in State v. Gonzales. See, State v. Gonzales, 150 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-Ohio-8319, 81 N.E.3d 405, reconsideration granted, decision vacated, 150 Ohio St.3d 276, 2017-Ohio-777, 81 N.E.3d 419, reconsideration denied, 149 Ohio St.3d 1409, 2017-Ohio-2822, 74 N.E.3d 466. In Gonzales, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the offense level for possession of cocaine was determined only by the weight of the actual cocaine, not by the total weight of cocaine plus any filler. Id. at \u00b6 22. This opinion was inconsistent with prior case law on the same topic. Id. at \u00b6 51. Given the new purity requirements, the State requested a continuance to send Appellant\u2019s cocaine to a lab equipped to determine the weight of actual cocaine, separate from the filler weight.\nThe trial court, on February 9, 2017, granted the State\u2019s request for a continuance and set Appellant\u2019s jury trial for May 16, 2017. (Case number CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 182; case number CR 2015, Doc. No. 109). In granting the continuance, the trial court acknowledged that State v. Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom. Furthermore, the trial court relied on the Seventh District Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in State v. High, wherein the Appellate court held that an extension request by the State for testing of evidence was reasonable. State v. High, 143 Ohio App.3d 232, 242, 2001-Ohio-3530, 757 N.E.2d 1176.\n\nWe find that the continuance was reasonable in light of the need for additional time to conduct testing (of the drugs in question) in accordance with Gonzales. While Appellant argues that the State took \u201ctoo long\u201d (after the Gonzales decision was announced) to request the continuance, we find that the State\u2019s request was made prior to the already scheduled jury trial.\n\nAppellant further argues that the continuance was unreasonable because the trial court focused on its schedule in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss. However, \u201cscheduling and docketing conflicts have been held to be reasonable grounds for extending an accused\u2019s trial date beyond the speedy trial limit date by both [the Appellate Court] and the Supreme Court of Ohio.

Thus, we find that the continuance was reasonable, and therefore met the exception requirement listed in R.C. 2945.72(H).\n\n\u00b692 For the foregoing reasons, we find Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error not well taken and overrule the same.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Fifth Assignment of Error\n\n\u00b693 In Appellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error, Appellant argues that the trial court was required to exclude Identification Officer Michael Carman\u2019s (\u201cCarman\u201d) expert testimony, because the State did not comply with Crim.R. 16(K). For the reasons that follow, we find that the trial court did not err in allowing the State\u2019s expert witness to testify.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n\u00b694 \u201cThe trial court has broad discretion over evidentiary rulings, and such rulings will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d State v.

Crim.R. 16(K) states:\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b659} After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes charged proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error in its entirety.\n\nAppellant\u2019s Second Assignment of Error\n\n{\u00b660} Appellant argues that his convictions in both case number CR 2014 0118 and CR 2015 0361 were against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\nCase Nos. 1-17-44 and 1-17-45\n\nStandard of Review\n\n{\u00b661} The Ohio Supreme Court has \u201c\u2018carefully distinguished the terms \u2018sufficiency\u2019 and \u2018weight\u2019 in criminal cases, declaring that \u2018manifest weight\u2019 and \u2018legal sufficiency\u2019 are \u2018both quantitatively and qualitatively different.\u2019\u201d Lyle, 3rd Dist.

However, in sitting as the thirteenth juror the appellate court should give due deference to the findings made by the jury. Id.\nAnalysis\n\n{\u00b663} The Eighth District Court of Appeals identified the following eight factors as a guide to assist a reviewing court in determining whether a decision of the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence:\n\n1. A reviewing court is not required to accept the incredible as true;\n2. Whether the evidence is uncontradicted;\n3. Whether a witness was impeached;\n4. What was not proved;\n5. Certainty of evidence;\n6. Reliability of evidence;\n7. Whether witness\u2019 testimony is self-serving;\n8. And whether evidence is vague, uncertain, conflicting, or fragmentary.\n\nState v. Mattison, 23 Ohio App.3d 10, 14, 490 N.E.2d 926 (8th Dist.1985). We discuss the relevant factors to each underlying case below.\n\nUncontradicted Evidence\n\n{\u00b664} Initially, we note that Appellant failed to introduce any evidence that contradicted the State\u2019s evidence at trial. In respect to case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant produced no evidence to contradict the State\u2019s testimony that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:00 a.m., the Lima Police Department was dispatched to 234 North Main Street in Lima, Ohio for a call of a suspicious vehicle sitting in\nthe parking lot. It is not disputed that the Appellant exited his vehicle when officers arrived, and when Kunkleman approached him, Appellant turned back and leaned into the car on the driver\u2019s side. It is further undisputed that officers could smell the smell of raw marijuana at this time and that officers grabbed Appellant and pulled him away from the vehicle for their safety.\n\n{\u00b665} There is no dispute that the Appellant, when ordered to put his hands up in the air, disregarded the officer\u2019s commands, which led to him being detained. A pat down of Appellant produced a large sum of money and marijuana, which led to his arrest and the subsequent search of the vehicle, which produced a large amount of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, digital scales, and Appellant\u2019s billfold. With no testimony or evidence produced at trial to cast doubt upon this version of events, Appellant cannot contradict the elements of possession of cocaine and possession of heroin as established by the State in case number CR 2014 0118.\n\n{\u00b666} In regards to case number CR 2015 0361, the State\u2019s uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that on January 17, 2015, after receiving an anonymous tip and surveilling the premises, law enforcement entered 1222 Catalpa Street after repeatedly requesting that Appellant come to the front door. Once inside the premises, and while conducting a protective sweep of the home, officers viewed a marijuana grow tent in plain view. Based on the information collected, officers obtained a search warrant and searched the premises in its entirety. During the\nsearch, officers located credit cards, mail, and other personal effects bearing Appellant\u2019s name.\n\n{\u00b667} While Appellant contends that no witness had personal knowledge that he occupied the premises, the evidence indicates otherwise. Specifically, many of Appellant\u2019s personal effects were found within the residence, which is indicative of occupation. Accordingly, we find that the uncontradicted evidence supports that Appellant was occupying the residence on January 17, 2015.\n\nImpeached Witness\n\n{\u00b668} A review of the record reveals that no witness for the State was impeached in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361.\n\nReliability of Evidence\n\n{\u00b669} With respect to case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant attempts to discredit the reliability of the testimony and evidence produced at trial, because \u201cnot one single witness [***] actually had personal knowledge of Appellant allegedly occupying the premises testified [to] at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). Appellant further classifies all of the testimony produced regarding occupation of the premises as \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\n{\u00b670} However, we find that the State produced competent and credible evidence that Appellant was occupying 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio at the time the officers conducted their raid. Specifically, officers testified that they\nobserved Appellant leave the back of the duplex in an attempt to flee, and then run back inside once he saw that officers had the duplex surrounded. Furthermore, the evidence established that officers personally observed Appellant leave out of the back of the residence prior to it being breached. With eyewitness testimony confirming that Appellant was, in fact, inside the residence, we find no merit in Appellant\u2019s argument in regards to reliability.\n\n**Self-Serving Testimony**\n\n{\u00b671} The record reveals that the trial court did not characterize any witness\u2019s testimony as self-serving in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, on review, we do not find any indicia of self-serving testimony in either case and Appellant does not argue that testimony was self-serving on appeal.\n\n**Vague, Uncertain, Conflicting, or Fragmentary Evidence**\n\n{\u00b672} In case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant points to the evidence produced at the suppression hearing to cast into doubt officers\u2019 testimony at trial. Specifically, Appellant argues that the officers, when testifying at the suppression hearing, described a \u201cmuch more leisurely encounter at the suppression hearing than they did at trial.\u201d (Br. of Appellant at 10). However, Appellant fails to develop this argument and further fails to demonstrate how this \u201cconflict\u201d in testimonies between the suppression hearing and trial creates a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting\nreversal. Even should Appellant establish that a true \u201cconflict\u201d exists in the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and the trial, and that such issue was properly before this Court, we find that the record contains competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s findings. *Phelps v. Horn\u2019s Crop Serv. Ctr.*, 3rd Dist. Wyandot No. 16-89-8, 1990 WL 157282, * 2 (holding that the choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact)."}

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO INSTRUCT THE JURY AS TO THE LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSE OF RECKLESS HOMICIDE. ADDITIONALLY, APPELLANT VOGT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL WHEN HIS ATTORNEY FAILED TO REQUEST AN INSTRUCTION ON THE LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSE OF RECKLESS HOMICIDE. FIFTH, SIXTH, AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS\nOF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND\nARTICLE I, SECTION 10 AND 16 OF THE OHIO\nCONSTITUTION.\n\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63 On May 31, 2016, Appellant was indicted by a Washington\nCounty Grand Jury on two counts: (1) involuntary manslaughter, R.C.\n2903.04(A)&(C); and (2) trafficking in drugs, R.C.\n2925.03(A)(1)&(C)(6)(a). The indictment occurred subsequent to the\noverdose death of Tyler Miller which occurred on January 16, 2016. Tyler\nMiller was a young man who had just returned to Washington County after\nbeing drug free while in rehabilitation for his heroin addiction. The\nindictment alleges that shortly upon Tyler Miller\u2019s return to his hometown,\nAppellant sold him heroin.\n\n\u00b64 Appellant proceeded to a jury trial which commenced on\nDecember 5, 2016. On the second day of trial, a discussion was held in\nchambers regarding: (1) text messages which had not been provided to\ndefense counsel as part of pretrial discovery and which, the defense argued,\nviolated Crim.R. 16; and (2) the existence of a conflict of interest which had\narisen on the part of defense counsel as a result of the violation. After\ndiscussion amongst the attorneys and the trial court, the trial court declared a\nmistrial and rescheduled the trial for a date in January 2017.\nOn January 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss both counts of the indictment filed against him on the ground that his state and federal constitutional rights against Double Jeopardy had been violated. Appellant argued that the State had willfully flouted its responsibilities to disclose evidence under the Ohio criminal rules. After the State filed a responsive brief, the trial court denied Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nAppellant again proceeded to trial on March 27, 2017. At trial, the State\u2019s first witness was Tyler\u2019s father. John Miller testified he discovered Tyler had a drug problem in March 2015. Tyler, who worked in his family\u2019s plumbing and electric business, was exhibiting erratic behavior. After the drug problem was confronted, Tyler presented to L&P services for outpatient treatment and attended NA meetings. He did not want to go to inpatient rehabilitation.\n\nIn the fall of 2015, Tyler overdosed. He was successfully revived with Narcan and continued his outpatient drug counseling through the fall of 2015. In early December 2015, Tyler acknowledged that he needed inpatient rehab. Tyler went into Camden Clark for 5-6 days and then\nwent into Parkside drug and alcohol rehabilitation in Columbus for over a month.\u00b9\n\n{\u00b68} John Miller specifically testified Tyler\u2019s cell phone and wallet were in the Millers\u2019 possession while he was at inpatient rehabilitation in Columbus. Tyler also parked his truck at his parents\u2019 house. While Tyler was in rehab, his mother, Jill Miller, searched his wallet several times and found no illegal drugs inside it.\n\n{\u00b69} Tyler was discharged from Parkside on January 15, 2016, and his parents and his girlfriend, Josie Schau, drove to Columbus to bring him home. The group stopped in Zanesville to eat and arrived at the Millers\u2019 home around 7:00 p.m. On the way home, Tyler was in good spirits, talking about the future and even singing along with the radio. Tyler indicated he wanted to become an addiction counselor so he could help others. John Miller saw no indication his son was using any drug.\n\n{\u00b610} Upon return to the Millers\u2019 home, Tyler retrieved his wallet and cell phone. His truck battery seemed to be dead, so Josie drove Tyler to his residence in Beverly where he lived with his sister, Samantha Miller. John Miller last saw his son alive between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. on January 15, 2016.\n\n\u00b9 Information regarding L&P Services, Camden Clark, and Parkside was not further developed in testimony.\nThe next morning, January 16, 2016, John Miller texted Tyler to see if he wanted to go hunting. Tyler did not reply. John Miller proceeded to go hunting alone, and he returned home between 3:00 and 3:30 p.m. Since neither parent had heard from Tyler, John Miller went to Samantha\u2019s house and knocked on the door. When no one answered, Mr. Miller opened the door and called out again. John Miller soon found Tyler lying motionless with his wallet lying beside him and immediately called 911, but emergency personnel were never able to revive Tyler.\n\nAfter emergency personnel and law enforcement left the scene, Jill Miller and Samantha were looking through Tyler\u2019s wallet and found something which looked like a small rock, wrapped in a piece of paper. They immediately contacted law enforcement. John Miller concluded his direct testimony acknowledging that Tyler had available funds, his regular paycheck and a Christmas bonus, in his bank account when he returned from rehabilitation.\n\nJosie Schau next testified that she and Tyler had been in a relationship for 3 years at the time of his death. Josie discovered that Tyler was using heroin only after he overdosed in the summer of 2015. Tyler had never used heroin in her presence.\nAlthough Tyler did not have his cell phone with him at Parkside, he called Josie regularly. While in rehab, Tyler\u2019s mood changed and he seemed happy again.\n\nJosie\u2019s testimony correlated with John Miller\u2019s. When Josie accompanied the Millers to bring Tyler home, she also noticed he was in a good mood and making plans for the future. Josie testified after driving Tyler home, she stayed and visited Tyler and Samantha while Tyler cleaned the receipts out of his wallet and played with his dog. When Samantha went to bed, Tyler and Josie watched a movie together. During the entire time Josie was with Tyler on January 15th, she never observed him using drugs.\n\nJosie left at 11:00 p.m. on January 15, 2016. At that time, Tyler was still happy and thankful, reiterating that it had been a good decision to go into rehab. When Josie reached her home, she texted Tyler to let him know she had arrived safely. He texted her a brief reply and then texted her later at 2:13 a.m. on January 16th. Josie did not receive Tyler\u2019s last text until morning. When she replied, he did not respond.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nThe appellate court in Brown recently considered his argument that his involuntary manslaughter conviction, based on a predicate offense of corrupting another with drugs, was not supported by sufficient evidence. The appellate court simply concluded at \u00b6 30:\n\u201cSince we have found Brown\u2019s arguments against his conviction for corrupting another with drugs are without merit, his conviction for involuntary manslaughter has a properly supported predicate convictions and withstands the sufficiency of the evidence analysis.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Appellant\u2019s conviction for trafficking with drugs is not against the manifest weight of the evidence and thus, his conviction for involuntary manslaughter has a properly supported predicate conviction. Thus, we find no merit to Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n\u00b694 Similar to the abbreviated analysis in Brown, our decision in State v. Wickersham, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 13CA10, 2015-Ohio-2756, at \u00b6 27, allows for disposition of Appellant\u2019s involuntary manslaughter conviction sufficiency challenge in summary fashion. However, under Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error arguing the sufficiency of his involuntary manslaughter conviction, Appellant makes a different and distinct argument. Appellant asserts that, assuming he delivered heroin to Tyler Miller, he could not have legally foreseen Miller\u2019s death because he could not have known that the effects of a small amount of heroin could be magnified due to Miller\u2019s time in the drug rehabilitation program. Appellant concludes that the evidence against him is insufficient because:\n\n1) He cannot be held responsible for the consequences that a reasonable person could not expect to follow from his conduct; and,\n2) He cannot be held responsible in light of Dr. Shott\u2019s testimony that it is possible that a person who had just been in rehab and was presumably drug-free could overdose more easily.\n\n{\u00b695} When a court reviews a record for sufficiency, \u2018[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d Lamb, \u00b6 18, quoting State v. Maxwell, 139 Ohio St.3d 12, 2014-Ohio-1019, 9 N.E.3d 930, \u00b6 146; quoting State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus; Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (1979). \u201cThe court must defer to the trier of fact on questions of credibility and the weight assigned to the evidence.\u201d State v. Dillard, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 13CA9, 2014-Ohio-4974, at \u00b6 22; citing State v. Kirkland, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, 15 N.E.3d 818, \u00b6 132.\n\n{\u00b696} Our review of Ohio law demonstrates that Appellant herein is not the first defendant to argue as to the \u201cforeseeability\u201d of a death occurring as a result of a conviction for trafficking in drugs or corrupting another with drugs. Generally, other courts have rejected this argument.\n\n{\u00b697} In State v. Sabo, 3rd Dist. Union No. 14-09-33, 2010-Ohio-1261, the defendant allegedly transported liquid methadone and other drugs to Union County, Ohio, where he shared them with another individual who\nlater overdosed. Sabo was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nSabo argued his conviction was not based on sufficient evidence and was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In reviewing his appeal, the appellate court noted at \u00b6 25:\n\n\u201cThis Court has previously cited to the 10th District's decision in State v. Losey, 23 Ohio App.3d 93, 94-95, 491 N.E.2d 379 (10th Dist. 1985), for guidance on the intention of the Legislature in its use of \u201cproximate result\u201d under R.C. 2903.04. See Shoemaker, 2006-Ohio-5159, at \u00b6 65. In that decision, the 10th District stated as follows:\n\nUnder [R.C. 2903.04], defendant cannot be held responsible for consequences no reasonable person could expect to follow from his conduct; he will be held responsible for consequences which are direct, normal, and reasonably inevitable-as opposed to extraordinary or surprising-when viewed in the light of ordinary experience. In this sense, then, \u201cproximate result\u201d bears a resemblance to the concept of \u201cproximate cause\u201d in that defendant will be held responsible for those foreseeable consequences which are known to be, or should be known to be, within the scope of the risk created by his conduct. State v. Chambers, 53 Ohio App.2d 266, 373 N.E.2d 393 (9th Dist. 1977). Here, that means that death reasonably could be anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result under these or similar circumstances. See State v. Nosis, 22 Ohio App.2d 16, 457 N.E.2d 414 (9th Dist. 1969). Losey, 23 Ohio App.3d at 95, 491 N.E.2d 379.\u201d\n\n\u00b698 Sabo argued that there was insufficient evidence that his aggravated trafficking of drugs proximately caused the victim\u2019s death.\n\nSpecifically, he claimed that given the evidence presented at trial, only the liquid methadone could be associated with him, and neither expert witness\ncould say which one of the five significant drugs found through testing caused the victim\u2019s death. Sabo concluded it was unforeseeable for him to have known that the victim had toxic levels of other significant drugs in his body when he administered the liquid methadone. The appellate court disagreed, based on the evidence presented in Sabo\u2019s case. Citing State v. Baksi (Dec. 23, 1999), 11th Dist. No. 98-T-0123, at *16 and State v. Grunden, 65 Ohio App.3d 777, 783-84, 585 N.E.2d 487 (3rd Dist. 1989), the Sabo court noted at \u00b6 27:\n\n\u201cWhile Michael's death was the result of the effects of taking multiple drugs, and neither expert could pinpoint which exact drug caused Michael's death, we believe that a fatal consequence was within the foreseeable scope of risk created by Sabo's conduct in administering the liquid methadone when there was ample evidence regarding Michael's inebriated condition, the fact that he and Sabo had taken other substances together that night, and the fact that Sabo had even warned Michael about using the liquid methadone.\u201d\n\nOther courts have addressed the foreseeability argument within the context of a manifest weight of the evidence analysis. In State v. Wells, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2016-02-009, 2017-Ohio-420, the decedent traveled to Wells\u2019 home to exchange his prescription for illegal drugs. After obtaining \u201cdope\u201d and injecting himself, the victim immediately\n\n---\n\n5 The Baksi court found that there was sufficient evidence to support involuntary manslaughter conviction when evidence showed defendant prepared an extremely strong hit of heroin and gave the loaded syringe to another inmate who was known to abuse drugs. Grunden held that reasonable minds could have concluded at the close of the State\u2019s case that the infant\u2019s death was proximately caused by the defendant's conduct in leaving a gram of cocaine unattended on a coffee table, well within the reach and propensities of a thirteen-month-old child.\noverdosed. Testing later revealed he had cocaine metabolites and fentanyl in his system at the time of death. At trial, a forensic pathologist and coroner testified that the level of fentanyl in his system caused him to stop breathing. The appellate court found that given the evidence before it, the jury did not lose its way in finding that Wells\u2019 actions caused the overdose death. The appellate court stated at \u00b6 39:\n\n\u201cThere is nothing extraordinary or surprising about the manner of [the victim\u2019s] death in relation to appellant\u2019s actions. Appellant provided drugs to a known drug abuser. The possibility of an overdose is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of providing a controlled substance to another. (Emphasis added). See, e.g., State v. Patterson, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2013\u2013T\u20130062, 2015\u2013Ohio\u20134423, \u00b6 80\u201395; State v. Zusman, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2014\u2013L\u2013087, 2015\u2013Ohio\u20133218.\u201d\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6113 With this framework in mind, we now consider whether the trial court should have given the jury a reckless homicide instruction as a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter. Our research has yielded little guidance on whether, as a general premise, reckless homicide is a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter. Other appellate districts have reached differing conclusions.\n\n\u00b6114 In State v. Hipshire, 2nd Dist. Darke No. 2010-CA-07, 2011-Ohio-3863, the defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of reckless homicide. The trial court instructed the jury on the elements of involuntary manslaughter, but stated that it could find nothing to indicate that reckless homicide was a lesser-included offense in terms of statutory interpretation or common law decision. As in Appellant\u2019s case herein, Hipshire was convicted of having violated R.C. 2903.04(A), involuntary manslaughter, which does not specify a culpable mental state, but the mental state \u201cis supplied by the underlying offense.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28. See also State v. Carusone, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C\u2013010681, 2003\u2013Ohio\u20131018, \u00b6 47.\nIn Hipshire, the underlying felony offense for which Hipshire was indicted was a violation of R.C. 2903.16(A), failing to provide for a functionally impaired person, which required proof of the mental state of \u201cknowingly.\u201d The appellate court held:\n\n\u201cAlthough Hipshire should have been more attentive to his wife's condition, there is evidence that she was not malnourished, that she did receive food and medication, and that some degree of care was given. A jury could reasonably conclude that Hipshire showed heedless indifference to the consequences and perversely disregarded a known risk that his conduct was likely to result in his wife's death, thus meriting the Reckless Homicide instruction. Accordingly, the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on Reckless Homicide as a lesser-included offense.\u201d\n\nThe Hipshire court ultimately concluded that the trial court based its decision on incorrect legal grounds, not on factual conclusions relating to the state of the evidence.10\n\nIn Carusone, supra, the appellate court considered the culpable mental states required for involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide and concluded that the mental states were inconsistent. However, Carusone is distinguishable in that Carusone was involved in an altercation with two victims (emphasis added). The court held at \u00b6 50:\n\n---\n\n10 Hipshire held that the court's stated reason for refusing to give the instruction was based on unsound reasoning\u2014an error of law\u2014and in that respect, was an abuse of discretion. Id. at 41. See, e.g., AAAA Enterprises, Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.3d 597(1990).\n\u201cWe hold, under the facts of this case, that Carusone could not have been found guilty of both involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide. * * * The evidence did not reasonably support findings that Carusone acted both knowingly and recklessly * * *.\u201d\n\n\u00b6117 In State v. Patterson, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2013-T-0062, 2015-Ohio-4423, a case similar to ours, the defendant was convicted for reckless homicide and corrupting another with drugs, along with other felonies. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Wright opined at \u00b6 117:\n\n\u201cInvoluntary manslaughter can be committed without reckless homicide also being committed.\u201d\n\n\u00b6118 Assuming, as in Hipshire, there are occasions where reckless homicide may fairly be considered a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter, here, we do not find the trial court\u2019s failure to give a lesser-included instruction was in error, let alone plain error. At trial, the defense theory of the case was that there was an absence of evidence that Appellant trafficked in drugs. Appellant\u2019s involuntary manslaughter conviction is contingent only upon proof of the underlying felony trafficking. Defense counsel pointed out in closing that there was only circumstantial evidence of texting between Tyler Miller\u2019s phone and \u201cwhomever\u201d was using Appellant\u2019s phone. Defense counsel emphasized Appellant\u2019s lack of a criminal record. Defense counsel\u2019s closing argument emphasized that Appellant\u2019s friend, Cory Forshey, had access to Appellant\u2019s cell phone, thus\nattempting to plant the idea that Corey Forshey was the one trafficking in drugs the night Tyler Miller overdosed.\n\n{\u00b6119} It appears defense counsel\u2019s strategy was \u201call or nothing,\u201d to argue for a complete acquittal of both charges. It would have been inconsistent for Appellant\u2019s counsel to argue for complete acquittal while at the same time, attempt to argue that Appellant \u201cknew of a dangerous situation,\u201d yet \u201cfailed to use ordinary care\u201d as set forth above in the definition of \u201crecklessness.\u201d Generally, a failure to request a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense is presumed to be a matter of trial strategy. Wilson, supra, at \u00b6 42. In this case, that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel employed this \u201call-or-nothing\u201d strategy is a reasonable presumption.\n\n{\u00b6120} For the foregoing reasons, we find no plain error with regard to the trial court\u2019s failure to give a lesser-included offense jury instruction. Related to the above argument, Appellant has also asserted he received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his attorney\u2019s failure to request a lesser-included offense instruction. Given our finding that Appellant did not request the instruction as a matter of reasonable trial strategy, similarly, we find Appellant was not rendered the ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the lack of request for this instruction.\nCriminal defendants have a right to counsel, including a right to the effective assistance from counsel. *State v. Hill*, 4th Dist. Athens No. 16CA3, 2018-Ohio-67, at \u00b6 41. *McMann v. Richardson*, 397 U.S. 759, 770, 90 S.Ct. 1441 (1970); *State v. Stout*, 4th Dist. Gallia No. 07CA5, 2008-Ohio-1366, at \u00b6 21. To establish constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) that his counsel's performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense and deprived him of a fair trial. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984); *State v. Issa*, 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 67, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001); *State v. Goff*, 82 Ohio St.3d 123, 139, 694 N.E.2d 916 (1998). \u201cIn order to show deficient performance, the defendant must prove that counsel's performance fell below an objective level of reasonable representation. To show prejudice, the defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d *State v. Conway*, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 95 (citations omitted). \u201cFailure to establish either element is fatal to the claim.\u201d *State v. Jones*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 06CA3116, 2008-Ohio-968, \u00b6 14, 2008 WL 613116. Therefore, if one element is dispositive, a court need not analyze both. *State v. Madrigal*, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 389, 2000-\nOhio-448, 721 N.E.2d 52, (stating that a defendant's failure to satisfy one of the elements \u201cnegates a court's need to consider the other\u201d).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nDr. Juhascik, a toxicologist with the Montgomery County Coroner\u2019s Office, testified that the results in the toxicology report were consistent with a heroin overdose. The report was given to Dr. Robert Shott, the Montgomery County Coroner, who prepared an opinion as to Tyler\u2019s cause of death. Dr. Shott explained that 136 nanograms per milliliter found in Tyler\u2019s femoral blood was enough to be a fatal overdose, and he opined, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Tyler\u2019s cause of death was heroin intoxication.\n\nNot only is Appellant\u2019s conviction for involuntary manslaughter supported by sufficient evidence, based solely on the fact it is a predicate offense, we also find any rational trier of fact could have found all the elements of involuntary manslaughter proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, his conviction is also supported by sufficient evidence. As such, we overrule Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR FOUR\n\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury as to the lesser-included offense of reckless homicide. Additionally,\nAppellant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to request an instruction on reckless homicide. Appellant raises two separate and significant arguments; however, we note that he has failed to separately argue the assignments of error as required by App.R. 16(A)(7). While App.R. 12(A)(2) provides authority to disregard assignments of error on this basis, we may still address the assignments in the interest of justice. State v. Matzinger, 81 N.E.3d 841, 2017-Ohio-324, (4th Dist.) at \u00b6 28; State v. Reye, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 15CA010770, 2016-Ohio-3495, 2016 WL 3387769, \u00b6 5. See also Comisford v. Erie Ins. Property Cas. Co., 4th Dist. Gallia No. 10CA3, 2011-Ohio-1373, at \u00b6 29. Because in this case it appears to be a simple matter of form, we proceed to consider both arguments.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\u00b6109 Our review of whether a jury instruction is warranted is de novo. State v. Schwendeman, 4th Dist. Athens No. 17CA7, 2018-Ohio-240, at \u00b618; State v. Depew, 4th Dist. Ross No. 00CA2562, 2002-Ohio-6158, at \u00b6 24 (\u201cWhile a trial court has some discretion in the actual wording of an instruction, the issue of whether an instruction is required presents a question of law for de novo review.\u201d) However, because Appellant failed to request an instruction on reckless homicide, we review Appellant\u2019s\nargument hereunder a \u201cplain-error\u201d standard of review. Notice of plain error under Crim.R. 52(B) is to be taken with the utmost of caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. *State v. Grube*, \u00b6 34; *See, e.g.*, *State v. Barnes*, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002); *State v. Hill*, 92 Ohio St.3d 191, 196, 749 N.E.2d 274 (2001). Plain error should not be invoked unless it can be said that, but for the error, the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise. *See, e.g.*, *State v. Jackson*, 92 Ohio St.3d 436, 438, 751 N.E.2d 946 (2001); *State v. Sanders*, 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 263, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001).\n\n**LEGAL ANALYSIS**\n\n1. Did the trial court commit plain error by failing to give a lesser included instruction on reckless homicide?\n2. Did Appellant\u2019s counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to request the lesser included offense instruction of reckless homicide?\n\n{\u00b6110} The question of whether a particular offense should be submitted to the finder of fact as a lesser-included offense involves a two-tiered analysis. *State v. Deanda*, 136 Ohio St.3d 118, 2013-Ohio-1722, 989 N.E.2d 986, at \u00b6 6; *State v. Evans*, 122 Ohio St.3d 381, 2009-Ohio-2974, 911 N.E.2d 889, \u00b6 13. *State v. Wilson*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 13CA3542, 2015-Ohio-2016, at \u00b6 42. The first tier, also called the \u201cstatutory-elements\n\n---\n\n9 *Deanda* provides a comprehensive historical review of the lesser-offenses analysis.\nstep,\u201d is a purely legal question, wherein we determine whether one offense is generally a lesser-included offense of the charged offense. *State v. Kidder*, 32 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 513 N.E.2d 311 (1987). The second tier looks to the evidence in a particular case and determines whether \u201c\u2018a jury could reasonably find the defendant not guilty of the charged offense, but could convict the defendant of the lesser-included offense.\u2019\u201d *Evans* at \u00b6 13, quoting *Shaker Hts. v. Mosely*, 113 Ohio St.3d 329, 2007-Ohio-2072, 865 N.E.2d 859, \u00b6 11.\n\n{\u00b6111} In *State v. Deem*, 40 Ohio St.3d 205, 533 N.E.2d 294 (1988), paragraph three of the syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio held:\n\n\u201cAn offense may be a lesser-included offense of another if (i) the offense carries a lesser penalty than the other; (ii) the greater offense cannot, as statutorily defined, ever be committed without the lesser offense, as statutorily defined, also being committed; and (iii) some element of the greater offense is not required to prove the commission of the lesser offense.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6112} The *Deem* statement of the rule remained the norm in Ohio for 20 years, until it was further reworded in *Evans, supra; Deanda, supra*, at \u00b6 13. In *Deanda, supra*, the Supreme Court of Ohio explained:\n\n\u201c[T]he test does not require identical language to define the two offenses, but focuses upon whether the words used in the statute defining the greater offense will put the offender on notice that an indictment for that offense could also result in the prosecution of the lesser-included offense. *Evans* at \u00b6 22. Thus, in order \u2018to ensure that such implausible scenarios will not derail a proper lesser included offense analysis\u2019 in the future,\nwe made one minor change in the phrasing of the second step of the statutory-elements test stated in Deem, by deleting the word \u2018ever.\u2019 Id. at \u00b6 25. The second step now requires that \u2018the greater offense as statutorily defined cannot be committed without the lesser offense as statutorily defined also being committed.\u2019 Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.\u201d\n\n\u00b6113 With this framework in mind, we now consider whether the trial court should have given the jury a reckless homicide instruction as a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter. Our research has yielded little guidance on whether, as a general premise, reckless homicide is a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter. Other appellate districts have reached differing conclusions.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b648} In the present matter, after Appellant objected to the admission of the texts and explained his possible conflict, the record indicates that after discussion was had both on and off the record, the court declared a mistrial. Appellant argues that the State\u2019s action in failing to disclose the text messages in violation of Crim.R. 16 forced or manipulated the court into the position where a mistrial was necessary and was imposed upon him. The record reflects defense counsel neither requested nor objected to the declaration of mistrial.\n\n{\u00b649} The Supreme Court of Ohio held in *Anderson* that \u201cwhen a mistrial was \u2018instigated by prosecutorial misconduct designed to provoke [the] mistrial,\u2019 retrial is barred by double jeopardy.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 32, quoting *State v. Glover*, 35 Ohio St.3d 18, 517 N.E.2d 900 (1988), syllabus; see also *Oregon v. Kennedy*, 456 U.S. 667, 676, 102 S.Ct. 2083 (1982) (double jeopardy bars retrial if the prosecutor has engaged in misconduct intended to\n\u201cgoad\u201d the defense into moving for a mistrial); *Green v. United States*, 355 U.S. 184, 188, 78 S.Ct. 221 (1957) (\u201ca prosecutor or judge [is prohibited] from subjecting a defendant to a second prosecution by discontinuing the trial when it appears that the jury might not convict\u201d).\n\n{\u00b650} This court has also noted that the prohibition against double jeopardy precludes a second trial absent (1) a mistrial justified by a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d or (2) consent to the mistrial by the defendant. *Johnson*, supra, at \u00b6 14, quoting *Klein v. Leis*, 548 F.3d 425, 431 (6th Cir.2008). \u201cIn determining whether a \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 exists, Courts need not find an absence of alternatives but only a \u2018high degree\u2019 of necessity.\u201d *Johnson*, supra, at 15, quoting *Klein* at 431. \u201cWhat constitutes a \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 is left to the discretion of the courts, which must \u2018exercise a sound discretion on the subject [as] it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere.\u201d *Gunnell*, 132 Ohio St.3d 442, 2012\u2013Ohio\u20133236, 973 N.E.2d 243, at \u00b6 26, quoting *United States v. Perez*, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580 (1824).\n\n{\u00b651} In Appellant\u2019s case, while the State failed to provide the texts during discovery, we do not find this omission was intentionally calculated to invite a mistrial. The texts at issue were between Appellant and his girlfriend and in preparing for trial, the prosecution would have likely been\nfocusing on the texts linking Appellant to Tyler Miller. Arguably, the omission could have been negligence. In *State v. Hodges*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 17MA0025, 2018-Ohio-447, the appellate court recently noted at \u00b6 18, that \u201c[a] retrial is not barred on double jeopardy grounds where the state's mere negligence, rather than intentional misconduct, required the trial court to grant a mistrial on a defense motion. *Hodges*, *supra*, citing *State v. Wood*, 114 Ohio App.3d 395, 400, 683 N.E.2d 354 (10th Dist.1996), citing *United States v. Dinitz*, 424 U.S. 600, 607,611, 96 S.Ct. 1075 (1976).\n\n\u00b652 More importantly, the State had no way of knowing Appellant\u2019s counsel represented Cory Forshey in an unrelated matter and hence, no way of knowing that use of the texts would place Appellant\u2019s counsel in the position of having a conflict of interest. Instead, any possibility of a conflict of interest would have been known to defense counsel when counsel was provided with the recorded interview of the State\u2019s response to discovery which was filed June 8, 2016. In its response to discovery, the State provided Appellant\u2019s counsel with the recorded interview in which Appellant attempts to shift any blame to his friend Cory Forshey. At this point, counsel should have considered the possibility of a conflict of interest in representing both defendants.\nThe Hodges court also noted the state did not gain material advantage from the mistrial itself. *Id.* at \u00b6 24. Similarly, we do not see that the State gained any material advantage from the mistrial. In fact, Appellant was additionally armed with the text messages at issue and gained advantage of time to further prepare his defense or to consider his alternatives.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declaring a mistrial. We find an absence of evidence suggesting that the State engaged in intentional misconduct in order to necessitate a mistrial. And, the journal entry denying Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss stated the trial court\u2019s reasoning as follows:\n\n\u201cThe Court FINDS that the failure to provide the texts during discovery did not create the conflict of interest which resulted in the mistrial of this case as any conflict of interest which existed was known to Defendant long before the State\u2019s revelation of the additional texts. The court further FINDS that the State\u2019s failure to provide the additional texts was not misconduct intentionally calculated to create or invite mistrial.\u201d\n\nWhile defense counsel did not request the mistrial, defense counsel asserted that there was a \u201cpossible conflict of interest.\u201d As set forth above, what constitutes a manifest necessity is left to the discretion of the trial court. While not explicitly finding a manifest necessity, the trial court was obviously concerned about a possible conflict of interest as defense counsel emphasized this argument.\nWe conclude the court\u2019s decision constituted an implicit finding that the possible conflict of interest, as vigorously asserted by defense counsel when arguing the alleged Crim.R. 16 violation, created a manifest necessity for the mistrial. As such, the protection afforded by the prohibition against double jeopardy did not attach. The trial court did not err in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. We hereby overrule Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.\n\nASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR ONE AND TWO\n\nUnder assignment of error one, Appellant argues his conviction for involuntary manslaughter is not supported by sufficient evidence. Under assignment of error two, he argues his convictions for involuntary manslaughter and drug trafficking are against the manifest weight of the evidence. Because the matters are interrelated, we consider Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error jointly.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nIn determining whether a criminal conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest\nmiscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed. *State v. Lamb*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 17CA3796, 2018-Ohio-1405, \u00b6 19; *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997); *State v. Hunter*, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, \u00b6 119. The weight and credibility of evidence are to be determined by the trier of fact. *Lamb, supra*, at \u00b6 20; *State v. Kirkland*, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1965, 15 N.E.3d 818, at \u00b6 132. The trier of fact is free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of any witness, and we defer to the trier of fact on evidentiary weight and credibility issues because it is in the best position to gauge the witnesses' demeanor, gestures, and voice inflections, and to use these observations to weigh their credibility. *State v. Dillard*, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 13CA9, 2014-Ohio-4974, at \u00b6 28; citing *State v. West*, 4th Dist.

ADDITIONALLY, APPELLANT VOGT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL WHEN HIS ATTORNEY FAILED TO REQUEST AN INSTRUCTION ON THE LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSE OF RECKLESS HOMICIDE. FIFTH, SIXTH, AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS\nOF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND\nARTICLE I, SECTION 10 AND 16 OF THE OHIO\nCONSTITUTION.\n\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63 On May 31, 2016, Appellant was indicted by a Washington\nCounty Grand Jury on two counts: (1) involuntary manslaughter, R.C.\n2903.04(A)&(C); and (2) trafficking in drugs, R.C.\n2925.03(A)(1)&(C)(6)(a). The indictment occurred subsequent to the\noverdose death of Tyler Miller which occurred on January 16, 2016. Tyler\nMiller was a young man who had just returned to Washington County after\nbeing drug free while in rehabilitation for his heroin addiction. The\nindictment alleges that shortly upon Tyler Miller\u2019s return to his hometown,\nAppellant sold him heroin.\n\n\u00b64 Appellant proceeded to a jury trial which commenced on\nDecember 5, 2016. On the second day of trial, a discussion was held in\nchambers regarding: (1) text messages which had not been provided to\ndefense counsel as part of pretrial discovery and which, the defense argued,\nviolated Crim.R. 16; and (2) the existence of a conflict of interest which had\narisen on the part of defense counsel as a result of the violation. After\ndiscussion amongst the attorneys and the trial court, the trial court declared a\nmistrial and rescheduled the trial for a date in January 2017.\nOn January 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss both counts of the indictment filed against him on the ground that his state and federal constitutional rights against Double Jeopardy had been violated. Appellant argued that the State had willfully flouted its responsibilities to disclose evidence under the Ohio criminal rules. After the State filed a responsive brief, the trial court denied Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nAppellant again proceeded to trial on March 27, 2017. At trial, the State\u2019s first witness was Tyler\u2019s father. John Miller testified he discovered Tyler had a drug problem in March 2015. Tyler, who worked in his family\u2019s plumbing and electric business, was exhibiting erratic behavior. After the drug problem was confronted, Tyler presented to L&P services for outpatient treatment and attended NA meetings. He did not want to go to inpatient rehabilitation.\n\nIn the fall of 2015, Tyler overdosed. He was successfully revived with Narcan and continued his outpatient drug counseling through the fall of 2015. In early December 2015, Tyler acknowledged that he needed inpatient rehab. Tyler went into Camden Clark for 5-6 days and then\nwent into Parkside drug and alcohol rehabilitation in Columbus for over a month.\u00b9\n\n{\u00b68} John Miller specifically testified Tyler\u2019s cell phone and wallet were in the Millers\u2019 possession while he was at inpatient rehabilitation in Columbus. Tyler also parked his truck at his parents\u2019 house. While Tyler was in rehab, his mother, Jill Miller, searched his wallet several times and found no illegal drugs inside it.\n\n{\u00b69} Tyler was discharged from Parkside on January 15, 2016, and his parents and his girlfriend, Josie Schau, drove to Columbus to bring him home. The group stopped in Zanesville to eat and arrived at the Millers\u2019 home around 7:00 p.m. On the way home, Tyler was in good spirits, talking about the future and even singing along with the radio. Tyler indicated he wanted to become an addiction counselor so he could help others. John Miller saw no indication his son was using any drug.\n\n{\u00b610} Upon return to the Millers\u2019 home, Tyler retrieved his wallet and cell phone. His truck battery seemed to be dead, so Josie drove Tyler to his residence in Beverly where he lived with his sister, Samantha Miller. John Miller last saw his son alive between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. on January 15, 2016.\n\n\u00b9 Information regarding L&P Services, Camden Clark, and Parkside was not further developed in testimony.\nThe next morning, January 16, 2016, John Miller texted Tyler to see if he wanted to go hunting. Tyler did not reply. John Miller proceeded to go hunting alone, and he returned home between 3:00 and 3:30 p.m. Since neither parent had heard from Tyler, John Miller went to Samantha\u2019s house and knocked on the door. When no one answered, Mr. Miller opened the door and called out again. John Miller soon found Tyler lying motionless with his wallet lying beside him and immediately called 911, but emergency personnel were never able to revive Tyler.\n\nAfter emergency personnel and law enforcement left the scene, Jill Miller and Samantha were looking through Tyler\u2019s wallet and found something which looked like a small rock, wrapped in a piece of paper. They immediately contacted law enforcement. John Miller concluded his direct testimony acknowledging that Tyler had available funds, his regular paycheck and a Christmas bonus, in his bank account when he returned from rehabilitation.\n\nJosie Schau next testified that she and Tyler had been in a relationship for 3 years at the time of his death. Josie discovered that Tyler was using heroin only after he overdosed in the summer of 2015. Tyler had never used heroin in her presence.\nAlthough Tyler did not have his cell phone with him at Parkside, he called Josie regularly. While in rehab, Tyler\u2019s mood changed and he seemed happy again.\n\nJosie\u2019s testimony correlated with John Miller\u2019s. When Josie accompanied the Millers to bring Tyler home, she also noticed he was in a good mood and making plans for the future. Josie testified after driving Tyler home, she stayed and visited Tyler and Samantha while Tyler cleaned the receipts out of his wallet and played with his dog. When Samantha went to bed, Tyler and Josie watched a movie together. During the entire time Josie was with Tyler on January 15th, she never observed him using drugs.\n\nJosie left at 11:00 p.m. on January 15, 2016. At that time, Tyler was still happy and thankful, reiterating that it had been a good decision to go into rehab. When Josie reached her home, she texted Tyler to let him know she had arrived safely. He texted her a brief reply and then texted her later at 2:13 a.m. on January 16th. Josie did not receive Tyler\u2019s last text until morning. When she replied, he did not respond.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nThe appellate court in Brown recently considered his argument that his involuntary manslaughter conviction, based on a predicate offense of corrupting another with drugs, was not supported by sufficient evidence. The appellate court simply concluded at \u00b6 30:\n\u201cSince we have found Brown\u2019s arguments against his conviction for corrupting another with drugs are without merit, his conviction for involuntary manslaughter has a properly supported predicate convictions and withstands the sufficiency of the evidence analysis.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Appellant\u2019s conviction for trafficking with drugs is not against the manifest weight of the evidence and thus, his conviction for involuntary manslaughter has a properly supported predicate conviction. Thus, we find no merit to Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n\u00b694 Similar to the abbreviated analysis in Brown, our decision in State v. Wickersham, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 13CA10, 2015-Ohio-2756, at \u00b6 27, allows for disposition of Appellant\u2019s involuntary manslaughter conviction sufficiency challenge in summary fashion. However, under Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error arguing the sufficiency of his involuntary manslaughter conviction, Appellant makes a different and distinct argument. Appellant asserts that, assuming he delivered heroin to Tyler Miller, he could not have legally foreseen Miller\u2019s death because he could not have known that the effects of a small amount of heroin could be magnified due to Miller\u2019s time in the drug rehabilitation program. Appellant concludes that the evidence against him is insufficient because:\n\n1) He cannot be held responsible for the consequences that a reasonable person could not expect to follow from his conduct; and,\n2) He cannot be held responsible in light of Dr. Shott\u2019s testimony that it is possible that a person who had just been in rehab and was presumably drug-free could overdose more easily.\n\n{\u00b695} When a court reviews a record for sufficiency, \u2018[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d Lamb, \u00b6 18, quoting State v. Maxwell, 139 Ohio St.3d 12, 2014-Ohio-1019, 9 N.E.3d 930, \u00b6 146; quoting State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus; Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (1979). \u201cThe court must defer to the trier of fact on questions of credibility and the weight assigned to the evidence.\u201d State v. Dillard, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 13CA9, 2014-Ohio-4974, at \u00b6 22; citing State v. Kirkland, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, 15 N.E.3d 818, \u00b6 132.\n\n{\u00b696} Our review of Ohio law demonstrates that Appellant herein is not the first defendant to argue as to the \u201cforeseeability\u201d of a death occurring as a result of a conviction for trafficking in drugs or corrupting another with drugs. Generally, other courts have rejected this argument.\n\n{\u00b697} In State v. Sabo, 3rd Dist. Union No. 14-09-33, 2010-Ohio-1261, the defendant allegedly transported liquid methadone and other drugs to Union County, Ohio, where he shared them with another individual who\nlater overdosed. Sabo was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nSabo argued his conviction was not based on sufficient evidence and was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In reviewing his appeal, the appellate court noted at \u00b6 25:\n\n\u201cThis Court has previously cited to the 10th District's decision in State v. Losey, 23 Ohio App.3d 93, 94-95, 491 N.E.2d 379 (10th Dist. 1985), for guidance on the intention of the Legislature in its use of \u201cproximate result\u201d under R.C. 2903.04. See Shoemaker, 2006-Ohio-5159, at \u00b6 65. In that decision, the 10th District stated as follows:\n\nUnder [R.C. 2903.04], defendant cannot be held responsible for consequences no reasonable person could expect to follow from his conduct; he will be held responsible for consequences which are direct, normal, and reasonably inevitable-as opposed to extraordinary or surprising-when viewed in the light of ordinary experience. In this sense, then, \u201cproximate result\u201d bears a resemblance to the concept of \u201cproximate cause\u201d in that defendant will be held responsible for those foreseeable consequences which are known to be, or should be known to be, within the scope of the risk created by his conduct. State v. Chambers, 53 Ohio App.2d 266, 373 N.E.2d 393 (9th Dist. 1977). Here, that means that death reasonably could be anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result under these or similar circumstances. See State v. Nosis, 22 Ohio App.2d 16, 457 N.E.2d 414 (9th Dist. 1969). Losey, 23 Ohio App.3d at 95, 491 N.E.2d 379.\u201d\n\n\u00b698 Sabo argued that there was insufficient evidence that his aggravated trafficking of drugs proximately caused the victim\u2019s death.\n\nSpecifically, he claimed that given the evidence presented at trial, only the liquid methadone could be associated with him, and neither expert witness\ncould say which one of the five significant drugs found through testing caused the victim\u2019s death. Sabo concluded it was unforeseeable for him to have known that the victim had toxic levels of other significant drugs in his body when he administered the liquid methadone. The appellate court disagreed, based on the evidence presented in Sabo\u2019s case. Citing State v. Baksi (Dec. 23, 1999), 11th Dist. No. 98-T-0123, at *16 and State v. Grunden, 65 Ohio App.3d 777, 783-84, 585 N.E.2d 487 (3rd Dist. 1989), the Sabo court noted at \u00b6 27:\n\n\u201cWhile Michael's death was the result of the effects of taking multiple drugs, and neither expert could pinpoint which exact drug caused Michael's death, we believe that a fatal consequence was within the foreseeable scope of risk created by Sabo's conduct in administering the liquid methadone when there was ample evidence regarding Michael's inebriated condition, the fact that he and Sabo had taken other substances together that night, and the fact that Sabo had even warned Michael about using the liquid methadone.\u201d\n\nOther courts have addressed the foreseeability argument within the context of a manifest weight of the evidence analysis. In State v. Wells, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2016-02-009, 2017-Ohio-420, the decedent traveled to Wells\u2019 home to exchange his prescription for illegal drugs. After obtaining \u201cdope\u201d and injecting himself, the victim immediately\n\n---\n\n5 The Baksi court found that there was sufficient evidence to support involuntary manslaughter conviction when evidence showed defendant prepared an extremely strong hit of heroin and gave the loaded syringe to another inmate who was known to abuse drugs. Grunden held that reasonable minds could have concluded at the close of the State\u2019s case that the infant\u2019s death was proximately caused by the defendant's conduct in leaving a gram of cocaine unattended on a coffee table, well within the reach and propensities of a thirteen-month-old child.\noverdosed. Testing later revealed he had cocaine metabolites and fentanyl in his system at the time of death. At trial, a forensic pathologist and coroner testified that the level of fentanyl in his system caused him to stop breathing. The appellate court found that given the evidence before it, the jury did not lose its way in finding that Wells\u2019 actions caused the overdose death. The appellate court stated at \u00b6 39:\n\n\u201cThere is nothing extraordinary or surprising about the manner of [the victim\u2019s] death in relation to appellant\u2019s actions. Appellant provided drugs to a known drug abuser. The possibility of an overdose is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of providing a controlled substance to another. (Emphasis added). See, e.g., State v. Patterson, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2013\u2013T\u20130062, 2015\u2013Ohio\u20134423, \u00b6 80\u201395; State v. Zusman, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2014\u2013L\u2013087, 2015\u2013Ohio\u20133218.\u201d\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n**LEGAL ANALYSIS**\n\n1. **Drug Trafficking**\n\n   {\u00b659} In recent years, appellate courts in Ohio have considered convictions for involuntary manslaughter involving drug overdose deaths, predicated on a drug offense conviction. Here, Appellant\u2019s conviction for involuntary manslaughter was necessarily predicated upon trafficking in heroin. Appellant contends the jury\u2019s verdict that he knowingly trafficked in\ndrugs was based solely upon text messages which did not establish that he\nsold or attempted to sell heroin.\n\n\u00b660 Appellant was convicted of drug trafficking in violation of R.C.\n2925.03(A)(1). Thus, the State had to establish that Appellant knowingly\nsold or offered to sell a controlled substance or a controlled substance\nanalog. A person acts \u201cknowingly,\u201d when, regardless of purpose, the person\nis aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will\nprobably be of a certain nature. R.C. 2901.22(B). A person has knowledge\nof circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably\nexist. Id. When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element\nof an offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively\nbelieves that there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make\ninquiry or acts with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact. Id. A\n\u201ccontrolled substance\u201d means a drug, compound, mixture, preparation, or\nsubstance included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, as defined in R.C.\n3719.01(C) of the Revised Code.\n\n\u00b661 We agree that Appellant\u2019s conviction for drug trafficking is\nbased largely upon the circumstantial text messages evidencing\ncommunications between Tyler Miller and Appellant. However, we point\nout that \u201ca defendant may be convicted solely on the basis of circumstantial\nevidence.\u201d *Luther, supra,* at 19, quoting *State v. Nicely,* 39 Ohio St.3d 147, 151, 529 N.E.2d 1236 (1988). \u201cCircumstantial evidence and direct evidence inherently possess the same probative value.\u201d *State v. Jenks,* 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cCircumstantial evidence is defined as \u2018[t]estimony not based on actual personal knowledge or observation of the facts in controversy, but of other facts from which deductions are drawn, showing indirectly the facts sought to be proved. * * *\u2019 \u201d *Nicely,* 39 Ohio St.3d at 150, 529 N.E.2d 1236, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.1979) 221.\n\n{\u00b662} In *State v. Kramer,* 3rd Dist. Defiance No. 4-15-14, 2016-Ohio-2984, the defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter after allegedly selling heroin to the deceased, Matney, shortly before his death. On appeal, Kramer argued his conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence, specifically that the jury improperly concluded that he provided the heroin that led to Matney\u2019s death. Kramer produced an alibi witness, a female acquaintance who testified that Kramer was with her and never left her presence during the relevant time period.\n\n{\u00b663} The State presented a Defiance police officer, Campbell, who testified that he looked through text messages on Matney\u2019s cell phone. With the aid of exhibits, Campbell testified to the calls and text messages between\nMatney\u2019s and Kramer\u2019s cell phones between relevant dates. Campbell also testified to contacts between Matney and the mother of his children. Campbell testified that based on the nature of the text message exchanges and his knowledge of \u201cstreet language,\u201d the evidence pointed to Kramer\u2019s trafficking in drugs. Another witness, Horan, an FBI special agent, testified as to the location of Kramer\u2019s cell phone at the relevant times.\n\n\u00b664 Kramer took the stand in his own defense and testified that he never called Matney, Matney always contacted him. He admitted he had sold drugs to Matney in the past, but on the relevant date, he was actually trying to \u201cput him off,\u201d and hoping that Matney would just find another supplier. The appellate court in Kramer affirmed the jury\u2019s verdict that Kramer\u2019s trafficking in heroin proximately resulted in Matney\u2019s death and that the verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n\u00b665 Kramer\u2019s conviction was also based largely upon the circumstantial evidence of text message conversations between Matney and Kramer, introduced as evidence of a \u201cuser/seller\u201d relationship. Here, Detective Lockhart\u2019s investigation and testimony focused on the text conversations between Tyler\u2019s cell phone and Appellant\u2019s IPhone. In Detective Lockhart\u2019s opinion, the content of the conversations indicated some type of illegal drug activity.\nDetective Lockhart identified Exhibit F, the extraction report, which identified various text conversations. A conversation between the two phones revealed a conversation on November 30, 2015 in which \u201cprice\u201d and \u201clocation\u201d were discussed. Setting forth the conversations below, we reference Tyler\u2019s cell phone as \u201cTP,\u201d and Appellant\u2019s IPhone as \u201cAP.\u201d\n\nDetective Lockhart also testified to a text exchange on December 4, 2015. This exchange signified to him that Tyler was trying to keep his addiction hidden from his girlfriend Josie, and correlated with her trial testimony that she was unaware that Tyler used heroin. The extraction report revealed as follows:\n\nTP: Well I passed my girlfriend right in front of the IGA. So I kept driving lol but I\u2019m coming back as soon as she texts me back.\n\nAP: Ok.\n\nTP: I\u2019m sorry bro I just can\u2019t let her see me. Lol I gotta avoid her at all costs.\n\nDetective Lockhart also testified to a conversation between the users of the two phones which occurred on December 5, 2015. In his opinion, the exchange was discussing how much Tyler wanted to purchase and how long it would be until the parties met. Tyler\u2019s desire to keep his\n\n---\n\n3 Detective Lockhart explained that, Exhibit F, a six-page document, showed text conversations on pages 1-5, and contained a call log on page 7. He testified the document was not missing a page but was compiled as he had requested.\naddiction from Josie was again evident. The following text conversation occurred:\n\nTP: Hey man I ain\u2019t gonna to be able to get that. Sorry about that.\u201d\n\nAP: Ok man.\n\nTP: Hey man I can\u2019t come to town cause I\u2019m with my girl. But I have a buddy that\u2019s cool and lives in Marietta if you want to get rid of that half.\n\nDetective Lockhart also testified there was one more text message on December 15, 2015 from Appellant\u2019s phone, to which there was no response. Lockhart opined the lack of response coincided with Tyler being in rehab in Columbus and not having access to his cell phone.\n\nFinally, Detective Lockhart also testified to a conversation which took place one month later on January 15, 2016 at 11:23 p.m., which was approximately twenty minutes after Josie testified she left Tyler\u2019s residence. The exchange began with Tyler\u2019s initiation, occurred as follows:\n\nTP: Hey man what\u2019s up?\n\nAP: Yo.\n\nTP: Sorry I haven\u2019t got at you man. I\u2019ve been in rehab since December 4th.\n\nAP: It\u2019s cool. Good for you man.\n\n* * *\nTP: Yeah it was all good, just not really by choice ya feel me?\n\nAP: I feel ya.\n\nTP: I\u2019m just kickin it.\n\nAP: Like your hanging out or quitting the d?\n\n{\u00b671} Lockhart testified from his time on the drug task force, \u201cd\u201d is slang used in text messages between traffickers and users, commonly meaning \u201cheroin.\u201d The exchange continued from Tyler\u2019s phone:\n\nTP: You still doing your thing?\n\nAP: Yeah.\n\nTP: Damn I wish my truck was running or I\u2019d come in town tonight lol.\n\nAP: You need something or trying to kick it or what?\n\nAP: I just got my car back together the other day. Had to put a new axle up front.\n\nTP: Damn, that sucks Bro. I was just thinking about picking up.\n\nAP: Up what?\n\nTP: Some of that d.\n\nAP: I\u2019m around. I\u2019ll drop by for a little extra.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u201cThere is nothing extraordinary or surprising about the manner of [the victim\u2019s] death in relation to appellant\u2019s actions. Appellant provided drugs to a known drug abuser. The possibility of an overdose is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of providing a controlled substance to another. (Emphasis added). See, e.g., State v. Patterson, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2013\u2013T\u20130062, 2015\u2013Ohio\u20134423, \u00b6 80\u201395; State v. Zusman, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2014\u2013L\u2013087, 2015\u2013Ohio\u20133218.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6100} In State v. Veley, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-16-1038, 2017-Ohio-9064, Veley argued that the victim\u2019s death in his case was not a \u201creasonably inevitable\u201d result of the alleged drug transaction between the deceased and himself. Veley argued that the victim had purchased heroin over 100 times from him and as such, his death from an overdose was not likely or foreseeable. The Veley court observed at \u00b6 25:\n\n\u201cReviewing appellant\u2019s argument relating to the general foreseeability issue, we find that in the past decade Ohio courts have widely recognized that death by overdose of an illegal or illegally sold substance is a foreseeable result; inevitability has not been held to be the standard. For example, addressing foreseeability in a case where the defendant sold the deceased\nheroin and fentanyl and was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, the court noted that \u201c\u2018when the result varied from the harm intended or hazarded, it must be determined that the result achieved was not so extraordinary or surprising that it would be simply unfair to hold the defendant criminally responsible for something so unforeseeable.\u2019\u201d State v. Potee, 12th Dist. Clermont No, CA2016\u201306\u2013045, 2017-Ohio-2926, \u00b6 33, \u2014 N.E.3d \u2014\u2014, quoting State v. Hall, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2015-11-022, 2017-Ohio-879, \u00b6 78. The court further stated that \u201ca defendant will be held responsible for foreseeable consequences \u2018which are known to be, or should be known to be, within the scope of the risk created by his conduct.\u2019\u201d Id., quoting Hall at \u00b6 79. See State v. Patterson, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2013-T-0062, 2015-Ohio-4423, \u00b6 91 (\u201cThe possibility of an overdose is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the sale of heroin.\u201d). Further, \u201c\u2018for something to be foreseeable does not mean that it be actually envisioned.\u2019\u201d State v. Wells, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2016-02-009, 2017-Ohio-420, \u00b6 35, quoting State v. Lovelace, 137 Ohio App.3d 206, 219, 738 N.E.2d 418 (1st Dist.1999).\u201d\n\n{\u00b6101} The Fifth District, however, reached the conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to convict a defendant of involuntary manslaughter in State v. Kosto, 5th Dist. Licking No. 17CA54, 2018-Ohio-1925. There, Baker, the decedent, overdosed. His toxicology report revealed he had heroin, cocaine, and marijuana in his system. Law enforcement investigators recovered some of Baker\u2019s deleted cell phone texts which showed text conversations between Kosto and Baker the day before he died.\n\n---\n\n6 The Veley court also noted that the suggestion that the ingestion of a fatal drug was an intervening act itself had been rejected. Id., at \u00b6 28; State v. Baksim 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 98-T-0123, 1999 WL 12992927 (Dec. 23, 1999).\nKosto admitted he had deleted some of his texts because it looked like he had provided Baker with heroin.\n\n\u00b6102 Making a sufficiency argument on appeal, Kosto directed the appellate court to *Burrage v. United States*, 571 U.S. 204, 134 S.Ct. 881, 892 (2014). There, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201c* * * at least where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is not an independently sufficient cause of the victim's death or serious bodily injury, a defendant cannot be liable under the penalty enhancement provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) unless such use is a but-for cause of the death or injury.\u201d *Id.* at 892. The Court stated: \u201cThe language Congress enacted requires death to \u2018result from\u2019 use of the unlawfully distributed drug, not from a combination of factors to which drug use merely contributed.\u201d *Id.* at 891.\n\n\u00b6103 The *Kosto* court pointed out the State of Ohio was required to prove under R.C. 2903.04(A) that the defendant had caused the death of Baker as a proximate result of his committing or attempting to commit the felony offense of corrupting another with drugs under R.C. 2925.02(A)(3).\n\n---\n\n7 *Burrage* involved the challenge of a penalty enhancement provision under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(C). The federal statute at issue imposed a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence on a defendant who unlawfully distributes a Schedule I or II drug, when \u201cdeath or serious bodily injury results from the use of such substance.\u201d The United States Supreme Court in *Burrage* granted certiorari on two questions, the first of which was whether the defendant could be convicted under the \u201cdeath results\u201d provision when the use of the controlled substance was a \u201ccontributing cause\u201d of the death. *Id.* at 886. The Court first determined that the federal statute in question imposes a requirement of \u201cbut-for causation.\u201d *Id.* at 889\u2013891. Although the Government proposed the argument that an act or omission should be considered a cause-in-fact if it was a \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201ccontributing\u201d factor in producing a given result, this was rejected by the Court. *Id.* at 890.\nThe indictment and the bill of particulars both alleged that the cause of Baker's death was based on the felony of corrupting another specifically with heroin. However, the record in that case revealed that the theory was not fully consistent with the forensic pathologist\u2019s investigation.\n\n{\u00b6104} The pathologist specifically testified that \u201cacute combined drug effects\u201d from \u201c[u]sing heroin and cocaine\u201d were the cause of Baker\u2019s death. The pathologist also could not opine on cross-examination that Baker would have died from the heroin use in and of itself. In other words, there is arguably a reasonable probability that but for the use of cocaine, the death would not have occurred. Appellant was not charged with providing cocaine to Baker, nor did the State pursue a theory that appellant did so. The Kosto court concluded at \u00b6 23: \u201c[A]s in Burrage, \u201c[n]o expert was prepared to say that [the victim] would have died from the heroin use alone.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6105} Based on the above, we also reject Appellant\u2019s foreseeability argument. Other Ohio courts have consistently found that the possibility of an overdose is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of providing a\n\n---\n\n8 The Kosto court further opined at \u00b6 24:\u201cWe recognize that in Burrage, the United States Supreme Court was interpreting a penalty enhancement provision in a federal statute, not an Ohio criminal statute. However, this distinction does not dissuade us from applying the rationale of Burrage herein, and \u201c* * * we cannot amend statutes to provide what we consider a more logical result.\u201d State v. Link, 155 Ohio App.3d 585, 2003-Ohio-6798, 802 N.E.2d 680, \u00b6 17, citing State v. Virasayachack (2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 570, 741 N.E.2d 943. Accordingly, upon review, we find insufficient evidence was presented for reasonable fact finders to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty of involuntary manslaughter as charged by the State.\u201d\ncontrolled substance to another. In this case, Appellant was indicted specifically for trafficking in heroin.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nDr. Juhascik, a toxicologist with the Montgomery County Coroner\u2019s Office, testified that the results in the toxicology report were consistent with a heroin overdose. The report was given to Dr. Robert Shott, the Montgomery County Coroner, who prepared an opinion as to Tyler\u2019s cause of death. Dr. Shott explained that 136 nanograms per milliliter found in Tyler\u2019s femoral blood was enough to be a fatal overdose, and he opined, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Tyler\u2019s cause of death was heroin intoxication.\n\nNot only is Appellant\u2019s conviction for involuntary manslaughter supported by sufficient evidence, based solely on the fact it is a predicate offense, we also find any rational trier of fact could have found all the elements of involuntary manslaughter proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, his conviction is also supported by sufficient evidence. As such, we overrule Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR FOUR\n\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury as to the lesser-included offense of reckless homicide. Additionally,\nAppellant contends that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to request an instruction on reckless homicide. Appellant raises two separate and significant arguments; however, we note that he has failed to separately argue the assignments of error as required by App.R. 16(A)(7). While App.R. 12(A)(2) provides authority to disregard assignments of error on this basis, we may still address the assignments in the interest of justice. State v. Matzinger, 81 N.E.3d 841, 2017-Ohio-324, (4th Dist.) at \u00b6 28; State v. Reye, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 15CA010770, 2016-Ohio-3495, 2016 WL 3387769, \u00b6 5. See also Comisford v. Erie Ins. Property Cas. Co., 4th Dist. Gallia No. 10CA3, 2011-Ohio-1373, at \u00b6 29. Because in this case it appears to be a simple matter of form, we proceed to consider both arguments.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\u00b6109 Our review of whether a jury instruction is warranted is de novo. State v. Schwendeman, 4th Dist. Athens No. 17CA7, 2018-Ohio-240, at \u00b618; State v. Depew, 4th Dist. Ross No. 00CA2562, 2002-Ohio-6158, at \u00b6 24 (\u201cWhile a trial court has some discretion in the actual wording of an instruction, the issue of whether an instruction is required presents a question of law for de novo review.\u201d) However, because Appellant failed to request an instruction on reckless homicide, we review Appellant\u2019s\nargument hereunder a \u201cplain-error\u201d standard of review. Notice of plain error under Crim.R. 52(B) is to be taken with the utmost of caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. *State v. Grube*, \u00b6 34; *See, e.g.*, *State v. Barnes*, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002); *State v. Hill*, 92 Ohio St.3d 191, 196, 749 N.E.2d 274 (2001). Plain error should not be invoked unless it can be said that, but for the error, the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise. *See, e.g.*, *State v. Jackson*, 92 Ohio St.3d 436, 438, 751 N.E.2d 946 (2001); *State v. Sanders*, 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 263, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001).\n\n**LEGAL ANALYSIS**\n\n1. Did the trial court commit plain error by failing to give a lesser included instruction on reckless homicide?\n2. Did Appellant\u2019s counsel render ineffective assistance by failing to request the lesser included offense instruction of reckless homicide?\n\n{\u00b6110} The question of whether a particular offense should be submitted to the finder of fact as a lesser-included offense involves a two-tiered analysis. *State v. Deanda*, 136 Ohio St.3d 118, 2013-Ohio-1722, 989 N.E.2d 986, at \u00b6 6; *State v. Evans*, 122 Ohio St.3d 381, 2009-Ohio-2974, 911 N.E.2d 889, \u00b6 13. *State v. Wilson*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 13CA3542, 2015-Ohio-2016, at \u00b6 42. The first tier, also called the \u201cstatutory-elements\n\n---\n\n9 *Deanda* provides a comprehensive historical review of the lesser-offenses analysis.\nstep,\u201d is a purely legal question, wherein we determine whether one offense is generally a lesser-included offense of the charged offense. *State v. Kidder*, 32 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 513 N.E.2d 311 (1987). The second tier looks to the evidence in a particular case and determines whether \u201c\u2018a jury could reasonably find the defendant not guilty of the charged offense, but could convict the defendant of the lesser-included offense.\u2019\u201d *Evans* at \u00b6 13, quoting *Shaker Hts. v. Mosely*, 113 Ohio St.3d 329, 2007-Ohio-2072, 865 N.E.2d 859, \u00b6 11.\n\n{\u00b6111} In *State v. Deem*, 40 Ohio St.3d 205, 533 N.E.2d 294 (1988), paragraph three of the syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio held:\n\n\u201cAn offense may be a lesser-included offense of another if (i) the offense carries a lesser penalty than the other; (ii) the greater offense cannot, as statutorily defined, ever be committed without the lesser offense, as statutorily defined, also being committed; and (iii) some element of the greater offense is not required to prove the commission of the lesser offense.\u201d\n\n{\u00b6112} The *Deem* statement of the rule remained the norm in Ohio for 20 years, until it was further reworded in *Evans, supra; Deanda, supra*, at \u00b6 13. In *Deanda, supra*, the Supreme Court of Ohio explained:\n\n\u201c[T]he test does not require identical language to define the two offenses, but focuses upon whether the words used in the statute defining the greater offense will put the offender on notice that an indictment for that offense could also result in the prosecution of the lesser-included offense. *Evans* at \u00b6 22. Thus, in order \u2018to ensure that such implausible scenarios will not derail a proper lesser included offense analysis\u2019 in the future,\nwe made one minor change in the phrasing of the second step of the statutory-elements test stated in Deem, by deleting the word \u2018ever.\u2019 Id. at \u00b6 25. The second step now requires that \u2018the greater offense as statutorily defined cannot be committed without the lesser offense as statutorily defined also being committed.\u2019 Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.\u201d\n\n\u00b6113 With this framework in mind, we now consider whether the trial court should have given the jury a reckless homicide instruction as a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter. Our research has yielded little guidance on whether, as a general premise, reckless homicide is a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter. Other appellate districts have reached differing conclusions."}

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO INSTRUCT THE JURY AS TO THE LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSE OF RECKLESS HOMICIDE. ADDITIONALLY, APPELLANT VOGT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL WHEN HIS ATTORNEY FAILED TO REQUEST AN INSTRUCTION ON THE LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSE OF RECKLESS HOMICIDE. FIFTH, SIXTH, AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS\nOF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND\nARTICLE I, SECTION 10 AND 16 OF THE OHIO\nCONSTITUTION.\n\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63 On May 31, 2016, Appellant was indicted by a Washington\nCounty Grand Jury on two counts: (1) involuntary manslaughter, R.C.\n2903.04(A)&(C); and (2) trafficking in drugs, R.C.\n2925.03(A)(1)&(C)(6)(a). The indictment occurred subsequent to the\noverdose death of Tyler Miller which occurred on January 16, 2016. Tyler\nMiller was a young man who had just returned to Washington County after\nbeing drug free while in rehabilitation for his heroin addiction. The\nindictment alleges that shortly upon Tyler Miller\u2019s return to his hometown,\nAppellant sold him heroin.\n\n\u00b64 Appellant proceeded to a jury trial which commenced on\nDecember 5, 2016. On the second day of trial, a discussion was held in\nchambers regarding: (1) text messages which had not been provided to\ndefense counsel as part of pretrial discovery and which, the defense argued,\nviolated Crim.R. 16; and (2) the existence of a conflict of interest which had\narisen on the part of defense counsel as a result of the violation. After\ndiscussion amongst the attorneys and the trial court, the trial court declared a\nmistrial and rescheduled the trial for a date in January 2017.\nOn January 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss both counts of the indictment filed against him on the ground that his state and federal constitutional rights against Double Jeopardy had been violated. Appellant argued that the State had willfully flouted its responsibilities to disclose evidence under the Ohio criminal rules. After the State filed a responsive brief, the trial court denied Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nAppellant again proceeded to trial on March 27, 2017. At trial, the State\u2019s first witness was Tyler\u2019s father. John Miller testified he discovered Tyler had a drug problem in March 2015. Tyler, who worked in his family\u2019s plumbing and electric business, was exhibiting erratic behavior. After the drug problem was confronted, Tyler presented to L&P services for outpatient treatment and attended NA meetings. He did not want to go to inpatient rehabilitation.\n\nIn the fall of 2015, Tyler overdosed. He was successfully revived with Narcan and continued his outpatient drug counseling through the fall of 2015. In early December 2015, Tyler acknowledged that he needed inpatient rehab. Tyler went into Camden Clark for 5-6 days and then\nwent into Parkside drug and alcohol rehabilitation in Columbus for over a month.\u00b9\n\n{\u00b68} John Miller specifically testified Tyler\u2019s cell phone and wallet were in the Millers\u2019 possession while he was at inpatient rehabilitation in Columbus. Tyler also parked his truck at his parents\u2019 house. While Tyler was in rehab, his mother, Jill Miller, searched his wallet several times and found no illegal drugs inside it.\n\n{\u00b69} Tyler was discharged from Parkside on January 15, 2016, and his parents and his girlfriend, Josie Schau, drove to Columbus to bring him home. The group stopped in Zanesville to eat and arrived at the Millers\u2019 home around 7:00 p.m. On the way home, Tyler was in good spirits, talking about the future and even singing along with the radio. Tyler indicated he wanted to become an addiction counselor so he could help others. John Miller saw no indication his son was using any drug.\n\n{\u00b610} Upon return to the Millers\u2019 home, Tyler retrieved his wallet and cell phone. His truck battery seemed to be dead, so Josie drove Tyler to his residence in Beverly where he lived with his sister, Samantha Miller. John Miller last saw his son alive between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. on January 15, 2016.\n\n\u00b9 Information regarding L&P Services, Camden Clark, and Parkside was not further developed in testimony.\nThe next morning, January 16, 2016, John Miller texted Tyler to see if he wanted to go hunting. Tyler did not reply. John Miller proceeded to go hunting alone, and he returned home between 3:00 and 3:30 p.m. Since neither parent had heard from Tyler, John Miller went to Samantha\u2019s house and knocked on the door. When no one answered, Mr. Miller opened the door and called out again. John Miller soon found Tyler lying motionless with his wallet lying beside him and immediately called 911, but emergency personnel were never able to revive Tyler.\n\nAfter emergency personnel and law enforcement left the scene, Jill Miller and Samantha were looking through Tyler\u2019s wallet and found something which looked like a small rock, wrapped in a piece of paper. They immediately contacted law enforcement. John Miller concluded his direct testimony acknowledging that Tyler had available funds, his regular paycheck and a Christmas bonus, in his bank account when he returned from rehabilitation.\n\nJosie Schau next testified that she and Tyler had been in a relationship for 3 years at the time of his death. Josie discovered that Tyler was using heroin only after he overdosed in the summer of 2015. Tyler had never used heroin in her presence.\nAlthough Tyler did not have his cell phone with him at Parkside, he called Josie regularly. While in rehab, Tyler\u2019s mood changed and he seemed happy again.\n\nJosie\u2019s testimony correlated with John Miller\u2019s. When Josie accompanied the Millers to bring Tyler home, she also noticed he was in a good mood and making plans for the future. Josie testified after driving Tyler home, she stayed and visited Tyler and Samantha while Tyler cleaned the receipts out of his wallet and played with his dog. When Samantha went to bed, Tyler and Josie watched a movie together. During the entire time Josie was with Tyler on January 15th, she never observed him using drugs.\n\nJosie left at 11:00 p.m. on January 15, 2016. At that time, Tyler was still happy and thankful, reiterating that it had been a good decision to go into rehab. When Josie reached her home, she texted Tyler to let him know she had arrived safely. He texted her a brief reply and then texted her later at 2:13 a.m. on January 16th. Josie did not receive Tyler\u2019s last text until morning. When she replied, he did not respond.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b648} In the present matter, after Appellant objected to the admission of the texts and explained his possible conflict, the record indicates that after discussion was had both on and off the record, the court declared a mistrial. Appellant argues that the State\u2019s action in failing to disclose the text messages in violation of Crim.R. 16 forced or manipulated the court into the position where a mistrial was necessary and was imposed upon him. The record reflects defense counsel neither requested nor objected to the declaration of mistrial.\n\n{\u00b649} The Supreme Court of Ohio held in *Anderson* that \u201cwhen a mistrial was \u2018instigated by prosecutorial misconduct designed to provoke [the] mistrial,\u2019 retrial is barred by double jeopardy.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 32, quoting *State v. Glover*, 35 Ohio St.3d 18, 517 N.E.2d 900 (1988), syllabus; see also *Oregon v. Kennedy*, 456 U.S. 667, 676, 102 S.Ct. 2083 (1982) (double jeopardy bars retrial if the prosecutor has engaged in misconduct intended to\n\u201cgoad\u201d the defense into moving for a mistrial); *Green v. United States*, 355 U.S. 184, 188, 78 S.Ct. 221 (1957) (\u201ca prosecutor or judge [is prohibited] from subjecting a defendant to a second prosecution by discontinuing the trial when it appears that the jury might not convict\u201d).\n\n{\u00b650} This court has also noted that the prohibition against double jeopardy precludes a second trial absent (1) a mistrial justified by a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d or (2) consent to the mistrial by the defendant. *Johnson*, supra, at \u00b6 14, quoting *Klein v. Leis*, 548 F.3d 425, 431 (6th Cir.2008). \u201cIn determining whether a \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 exists, Courts need not find an absence of alternatives but only a \u2018high degree\u2019 of necessity.\u201d *Johnson*, supra, at 15, quoting *Klein* at 431. \u201cWhat constitutes a \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 is left to the discretion of the courts, which must \u2018exercise a sound discretion on the subject [as] it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere.\u201d *Gunnell*, 132 Ohio St.3d 442, 2012\u2013Ohio\u20133236, 973 N.E.2d 243, at \u00b6 26, quoting *United States v. Perez*, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580 (1824).\n\n{\u00b651} In Appellant\u2019s case, while the State failed to provide the texts during discovery, we do not find this omission was intentionally calculated to invite a mistrial. The texts at issue were between Appellant and his girlfriend and in preparing for trial, the prosecution would have likely been\nfocusing on the texts linking Appellant to Tyler Miller. Arguably, the omission could have been negligence. In *State v. Hodges*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 17MA0025, 2018-Ohio-447, the appellate court recently noted at \u00b6 18, that \u201c[a] retrial is not barred on double jeopardy grounds where the state's mere negligence, rather than intentional misconduct, required the trial court to grant a mistrial on a defense motion. *Hodges*, *supra*, citing *State v. Wood*, 114 Ohio App.3d 395, 400, 683 N.E.2d 354 (10th Dist.1996), citing *United States v. Dinitz*, 424 U.S. 600, 607,611, 96 S.Ct. 1075 (1976).\n\n\u00b652 More importantly, the State had no way of knowing Appellant\u2019s counsel represented Cory Forshey in an unrelated matter and hence, no way of knowing that use of the texts would place Appellant\u2019s counsel in the position of having a conflict of interest. Instead, any possibility of a conflict of interest would have been known to defense counsel when counsel was provided with the recorded interview of the State\u2019s response to discovery which was filed June 8, 2016. In its response to discovery, the State provided Appellant\u2019s counsel with the recorded interview in which Appellant attempts to shift any blame to his friend Cory Forshey. At this point, counsel should have considered the possibility of a conflict of interest in representing both defendants.\nThe Hodges court also noted the state did not gain material advantage from the mistrial itself. *Id.* at \u00b6 24. Similarly, we do not see that the State gained any material advantage from the mistrial. In fact, Appellant was additionally armed with the text messages at issue and gained advantage of time to further prepare his defense or to consider his alternatives.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declaring a mistrial. We find an absence of evidence suggesting that the State engaged in intentional misconduct in order to necessitate a mistrial. And, the journal entry denying Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss stated the trial court\u2019s reasoning as follows:\n\n\u201cThe Court FINDS that the failure to provide the texts during discovery did not create the conflict of interest which resulted in the mistrial of this case as any conflict of interest which existed was known to Defendant long before the State\u2019s revelation of the additional texts. The court further FINDS that the State\u2019s failure to provide the additional texts was not misconduct intentionally calculated to create or invite mistrial.\u201d\n\nWhile defense counsel did not request the mistrial, defense counsel asserted that there was a \u201cpossible conflict of interest.\u201d As set forth above, what constitutes a manifest necessity is left to the discretion of the trial court. While not explicitly finding a manifest necessity, the trial court was obviously concerned about a possible conflict of interest as defense counsel emphasized this argument.\nWe conclude the court\u2019s decision constituted an implicit finding that the possible conflict of interest, as vigorously asserted by defense counsel when arguing the alleged Crim.R. 16 violation, created a manifest necessity for the mistrial. As such, the protection afforded by the prohibition against double jeopardy did not attach. The trial court did not err in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. We hereby overrule Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.\n\nASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR ONE AND TWO\n\nUnder assignment of error one, Appellant argues his conviction for involuntary manslaughter is not supported by sufficient evidence. Under assignment of error two, he argues his convictions for involuntary manslaughter and drug trafficking are against the manifest weight of the evidence. Because the matters are interrelated, we consider Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error jointly.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nIn determining whether a criminal conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest\nmiscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed. *State v. Lamb*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 17CA3796, 2018-Ohio-1405, \u00b6 19; *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997); *State v. Hunter*, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, \u00b6 119. The weight and credibility of evidence are to be determined by the trier of fact. *Lamb, supra*, at \u00b6 20; *State v. Kirkland*, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1965, 15 N.E.3d 818, at \u00b6 132. The trier of fact is free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of any witness, and we defer to the trier of fact on evidentiary weight and credibility issues because it is in the best position to gauge the witnesses' demeanor, gestures, and voice inflections, and to use these observations to weigh their credibility. *State v. Dillard*, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 13CA9, 2014-Ohio-4974, at \u00b6 28; citing *State v. West*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 12CA3507, 2014-Ohio-1941, at \u00b6 23.\n\n**LEGAL ANALYSIS**\n\n1. **Drug Trafficking**\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6122 When considering whether trial counsel's representation amounts to deficient performance, \u201ca court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d Hill, supra, at \u00b6 42, quoting Strickland at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Thus, \u201cthe defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d Id. \u201cA properly licensed attorney is presumed to execute his duties in an ethical and competent manner.\u201d State v. Taylor, 4th Dist. Washington No. 07CA11, 2008-Ohio-482, \u00b6 10, quoting State v. Smith, 17 Ohio St.3d 98, 100, 477 N.E.2d 1128 (1985).\n\n\u00b6123 As cited above, \u201c[T]actical or strategic trial decisions, even if ultimately unsuccessful, do not generally constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d State v. Rizer, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 10CA3, 2011-Ohio-5702, at \u00b6 37, quoting In re Wingo, 143 Ohio App.3d 652, 668, 2001\u2013Ohio\u20132477, 758 N.E.2d 780, (4th Dist.), citing State v. Carter, 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 558, 1995\u2013Ohio\u2013104, 651 N.E.2d 965. The underlying conviction, trafficking in drugs, was supported by circumstantial evidence which defense counsel vigorously challenged.

McFarland, Judge\n\nNOTICE TO COUNSEL\n\nPursuant to Local Rule No. 14, this document constitutes a final judgment entry and the time period for further appeal commences from the date of filing with the clerk.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nThe appellate court in Brown recently considered his argument that his involuntary manslaughter conviction, based on a predicate offense of corrupting another with drugs, was not supported by sufficient evidence. The appellate court simply concluded at \u00b6 30:\n\u201cSince we have found Brown\u2019s arguments against his conviction for corrupting another with drugs are without merit, his conviction for involuntary manslaughter has a properly supported predicate convictions and withstands the sufficiency of the evidence analysis.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Appellant\u2019s conviction for trafficking with drugs is not against the manifest weight of the evidence and thus, his conviction for involuntary manslaughter has a properly supported predicate conviction. Thus, we find no merit to Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n\u00b694 Similar to the abbreviated analysis in Brown, our decision in State v. Wickersham, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 13CA10, 2015-Ohio-2756, at \u00b6 27, allows for disposition of Appellant\u2019s involuntary manslaughter conviction sufficiency challenge in summary fashion. However, under Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error arguing the sufficiency of his involuntary manslaughter conviction, Appellant makes a different and distinct argument. Appellant asserts that, assuming he delivered heroin to Tyler Miller, he could not have legally foreseen Miller\u2019s death because he could not have known that the effects of a small amount of heroin could be magnified due to Miller\u2019s time in the drug rehabilitation program. Appellant concludes that the evidence against him is insufficient because:\n\n1) He cannot be held responsible for the consequences that a reasonable person could not expect to follow from his conduct; and,\n2) He cannot be held responsible in light of Dr. Shott\u2019s testimony that it is possible that a person who had just been in rehab and was presumably drug-free could overdose more easily.\n\n{\u00b695} When a court reviews a record for sufficiency, \u2018[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d Lamb, \u00b6 18, quoting State v. Maxwell, 139 Ohio St.3d 12, 2014-Ohio-1019, 9 N.E.3d 930, \u00b6 146; quoting State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus; Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (1979). \u201cThe court must defer to the trier of fact on questions of credibility and the weight assigned to the evidence.\u201d State v. Dillard, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 13CA9, 2014-Ohio-4974, at \u00b6 22; citing State v. Kirkland, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, 15 N.E.3d 818, \u00b6 132.\n\n{\u00b696} Our review of Ohio law demonstrates that Appellant herein is not the first defendant to argue as to the \u201cforeseeability\u201d of a death occurring as a result of a conviction for trafficking in drugs or corrupting another with drugs. Generally, other courts have rejected this argument.\n\n{\u00b697} In State v. Sabo, 3rd Dist. Union No. 14-09-33, 2010-Ohio-1261, the defendant allegedly transported liquid methadone and other drugs to Union County, Ohio, where he shared them with another individual who\nlater overdosed. Sabo was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nSabo argued his conviction was not based on sufficient evidence and was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In reviewing his appeal, the appellate court noted at \u00b6 25:\n\n\u201cThis Court has previously cited to the 10th District's decision in State v. Losey, 23 Ohio App.3d 93, 94-95, 491 N.E.2d 379 (10th Dist. 1985), for guidance on the intention of the Legislature in its use of \u201cproximate result\u201d under R.C. 2903.04. See Shoemaker, 2006-Ohio-5159, at \u00b6 65. In that decision, the 10th District stated as follows:\n\nUnder [R.C. 2903.04], defendant cannot be held responsible for consequences no reasonable person could expect to follow from his conduct; he will be held responsible for consequences which are direct, normal, and reasonably inevitable-as opposed to extraordinary or surprising-when viewed in the light of ordinary experience. In this sense, then, \u201cproximate result\u201d bears a resemblance to the concept of \u201cproximate cause\u201d in that defendant will be held responsible for those foreseeable consequences which are known to be, or should be known to be, within the scope of the risk created by his conduct. State v. Chambers, 53 Ohio App.2d 266, 373 N.E.2d 393 (9th Dist. 1977). Here, that means that death reasonably could be anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result under these or similar circumstances. See State v. Nosis, 22 Ohio App.2d 16, 457 N.E.2d 414 (9th Dist. 1969). Losey, 23 Ohio App.3d at 95, 491 N.E.2d 379.\u201d\n\n\u00b698 Sabo argued that there was insufficient evidence that his aggravated trafficking of drugs proximately caused the victim\u2019s death.\n\nSpecifically, he claimed that given the evidence presented at trial, only the liquid methadone could be associated with him, and neither expert witness\ncould say which one of the five significant drugs found through testing caused the victim\u2019s death. Sabo concluded it was unforeseeable for him to have known that the victim had toxic levels of other significant drugs in his body when he administered the liquid methadone. The appellate court disagreed, based on the evidence presented in Sabo\u2019s case. Citing State v. Baksi (Dec. 23, 1999), 11th Dist. No. 98-T-0123, at *16 and State v. Grunden, 65 Ohio App.3d 777, 783-84, 585 N.E.2d 487 (3rd Dist. 1989), the Sabo court noted at \u00b6 27:\n\n\u201cWhile Michael's death was the result of the effects of taking multiple drugs, and neither expert could pinpoint which exact drug caused Michael's death, we believe that a fatal consequence was within the foreseeable scope of risk created by Sabo's conduct in administering the liquid methadone when there was ample evidence regarding Michael's inebriated condition, the fact that he and Sabo had taken other substances together that night, and the fact that Sabo had even warned Michael about using the liquid methadone.\u201d\n\nOther courts have addressed the foreseeability argument within the context of a manifest weight of the evidence analysis. In State v. Wells, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2016-02-009, 2017-Ohio-420, the decedent traveled to Wells\u2019 home to exchange his prescription for illegal drugs. After obtaining \u201cdope\u201d and injecting himself, the victim immediately\n\n---\n\n5 The Baksi court found that there was sufficient evidence to support involuntary manslaughter conviction when evidence showed defendant prepared an extremely strong hit of heroin and gave the loaded syringe to another inmate who was known to abuse drugs. Grunden held that reasonable minds could have concluded at the close of the State\u2019s case that the infant\u2019s death was proximately caused by the defendant's conduct in leaving a gram of cocaine unattended on a coffee table, well within the reach and propensities of a thirteen-month-old child.\noverdosed. Testing later revealed he had cocaine metabolites and fentanyl in his system at the time of death. At trial, a forensic pathologist and coroner testified that the level of fentanyl in his system caused him to stop breathing. The appellate court found that given the evidence before it, the jury did not lose its way in finding that Wells\u2019 actions caused the overdose death. The appellate court stated at \u00b6 39:\n\n\u201cThere is nothing extraordinary or surprising about the manner of [the victim\u2019s] death in relation to appellant\u2019s actions. Appellant provided drugs to a known drug abuser. The possibility of an overdose is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of providing a controlled substance to another. (Emphasis added). See, e.g., State v. Patterson, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2013\u2013T\u20130062, 2015\u2013Ohio\u20134423, \u00b6 80\u201395; State v. Zusman, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2014\u2013L\u2013087, 2015\u2013Ohio\u20133218.\u201d\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6113 With this framework in mind, we now consider whether the trial court should have given the jury a reckless homicide instruction as a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter. Our research has yielded little guidance on whether, as a general premise, reckless homicide is a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter. Other appellate districts have reached differing conclusions.\n\n\u00b6114 In State v. Hipshire, 2nd Dist. Darke No. 2010-CA-07, 2011-Ohio-3863, the defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of reckless homicide. The trial court instructed the jury on the elements of involuntary manslaughter, but stated that it could find nothing to indicate that reckless homicide was a lesser-included offense in terms of statutory interpretation or common law decision. As in Appellant\u2019s case herein, Hipshire was convicted of having violated R.C. 2903.04(A), involuntary manslaughter, which does not specify a culpable mental state, but the mental state \u201cis supplied by the underlying offense.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28. See also State v. Carusone, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C\u2013010681, 2003\u2013Ohio\u20131018, \u00b6 47.\nIn Hipshire, the underlying felony offense for which Hipshire was indicted was a violation of R.C. 2903.16(A), failing to provide for a functionally impaired person, which required proof of the mental state of \u201cknowingly.\u201d The appellate court held:\n\n\u201cAlthough Hipshire should have been more attentive to his wife's condition, there is evidence that she was not malnourished, that she did receive food and medication, and that some degree of care was given. A jury could reasonably conclude that Hipshire showed heedless indifference to the consequences and perversely disregarded a known risk that his conduct was likely to result in his wife's death, thus meriting the Reckless Homicide instruction. Accordingly, the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on Reckless Homicide as a lesser-included offense.\u201d\n\nThe Hipshire court ultimately concluded that the trial court based its decision on incorrect legal grounds, not on factual conclusions relating to the state of the evidence.10\n\nIn Carusone, supra, the appellate court considered the culpable mental states required for involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide and concluded that the mental states were inconsistent. However, Carusone is distinguishable in that Carusone was involved in an altercation with two victims (emphasis added). The court held at \u00b6 50:\n\n---\n\n10 Hipshire held that the court's stated reason for refusing to give the instruction was based on unsound reasoning\u2014an error of law\u2014and in that respect, was an abuse of discretion. Id. at 41. See, e.g., AAAA Enterprises, Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.3d 597(1990).\n\u201cWe hold, under the facts of this case, that Carusone could not have been found guilty of both involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide. * * * The evidence did not reasonably support findings that Carusone acted both knowingly and recklessly * * *.\u201d\n\n\u00b6117 In State v. Patterson, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2013-T-0062, 2015-Ohio-4423, a case similar to ours, the defendant was convicted for reckless homicide and corrupting another with drugs, along with other felonies. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Wright opined at \u00b6 117:\n\n\u201cInvoluntary manslaughter can be committed without reckless homicide also being committed.\u201d\n\n\u00b6118 Assuming, as in Hipshire, there are occasions where reckless homicide may fairly be considered a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter, here, we do not find the trial court\u2019s failure to give a lesser-included instruction was in error, let alone plain error. At trial, the defense theory of the case was that there was an absence of evidence that Appellant trafficked in drugs. Appellant\u2019s involuntary manslaughter conviction is contingent only upon proof of the underlying felony trafficking. Defense counsel pointed out in closing that there was only circumstantial evidence of texting between Tyler Miller\u2019s phone and \u201cwhomever\u201d was using Appellant\u2019s phone. Defense counsel emphasized Appellant\u2019s lack of a criminal record. Defense counsel\u2019s closing argument emphasized that Appellant\u2019s friend, Cory Forshey, had access to Appellant\u2019s cell phone, thus\nattempting to plant the idea that Corey Forshey was the one trafficking in drugs the night Tyler Miller overdosed.\n\n{\u00b6119} It appears defense counsel\u2019s strategy was \u201call or nothing,\u201d to argue for a complete acquittal of both charges. It would have been inconsistent for Appellant\u2019s counsel to argue for complete acquittal while at the same time, attempt to argue that Appellant \u201cknew of a dangerous situation,\u201d yet \u201cfailed to use ordinary care\u201d as set forth above in the definition of \u201crecklessness.\u201d Generally, a failure to request a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense is presumed to be a matter of trial strategy. Wilson, supra, at \u00b6 42. In this case, that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel employed this \u201call-or-nothing\u201d strategy is a reasonable presumption.\n\n{\u00b6120} For the foregoing reasons, we find no plain error with regard to the trial court\u2019s failure to give a lesser-included offense jury instruction. Related to the above argument, Appellant has also asserted he received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his attorney\u2019s failure to request a lesser-included offense instruction. Given our finding that Appellant did not request the instruction as a matter of reasonable trial strategy, similarly, we find Appellant was not rendered the ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the lack of request for this instruction.\nCriminal defendants have a right to counsel, including a right to the effective assistance from counsel. *State v. Hill*, 4th Dist. Athens No. 16CA3, 2018-Ohio-67, at \u00b6 41. *McMann v. Richardson*, 397 U.S. 759, 770, 90 S.Ct. 1441 (1970); *State v. Stout*, 4th Dist. Gallia No. 07CA5, 2008-Ohio-1366, at \u00b6 21. To establish constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) that his counsel's performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense and deprived him of a fair trial. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984); *State v. Issa*, 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 67, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001); *State v. Goff*, 82 Ohio St.3d 123, 139, 694 N.E.2d 916 (1998). \u201cIn order to show deficient performance, the defendant must prove that counsel's performance fell below an objective level of reasonable representation. To show prejudice, the defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d *State v. Conway*, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 95 (citations omitted). \u201cFailure to establish either element is fatal to the claim.\u201d *State v. Jones*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 06CA3116, 2008-Ohio-968, \u00b6 14, 2008 WL 613116. Therefore, if one element is dispositive, a court need not analyze both. *State v. Madrigal*, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 389, 2000-\nOhio-448, 721 N.E.2d 52, (stating that a defendant's failure to satisfy one of the elements \u201cnegates a court's need to consider the other\u201d)."}

FIFTH, SIXTH, AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS\nOF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND\nARTICLE I, SECTION 10 AND 16 OF THE OHIO\nCONSTITUTION.\n\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\u00b63 On May 31, 2016, Appellant was indicted by a Washington\nCounty Grand Jury on two counts: (1) involuntary manslaughter, R.C.\n2903.04(A)&(C); and (2) trafficking in drugs, R.C.\n2925.03(A)(1)&(C)(6)(a). The indictment occurred subsequent to the\noverdose death of Tyler Miller which occurred on January 16, 2016. Tyler\nMiller was a young man who had just returned to Washington County after\nbeing drug free while in rehabilitation for his heroin addiction. The\nindictment alleges that shortly upon Tyler Miller\u2019s return to his hometown,\nAppellant sold him heroin.\n\n\u00b64 Appellant proceeded to a jury trial which commenced on\nDecember 5, 2016. On the second day of trial, a discussion was held in\nchambers regarding: (1) text messages which had not been provided to\ndefense counsel as part of pretrial discovery and which, the defense argued,\nviolated Crim.R. 16; and (2) the existence of a conflict of interest which had\narisen on the part of defense counsel as a result of the violation. After\ndiscussion amongst the attorneys and the trial court, the trial court declared a\nmistrial and rescheduled the trial for a date in January 2017.\nOn January 12, 2017, Appellant filed a motion to dismiss both counts of the indictment filed against him on the ground that his state and federal constitutional rights against Double Jeopardy had been violated. Appellant argued that the State had willfully flouted its responsibilities to disclose evidence under the Ohio criminal rules. After the State filed a responsive brief, the trial court denied Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\n\nAppellant again proceeded to trial on March 27, 2017. At trial, the State\u2019s first witness was Tyler\u2019s father. John Miller testified he discovered Tyler had a drug problem in March 2015. Tyler, who worked in his family\u2019s plumbing and electric business, was exhibiting erratic behavior. After the drug problem was confronted, Tyler presented to L&P services for outpatient treatment and attended NA meetings. He did not want to go to inpatient rehabilitation.\n\nIn the fall of 2015, Tyler overdosed. He was successfully revived with Narcan and continued his outpatient drug counseling through the fall of 2015. In early December 2015, Tyler acknowledged that he needed inpatient rehab. Tyler went into Camden Clark for 5-6 days and then\nwent into Parkside drug and alcohol rehabilitation in Columbus for over a month.\u00b9\n\n{\u00b68} John Miller specifically testified Tyler\u2019s cell phone and wallet were in the Millers\u2019 possession while he was at inpatient rehabilitation in Columbus. Tyler also parked his truck at his parents\u2019 house. While Tyler was in rehab, his mother, Jill Miller, searched his wallet several times and found no illegal drugs inside it.\n\n{\u00b69} Tyler was discharged from Parkside on January 15, 2016, and his parents and his girlfriend, Josie Schau, drove to Columbus to bring him home. The group stopped in Zanesville to eat and arrived at the Millers\u2019 home around 7:00 p.m. On the way home, Tyler was in good spirits, talking about the future and even singing along with the radio. Tyler indicated he wanted to become an addiction counselor so he could help others. John Miller saw no indication his son was using any drug.\n\n{\u00b610} Upon return to the Millers\u2019 home, Tyler retrieved his wallet and cell phone. His truck battery seemed to be dead, so Josie drove Tyler to his residence in Beverly where he lived with his sister, Samantha Miller. John Miller last saw his son alive between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. on January 15, 2016.\n\n\u00b9 Information regarding L&P Services, Camden Clark, and Parkside was not further developed in testimony.\nThe next morning, January 16, 2016, John Miller texted Tyler to see if he wanted to go hunting. Tyler did not reply. John Miller proceeded to go hunting alone, and he returned home between 3:00 and 3:30 p.m. Since neither parent had heard from Tyler, John Miller went to Samantha\u2019s house and knocked on the door. When no one answered, Mr. Miller opened the door and called out again. John Miller soon found Tyler lying motionless with his wallet lying beside him and immediately called 911, but emergency personnel were never able to revive Tyler.\n\nAfter emergency personnel and law enforcement left the scene, Jill Miller and Samantha were looking through Tyler\u2019s wallet and found something which looked like a small rock, wrapped in a piece of paper. They immediately contacted law enforcement. John Miller concluded his direct testimony acknowledging that Tyler had available funds, his regular paycheck and a Christmas bonus, in his bank account when he returned from rehabilitation.\n\nJosie Schau next testified that she and Tyler had been in a relationship for 3 years at the time of his death. Josie discovered that Tyler was using heroin only after he overdosed in the summer of 2015. Tyler had never used heroin in her presence.\nAlthough Tyler did not have his cell phone with him at Parkside, he called Josie regularly. While in rehab, Tyler\u2019s mood changed and he seemed happy again.\n\nJosie\u2019s testimony correlated with John Miller\u2019s. When Josie accompanied the Millers to bring Tyler home, she also noticed he was in a good mood and making plans for the future. Josie testified after driving Tyler home, she stayed and visited Tyler and Samantha while Tyler cleaned the receipts out of his wallet and played with his dog. When Samantha went to bed, Tyler and Josie watched a movie together. During the entire time Josie was with Tyler on January 15th, she never observed him using drugs.\n\nJosie left at 11:00 p.m. on January 15, 2016. At that time, Tyler was still happy and thankful, reiterating that it had been a good decision to go into rehab. When Josie reached her home, she texted Tyler to let him know she had arrived safely. He texted her a brief reply and then texted her later at 2:13 a.m. on January 16th. Josie did not receive Tyler\u2019s last text until morning. When she replied, he did not respond.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6113 With this framework in mind, we now consider whether the trial court should have given the jury a reckless homicide instruction as a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter.

Id. at 41. See, e.g., AAAA Enterprises, Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161, 553 N.E.3d 597(1990).\n\u201cWe hold, under the facts of this case, that Carusone could not have been found guilty of both involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide. * * * The evidence did not reasonably support findings that Carusone acted both knowingly and recklessly * * *.\u201d\n\n\u00b6117 In State v. Patterson, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2013-T-0062, 2015-Ohio-4423, a case similar to ours, the defendant was convicted for reckless homicide and corrupting another with drugs, along with other felonies. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Wright opined at \u00b6 117:\n\n\u201cInvoluntary manslaughter can be committed without reckless homicide also being committed.\u201d\n\n\u00b6118 Assuming, as in Hipshire, there are occasions where reckless homicide may fairly be considered a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter, here, we do not find the trial court\u2019s failure to give a lesser-included instruction was in error, let alone plain error. At trial, the defense theory of the case was that there was an absence of evidence that Appellant trafficked in drugs. Appellant\u2019s involuntary manslaughter conviction is contingent only upon proof of the underlying felony trafficking. Defense counsel pointed out in closing that there was only circumstantial evidence of texting between Tyler Miller\u2019s phone and \u201cwhomever\u201d was using Appellant\u2019s phone. Defense counsel emphasized Appellant\u2019s lack of a criminal record. Defense counsel\u2019s closing argument emphasized that Appellant\u2019s friend, Cory Forshey, had access to Appellant\u2019s cell phone, thus\nattempting to plant the idea that Corey Forshey was the one trafficking in drugs the night Tyler Miller overdosed.\n\n{\u00b6119} It appears defense counsel\u2019s strategy was \u201call or nothing,\u201d to argue for a complete acquittal of both charges. It would have been inconsistent for Appellant\u2019s counsel to argue for complete acquittal while at the same time, attempt to argue that Appellant \u201cknew of a dangerous situation,\u201d yet \u201cfailed to use ordinary care\u201d as set forth above in the definition of \u201crecklessness.\u201d Generally, a failure to request a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense is presumed to be a matter of trial strategy. Wilson, supra, at \u00b6 42. In this case, that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel employed this \u201call-or-nothing\u201d strategy is a reasonable presumption.\n\n{\u00b6120} For the foregoing reasons, we find no plain error with regard to the trial court\u2019s failure to give a lesser-included offense jury instruction. Related to the above argument, Appellant has also asserted he received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his attorney\u2019s failure to request a lesser-included offense instruction. Given our finding that Appellant did not request the instruction as a matter of reasonable trial strategy, similarly, we find Appellant was not rendered the ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the lack of request for this instruction.\nCriminal defendants have a right to counsel, including a right to the effective assistance from counsel. *State v. Hill*, 4th Dist. Athens No. 16CA3, 2018-Ohio-67, at \u00b6 41. *McMann v. Richardson*, 397 U.S. 759, 770, 90 S.Ct. 1441 (1970); *State v. Stout*, 4th Dist. Gallia No. 07CA5, 2008-Ohio-1366, at \u00b6 21. To establish constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) that his counsel's performance was deficient and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense and deprived him of a fair trial. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984); *State v. Issa*, 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 67, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001); *State v. Goff*, 82 Ohio St.3d 123, 139, 694 N.E.2d 916 (1998). \u201cIn order to show deficient performance, the defendant must prove that counsel's performance fell below an objective level of reasonable representation. To show prejudice, the defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d *State v. Conway*, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 95 (citations omitted). \u201cFailure to establish either element is fatal to the claim.\u201d *State v. Jones*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 06CA3116, 2008-Ohio-968, \u00b6 14, 2008 WL 613116. Therefore, if one element is dispositive, a court need not analyze both. *State v. Madrigal*, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 389, 2000-\nOhio-448, 721 N.E.2d 52, (stating that a defendant's failure to satisfy one of the elements \u201cnegates a court's need to consider the other\u201d).\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nThe appellate court in Brown recently considered his argument that his involuntary manslaughter conviction, based on a predicate offense of corrupting another with drugs, was not supported by sufficient evidence. The appellate court simply concluded at \u00b6 30:\n\u201cSince we have found Brown\u2019s arguments against his conviction for corrupting another with drugs are without merit, his conviction for involuntary manslaughter has a properly supported predicate convictions and withstands the sufficiency of the evidence analysis.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Appellant\u2019s conviction for trafficking with drugs is not against the manifest weight of the evidence and thus, his conviction for involuntary manslaughter has a properly supported predicate conviction. Thus, we find no merit to Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error.\n\n\u00b694 Similar to the abbreviated analysis in Brown, our decision in State v. Wickersham, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 13CA10, 2015-Ohio-2756, at \u00b6 27, allows for disposition of Appellant\u2019s involuntary manslaughter conviction sufficiency challenge in summary fashion. However, under Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error arguing the sufficiency of his involuntary manslaughter conviction, Appellant makes a different and distinct argument. Appellant asserts that, assuming he delivered heroin to Tyler Miller, he could not have legally foreseen Miller\u2019s death because he could not have known that the effects of a small amount of heroin could be magnified due to Miller\u2019s time in the drug rehabilitation program. Appellant concludes that the evidence against him is insufficient because:\n\n1) He cannot be held responsible for the consequences that a reasonable person could not expect to follow from his conduct; and,\n2) He cannot be held responsible in light of Dr. Shott\u2019s testimony that it is possible that a person who had just been in rehab and was presumably drug-free could overdose more easily.\n\n{\u00b695} When a court reviews a record for sufficiency, \u2018[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d Lamb, \u00b6 18, quoting State v. Maxwell, 139 Ohio St.3d 12, 2014-Ohio-1019, 9 N.E.3d 930, \u00b6 146; quoting State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus; Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (1979). \u201cThe court must defer to the trier of fact on questions of credibility and the weight assigned to the evidence.\u201d State v. Dillard, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 13CA9, 2014-Ohio-4974, at \u00b6 22; citing State v. Kirkland, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1966, 15 N.E.3d 818, \u00b6 132.\n\n{\u00b696} Our review of Ohio law demonstrates that Appellant herein is not the first defendant to argue as to the \u201cforeseeability\u201d of a death occurring as a result of a conviction for trafficking in drugs or corrupting another with drugs. Generally, other courts have rejected this argument.\n\n{\u00b697} In State v. Sabo, 3rd Dist. Union No. 14-09-33, 2010-Ohio-1261, the defendant allegedly transported liquid methadone and other drugs to Union County, Ohio, where he shared them with another individual who\nlater overdosed. Sabo was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nSabo argued his conviction was not based on sufficient evidence and was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In reviewing his appeal, the appellate court noted at \u00b6 25:\n\n\u201cThis Court has previously cited to the 10th District's decision in State v. Losey, 23 Ohio App.3d 93, 94-95, 491 N.E.2d 379 (10th Dist. 1985), for guidance on the intention of the Legislature in its use of \u201cproximate result\u201d under R.C. 2903.04. See Shoemaker, 2006-Ohio-5159, at \u00b6 65. In that decision, the 10th District stated as follows:\n\nUnder [R.C. 2903.04], defendant cannot be held responsible for consequences no reasonable person could expect to follow from his conduct; he will be held responsible for consequences which are direct, normal, and reasonably inevitable-as opposed to extraordinary or surprising-when viewed in the light of ordinary experience. In this sense, then, \u201cproximate result\u201d bears a resemblance to the concept of \u201cproximate cause\u201d in that defendant will be held responsible for those foreseeable consequences which are known to be, or should be known to be, within the scope of the risk created by his conduct. State v. Chambers, 53 Ohio App.2d 266, 373 N.E.2d 393 (9th Dist. 1977). Here, that means that death reasonably could be anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result under these or similar circumstances. See State v. Nosis, 22 Ohio App.2d 16, 457 N.E.2d 414 (9th Dist. 1969). Losey, 23 Ohio App.3d at 95, 491 N.E.2d 379.\u201d\n\n\u00b698 Sabo argued that there was insufficient evidence that his aggravated trafficking of drugs proximately caused the victim\u2019s death.\n\nSpecifically, he claimed that given the evidence presented at trial, only the liquid methadone could be associated with him, and neither expert witness\ncould say which one of the five significant drugs found through testing caused the victim\u2019s death. Sabo concluded it was unforeseeable for him to have known that the victim had toxic levels of other significant drugs in his body when he administered the liquid methadone. The appellate court disagreed, based on the evidence presented in Sabo\u2019s case. Citing State v. Baksi (Dec. 23, 1999), 11th Dist. No. 98-T-0123, at *16 and State v. Grunden, 65 Ohio App.3d 777, 783-84, 585 N.E.2d 487 (3rd Dist. 1989), the Sabo court noted at \u00b6 27:\n\n\u201cWhile Michael's death was the result of the effects of taking multiple drugs, and neither expert could pinpoint which exact drug caused Michael's death, we believe that a fatal consequence was within the foreseeable scope of risk created by Sabo's conduct in administering the liquid methadone when there was ample evidence regarding Michael's inebriated condition, the fact that he and Sabo had taken other substances together that night, and the fact that Sabo had even warned Michael about using the liquid methadone.\u201d\n\nOther courts have addressed the foreseeability argument within the context of a manifest weight of the evidence analysis. In State v. Wells, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2016-02-009, 2017-Ohio-420, the decedent traveled to Wells\u2019 home to exchange his prescription for illegal drugs. After obtaining \u201cdope\u201d and injecting himself, the victim immediately\n\n---\n\n5 The Baksi court found that there was sufficient evidence to support involuntary manslaughter conviction when evidence showed defendant prepared an extremely strong hit of heroin and gave the loaded syringe to another inmate who was known to abuse drugs. Grunden held that reasonable minds could have concluded at the close of the State\u2019s case that the infant\u2019s death was proximately caused by the defendant's conduct in leaving a gram of cocaine unattended on a coffee table, well within the reach and propensities of a thirteen-month-old child.\noverdosed. Testing later revealed he had cocaine metabolites and fentanyl in his system at the time of death. At trial, a forensic pathologist and coroner testified that the level of fentanyl in his system caused him to stop breathing. The appellate court found that given the evidence before it, the jury did not lose its way in finding that Wells\u2019 actions caused the overdose death. The appellate court stated at \u00b6 39:\n\n\u201cThere is nothing extraordinary or surprising about the manner of [the victim\u2019s] death in relation to appellant\u2019s actions. Appellant provided drugs to a known drug abuser. The possibility of an overdose is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of providing a controlled substance to another. (Emphasis added). See, e.g., State v. Patterson, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2013\u2013T\u20130062, 2015\u2013Ohio\u20134423, \u00b6 80\u201395; State v. Zusman, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2014\u2013L\u2013087, 2015\u2013Ohio\u20133218.\u201d\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n{\u00b648} In the present matter, after Appellant objected to the admission of the texts and explained his possible conflict, the record indicates that after discussion was had both on and off the record, the court declared a mistrial. Appellant argues that the State\u2019s action in failing to disclose the text messages in violation of Crim.R. 16 forced or manipulated the court into the position where a mistrial was necessary and was imposed upon him. The record reflects defense counsel neither requested nor objected to the declaration of mistrial.\n\n{\u00b649} The Supreme Court of Ohio held in *Anderson* that \u201cwhen a mistrial was \u2018instigated by prosecutorial misconduct designed to provoke [the] mistrial,\u2019 retrial is barred by double jeopardy.\u201d *Id.* at \u00b6 32, quoting *State v. Glover*, 35 Ohio St.3d 18, 517 N.E.2d 900 (1988), syllabus; see also *Oregon v. Kennedy*, 456 U.S. 667, 676, 102 S.Ct. 2083 (1982) (double jeopardy bars retrial if the prosecutor has engaged in misconduct intended to\n\u201cgoad\u201d the defense into moving for a mistrial); *Green v. United States*, 355 U.S. 184, 188, 78 S.Ct. 221 (1957) (\u201ca prosecutor or judge [is prohibited] from subjecting a defendant to a second prosecution by discontinuing the trial when it appears that the jury might not convict\u201d).\n\n{\u00b650} This court has also noted that the prohibition against double jeopardy precludes a second trial absent (1) a mistrial justified by a \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d or (2) consent to the mistrial by the defendant. *Johnson*, supra, at \u00b6 14, quoting *Klein v. Leis*, 548 F.3d 425, 431 (6th Cir.2008). \u201cIn determining whether a \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 exists, Courts need not find an absence of alternatives but only a \u2018high degree\u2019 of necessity.\u201d *Johnson*, supra, at 15, quoting *Klein* at 431. \u201cWhat constitutes a \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 is left to the discretion of the courts, which must \u2018exercise a sound discretion on the subject [as] it is impossible to define all the circumstances, which would render it proper to interfere.\u201d *Gunnell*, 132 Ohio St.3d 442, 2012\u2013Ohio\u20133236, 973 N.E.2d 243, at \u00b6 26, quoting *United States v. Perez*, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580 (1824).\n\n{\u00b651} In Appellant\u2019s case, while the State failed to provide the texts during discovery, we do not find this omission was intentionally calculated to invite a mistrial. The texts at issue were between Appellant and his girlfriend and in preparing for trial, the prosecution would have likely been\nfocusing on the texts linking Appellant to Tyler Miller. Arguably, the omission could have been negligence. In *State v. Hodges*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 17MA0025, 2018-Ohio-447, the appellate court recently noted at \u00b6 18, that \u201c[a] retrial is not barred on double jeopardy grounds where the state's mere negligence, rather than intentional misconduct, required the trial court to grant a mistrial on a defense motion. *Hodges*, *supra*, citing *State v. Wood*, 114 Ohio App.3d 395, 400, 683 N.E.2d 354 (10th Dist.1996), citing *United States v. Dinitz*, 424 U.S. 600, 607,611, 96 S.Ct. 1075 (1976).\n\n\u00b652 More importantly, the State had no way of knowing Appellant\u2019s counsel represented Cory Forshey in an unrelated matter and hence, no way of knowing that use of the texts would place Appellant\u2019s counsel in the position of having a conflict of interest. Instead, any possibility of a conflict of interest would have been known to defense counsel when counsel was provided with the recorded interview of the State\u2019s response to discovery which was filed June 8, 2016. In its response to discovery, the State provided Appellant\u2019s counsel with the recorded interview in which Appellant attempts to shift any blame to his friend Cory Forshey. At this point, counsel should have considered the possibility of a conflict of interest in representing both defendants.\nThe Hodges court also noted the state did not gain material advantage from the mistrial itself. *Id.* at \u00b6 24. Similarly, we do not see that the State gained any material advantage from the mistrial. In fact, Appellant was additionally armed with the text messages at issue and gained advantage of time to further prepare his defense or to consider his alternatives.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declaring a mistrial. We find an absence of evidence suggesting that the State engaged in intentional misconduct in order to necessitate a mistrial. And, the journal entry denying Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss stated the trial court\u2019s reasoning as follows:\n\n\u201cThe Court FINDS that the failure to provide the texts during discovery did not create the conflict of interest which resulted in the mistrial of this case as any conflict of interest which existed was known to Defendant long before the State\u2019s revelation of the additional texts. The court further FINDS that the State\u2019s failure to provide the additional texts was not misconduct intentionally calculated to create or invite mistrial.\u201d\n\nWhile defense counsel did not request the mistrial, defense counsel asserted that there was a \u201cpossible conflict of interest.\u201d As set forth above, what constitutes a manifest necessity is left to the discretion of the trial court. While not explicitly finding a manifest necessity, the trial court was obviously concerned about a possible conflict of interest as defense counsel emphasized this argument.\nWe conclude the court\u2019s decision constituted an implicit finding that the possible conflict of interest, as vigorously asserted by defense counsel when arguing the alleged Crim.R. 16 violation, created a manifest necessity for the mistrial. As such, the protection afforded by the prohibition against double jeopardy did not attach. The trial court did not err in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. We hereby overrule Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.\n\nASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR ONE AND TWO\n\nUnder assignment of error one, Appellant argues his conviction for involuntary manslaughter is not supported by sufficient evidence. Under assignment of error two, he argues his convictions for involuntary manslaughter and drug trafficking are against the manifest weight of the evidence. Because the matters are interrelated, we consider Appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error jointly.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nIn determining whether a criminal conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest\nmiscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed. *State v. Lamb*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 17CA3796, 2018-Ohio-1405, \u00b6 19; *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997); *State v. Hunter*, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, \u00b6 119. The weight and credibility of evidence are to be determined by the trier of fact. *Lamb, supra*, at \u00b6 20; *State v. Kirkland*, 140 Ohio St.3d 73, 2014-Ohio-1965, 15 N.E.3d 818, at \u00b6 132. The trier of fact is free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of any witness, and we defer to the trier of fact on evidentiary weight and credibility issues because it is in the best position to gauge the witnesses' demeanor, gestures, and voice inflections, and to use these observations to weigh their credibility. *State v. Dillard*, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 13CA9, 2014-Ohio-4974, at \u00b6 28; citing *State v. West*, 4th Dist.

The underlying conviction, trafficking in drugs, was supported by circumstantial evidence which defense counsel vigorously challenged. As such, we view counsel\u2019s decision not to request\nthe lesser-included instruction on reckless homicide to be a reasonable trial strategy and we do not find it to be deficient representation.\n\n\u00b6124 For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit to Appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error.

{"Index": "087-Norales-Martinez", "allegation": "APPELLANT WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS AND THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AS GUARANTEED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS, AS APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL MADE ERRORS SO DEFICIENT AS TO DEPRIVE APPELLANT OF A FAIR TRIAL.", "evidence": "ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n\nAPPELLANT WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS AND THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AS GUARANTEED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THE INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF HIS TRIAL COUNSEL AND NUMEROUS INCIDENTS OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT COMMITTED BY THE ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR.\n\nII. Law and Analysis\n\nIn his first assignment of error, Norales contends that he was denied due process and effective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel\u2019s errors in failing to (1) file a motion to suppress statements that he made at the Highway Patrol Post;\n(2) object to multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct; (3) object to irrelevant, \u201chighly prejudicial\u201d evidence; (4) object to the admission of hearsay statements; (5) object to the court\u2019s jury instructions; and (6) appreciate that a mandatory eight-year prison term was at stake. He argues that even if one of these errors by itself did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, the combination of the errors did.\n\n\u00b6 16 In his second assignment of error, Norales contends that he was denied due process and a fair trial based on the combined effect of the ineffective assistance of trial counsel and numerous incidents of misconduct by the assistant prosecutor. Resolution of the issues raised in Norales\u2019s second assignment of error are subsumed by those raised in his first assignment of error, therefore, we consider both assignments together.\n\nA. Failure to file a motion to suppress.\n\n\u00b6 17 After his arrest on December 9, 2016, Norales was taken to the Highway Patrol Post where he was questioned by Officer Steven Cousino, of the Sylvania Township Police Department, and Trooper Anthony Martin, of the Ohio State Highway Patrol, both of whom are assigned to the DEA task force in Toledo. Norales indicated that he speaks Spanish and does not speak English very well. Trooper Martin, therefore, advised Norales of his Miranda rights in Spanish. Officer Cousino asked questions of Norales in English, which Trooper Martin translated into Spanish. He translated Norales\u2019s responses in English for Officer Cousino. At trial, Trooper Martin was permitted to relay to the jury statements that Norales made during this questioning. Norales argues that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to file a motion to\nsuppress these statements. He claims that trial counsel should have challenged Trooper Martin\u2019s level of fluency in Spanish, and, therefore, the accuracy of the statements from Norales that he interpreted and testified about.\n\n\u00b6 18 Before Trooper Martin testified at trial, he was questioned about his Spanish-language skills. He explained that he took two years of Spanish in high school. When he was 19, he embarked on a mission trip to Ecuador where he was immersed in the language for two years. Before leaving for that trip, he received training in Spanish at his church\u2019s missionary training center for approximately two months. As part of his job as a trooper, he is called upon to conduct interviews in Spanish. When asked by the assistant prosecutor to rate his fluency in Spanish on a scale of one to ten, Trooper Martin rated himself a seven.\n\n\u00b6 19 The state asked the court to qualify Trooper Martin as an expert Spanish interpreter or translator. With no objection from Norales, the court qualified him. Norales contends that trial counsel should have moved to suppress the statements he made to Trooper Martin because, by his own admission, Trooper Martin\u2019s translations are \u201cwrong 30% of the time.\u201d He queries \u201cwhich 30% of the Miranda rights Martin translated to [him] incorrectly[;] * * * what 30% of [his] responses to the warnings were misunderstood/misinterpreted by Martin[; and] * * * which 30% of Martin\u2019s account of what [he] told him was incorrect.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 20 In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an appellant must show that counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the\nadversarial process that the trial court cannot be relied on as having produced a just result. *State v. Shuttlesworth*, 104 Ohio App.3d 281, 287, 661 N.E.2d 817 (7th Dist.1995). To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, an appellant must show \u201c(1) deficient performance of counsel, i.e., performance falling below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been different.\u201d *State v. Hale*, 119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 204, citing *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d *State v. Sanders*, 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151, 761 N.E.2d 18 (2002).\n\n\u00b6 21 Counsel is not ineffective per se for failing to file a motion to suppress. *State v. Reynolds*, 2017-Ohio-1478, 89 N.E.3d 235, \u00b6 61 (6th Dist.). The defendant must show that (1) there was a valid ground to suppress the disputed evidence, (2) there was a reasonable probability of success on the motion; and (3) there was a reasonable probability that suppression of the evidence would have changed the outcome of the trial. *State v. Clark*, 6th Dist. Williams No. WM-09-009, 2010-Ohio-2383, \u00b6 21; *State v. Thompson*, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-11-1184, 2013-Ohio-1597, \u00b6 8. A claim of ineffective assistance will be rejected when counsel\u2019s failure to file a suppression motion \u201cwas a tactical decision, there was no reasonable probability of success, or there was no prejudice,\u201d or where counsel could have reasonably decided that filing a motion to suppress would be futile, even if there is evidence in the record to support such a motion.\nNorales relies on *State v. Ramirez*, 135 Ohio App.3d 89, 94, 732 N.E.2d 1065 (11th Dist.1999), in support of his position that trial counsel should have challenged Trooper Martin\u2019s qualifications and sought to suppress the statements he elicited. In *Ramirez*, the defendant moved to suppress statements he made to police because his *Miranda* rights were poorly translated by the interpreter provided by the police. For example, it was determined that (1) instead of using the Spanish term for \u201clegal rights,\u201d the translator repeatedly used a term that means \u201cright hand side;\u201d (2) instead of using the phrase \u201cunder the law,\u201d she used the word \u201cunderneath,\u201d thus her translation referenced \u201csomething to do with a right hand side that was physically underneath the law;\u201d (3) she told the defendant that he was entitled to \u201cnotifications\u201d of counsel and not that he had the right to have an attorney present during questioning; (4) she failed to tell defendant that if he elected to speak, his statements could be used against him in a court of law and that he had the right to an attorney free of charge if he could not afford one; and (5) in attempting to determine if the defendant was willing to waive counsel, it sounded more like she was asking him if he had an attorney. *Id.* The court held that the significant problems with the translation rendered the reading of his *Miranda* rights insufficient to adequately apprise appellant of his rights, therefore, the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. *Id.* at 96-97.\nHere, there is no indication in the record that Norales did not understand his *Miranda* rights. Norales testified at trial. He never suggested that a language barrier rendered him and Trooper Martin incapable of understanding each other. Rather, to the extent that Norales disputed a few of the statements Trooper Martin attributed to him (including that Norales had never been to Maryland before and that he helped Ortiz load heavy items into the U-Haul1), Norales testified that Trooper Martin \u201cmaybe * * * didn\u2019t remember\u201d or \u201cdidn\u2019t explain correctly\u201d or that \u201c[a] better explanation would have been better.\u201d\n\nIn addition to this, Trooper Martin interviewed Norales twice\u2014once on December 9, 2016, without counsel present, and once on January 5, 2017, with counsel present. On cross-examination at trial, defense counsel asked Trooper Martin to admit that Norales\u2019s story had stayed the same between his first and second interviews, except that Norales offered additional details at his second interview. Trooper Martin conceded that this was true. The fact that defense counsel sought to establish from Trooper Martin that Norales\u2019s version of events remained consistent between the first and second interviews suggests to us that any discrepancies between what Trooper Martin and Norales recalled at trial were not on account of a language barrier.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6 66 Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s leading or otherwise improper questions. Moreover, the assistant prosecutor\u2019s improper questions were not so pervasive as to constitute reversible prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n\u00b6 67 While evidence that pornography was found on Norales\u2019s phone was irrelevant, and while the assistant prosecutor improperly mocked Norales as a \u201cgood Christian,\u201d counsel was not ineffective for failing to object. These instances did not rise to the level of reversible prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n\u00b6 68 When read in its entirety, the assistant prosecutor\u2019s denigrating statements about defense counsel were not so pervasive as to cause prejudice to Norales. Trial counsel also was not ineffective for failing to object to the improper comments.\n\n\u00b6 69 Trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to hearsay statements admitted through Trooper Malone, especially given that the statements to which she testified were recorded and the recording was admitted as an exhibit at trial.\n\n\u00b6 70 When read as a whole, the jury instructions permitted the jury to reject the state\u2019s witnesses\u2019 translations. Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the instructions.\nNorales failed to articulate how the outcome of the trial was affected by trial counsel\u2019s belief that an eight-year prison term was merely presumed\u2014and was not mandatory.\n\nWe find Norales\u2019s two assignments of error not well-taken and affirm the July 10, 2017 judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas. Norales is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal under App.R. 24.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to App.R. 27.

JUDGE\n\nThis decision is subject to further editing by the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s Reporter of Decisions. Parties interested in viewing the final reported version are advised to visit the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s web site at: http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/ROD/docs/.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6 37 In his closing argument, the assistant prosecutor persisted with this theme:\n\nNow, this good Christian man would have you believe that he was the unluckiest man in the world * * *.\n\nI\u2019m going to encourage you to ask the Court for a computer, to plug this in, to open it up and peruse it, and to look at what was in the contents of this good Christian\u2019s cell phone, a cell phone that he claimed to have had for two or three years but occasionally loaned to Mr. Ortiz. Nearly 17,000 pornographic videos and pictures, not of his wife.\n\nAgain, trial counsel failed to object.\n\n\u00b6 38 That pornographic images were found on Norales\u2019s phone was not relevant to any issue in this case. We agree with Norales that there was no legitimate reason for raising this issue at trial\u2014either on cross-examination or in closing\u2014and that the assistant prosecutor acted improperly by doing so. State v. Dillon, 2016-Ohio-1561, 63 N.E.3d 712, \u00b6 36 (2d Dist.) (finding that admission of white-supremacist screen names and pornographic nature of web sites accessed by appellant were not relevant to any material issue in the case and were unfairly prejudicial); State v. Mills, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 8925, 1985 Ohio App. LEXIS 6883, *10 (July 17, 1985) (finding that possession of pornographic materials was irrelevant to issue of knowing possession of illicit drugs).\nWe also agree with Norales that the assistant prosecutor acted improperly when he asked Norales if he was Christian and then mocked him during closing argument, sarcastically referring to him as \u201cthis good Christian.\u201d See State v. Rahman, 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 153, 492 N.E.2d 401 (1986) (\u201c[A]ppeals to racial or religious prejudices are improper conduct on the part of a prosecutor and may exert such a substantial influence on the result at trial that reversal is required.\u201d); State v. Gilbert, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2010-09-240, 2011-Ohio-4340, \u00b6 58.\n\nBut while the assistant prosecutor acted improperly in asking about the pornographic images and referencing them during closing\u2014and in mocking Norales\u2019s Christianity\u2014we cannot say that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object. First, an objection from trial counsel may have served only to highlight the improper evidence. State v. Lawless, 9th Dist. Wayne No. 16AP0025, 2018-Ohio-444, \u00b6 20 (\u201c[T]rial counsel may have made the strategic decision not to object because doing so would \u2018only serve to highlight negative testimony.\u2019\u201d). Additionally, Norales has not shown that the outcome of the trial would have been different had an objection been registered.\n\nAnd while we recognize that the assistant prosecutor acted improperly, we cannot say that his conduct amounted to misconduct requiring reversal because, again, Norales has not shown that the outcome of the trial would have been different absent the improper conduct. See Boles, 190 Ohio App.3d 431, 2010-Ohio-5503, 942 N.E.2d 417, at \u00b6 50, citing Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d at 15, 470 N.E.2d 883 (\u201c[A] reversal for prosecutorial\nmisconduct will not occur unless it is clear that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for the misconduct.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 42 We find no ineffective assistance of counsel arising from trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s mocking references to Norales\u2019s Christianity and to references to the pornographic images found on his phone. We also find no reversible prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nD. Denigrating defense counsel.\n\n\u00b6 43 Following defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, the assistant prosecutor in his rebuttal argument began by stating \u201c[w]ell, that was entertaining.\u201d Multiple times, he called defense counsel\u2019s summary of the evidence misleading, and he referred to defense counsel\u2019s argument as \u201ca simple defense trick that they like to do to jurors to try and mislead you.\u201d Norales argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to these improper statements.\n\n\u00b6 44 \u201cGenerally, prosecutors are entitled to considerable latitude in opening and closing arguments.\u201d Boles, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-07-1255, 2009-Ohio-512, at \u00b6 47, citing State v. Ballew, 76 Ohio St.3d 244, 667 N.E.2d 369 (1996). During closing, a prosecutor may comment on what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn from the evidence. Id. He or she may not, however, denigrate or impute insincerity to defense counsel in the jury\u2019s presence. State v. Davis, 116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 301, citing State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 167. Having said this, isolated incidents of\nprosecutorial misconduct are considered harmless, and the closing argument must be viewed in its entirety to determine whether the defendant was prejudiced. *Id.*, citing *State v. Stevens*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19572, 2003-Ohio-6249.\n\n{\u00b6 45} Having reviewed the closing arguments in their entirety, we find that the assistant prosecutor\u2019s comments were not so pervasive as to cause prejudice to Norales. We also find that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s improper comments.\n\nE. Failure to object to jury instructions regarding expert testimony.\n\n{\u00b6 46} As previously discussed, Trooper Martin provided Spanish-to-English and English-to-Spanish translations during interviews of Norales. He was permitted to testify at trial concerning statements that Norales made during those interviews.\n\n{\u00b6 47} Additionally, Trooper Malone\u2019s cruiser was wired to record both video and audio of the back seat of the vehicle, and to record video of what was happening in front of the cruiser. U.S. Border Patrol Agent, Alexander Chavez, watched and listened to the recordings of the conversations between Bain, Ortiz, and Norales while they were seated in the back of Trooper Malone\u2019s squad car. Agent Chavez, like Norales, grew up in Honduras. Some of the audio was inaudible or unintelligible, but Agent Chavez transcribed what he was able to hear. He also watched the video recording of what was happening in front of the cruiser. This allowed him to determine when the suspects\u2019 conversations or statements were made in relation to what they were seeing outside the\ncruiser. He testified at trial concerning his translation and observations, and the transcript he created was admitted into evidence.\n\n\u00b6 48 The state asked the court to qualify Trooper Martin and Agent Chavez as experts in the translation of Spanish-to-English and English-to-Spanish. The trial court qualified both of them as experts. As to Agent Chavez, it did so over the objection of the defense; trial counsel did not raise an objection as to Trooper Martin testifying as an expert.\n\n\u00b6 49 In addition to these two witnesses, two interpreters were appointed to translate the proceedings due to Norales\u2019s lack of proficiency in English. Those two interpreters took an oath to follow the guidelines for legal interpreting. Trooper Martin and Agent Chavez were also asked to take interpreters\u2019 oaths after being qualified as expert witnesses.\n\n\u00b6 50 At the close of evidence, the trial court included an instruction to the jury with respect to the participation of the interpreters:\n\nDuring this trial the interpreters or translators have provided interpretations or translations. The interpreter/translators must provide a complete and accurate interpretation or translation without altering, omitting, or adding anything to what has been spoken or written and without explaining the statements of the original speaker or writer.\n\nYou are not permitted to make any assumptions about any witness or party based upon the use of an interpreter/translator. Do not allow the fact\nthat the testimony was in a language other than English influence you in any way.\n\nThe evidence you are to consider is only that provided through the interpreters/translators. Although some of you may understand Spanish, you must disregard your own interpretation or translation because you are not permitted to disagree with the English translations that have been provided to you. All jurors must consider the same evidence.\n\nBecause you have received multiple interpretations or translations that disagree, it is your duty to decide which, if any, interpretation or translation is accurate.\n\nThe court did not, however, provide an instruction with respect to the consideration of expert testimony.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nIN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\nSIXTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\nWOOD COUNTY\n\nState of Ohio     Court of Appeals No. WD-17-041\nAppellee\n\nv.\n\nSelin A.

Norales-Martinez\n(\u201cNorales\u201d), appeals the July 10, 2017 judgment of the Wood County Court of Common\nPleas, convicting him of one count of possession of marijuana and one count of\ntrafficking in marijuana, and sentencing him to a mandatory prison term of eight years.\nFor the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court judgment.\nI. Background\n\n\u00b6 2 On the morning of December 9, 2016, Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper, Ann Malone, and U.S. Border Patrol Agent, Nick King, were patrolling a stretch of the Ohio Turnpike in Wood County, Ohio, at the crossover at milepost 67.6. A U-Haul truck pulling a Hyundai vehicle on a trailer drove past Trooper Malone heading eastbound. Trooper Malone, a criminal interdiction officer, observed what she described as \u201ccriminal indicators\u201d manifested by the driver and the passengers of the U-Haul: the driver was sitting in a rigid position and did not look over at her, there were three occupants squeezed into the front seat, which looked to her to be \u201cvery uncomfortable,\u201d and the U-Haul was hauling a passenger vehicle with Maryland license plates, which seemed \u201ca little odd.\u201d She pulled behind the U-Haul to observe further behavior and to run a registration check. She learned that the Hyundai was a rental vehicle, which she described as \u201ca huge, huge red flag.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 3 With the trooper behind her, the driver of the U-Haul\u2014later identified as Belkis Bain-Garcia (\u201cBain\u201d)\u2014eventually committed minor marked lanes violations: she twice briefly drifted over the painted white lane divider without signaling, and she switched lanes but turned off her turn signal before fully completing the lane change. She also decreased her speed \u201cgreatly\u201d to 58 to 60 miles per hour in a 70-mile-per-hour zone and changed lanes \u201cfor no apparent reason.\u201d Trooper Malone initiated a stop of the vehicle.\nUpon approaching the vehicle, Trooper Malone noticed an odor of marijuana \u201cemitting from inside of the traffic [sic] portion of the U-Haul.\u201d She described that the U-Haul had a \u201clived-in\u201d look, with trash, cups, beverages, bottles of water, and snacks in the passenger compartment. There were numerous cell phones and chargers in the vehicle, and there was an air freshener hanging from a cell phone that was mounted to the window. According to Trooper Malone, the \u201clived-in\u201d look of the vehicle was significant because drug traffickers drive long distances and do not want to make stops. She said that the multiple cell phones and the air freshener are also criminal indicators.\n\nTrooper Malone approached the U-Haul on the passenger side. Norales was seated in the right passenger seat of the U-Haul, and Javier Ortiz-Nunez (\u201cOrtiz\u201d) was seated in the middle. Trooper Malone testified that as she spoke to the driver through the passenger window, Norales stared straight ahead and did not make eye contact with her. She deemed this behavior to be a \u201chuge criminal indicator\u201d because there was \u201cno reason for him to act that way towards\u201d her. She observed that Ortiz had bloodshot eyes, and she rated the odor of marijuana in the cab as a six on a scale of one to ten.\n\nBain presented a Maryland driver\u2019s license and rental agreements for the U-Haul and the Hyundai being towed. Trooper Malone asked her to exit the vehicle and directed her to sit in the backseat of the cruiser. Bain, a Spanish-speaker who knows some English, told Trooper Malone that she rented the Hyundai, and her cousin\u2014Norales\u2014rented the U-Haul. The rental agreements confirmed this. Trooper Malone\nasked Bain why the cab smelled of marijuana and she responded that her boyfriend\u2014Ortiz\u2014smokes marijuana.\n\n\u00b6 7 Trooper Malone spoke with Ortiz and he told her that he lives in Seattle and his girlfriend lives in Maryland. He said that they were moving his cousin\u2014Norales\u2014to Maryland. He explained that they had a company that had a new contract in Maryland. He claimed that the items in the back of the U-Haul belonged to Norales. Trooper Malone asked Ortiz if he had marijuana in the vehicle, and he responded affirmatively, commenting that it is legal in Seattle. She told him that his tongue appeared green and asked if he had been eating edible marijuana. He said that he was just tired.\n\n\u00b6 8 One by one, Trooper Malone placed all three of the U-Haul\u2019s occupants into the back of her cruiser where their conversations\u2014conducted in Spanish\u2014were being recorded. Their conversations would later be translated and transcribed.\n\n\u00b6 9 Trooper Malone asked for the keys to the cargo area of the U-Haul and for the Hyundai. Ortiz told her where to find them. Shortly thereafter, Trooper Alejo Romero arrived on the scene. Norales was moved into Trooper Romero\u2019s cruiser.\n\n\u00b6 10 Trooper Malone asked additional questions of Ortiz. Ortiz told her that his cousin was going to be staying in Maryland for a couple of months because he got a painting contract there. He indicated that they both had families back in Seattle and would be returning. He said that his girlfriend\u2014Bain\u2014came out to visit him and they drove back with her so she would not have to drive back alone. Again, he said that Norales owned the items in the U-Haul.\n\u00b6 11 Agent King, Trooper Romero, and Trooper Malone looked inside the cargo area of the U-Haul. There were five boxes in the front. They opened one and discovered that it was full of vacuum-sealed packages of marijuana. The three occupants of the U-Haul were arrested. Trooper Romero advised them of their *Miranda* rights in Spanish.\n\n\u00b6 12 When a more extensive search of the vehicles was conducted, law enforcement officials found what they described as a \u201ccover load\u201d in the U-Haul\u2014items placed in the vehicle to \u201cfool law enforcement\u201d into believing their story that they were in the process of moving from Washington to Maryland. There was a newly-purchased dresser and armoire with the tags still on them; several mattresses with no bed frames; newly-purchased pots and pans, still in the box; and a chair. There were also five boxes of vacuum-sealed packages of hydroponic marijuana, five containers of THC edibles; multiple cell phones; multiple iPads; a SIM card; two bags of leafy green plant material; luggage and duffel bags; a digital scale; and a package of rubber bands. The total weight of the marijuana was 297 pounds.\n\n\u00b6 13 Ortiz and Norales were both charged with possession of marijuana, a violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), a second-degree felony, and trafficking in marijuana, a violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2), also a second-degree felony. Their cases were eventually severed. The charges against Norales were tried to a jury on June 28 and 29, 2017, and he was found guilty of both counts. The trial court determined that the convictions merged for purposes of sentencing, and the state elected to proceed to\nsentencing as to the trafficking-in-marijuana conviction. The trial court sentenced Norales to a mandatory prison term of eight years.\n\nNorales appealed and assigns two errors for our review:\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n\nAPPELLANT WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS AND THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AS GUARANTEED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS, AS APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL MADE ERRORS SO DEFICIENT AS TO DEPRIVE APPELLANT OF A FAIR TRIAL.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n\nAPPELLANT WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS AND THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AS GUARANTEED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THE INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF HIS TRIAL COUNSEL AND NUMEROUS INCIDENTS OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT COMMITTED BY THE ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR.\n\nII. Law and Analysis\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nYou are not permitted to make any assumptions about any witness or party based upon the use of an interpreter/translator. Do not allow the fact\nthat the testimony was in a language other than English influence you in any way.\n\nThe evidence you are to consider is only that provided through the interpreters/translators. Although some of you may understand Spanish, you must disregard your own interpretation or translation because you are not permitted to disagree with the English translations that have been provided to you. All jurors must consider the same evidence.\n\nBecause you have received multiple interpretations or translations that disagree, it is your duty to decide which, if any, interpretation or translation is accurate.\n\nThe court did not, however, provide an instruction with respect to the consideration of expert testimony.\n\n\u00b6 51 Norales argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the jury instructions. He claims that the instruction with respect to interpreters coupled with the absence of an instruction on expert testimony caused jurors to feel constrained to accept as true Trooper Martin and Agent Chavez\u2019s testimony, especially given that they were recognized as experts in Spanish. He maintains that his guilt or innocence turned on his credibility and professed lack of knowledge about the marijuana in the U-Haul, and he insists that the state\u2019s \u201cexpert\u201d interpreters were permitted to editorialize when they testified about statements made by Norales during his interview and while in the back of Trooper Malone\u2019s squad car.\nThe trial court\u2019s instruction here is a recitation of Ohio Jury Instructions section 401.29. That instruction was appropriately given. But because Trooper Martin and Agent Chavez were qualified as Spanish-to-English translation experts, an instruction on expert-witness testimony was also warranted in this case. Interestingly, some jurisdictions\u2014including the Seventh Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, and Florida\u2014have adopted a pattern jury instruction for situations such as this. It provides:\n\nAmong the exhibits admitted during the trial were recordings that contained conversations in the _______ language. You were also provided with English transcripts of those conversations. The transcripts were provided to you [by the government] so that you could consider the content of the conversations on the recordings.\n\nWhether a transcript is an accurate translation, in whole or in part, is for you to decide. In considering whether a transcript accurately describes the meaning of a conversation, you should consider the testimony presented to you regarding how, and by whom, the transcript was made. You may consider the knowledge, training, and experience of the translator, as well as the nature of the conversation and the reasonableness of the translation in light of all the evidence in the case. You should not rely in any way on any knowledge you may have of the language spoken on the recording; your consideration of the transcripts should be based on the evidence introduced in the trial.\nUnited States v. Solis Jordan, 223 F.3d 676, 689 (7th Cir.2000), fn. 10, quoting Seventh Circuit Federal Criminal Jury Instructions, \u00a7 3.18. See also United States v. Gutierrez, 367 F.3d 733, 736 (8th Cir.2004) (\u201cWhen dealing with English transcripts of recorded conversations that were originally spoken in a foreign language, district courts are encouraged to use an instruction similar to the Seventh Circuit\u2019s Federal Criminal Jury Instruction \u00a7 3.18.\u201d); Florida Standard Jury Instruction (Criminal) 2.11.\n\n\u00b6 53 The jury instructions issued by the court would have been much clearer if they included an instruction similar to the Seventh Circuit\u2019s pattern jury instruction. Nevertheless, we find that Norales has failed to establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel because he has not demonstrated that he suffered prejudice from counsel\u2019s failure to object to the instructions.2\n\n\u00b6 54 When considering a challenge to the accuracy or completeness of the court\u2019s charge to the jury, the jury instructions must be read as a whole. State v. Price, 60 Ohio St.2d 136, 141, 398 N.E.2d 772 (1979). While the instructions here do not include a specific provision explicitly allowing jurors to reject Trooper Martin and Agent Chavez\u2019s translations, they do include a provision indicating that multiple translations were provided and that it was the jury\u2019s duty to decide \u201cwhich, if any, interpretation or translation is accurate.\u201d\n\n2 We also note that the record contains no transcript of the charge conference, therefore, it is not clear whether trial counsel registered any objections to the jury instructions.\nNorales did not challenge the accuracy of Trooper Martin\u2019s translations. He did, however, challenge a couple of Agent Chavez\u2019s translations. Norales testified on direct about purported errors in Agent Chavez\u2019s translations and was also cross-examined about them. Given that the trial court instructed the jury to decide which, if any interpretation or translation was accurate, the instructions\u2014when read as a whole\u2014gave the jury the option to reject Agent Chavez\u2019s interpretations or to choose Norales\u2019s interpretations over Agent Chavez\u2019s.\n\nAccordingly, we find that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury.\n\nF. Failure to object to hearsay statements.\n\nNorales argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to hearsay statements offered through the testimony of Trooper Malone. Trooper Malone testified that Bain said that Norales\u2014not Ortiz\u2014was moving to Maryland, and that Ortiz stated that the items in the U-Haul belonged to Norales. He claims that in the absence of an objection from trial counsel, the admission of these hearsay statements undermined his credibility. However, a recording of the traffic stop was admitted into evidence as an exhibit, and in that video, Bain and Ortiz themselves make these statements. An objection from trial counsel would not have prevented the damage that allegedly resulted to Norales\u2019s credibility.\n\nWe find no ineffective assistance of counsel arising from trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of hearsay statements.\nG. Failure to appreciate that a mandatory eight-year prison term was at stake.\n\n\u00b6 59 Norales argues that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to appreciate that if convicted, Norales faced a mandatory eight-year term of incarceration. While it is true that at sentencing, trial counsel indicated that he believed that there was merely a \u201cpresumption\u201d of eight years\u2019 incarceration, it was mentioned at the hearing of April 17, 2017, that the charges carried a mandatory eight-year prison term. The statement was made in reference to Ortiz\u2019s decision to reject a plea agreement, however, Norales\u2019s trial counsel was present and participated at that hearing. And more importantly, Norales fails to articulate how this alleged misunderstanding affected the outcome of the trial.\n\n\u00b6 60 We find no ineffective assistance of counsel arising from trial counsel\u2019s purported failure to appreciate the gravity of the potential sentence that Norales was facing.\n\nH. Cumulative Error\n\n\u00b6 61 Finally, Norales argues that the cumulative effect of his trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness and the assistant prosecutor\u2019s misconduct deprived him of his right to a fair trial. \u201cThe cumulative-error doctrine provides that \u2018a conviction will be reversed when the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the numerous instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute cause for reversal.\u2019\u201d State v. Belton, 149 Ohio St.3d 165, 2016-Ohio-1581, 74 N.E.3d\nHere, we have not found counsel to have been ineffective. And while we have found that several of the assistant prosecutor\u2019s questions and comments were improper, reviewing the proceedings as a whole, we cannot say that Norales was deprived of a fair trial.\n\nIn sum, we cannot say that counsel was ineffective for (1) failing to file a motion to suppress Norales\u2019s statements, (2) failing to object to multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct, the admission of hearsay statements, the admission of irrelevant, \u201chighly prejudicial\u201d evidence, or the jury instructions; or (3) failing to appreciate that a mandatory eight-year prison term was at stake. And while we acknowledge that the assistant prosecutor asked several improper questions and made improper denigrating comments about defense counsel during closing argument, Norales has not shown that the conduct was sufficiently pervasive or prejudicial to have deprived Norales of a fair trial.\n\nAccordingly, we find Norales\u2019s two assignments of error not well-taken.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\nTrial counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress Norales\u2019s statements to Trooper Morales. Norales testified that discrepancies in the testimony were on account of the trooper\u2019s failure to recall or failure to effectively explain what Norales told him\u2014not due to a language barrier. Accordingly, Norales\nfailed to show that there was a valid ground to suppress his statements, that there was a probability of success had a motion been filed, or that the outcome of the trial would have been different.\n\n\u00b6 66 Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s leading or otherwise improper questions. Moreover, the assistant prosecutor\u2019s improper questions were not so pervasive as to constitute reversible prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n\u00b6 67 While evidence that pornography was found on Norales\u2019s phone was irrelevant, and while the assistant prosecutor improperly mocked Norales as a \u201cgood Christian,\u201d counsel was not ineffective for failing to object. These instances did not rise to the level of reversible prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n\u00b6 68 When read in its entirety, the assistant prosecutor\u2019s denigrating statements about defense counsel were not so pervasive as to cause prejudice to Norales. Trial counsel also was not ineffective for failing to object to the improper comments."}
{"Index": "087-Norales-Martinez", "allegation": "APPELLANT WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS AND THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AS GUARANTEED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THE INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF HIS TRIAL COUNSEL AND NUMEROUS INCIDENTS OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT COMMITTED BY THE ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR.", "evidence": "ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n\nAPPELLANT WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS AND THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AS GUARANTEED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THE INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF HIS TRIAL COUNSEL AND NUMEROUS INCIDENTS OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT COMMITTED BY THE ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR.\n\nII. Law and Analysis\n\nIn his first assignment of error, Norales contends that he was denied due process and effective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel\u2019s errors in failing to (1) file a motion to suppress statements that he made at the Highway Patrol Post;\n(2) object to multiple instances of prosecutorial misconduct; (3) object to irrelevant, \u201chighly prejudicial\u201d evidence; (4) object to the admission of hearsay statements; (5) object to the court\u2019s jury instructions; and (6) appreciate that a mandatory eight-year prison term was at stake. He argues that even if one of these errors by itself did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, the combination of the errors did.\n\n\u00b6 16 In his second assignment of error, Norales contends that he was denied due process and a fair trial based on the combined effect of the ineffective assistance of trial counsel and numerous incidents of misconduct by the assistant prosecutor. Resolution of the issues raised in Norales\u2019s second assignment of error are subsumed by those raised in his first assignment of error, therefore, we consider both assignments together.\n\nA. Failure to file a motion to suppress.\n\n\u00b6 17 After his arrest on December 9, 2016, Norales was taken to the Highway Patrol Post where he was questioned by Officer Steven Cousino, of the Sylvania Township Police Department, and Trooper Anthony Martin, of the Ohio State Highway Patrol, both of whom are assigned to the DEA task force in Toledo. Norales indicated that he speaks Spanish and does not speak English very well. Trooper Martin, therefore, advised Norales of his Miranda rights in Spanish. Officer Cousino asked questions of Norales in English, which Trooper Martin translated into Spanish. He translated Norales\u2019s responses in English for Officer Cousino. At trial, Trooper Martin was permitted to relay to the jury statements that Norales made during this questioning. Norales argues that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to file a motion to\nsuppress these statements. He claims that trial counsel should have challenged Trooper Martin\u2019s level of fluency in Spanish, and, therefore, the accuracy of the statements from Norales that he interpreted and testified about.\n\n\u00b6 18 Before Trooper Martin testified at trial, he was questioned about his Spanish-language skills. He explained that he took two years of Spanish in high school. When he was 19, he embarked on a mission trip to Ecuador where he was immersed in the language for two years. Before leaving for that trip, he received training in Spanish at his church\u2019s missionary training center for approximately two months. As part of his job as a trooper, he is called upon to conduct interviews in Spanish. When asked by the assistant prosecutor to rate his fluency in Spanish on a scale of one to ten, Trooper Martin rated himself a seven.\n\n\u00b6 19 The state asked the court to qualify Trooper Martin as an expert Spanish interpreter or translator. With no objection from Norales, the court qualified him. Norales contends that trial counsel should have moved to suppress the statements he made to Trooper Martin because, by his own admission, Trooper Martin\u2019s translations are \u201cwrong 30% of the time.\u201d He queries \u201cwhich 30% of the Miranda rights Martin translated to [him] incorrectly[;] * * * what 30% of [his] responses to the warnings were misunderstood/misinterpreted by Martin[; and] * * * which 30% of Martin\u2019s account of what [he] told him was incorrect.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 20 In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an appellant must show that counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the\nadversarial process that the trial court cannot be relied on as having produced a just result. *State v. Shuttlesworth*, 104 Ohio App.3d 281, 287, 661 N.E.2d 817 (7th Dist.1995). To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, an appellant must show \u201c(1) deficient performance of counsel, i.e., performance falling below an objective standard of reasonable representation, and (2) prejudice, i.e., a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the proceeding\u2019s result would have been different.\u201d *State v. Hale*, 119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 204, citing *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d *State v. Sanders*, 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151, 761 N.E.2d 18 (2002).\n\n\u00b6 21 Counsel is not ineffective per se for failing to file a motion to suppress. *State v. Reynolds*, 2017-Ohio-1478, 89 N.E.3d 235, \u00b6 61 (6th Dist.). The defendant must show that (1) there was a valid ground to suppress the disputed evidence, (2) there was a reasonable probability of success on the motion; and (3) there was a reasonable probability that suppression of the evidence would have changed the outcome of the trial. *State v. Clark*, 6th Dist. Williams No. WM-09-009, 2010-Ohio-2383, \u00b6 21; *State v. Thompson*, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-11-1184, 2013-Ohio-1597, \u00b6 8. A claim of ineffective assistance will be rejected when counsel\u2019s failure to file a suppression motion \u201cwas a tactical decision, there was no reasonable probability of success, or there was no prejudice,\u201d or where counsel could have reasonably decided that filing a motion to suppress would be futile, even if there is evidence in the record to support such a motion.\nNorales relies on *State v. Ramirez*, 135 Ohio App.3d 89, 94, 732 N.E.2d 1065 (11th Dist.1999), in support of his position that trial counsel should have challenged Trooper Martin\u2019s qualifications and sought to suppress the statements he elicited. In *Ramirez*, the defendant moved to suppress statements he made to police because his *Miranda* rights were poorly translated by the interpreter provided by the police. For example, it was determined that (1) instead of using the Spanish term for \u201clegal rights,\u201d the translator repeatedly used a term that means \u201cright hand side;\u201d (2) instead of using the phrase \u201cunder the law,\u201d she used the word \u201cunderneath,\u201d thus her translation referenced \u201csomething to do with a right hand side that was physically underneath the law;\u201d (3) she told the defendant that he was entitled to \u201cnotifications\u201d of counsel and not that he had the right to have an attorney present during questioning; (4) she failed to tell defendant that if he elected to speak, his statements could be used against him in a court of law and that he had the right to an attorney free of charge if he could not afford one; and (5) in attempting to determine if the defendant was willing to waive counsel, it sounded more like she was asking him if he had an attorney. *Id.* The court held that the significant problems with the translation rendered the reading of his *Miranda* rights insufficient to adequately apprise appellant of his rights, therefore, the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. *Id.* at 96-97.\nHere, there is no indication in the record that Norales did not understand his *Miranda* rights. Norales testified at trial. He never suggested that a language barrier rendered him and Trooper Martin incapable of understanding each other. Rather, to the extent that Norales disputed a few of the statements Trooper Martin attributed to him (including that Norales had never been to Maryland before and that he helped Ortiz load heavy items into the U-Haul1), Norales testified that Trooper Martin \u201cmaybe * * * didn\u2019t remember\u201d or \u201cdidn\u2019t explain correctly\u201d or that \u201c[a] better explanation would have been better.\u201d\n\nIn addition to this, Trooper Martin interviewed Norales twice\u2014once on December 9, 2016, without counsel present, and once on January 5, 2017, with counsel present. On cross-examination at trial, defense counsel asked Trooper Martin to admit that Norales\u2019s story had stayed the same between his first and second interviews, except that Norales offered additional details at his second interview. Trooper Martin conceded that this was true. The fact that defense counsel sought to establish from Trooper Martin that Norales\u2019s version of events remained consistent between the first and second interviews suggests to us that any discrepancies between what Trooper Martin and Norales recalled at trial were not on account of a language barrier.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6 66 Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s leading or otherwise improper questions. Moreover, the assistant prosecutor\u2019s improper questions were not so pervasive as to constitute reversible prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n\u00b6 67 While evidence that pornography was found on Norales\u2019s phone was irrelevant, and while the assistant prosecutor improperly mocked Norales as a \u201cgood Christian,\u201d counsel was not ineffective for failing to object. These instances did not rise to the level of reversible prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n\u00b6 68 When read in its entirety, the assistant prosecutor\u2019s denigrating statements about defense counsel were not so pervasive as to cause prejudice to Norales. Trial counsel also was not ineffective for failing to object to the improper comments.\n\n\u00b6 69 Trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to hearsay statements admitted through Trooper Malone, especially given that the statements to which she testified were recorded and the recording was admitted as an exhibit at trial.\n\n\u00b6 70 When read as a whole, the jury instructions permitted the jury to reject the state\u2019s witnesses\u2019 translations. Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the instructions.\nNorales failed to articulate how the outcome of the trial was affected by trial counsel\u2019s belief that an eight-year prison term was merely presumed\u2014and was not mandatory.\n\nWe find Norales\u2019s two assignments of error not well-taken and affirm the July 10, 2017 judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas. Norales is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal under App.R. 24.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to App.R. 27.

Parties interested in viewing the final reported version are advised to visit the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s web site at: http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/ROD/docs/.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\n\u00b6 37 In his closing argument, the assistant prosecutor persisted with this theme:\n\nNow, this good Christian man would have you believe that he was the unluckiest man in the world * * *.\n\nI\u2019m going to encourage you to ask the Court for a computer, to plug this in, to open it up and peruse it, and to look at what was in the contents of this good Christian\u2019s cell phone, a cell phone that he claimed to have had for two or three years but occasionally loaned to Mr. Ortiz. Nearly 17,000 pornographic videos and pictures, not of his wife.\n\nAgain, trial counsel failed to object.\n\n\u00b6 38 That pornographic images were found on Norales\u2019s phone was not relevant to any issue in this case. We agree with Norales that there was no legitimate reason for raising this issue at trial\u2014either on cross-examination or in closing\u2014and that the assistant prosecutor acted improperly by doing so. State v. Dillon, 2016-Ohio-1561, 63 N.E.3d 712, \u00b6 36 (2d Dist.) (finding that admission of white-supremacist screen names and pornographic nature of web sites accessed by appellant were not relevant to any material issue in the case and were unfairly prejudicial); State v. Mills, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 8925, 1985 Ohio App. LEXIS 6883, *10 (July 17, 1985) (finding that possession of pornographic materials was irrelevant to issue of knowing possession of illicit drugs).\nWe also agree with Norales that the assistant prosecutor acted improperly when he asked Norales if he was Christian and then mocked him during closing argument, sarcastically referring to him as \u201cthis good Christian.\u201d See State v. Rahman, 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 153, 492 N.E.2d 401 (1986) (\u201c[A]ppeals to racial or religious prejudices are improper conduct on the part of a prosecutor and may exert such a substantial influence on the result at trial that reversal is required.\u201d); State v. Gilbert, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2010-09-240, 2011-Ohio-4340, \u00b6 58.\n\nBut while the assistant prosecutor acted improperly in asking about the pornographic images and referencing them during closing\u2014and in mocking Norales\u2019s Christianity\u2014we cannot say that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object. First, an objection from trial counsel may have served only to highlight the improper evidence. State v. Lawless, 9th Dist. Wayne No. 16AP0025, 2018-Ohio-444, \u00b6 20 (\u201c[T]rial counsel may have made the strategic decision not to object because doing so would \u2018only serve to highlight negative testimony.\u2019\u201d). Additionally, Norales has not shown that the outcome of the trial would have been different had an objection been registered.\n\nAnd while we recognize that the assistant prosecutor acted improperly, we cannot say that his conduct amounted to misconduct requiring reversal because, again, Norales has not shown that the outcome of the trial would have been different absent the improper conduct. See Boles, 190 Ohio App.3d 431, 2010-Ohio-5503, 942 N.E.2d 417, at \u00b6 50, citing Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d at 15, 470 N.E.2d 883 (\u201c[A] reversal for prosecutorial\nmisconduct will not occur unless it is clear that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for the misconduct.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 42 We find no ineffective assistance of counsel arising from trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s mocking references to Norales\u2019s Christianity and to references to the pornographic images found on his phone. We also find no reversible prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nD. Denigrating defense counsel.\n\n\u00b6 43 Following defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, the assistant prosecutor in his rebuttal argument began by stating \u201c[w]ell, that was entertaining.\u201d Multiple times, he called defense counsel\u2019s summary of the evidence misleading, and he referred to defense counsel\u2019s argument as \u201ca simple defense trick that they like to do to jurors to try and mislead you.\u201d Norales argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to these improper statements.\n\n\u00b6 44 \u201cGenerally, prosecutors are entitled to considerable latitude in opening and closing arguments.\u201d Boles, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-07-1255, 2009-Ohio-512, at \u00b6 47, citing State v. Ballew, 76 Ohio St.3d 244, 667 N.E.2d 369 (1996). During closing, a prosecutor may comment on what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn from the evidence. Id. He or she may not, however, denigrate or impute insincerity to defense counsel in the jury\u2019s presence. State v. Davis, 116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 301, citing State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 167. Having said this, isolated incidents of\nprosecutorial misconduct are considered harmless, and the closing argument must be viewed in its entirety to determine whether the defendant was prejudiced. *Id.*, citing *State v. Stevens*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19572, 2003-Ohio-6249.\n\n{\u00b6 45} Having reviewed the closing arguments in their entirety, we find that the assistant prosecutor\u2019s comments were not so pervasive as to cause prejudice to Norales. We also find that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s improper comments.\n\nE. Failure to object to jury instructions regarding expert testimony.\n\n{\u00b6 46} As previously discussed, Trooper Martin provided Spanish-to-English and English-to-Spanish translations during interviews of Norales. He was permitted to testify at trial concerning statements that Norales made during those interviews.\n\n{\u00b6 47} Additionally, Trooper Malone\u2019s cruiser was wired to record both video and audio of the back seat of the vehicle, and to record video of what was happening in front of the cruiser. U.S. Border Patrol Agent, Alexander Chavez, watched and listened to the recordings of the conversations between Bain, Ortiz, and Norales while they were seated in the back of Trooper Malone\u2019s squad car. Agent Chavez, like Norales, grew up in Honduras. Some of the audio was inaudible or unintelligible, but Agent Chavez transcribed what he was able to hear. He also watched the video recording of what was happening in front of the cruiser. This allowed him to determine when the suspects\u2019 conversations or statements were made in relation to what they were seeing outside the\ncruiser. He testified at trial concerning his translation and observations, and the transcript he created was admitted into evidence.\n\n\u00b6 48 The state asked the court to qualify Trooper Martin and Agent Chavez as experts in the translation of Spanish-to-English and English-to-Spanish. The trial court qualified both of them as experts. As to Agent Chavez, it did so over the objection of the defense; trial counsel did not raise an objection as to Trooper Martin testifying as an expert.\n\n\u00b6 49 In addition to these two witnesses, two interpreters were appointed to translate the proceedings due to Norales\u2019s lack of proficiency in English. Those two interpreters took an oath to follow the guidelines for legal interpreting. Trooper Martin and Agent Chavez were also asked to take interpreters\u2019 oaths after being qualified as expert witnesses.\n\n\u00b6 50 At the close of evidence, the trial court included an instruction to the jury with respect to the participation of the interpreters:\n\nDuring this trial the interpreters or translators have provided interpretations or translations. The interpreter/translators must provide a complete and accurate interpretation or translation without altering, omitting, or adding anything to what has been spoken or written and without explaining the statements of the original speaker or writer.\n\nYou are not permitted to make any assumptions about any witness or party based upon the use of an interpreter/translator. Do not allow the fact\nthat the testimony was in a language other than English influence you in any way.\n\nThe evidence you are to consider is only that provided through the interpreters/translators. Although some of you may understand Spanish, you must disregard your own interpretation or translation because you are not permitted to disagree with the English translations that have been provided to you. All jurors must consider the same evidence.\n\nBecause you have received multiple interpretations or translations that disagree, it is your duty to decide which, if any, interpretation or translation is accurate.\n\nThe court did not, however, provide an instruction with respect to the consideration of expert testimony.\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nIN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF OHIO\nSIXTH APPELLATE DISTRICT\nWOOD COUNTY\n\nState of Ohio     Court of Appeals No. WD-17-041\nAppellee\n\nv.\n\nSelin A.

Background\n\n\u00b6 2 On the morning of December 9, 2016, Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper, Ann Malone, and U.S. Border Patrol Agent, Nick King, were patrolling a stretch of the Ohio Turnpike in Wood County, Ohio, at the crossover at milepost 67.6. A U-Haul truck pulling a Hyundai vehicle on a trailer drove past Trooper Malone heading eastbound. Trooper Malone, a criminal interdiction officer, observed what she described as \u201ccriminal indicators\u201d manifested by the driver and the passengers of the U-Haul: the driver was sitting in a rigid position and did not look over at her, there were three occupants squeezed into the front seat, which looked to her to be \u201cvery uncomfortable,\u201d and the U-Haul was hauling a passenger vehicle with Maryland license plates, which seemed \u201ca little odd.\u201d She pulled behind the U-Haul to observe further behavior and to run a registration check. She learned that the Hyundai was a rental vehicle, which she described as \u201ca huge, huge red flag.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 3 With the trooper behind her, the driver of the U-Haul\u2014later identified as Belkis Bain-Garcia (\u201cBain\u201d)\u2014eventually committed minor marked lanes violations: she twice briefly drifted over the painted white lane divider without signaling, and she switched lanes but turned off her turn signal before fully completing the lane change. She also decreased her speed \u201cgreatly\u201d to 58 to 60 miles per hour in a 70-mile-per-hour zone and changed lanes \u201cfor no apparent reason.\u201d Trooper Malone initiated a stop of the vehicle.\nUpon approaching the vehicle, Trooper Malone noticed an odor of marijuana \u201cemitting from inside of the traffic [sic] portion of the U-Haul.\u201d She described that the U-Haul had a \u201clived-in\u201d look, with trash, cups, beverages, bottles of water, and snacks in the passenger compartment. There were numerous cell phones and chargers in the vehicle, and there was an air freshener hanging from a cell phone that was mounted to the window. According to Trooper Malone, the \u201clived-in\u201d look of the vehicle was significant because drug traffickers drive long distances and do not want to make stops. She said that the multiple cell phones and the air freshener are also criminal indicators.\n\nTrooper Malone approached the U-Haul on the passenger side. Norales was seated in the right passenger seat of the U-Haul, and Javier Ortiz-Nunez (\u201cOrtiz\u201d) was seated in the middle. Trooper Malone testified that as she spoke to the driver through the passenger window, Norales stared straight ahead and did not make eye contact with her. She deemed this behavior to be a \u201chuge criminal indicator\u201d because there was \u201cno reason for him to act that way towards\u201d her. She observed that Ortiz had bloodshot eyes, and she rated the odor of marijuana in the cab as a six on a scale of one to ten.\n\nBain presented a Maryland driver\u2019s license and rental agreements for the U-Haul and the Hyundai being towed. Trooper Malone asked her to exit the vehicle and directed her to sit in the backseat of the cruiser. Bain, a Spanish-speaker who knows some English, told Trooper Malone that she rented the Hyundai, and her cousin\u2014Norales\u2014rented the U-Haul. The rental agreements confirmed this. Trooper Malone\nasked Bain why the cab smelled of marijuana and she responded that her boyfriend\u2014Ortiz\u2014smokes marijuana.\n\n\u00b6 7 Trooper Malone spoke with Ortiz and he told her that he lives in Seattle and his girlfriend lives in Maryland. He said that they were moving his cousin\u2014Norales\u2014to Maryland. He explained that they had a company that had a new contract in Maryland. He claimed that the items in the back of the U-Haul belonged to Norales. Trooper Malone asked Ortiz if he had marijuana in the vehicle, and he responded affirmatively, commenting that it is legal in Seattle. She told him that his tongue appeared green and asked if he had been eating edible marijuana. He said that he was just tired.\n\n\u00b6 8 One by one, Trooper Malone placed all three of the U-Haul\u2019s occupants into the back of her cruiser where their conversations\u2014conducted in Spanish\u2014were being recorded. Their conversations would later be translated and transcribed.\n\n\u00b6 9 Trooper Malone asked for the keys to the cargo area of the U-Haul and for the Hyundai. Ortiz told her where to find them. Shortly thereafter, Trooper Alejo Romero arrived on the scene. Norales was moved into Trooper Romero\u2019s cruiser.\n\n\u00b6 10 Trooper Malone asked additional questions of Ortiz. Ortiz told her that his cousin was going to be staying in Maryland for a couple of months because he got a painting contract there. He indicated that they both had families back in Seattle and would be returning. He said that his girlfriend\u2014Bain\u2014came out to visit him and they drove back with her so she would not have to drive back alone. Again, he said that Norales owned the items in the U-Haul.\n\u00b6 11 Agent King, Trooper Romero, and Trooper Malone looked inside the cargo area of the U-Haul. There were five boxes in the front. They opened one and discovered that it was full of vacuum-sealed packages of marijuana. The three occupants of the U-Haul were arrested. Trooper Romero advised them of their *Miranda* rights in Spanish.\n\n\u00b6 12 When a more extensive search of the vehicles was conducted, law enforcement officials found what they described as a \u201ccover load\u201d in the U-Haul\u2014items placed in the vehicle to \u201cfool law enforcement\u201d into believing their story that they were in the process of moving from Washington to Maryland. There was a newly-purchased dresser and armoire with the tags still on them; several mattresses with no bed frames; newly-purchased pots and pans, still in the box; and a chair. There were also five boxes of vacuum-sealed packages of hydroponic marijuana, five containers of THC edibles; multiple cell phones; multiple iPads; a SIM card; two bags of leafy green plant material; luggage and duffel bags; a digital scale; and a package of rubber bands. The total weight of the marijuana was 297 pounds.\n\n\u00b6 13 Ortiz and Norales were both charged with possession of marijuana, a violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), a second-degree felony, and trafficking in marijuana, a violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2), also a second-degree felony. Their cases were eventually severed. The charges against Norales were tried to a jury on June 28 and 29, 2017, and he was found guilty of both counts. The trial court determined that the convictions merged for purposes of sentencing, and the state elected to proceed to\nsentencing as to the trafficking-in-marijuana conviction. The trial court sentenced Norales to a mandatory prison term of eight years.\n\nNorales appealed and assigns two errors for our review:\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I\n\nAPPELLANT WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS AND THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AS GUARANTEED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS, AS APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL MADE ERRORS SO DEFICIENT AS TO DEPRIVE APPELLANT OF A FAIR TRIAL.\n\nASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II\n\nAPPELLANT WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS AND THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AS GUARANTEED BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THE INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF HIS TRIAL COUNSEL AND NUMEROUS INCIDENTS OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT COMMITTED BY THE ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR.\n\nII. Law and Analysis\n\n----------NEW DOC----------\n\nIn addition to this, Trooper Martin interviewed Norales twice\u2014once on December 9, 2016, without counsel present, and once on January 5, 2017, with counsel present. On cross-examination at trial, defense counsel asked Trooper Martin to admit that Norales\u2019s story had stayed the same between his first and second interviews, except that Norales offered additional details at his second interview. Trooper Martin conceded that this was true. The fact that defense counsel sought to establish from Trooper Martin that Norales\u2019s version of events remained consistent between the first and second interviews suggests to us that any discrepancies between what Trooper Martin and Norales recalled at trial were not on account of a language barrier.\n\nFinally, defense counsel cross-examined Trooper Martin and questioned his Spanish fluency. Defense counsel highlighted the fact that (1) by his own admission,\n\n---\n\n1 These statements were significant because law enforcement found a picture of Norales\u2019s Maryland driver\u2019s license on his phone, and Norales denied loading the boxes of marijuana into the U-Haul.\nTrooper Martin\u2019s Spanish is not perfect, and (2) certain details can sometimes get lost in translation. With this information, it was the role of the jury to weigh the evidence and to determine whether to accept Trooper Martin\u2019s translation of Norales\u2019s statements.\n\nAccordingly, we find that Norales has not shown that there was a valid ground to suppress his statements, that there was a probability of success had a motion been filed, or that the outcome of the trial would have been different. We find no ineffective assistance of counsel arising from trial counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to suppress.\n\nB. Failure to object to instances of prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nNorales next argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to instances of prosecutorial misconduct. He points to numerous examples in the trial transcript where the assistant prosecutor asked leading and otherwise improper questions and trial counsel failed to object.\n\nIn one of the instances identified by Norales, the assistant prosecutor asked Trooper Malone if she is \u201ca forensic analyst with respect to fingerprints\u201d or DNA. She responded that she is not. Ignoring her response, he went on to ask her whether she was \u201caware of how difficult it is to get a useable fingerprint off of a textured surface;\u201d whether she was \u201caware that even if you can get a useable print off a textured surface, you cannot say when that fingerprint was placed on that surface;\u201d and whether she was \u201caware that even if you do get a useable strand of DNA, you cannot say when or how that DNA got on the object.\u201d The effect of these questions was that the assistant prosecutor\nhimself testified to information that the witness was unable\u2014and unqualified\u2014to provide.\n\n\u00b6 29 Similarly, the assistant prosecutor asked Trooper Martin whether he was aware that \u201cthe rental agreement [for the Hyundai] said that there was no mileage charges[.]\u201d This information was significant because Norales told Trooper Martin that they had been towing the Hyundai to save on mileage charges. Trooper Martin responded: \u201cI was not, not until right now I\u2019m not aware of that.\u201d In asking this question of Trooper Martin, the assistant prosecutor bypassed the proper procedure for the admission of this evidence.\n\n\u00b6 30 And during Norales\u2019s testimony, the assistant prosecutor questioned him about a statement he made to Bain in the back of the patrol car, indicating that they were going to \u201cthe federal.\u201d Norales explained that in Honduras, his native country, they call jail \u201cthe federal.\u201d But the assistant prosecutor asked him: \u201cIsn\u2019t it true that you used the word federal because $1.3 million worth of marijuana typically gets prosecuted by the feds?\u201d Although on cross-examination, leading questions are proper, Norales argues that the question was designed to magnify the importance of the case to the jury and to show Norales\u2019s \u201cguilty knowledge.\u201d\n\n\u00b6 31 Finally, the assistant prosecutor repeatedly asked Norales why he was searching for work across the country instead of in Washington. Norales responded that work was slow in Washington and that jobs decrease during the rainy season. The assistant prosecutor replied, \u201cIt\u2019s always rainy season in Washington. I\u2019ve been there.\u201d\nTo establish prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must show that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was improper and prejudicially affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. *State v. Walker*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-060910, 2007-Ohio-6337, \u00b6 45. \u201c[A] reversal for prosecutorial misconduct will not occur unless it is clear that the outcome of the trial would have been different but for the misconduct.\u201d *State v. Boles*, 190 Ohio App.3d 431, 2010-Ohio-5503, 942 N.E.2d 417, \u00b6 50 (6th Dist.), citing *State v. Smith*, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 15, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984). \u201cImportant considerations are whether the misconduct was an isolated incident or a protracted series of improper arguments, whether the defendant objected, whether curative instructions were given, and whether the evidence of guilt was overwhelming.\u201d *State v. Oviedo*, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-95-287, 1997 Ohio App. LEXIS 3607, *4 (Aug. 15, 1997), citing *State v. Keenan*, 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 410, 613 N.E.2d 203 (1993).\n\n\u201cA leading question is one that suggests to the witness the answer desired by the examiner.\u201d (Citations and quotations omitted.) *State v. Thompson*, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, 23 N.E.3d 1096, \u00b6 166. Generally, this type of question should not be used on direct examination except to develop the witness\u2019s testimony. Evid.R. 611(C). \u201c[A] prosecutor commits prosecutorial misconduct when leading questions pervade the entire trial in the face of a sustained objection.\u201d *State v. Lee*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-160294, 2017-Ohio-7377, \u00b6 20; see also *State v. McKelton*, 148 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-Ohio-5735, 70 N.E.3d 508, \u00b6 265, citing *State v. Diar*, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, \u00b6 170 (\u201c[P]rosecutorial misconduct can\noccur when a prosecutor continues to ask leading questions even after the trial court has sustained objections on that basis.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 34 Certainly there were several times that the assistant prosecutor asked leading or otherwise improper questions, and trial counsel failed to object. But upon our review of the record in its entirety, we would not characterize these improper questions as \u201cpervasive.\u201d We also cannot say that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to them because, as this court has recognized, a failure to object is generally viewed as trial strategy and alone will not establish an ineffective assistance claim. State v. Rossbach, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-09-1300, 2011-Ohio-281, \u00b6 135. See also State v. Franklin, 97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, \u00b6 42 (\u201cA reasonable attorney may decide not to interrupt his adversary\u2019s argument as a matter of strategy.\u201d).\n\n\u00b6 35 We find no ineffective assistance of counsel arising from trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the assistant prosecutor\u2019s leading or otherwise improper questions. We also find that the questions were not so pervasive as to constitute reversible prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nC. Failure to object to irrelevant, prejudicial evidence.\n\n\u00b6 36 Norales also argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to evidence that he claims was both irrelevant and highly prejudicial. Specifically, the assistant prosecutor asked Norales whether he knew how hundreds of pornographic pictures of women got on his phone. When Norales said that he did not know, the\nassistant prosecutor continued by inquiring: \u201cWere you aware it\u2019s nearly 17,000 pictures? Christian?\u201d Trial counsel failed to object.\n\n\u00b6 37 In his closing argument, the assistant prosecutor persisted with this theme:\n\nNow, this good Christian man would have you believe that he was the unluckiest man in the world * * *.\n\nI\u2019m going to encourage you to ask the Court for a computer, to plug this in, to open it up and peruse it, and to look at what was in the contents of this good Christian\u2019s cell phone, a cell phone that he claimed to have had for two or three years but occasionally loaned to Mr. Ortiz. Nearly 17,000 pornographic videos and pictures, not of his wife.\n\nAgain, trial counsel failed to object."}
