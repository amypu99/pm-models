{"allegation_num": "13", "allegation": "The court should have granted a mistrial because of repeated statements by the mother, and assertions by the state that Renode murdered the child.", "extracted_text": "Sanders next makes a broader argument that the court should have granted a mistrial because of repeated statements by the mother, and assertions by the state that Renode murdered the child.\n\nOur discussion of Sanders’s argument relating to the sufficiency of the evidence informs the present argument — because the state had to prove that the victim had been a ‘witness’ to a criminal act (that is, the child had knowledge concerning a fact or facts concerning a criminal act), it necessarily had to provide context for Sanders’s belief that the victim had been a witness to a criminal act. *See State v. Skatzes*, 104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, ¶ 216. The mother thus gave relevant testimony about the circumstances of her child’s death.\nIt is true that the state told the jury in its opening statement that the child ‘was murdered in his bedroom, his throat was slashed, by Jacque Renode, by Navi Sanders’[s] boyfriend,’ but this was irrelevant. This statement was not evidence — nothing said in an opening statement is considered evidence. *State v. Tenace*, 109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-Ohio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, ¶ 48. What mattered was that the state prove that Sanders was complicit in intimidating a witness who had knowledge concerning a fact or facts about a criminal act. The jury could have drawn different conclusions on whether the child died as result of murder or some other criminal homicide. We thus conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by denying Sanders’s motion for a mistrial."}
