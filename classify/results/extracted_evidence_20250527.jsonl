Skatzes*, 104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, ¶ 216.

Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\n\n¶24 R.C. 2945.59 provides:\n\nIn any criminal case in which the defendant’s motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\nRule 404(B) of the Ohio Rules of Evidence and R.C. 2945.59 preclude admission of other acts evidence to prove a character trait in order to demonstrate conduct in conformity with that trait. *State v. Williams*, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, ¶16. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts of an accused tending to show the plan with which an act is done may be admissible for other purposes, such as those listed in Evid.R. 404(B); to show “proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.”\n\nIn considering other acts evidence, trial courts should conduct a three-step analysis. The first step is to consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Evid.R. 401. Next, the trial court must consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show conformity therewith, or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B), proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident. Finally, a trial court is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Evid.R. 403, *Williams*, at ¶¶19-20.\n\n“Because R.C. 2945.59 and Evid.R. 404(B) codify an exception to the common law with respect to evidence of other acts of wrongdoing, they must be construed against admissibility, and the standard for determining admissibility of such evidence is strict.” *State v. Broom*, 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 281-82, 533 N.E.2d 682 (1988).\nAs cautioned by the Ohio Supreme Court in *State v. Lowe*, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 634 N.E.2d 616 (1994), “…we therefore must be careful…to recognize the distinction between evidence which shows that a defendant is the type of person who might commit a particular crime and evidence which shows that a defendant is the person who committed a particular crime.” *Id.* at 530. Evidence to prove the character of person the defendant is to show he acted in conformity therewith is barred by Evid.R. 404(B).\n\n¶28 We must first determine whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact of consequence to determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. In *Williams*, the Ohio Supreme Court found testimony of prior acts describing grooming techniques were relevant to show the defendant’s intent was sexual gratification. *Williams*, supra, ¶22. Gross Sexual Imposition, with which the defendant was charged, requires “sexual contact.” R.C. 2907.05(A)(1). R.C. 2907.01 defines “sexual contact” to require the touching be for the purpose of “sexual arousing or gratifying either person.” In the instant case, Appellant was charged with both Rape and Gross Sexual Imposition, making intent of sexual gratification an element which the State must prove.\n\n¶29 The second step is to consider whether the evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show conformity therewith, or whether the acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose.\n\n¶30 In the case *sub judice*, Appellee was permitted to introduce the testimony of another child Appellant raped in similar fashion to that of ZS and AW, raping young female children living in the same home as Appellant when other adults were not around. In its Judgment Entry dated December 19, 2019, the trial court stated, “the sought-after\ntestimony is relevant because it may tend to prove what the prosecution alleges was the defendant’s motive and intent: to derive sexual gratification from groping and raping children.” We find the legitimate purpose of proving Appellant’s intent to derive sexual gratification from groping and raping children relevant for the charge of Gross Sexual Imposition.\n\n¶31 The final step is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. In the case sub judice, the trial court gave a limiting instruction before the testimony, after the testimony, and at the close of trial, that the evidence may not be considered as character evidence and that Appellant acted in accordance with any such character trait. In Williams, the Ohio Supreme Court allowed the testimony because:\n\nThe evidence is not unduly prejudicial, because the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence could not be considered to show that Williams had acted in conformity with a character trait. This instruction lessened the prejudicial effect of A.B.’s testimony, and A.B. corroborated J.H.’s testimony about the sexual abuse, which had been denied by Williams. Thus Evid.R. 404(B) permitted admission of evidence of William’s prior crime because it helped to prove motive, preparation, and plan on the part of Williams. The prejudicial effect did not substantially outweigh the probative value of that evidence.134 Ohio St.3d 521, ¶24.\n\n¶32 In the case sub judice, the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence could not be considered to show that Appellant had acted in conformity with a character trait. The testimony tended to show Appellant’s motive to show sexual gratification for\ngroping and raping children. The prejudicial effect did not outweigh the probative value of that evidence.\n\n¶33 Moreover, assuming, arguendo, the trial court erred in admitting testimony from LC and EB, we find any error was harmless. Crim.R. 52(A) defines harmless error as “[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.” Before constitutional error can be considered harmless, we must be able to “declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Where no reasonable possibility exists that the unlawful testimony contributed to a conviction, the error is harmless and therefore will not be grounds for reversal. State v. Lytle, 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 358 N.E.2d 623 (1976), paragraph three of the syllabus, vacated on other grounds in Lytle v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 910, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1978).\n\n¶34 In the case at bar, there was overwhelming evidence, as set forth above, of Appellant’s guilt. The two victims testified in detail how Appellant raped them when they were little girls, both recounted multiple specific instances and identified Appellant as their abuser. Accordingly, we find any error in admitting the testimony did not have an impact on the verdict, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the other evidence in the case established Appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n¶35 Appellant argues the prosecutor is arguing Appellant is acting in conformity with a character trait when the prosecutor remarked Appellant is attracted to young girls and is motivated to have sexual relations with them.\nAs Appellant did not object to the remarks during closing arguments, he has waived all but plain error. An error not raised in the trial court must be plain error for an appellate court to reverse. *State v. Long*, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978) at paragraph one of the syllabus; Crim.R. 52(B). To prevail under a plain error analysis, Appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different but for the error. *Id.* at paragraph two of the syllabus. Notice of plain error “is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” *Id.* at paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n“A presumption always exists that the jury has followed the instructions given to it by the trial court.” *Pang v. Minch*, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 187, 559 N.E.2d 1313 (1990), at paragraph four of the syllabus, *rehearing denied*, 54 Ohio St.3d 716, 562 N.E.2d 163.\n\nAs noted above, the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence could not be considered to show that Appellant had acted in conformity with a character trait. Appellant has not demonstrated that “but for” this isolated statement by the prosecutor, he would not have been convicted of the crimes.\n\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of prior acts of child molestation.\n¶40 Appellant’s sole Assignment of Error is overruled.\n\n¶41 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Delaware County, Ohio, is hereby affirmed.\n\nBy: Wise, John, J.\n\nBaldwin, P. J., concurs.\n\nWise, Earle, J., concurs separately\n\nJWW/br 0322\nWise, Earle, J., concurs separately.\n\n¶ 42 I concur in the judgment of the majority.\n\n¶ 43 While I find error, I find it to be harmless and specifically concur with paragraphs 33 and 34 of the majority opinion.\n\n¶ 44 I write separately because I find the other-acts evidence should not have been admitted.\n\n¶ 45 The trial court’s December 19, 2019, judgment entry allowed the other-acts evidence because it found the evidence fit several of the exceptions in Evid.R. 404(B) and R.C. 2945.59.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n¶ 46 The Supreme Court of Ohio recently reviewed the admission of other-acts evidence in two cases decided on September 22, 2020; State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.2d 651, and State v. Smith, --- Ohio St.3d ---, 2020-Ohio-4441, --- N.E.2d ---. In Hartman at ¶ 19, the court sought to “clear up some of the confusion that exists regarding the use of other-acts evidence.” One issue it made clear was that “the admissibility of other-acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) is a question of law.” Id. at ¶ 22. The question of “whether the evidence is offered for an impermissible purpose does not involve the exercise of discretion” and is subject to review de novo. Id. If a permissible nonpropensity purpose is found, the trial court then has discretion to admit other-acts evidence. Id.\nPURPOSES FOR WHICH OTHER-ACTS EVIDENCE WERE ADMITTED\n\n¶ 47 The trial court considered whether the evidence supported permissible purposes pursuant to R.C. 2945.59 and Evid.R. 404(B) and found several exceptions. In its judgment entry at page 7, the trial court found:\n\nThe factual overlap between the prospective testimonies [of the witnesses] may point to a motive and intent: engaging in the sexual abuse of minors for sexual gratification. Detailed other-acts testimony here may help the jury identify [appellant] by a common scheme, plan, system, or modus operandi – a “behavioral fingerprint” – aimed at the targeting, grooming, and raping of children. The testimony about prior acts of child sex abuse may cast significant doubt, too, on the possibility that any of the alleged conduct in the present matter was accidental. (Citation omitted, emphasis added.)\n\n¶ 48 The trial court further defined the purposes of the other-acts evidence in the instructions it gave to the jury prior to deliberation (T. at 955-956):\n\nIf you find that the evidence about other acts on the part of the Defendant is true, then you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether that evidence proves: one, the absence of a mistake or an accident on his part on the dates of the crimes at issue in this case; two, his motive or his intent on the dates of the crimes at issue in this case; three, his\nknowledge of the circumstances surrounding the crimes at issue in this case; or, four, his use of a particular method of selecting, grooming, and sexually abusing minor victims. The evidence about other acts may not be considered by you for any other purpose. (Emphasis added.)\n\nANALYSIS OF OTHER-ACTS EVIDENCE\n\n¶ 49 The four nonpropensity reasons for admission of the evidence given by the trial court to the jury will be discussed out of order.\n\n1. ABSENCE OF A MISTAKE OR AN ACCIDENT\n\n¶ 50 The trial court first instructed the jury the other-acts evidence may be used to show appellant’s actions were not a mistake nor accidental. Appellant plead not guilty making a general denial of all allegations. He did not testify, nor did the police testify as to statements made by appellant. The record does not reflect any indication he ever claimed mistake or accident. Additionally, the state made no argument that appellant raised a defense claiming the acts were accidental.\n\n¶ 51 In Smith, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed lack of mistake evidence. In Smith, the defendant was charged in 2016 with rape, gross sexual imposition and disseminating matter harmful to a juvenile. The victim was his granddaughter. The allegations were he rubbed oil on her body under her clothes on her chest, buttock and vagina then licked her breast and vagina. He played a pornographic film showing oral and vaginal intercourse. The next morning he pressed his penis into her backside and began to remove her underwear; she moved away and he stop. He denied any of this was for sexual purposes. He admitted that he rubbed lotion on the child’s body, but any\ninappropriate touching of private parts was accidental. He claimed that if his penis did touch her it was accidental because he tends to get erections in his sleep. He further claimed an R-rated movie accidentally began to play for a few seconds when he attempted to play a cartoon on a DVD. The state sought to admit other-acts evidence from a 1986 allegation that he did similar things to one of his daughters. The Smith court held the prior testimony was admissible to rebut the defendant’s claim that his 2016 acts were accidental, inadvertent or a mistake.\n\n¶ 52 In the instant case there is no such claim by appellant. In Hartman, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio at ¶ 27 stated, “it is not enough to say the evidence is relevant to a nonpropensity purpose. The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a ‘material’ issue that is actually in dispute....”\n\n¶ 53 Because there is no claim of mistake or accident before the jury, there is nothing for the prosecution to rebut on this issue. I find the evidence may not be admitted for a legitimate purpose under this exception to the rule.\n\n3. KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE CRIMES\n\n¶ 54 This purpose was not addressed in the trial court’s judgment entry. It is unclear from the record exactly what nonpropensity purpose, “his knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the crimes,” refers to in this case. Typically, this type of other-acts evidence is admitted to show a defendant’s awareness, such as knowledge that he possessed contraband or his awareness of illegal activity. I find under the facts of this case, this is not a permissible purpose to admit other-acts evidence.\n\nPURPOSES 2. AND 4.\n¶ 55 The next two purposes are the focus of the case as highlighted by the prosecutors’ statements to the jury.\n\n¶ 56 In closing argument, the state told the jury: “So for our purposes, we’re asking that you consider this evidence of other acts on the issues of motive and method. Specifically, his motive and his intent to engage in sexual conduct with minor girls and his method of selecting, grooming, and sexually abusing these minor girls.” T. at 908. Later in rebuttal, the state again argued to the jury how it should use this evidence. “So yes, of course you can consider [L.C.’s] testimony for those purposes that we discussed in our first closing which was to show method and to show motivation that Ron Williams is attracted to underage girls.” T. at 944.\n\n4. USE OF A PARTICULAR METHOD OF SELECTING, GROOMING, AND SEXUALLY ABUSING MINOR VICTIMS\n\n¶ 57 The state sought to use the other-acts evidence to show appellant used a particular method of selecting, grooming and abusing his victims. In its judgment entry, the trial court found the other-acts evidence may be helpful to the jury to identify appellant by this common scheme or plan, modus operandi or behavioral fingerprint.\n\n¶ 58 This type of other acts evidence is a permissible purpose if the identity of the actor is an issue in actual dispute. “[Modus operandi] is evidence of signature, fingerprint-like characteristics unique enough ‘to show that the crimes were committed by the same person.’ Evidence of modus operandi is relevant to prove identity.” Hartman, supra, at ¶ 37. (Citations omitted.)\n\n¶ 59 In the instant case there is no question as to who may have done the acts. Both victims were clear the actor was appellant. The only question before the jury was whether the acts occurred. I find the other-acts evidence to prove identity by showing\nmodus operandi or a behavioral fingerprint is not permissible because identity is not in dispute.\n\n¶ 60 In State v. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 330 N.E.2d 720 (1975), the Supreme Court of Ohio discussed the two factual situations where the defendant’s scheme, plan or system pursuant to R.C. 2945.59 is relevant. One is identity, which as discussed above is not at issue here. The other, as cited in Curry at 73 is when:\n\n[T]he “other acts” form part of the immediate background of the alleged act which forms the foundation of the crime charged in the indictment.\n\n***\n\nTo be admissible pursuant to this sub-category of ‘scheme, plan or system’ evidence, the ‘other acts’ testimony must concern events which are inextricably related to the alleged criminal act. The July 8, 1972, incident and the December 22, 1972, incident are not so related; they are chronologically and factually separate occurrences.\n\n¶ 61 The Hartman court at ¶ 13 cited Curry to re-emphasize the connection of the other-acts evidence to the current crime:\n\nCommon-plan evidence generally concerns events that are “inextricably related’ to the crime charged. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d at 73. The other acts form the “immediate background” of the present crime: they are typically either part of the “same transaction” as the crime for which the defendant is\non trial or they are part of “a sequence of events” leading up to the commission of the crime in question.\n\n¶ 62 In Curry there was a five to six-month gap between the charged acts and the other-acts. In our current case there is a at least a seventeen-year gap between the “chronological and factually separate” other-acts and the current charges. I find the other-acts evidence is not admissible pursuant to a common scheme, plan or system exception.\n\n2. MOTIVE OR INTENT\n\n¶ 63 Motive and intent can be distinct issues. In Hartman at ¶ 48, motive is described as a specific reason for committing a crime. If a person commits a murder to cover up a previous crime, the other-acts evidence of the previous crime may tend to prove the motive for the murder, a permissible nonpropensity purpose. Id. Motive is not typically an element of a criminal offense. Intent is normally an element. Did a person act with the purpose to cause a certain result which culminated in a criminal offense? In the murder example, the motive may be to want a person dead; the intent is the mental purpose to do the act to cause the death (to pull the trigger of a gun). In this case, the trial court and the arguments of the prosecutor appear to treat the terms as one. The evidence was admitted to show appellant’s intent was to derive sexual gratification from the acts alleged in the charge of gross sexual imposition.\n\n¶ 64 Generally, intent is “not a material issue for other-acts purposes unless it is genuinely disputed – in most cases, ‘the act speaks for itself.’ ” Hartman at ¶ 55. However, when the crime charged is one of specific intent, such intent is a material issue in the case. Id. The crime of gross sexual imposition requires the state prove appellant had the\nspecific intent to perform the act(s) for the sexual gratification of himself or another. This is a potential proper purpose for other-acts evidence to be considered. However, based upon the facts of this case, a more thorough examination of the purpose is warranted.\n\n¶ 65 The decision on whether to allow other-acts evidence on the single count of gross sexual imposition should not be considered in a vacuum. Appellant faced sixteen counts of rape as well. The testimony relating to these counts was replete with explicit accounts of sexual conduct that left no question as to appellant’s intent. A single jury heard all of the testimony from both victims. There is certainly an argument, in light of the extensive testimony in the rape counts, that the element of sexual gratification in gross sexual imposition is not in actual dispute.\n\n¶ 66 Assuming arguendo, the permissible purpose to show intent by way of the other-acts evidence is justified, in my view the Evid.R. 403 balancing test is still a bar to this evidence. The Hartman court at ¶ 32 advised courts to, “consider whether the prosecution is able to present alternative evidence to prove the same fact through less prejudicial means…” In this case, the attendant sixteen counts of rape provided the jury with extensive and overwhelming evidence to find intent. This other-acts evidence is certainly probative of intent. However, it does not show anything about appellant’s intent not already shown by the extensive testimony in the current charges. I find the probative value of the other-acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Therefore, I would prohibit the admission of the other-acts evidence based upon the Evid.R. 403 balancing test.\n¶ 67 However, as indicated above, I find the error to admit the other-acts evidence to be harmless, and I join in the judgment of the majority in affirming the conviction of appellant."}
{"index": "077-Breneman", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "The trial court erred in failing to grant him a new trial due to the prosecutor’s informing the jury of Breneman’s three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions during opening statements.", "extracted_text": "¶ 34 On August 8, 2019, prior to trial, the parties filed three written stipulations signed by the prosecutor and defense counsel. The first concerned the title for the 1995 Toyota Corolla at issue, the second concerned Breneman’s criminal history, and the third concerned the prescription medication prescribed for Breneman’s mother. In the criminal history stipulation, the parties agreed and stipulated that Breneman was previously convicted of or plead guilty to the following felony drug abuse offenses:\n\n1. Possession of Heroin in violation of section 2925.11 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on July 21, 2014 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2014 CR 121.\n\n2. Possession of Cocaine in violation of section 2925.11 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on July 21, 2011 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2010 CR 103.\n\n3. Trafficking in Cocaine in violation of section 2925.03 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on April 30, 2002 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2002 CR 004.\n\n¶ 35 Trial began on August 12. That morning, before jury selection, the\n\n¹ Breneman’s sentencing occurred the day after the trial ended, and the trial court filed its written judgment entry of conviction on the same day. Breneman’s counsel filed a written motion for a new trial after the trial court filed its judgment entry of conviction. The court ruled on that motion after Breneman filed his notice of appeal of his conviction. The court’s decision denying the motion for a new trial is not before us. However, Breneman repeatedly claimed at trial and sentencing that he was denied a fair trial due to the prosecutor’s opening statement. We will construe his assignment of error as claiming that the prosecutor’s alleged misconduct violated his due process rights and that the court should have ordered a new trial.\nprosecutor and defense counsel gave opening statements to the prospective jurors. During the State’s opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that Breneman was released from prison on September 17, 2018, and that he committed the offense of escape by failing to report to his parole officer and moving without notifying his parole officer. The prosecutor further indicated that the parole officers nevertheless “were learning that he [Breneman] was getting into some trouble.” (Tr. at 21.) The prosecutor continued:\n\nThey heard of how the Defendant, who was previously convicted of felony drug abuse offenses of trafficking in cocaine in 2002, possession of cocaine in 2010, and possession of heroin in 2014 – They learned how this Defendant had stolen his mother’s prescription pain medication. * * *\n\nThe parole officers also learned about how this Defendant took possession of a 1995 Toyota Corolla that didn’t belong to him, and he sold the car without the permission of the owner. * * *\n\n(Tr. at 21-22.)\n\n¶ 36 After the prosecutor completed his opening statement, the court, sua sponte, gave the jury the following instruction:\n\nLadies and gentleman, from the prosecutor’s opening statement, we’ve learned that evidence may be received that the Defendant has been previously convicted of certain criminal offenses.\n\nThe Court is instructing you that that evidence may be received because a prior conviction is an element of the offense of theft of drugs in Count One.\nThat evidence was not received and you may not consider it to prove\nthe character of the Defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity\nor in accordance with that character.\n\n(Tr. at 23-24.)\n\n¶ 37 At this juncture, defense counsel asked for a sidebar discussion. Counsel\nstated that he wanted to “strenuously object to the opening statement in that it included\noffenses of prior history that were not part of the post-release control,” that is, Breneman\nwas not on post-release control for those offenses. Defense counsel asked for a mistrial.\n\n¶ 38 The trial court then asked defense counsel if he agreed that the three\nreferenced drug charges were predicate offenses for the theft of drug allegation.\nDefense counsel responded that he did. The court indicated that “[t]hat was the purpose\nfor the Court’s instruction to the jury.” The court denied the motion for a mistrial. It\nreasoned that, although the court “had a concern with the way the prosecution had\npositioned those offenses,” the opening statement was not evidence and the concern was\ncured through the jury instruction.\n\n¶ 39 After the jury was selected, but prior to the presentation of testimony, the\ntrial court, sua sponte, admirably raised with the parties that it had concerns about the\ncriminal history stipulation. The court referred the parties to two cases: State v. Totarella,\n11th Dist. Lake No. 2002-L-147, 2004-Ohio-1175, and State v. Overton, 2017-Ohio-8389,\n99 N.E.3d 1007 (5th Dist.). Discussing Totarella, the court expressed concern that it\nwould be prejudicial for the jury to learn that Breneman had three convictions and the\ndetails of those convictions if Breneman were acknowledging, by stipulation, that he had\na prior drug abuse conviction. The trial court told counsel that Overton addressed undue\nprejudice caused by evidence of a defendant’s prior convictions.\n\n¶ 40 After having an opportunity to read the two cases, the prosecutor argued that they were distinguishable, because in both cases defense counsel had sought to exclude evidence of the prior convictions and the trial court had denied those requests. The prosecutor argued that, in contrast, the trial court here was raising the issue sua sponte. Specifically, the prosecutor noted that the trial court had denied a motion in limine in Totarella; the appellate court found that to be error, but overruled the defendant’s assignment of error because the defendant had failed to preserve the error at trial. In Overton, the trial court overruled an oral motion to stipulate to a prior conviction, and the appellate court determined that the court should have allowed the stipulation. The prosecutor stated that the stipulation at issue stated that Breneman was agreeing that he previously was convicted of a felony drug abuse offense.\n\n¶ 41 Defense counsel indicated that he had been unaware of the Totarella case, and that the defense now wished only to stipulate that Breneman was previously convicted of or pled guilty to a felony drug abuse offense. The prosecutor responded that, given the case law and defense counsel’s request, the State would be required to agree to the request. The court indicated that the parties would need to file an amended stipulation. (The new stipulation regarding Breneman’s criminal history was filed on August 12, 2019.)\n\n¶ 42 The court then addressed the fact that the jury had been told of Breneman’s prior offenses during opening statements. The court concluded that the error in informing the jury of the three convictions was harmless. Breneman told the court that he did not believe he could get a fair trial due to the prosecutor’s opening statement. The\nprosecutor responded that he did not intentionally engage in any improper conduct and only told the jury of the three offenses mentioned in the stipulation; he did not mention the rest of Breneman’s “very extensive” criminal history or that Breneman was on post-release control for a burglary offense.\n\n¶ 43 None of the State’s witnesses discussed Breneman’s criminal history, although there was testimony that Breneman was released from prison and placed on post-release control. After the State’s final witness, the court read the stipulations regarding Breneman’s criminal history and the motor vehicle title. The stipulation regarding Breneman’s criminal history read, in its entirety: “The State of Ohio and the Defendant do hereby agree to stipulate that the Defendant, Virgil Royale Lee Breneman, was previously convicted of or pled guilty to a felony drug abuse offense.”\n\n¶ 44 During closing argument, the prosecutor stated that, as part of the theft of drug offense, the State had to prove that Breneman had a prior conviction of a felony drug abuse offense. The prosecutor told that jury that the parties had stipulated to that. The prosecutor did not mention Breneman’s specific criminal history.\n\n¶ 45 The court subsequently provided instructions to the jury. It told the jury that opening statements and closing statements were not evidence and were designed to assist the jury in evaluating the evidence. In a section entitled “Use of Prior Conviction – Enhancing the Degree of Offense,” the court stated:\n\nEvidence was received that the Defendant has been convicted of a felony drug abuse offense. That evidence was received because a prior conviction is an element of the offense charged. It was not received, and you may not consider it, to prove the character of the Defendant in order to\nshow that he acted in conformity with the character.\n\n¶ 46 On appeal, Breneman claims that the trial court should have ordered a new trial due to the prosecutor’s prejudicial opening statement. He claims that the prosecutor’s reference to his three prior convictions precluded him from receiving a fair trial. The State counters that Breneman’s argument is barred by the invited error doctrine, and that Breneman did not timely object to the prosecutor’s mentioning of the three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions. We conclude that Breneman invited the prosecutor’s reference to the three prior drug offenses in his opening statement. Moreover, with the unique record before us, we further conclude that Breneman was not prejudiced by the prosecutor’s isolated reference to Breneman’s three specific prior convictions, and no new trial was warranted.\n\n¶ 47 The indictment for Count 1, alleging theft of drugs as a felony of the third degree, include allegations that Breneman was previously convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony drug abuse offense, and it listed the 2014 conviction for possession of heroin, the 2011 conviction for possession of cocaine, and the 2002 conviction for trafficking in cocaine. The parties’ pretrial stipulation agreed that Breneman had been convicted of those three offenses. The prosecutor’s opening statement conformed to the parties’ stipulation; it did not add any details about those offenses or mention any other prior offenses.\n\n¶ 48 Under the doctrine of invited error, “[a] party will not be permitted to take advantage of an error [that] he himself invited or induced.” (Citations omitted.) State v. Fair, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24388, 2011-Ohio-4454, ¶ 69. Defense counsel agreed to a stipulation, prior to trial, that Breneman had been convicted of the three drug offenses\nreferenced in Count I of the indictment. The prosecutor cannot be faulted for relying on that stipulation in his opening statement, and Breneman cannot now complain about the prosecutor’s informing the jury of those convictions in the State’s opening statement.\n\n¶ 49 Moreover, under the facts of this case, any prejudice that resulted from the prosecutor’s single reference to Breneman’s three specific prior convictions was diminished by court’s jury instructions and the nature of the charges at trial. First, the jury was told, immediately after the prosecutor’s opening statement, that evidence of Breneman’s prior convictions was permitted because a prior conviction was an element of the offense of theft of drugs in Count One, but “[t]hat evidence was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the Defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity or in accordance with that character.” The court repeated that instruction at the conclusion of the trial. The court also twice instructed the jury that opening statements were not evidence. We presume that the jury followed the trial court’s instructions. State v. Keeton, 2d Dist. Darke No. 2019-CA-8, 2020-Ohio-950, ¶ 24, citing State v. Jones, 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 414, 739 N.E.2d 300 (2000) (“We presume that juries follow the instructions provided to them.”).\n\n¶ 50 Second, as part of the trial, the jury properly heard that Breneman had a prior felony drug abuse offense conviction and that he had previously served a prison sentence, for which he was on post-release control. The parties stipulated that Breneman had a prior felony drug abuse offense, and that stipulation was read to the jury. Although the prosecutor’s opening statement provided the specific offense, date and case number for three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions, the prosecutor did not inform the jury of the factual circumstances underlying those offenses or discuss any\nother aspect of Breneman’s criminal history.\n\n¶ 51 Upon review of the trial transcript, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor’s opening statement prejudicially affected Breneman’s substantial rights, resulting in an unfair trial. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant Breneman a new trial.\n\n¶ 52 Breneman’s first assignment of error is overruled."}

It was only for a few moments, and he looked up and his eyes opened and his head came up. But his eyes were closed for a few moments, and I felt that I needed to bring it to the Court’s attention.’ (Tr. at 388.)\nThe court responded that it ‘had taken a look at Juror No. 10 as well, and I never thought he was ‘sleeping.’ Some jurors will tend to listen to evidence without taking notes as if they’re listening to music. But I will seek to keep a closer eye as well.’ (Id. at 388-389.) The court asked the prosecutor if he wanted the court to take any action. The prosecutor responded, ‘No. I just wanted to bring it to your attention.’ (Id. at 389.)

The first argument is that the trial court erred by sustaining the State’s objection to the defense expert, Kapelsohn, testifying regarding a soft wood experiment conducted prior to trial.\n\nWhile testifying on redirect examination regarding the issue of whether pressing the Beretta against Carol’s forehead so as to put the weapon out of battery would have left a mark, Kapelsohn was asked if he had had “an opportunity to test this weapon about whether or not it would leave a mark on let’s say a piece of soft wood?” Kapelsohn answered that he did and began to explain the experiment when the State objected. The trial court sustained the objection having determined that, while Kapelsohn’s expert report contained his opinion that pushing the Beretta against a person’s forehead would leave a mark, the report did not disclose an experiment with a piece of wood which, apparently, was conducted after his report was turned over to the State.\n\nUnder the Rules of Criminal Procedure, “[t]he defendant shall provide copies or photographs, or permit the prosecuting attorney to copy or photograph, * * * [the] [r]esults of * * * experiments or scientific tests.” Crim.R. 16(H)(2).\n\n“If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.” Crim.R. 16(L)(1). This Rule “vests in the trial court the discretion to determine the appropriate response for failure of a party to disclose material subject to a valid discovery request,” and “[r]eversible error exists only where the exercise of such authority by the trial court constitutes an abuse of discretion.” State v. Wiles, 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 78, 571 N.E.2d 97 (1991); State v. Darmond, 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, 986 N.E.2d 971, ¶ 20.\n\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s decision to prevent the defense expert from testifying regarding the soft wood experiment. Burry offered no explanation for the failure to disclose to the State that the experiment had been conducted. The issue of whether pushing a pistol against a person’s forehead or stomach so as to put it out of battery would leave a mark was disputed at trial. The probative value of conducting an experiment with soft wood as a substitute for the human body is not immediately apparent. To allow Kapelsohn to testify regarding the results of such an experiment on redirect, when the State was unaware of either the methodology or the results of the experiment would have been unfair to the prosecution.\nThe case of *State v. Branham*, 104 Ohio App.3d 355, 662 N.E.2d 54 (12th Dist.1995), is comparable. In *Branham*, defense counsel had identified an expert witness in the pretrial discovery statement but did not disclose the details of an experiment “involving the shooting of arrows into a pig skull stuffed with styrofoam.” *Id.* at 361. “Therefore, the trial court confined the expert’s testimony to his expertise as developed through his experience and precluded testimony based upon the pig skull experiment.” *Id.* The court of appeals affirmed, observing that “[t]he trial court excluded only that expert testimony concerning the pig skull experiment,” while “[a]ll other testimony by the expert was permitted.” *Id.* at 362. “Under the circumstances, the sanction imposed by the trial court is entirely consistent with the Criminal Rules and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.” *Id.* Similarly in the present case, the trial court excluded only Kapelsohn’s testimony regarding an experiment which had not been included in his expert report."}

{"index": "078-Burry", "allegation_num": "allegation_3", "allegation": "The trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant when it returned a verdict of guilty against the manifest weight of the evidence.", "extracted_text": "Burry raises issues with Carol’s credibility, noting that she did not believe that the pistol was loaded at the time of the incident, did not claim that she had been held down in her initial statements to the police, and changed her account of events as to whether Burry held the magazine in his other hand and the number of clicks she heard when he pulled the trigger. Burry impugns Carol’s credibility by noting that, after he allegedly threatened her life and the lives of her dogs, she remained on the couch watching television. We find Carol’s testimony to be credible, if not wholly consistent. It is evident that immediately after the assault she was confused as to what had happened. She had no reason for believing that the gun was unloaded other than the fact that it did not fire. She also struggled with the fact that Burry had never been violent with her before. The salient aspects of Carol's testimony are corroborated by other evidence. Kyle, who never doubted the Beretta was loaded, confirmed that Burry held Carol down while pointing the gun at her. Burry suggests that Kyle has also changed his testimony to conform to the State's theory of the crime. But there is no inconsistency between Carol's and Kyle's testimony that she was held down and their initial statements to the police. That Burry held Carol down is merely an additional detail that is consonant with the fact that Carol was sitting down on a couch when Burry put the gun to her head and stomach. He would have to have been standing over her or be physically on top of her to do this. It is likewise significant that Carol was able to immediately locate the Beretta's magazine between the couch and ottoman, although she was unaware of the pistol's location in Burry's dresser drawer. Burry emphasizes his expert witness' testimony that the possibility of the Beretta being out of battery twice within seconds of the trigger being pulled is extremely unlikely and that it is more probable that it was not loaded when Burry fired. Burry's theory of events, however, is not without its incredible elements. It presupposes Burry loading the Beretta after he had fired twice at Carol for reasons unknown, chambering a round, dropping the magazine in the living room, and then moving to his bedroom where he discharged the weapon. Under this theory, there is no obvious logic or reason behind Burry's actions. It fails to account for Carol's knowledge of the magazine's location (unless we assume she remained on the couch while Burry actually loaded the weapon and then waited for him to change his mind and discard the magazine). And it is inconsistent with Burry’s own explanation of events from Sergeant Hirz’ and Officer Subkowich’s body cams. Both parties’ experts essentially agreed that the Beretta would not discharge if it was more than an eighth of an inch out of battery and that it could be put out of battery by pressing it against a person’s body. The likelihood of the weapon being put out of battery by pressing against a person’s forehead and stomach is especially for the jury to decide inasmuch as the jury was able to physically handle and manipulate the weapon in addition to witnessing the experts doing so."}

Burry maintains that he showed genuine remorse as evidenced by his apology to Carol and Kyle at sentencing:\n\nCarol, I’ve been waiting ten months to tell you how truly sorry I am for any pain or suffering I put you through that night. I constantly thank God that no one was hurt and killed. There is not a moment that I don’t think about that night. It haunts me constantly. I hope someday you and Kyle and Todd can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nThe sentencing court did not find Burry’s remorse genuine, or at least a mitigating factor, in light of Burry’s claim to not remember pointing the gun at Carol:\n\nI did pick up on the fact that you remember certain aspects [of the night’s events] in the presentence report as you related them to the probation officer and/or in writing and then indicate that you didn’t\nremember most things because you blacked out. So I don’t know which way it is. To me it’s of no significance, the likelihood is you’re at some point trying to minimize what happened **.5\n\nBurry further cites as mitigating factors the fact that he worked for thirty-five years and led a law-abiding life; the stress of the impending divorce; his age (sixty-three at the time of sentencing); and his anxiety and depression. The sentencing court noted that Burry ‘charged Sergeant Hirz’ but Burry claims that, ‘on the bodycam, it appears that he was requesting a ‘suicide by cop’ by standing up and telling the officers to shoot him.\n\n{¶81} With respect to Burry’s remorse, it has been the position of this court to ‘defer to the trial court as to whether a defendant’s remarks are indicative of genuine remorse because it is in the best position to make that determination.’ (Citation omitted.)

The court\nemphasized the psychological harm/‘torment’ suffered by Carol and Burry’s responsibility for causing the situation that evening (‘you knew that taking that medication and mixing it with not only alcohol but a lot of alcohol *** was a combination that wasn’t going to result in anything good’). The court recognized Burry’s lack of a criminal record and several letters of support received from friends and family but concluded, ultimately, ‘I don’t know how you get beyond the fact that other than that gun not going off because of the slide because it was out of battery [Carol] wouldn’t be here and you’d be in a whole different stretch of years that I would be considering right now.’\n\n{¶83} In light of the foregoing we cannot conclude that the record does not clearly and convincingly support the sentence imposed."}

Accordingly, we must vacate the consecutive nature of Bolware’s sentences and remand the cause for the trial court to consider whether consecutive sentences are appropriate under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) and, if so, to make the required findings on the record and incorporate those findings in the sentencing journal entry. We sustain Bolware’s fifth assignment of error."}

The male, who was later identified as Appellant, was the sole individual in the vehicle. (*Id.). As Kunkleman exited his vehicle, Appellant exited the vehicle in which he was sitting. (Id. at 67).

Shelby No. 17-08-06, 2008-Ohio-4784, ¶ 4 quoting State v. Jackson, 169 Ohio App.3d 440, 2006-Ohio-6059, 863 N.E.2d 223, ¶14 (citations omitted). However, in sitting as the thirteenth juror the appellate court should give due deference to the findings made by the jury. Id.\nAnalysis\n\n{¶63} The Eighth District Court of Appeals identified the following eight factors as a guide to assist a reviewing court in determining whether a decision of the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence:\n\n1. A reviewing court is not required to accept the incredible as true;\n2. Whether the evidence is uncontradicted;\n3. Whether a witness was impeached;\n4. What was not proved;\n5. Certainty of evidence;\n6. Reliability of evidence;\n7. Whether witness’ testimony is self-serving;\n8. And whether evidence is vague, uncertain, conflicting, or fragmentary.\n\nState v. Mattison, 23 Ohio App.3d 10, 14, 490 N.E.2d 926 (8th Dist.1985). We discuss the relevant factors to each underlying case below.\n\nUncontradicted Evidence\n\n{¶64} Initially, we note that Appellant failed to introduce any evidence that contradicted the State’s evidence at trial. In respect to case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant produced no evidence to contradict the State’s testimony that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:00 a.m., the Lima Police Department was dispatched to 234 North Main Street in Lima, Ohio for a call of a suspicious vehicle sitting in\nthe parking lot. It is not disputed that the Appellant exited his vehicle when officers arrived, and when Kunkleman approached him, Appellant turned back and leaned into the car on the driver’s side. It is further undisputed that officers could smell the smell of raw marijuana at this time and that officers grabbed Appellant and pulled him away from the vehicle for their safety.\n\n{¶65} There is no dispute that the Appellant, when ordered to put his hands up in the air, disregarded the officer’s commands, which led to him being detained. A pat down of Appellant produced a large sum of money and marijuana, which led to his arrest and the subsequent search of the vehicle, which produced a large amount of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, digital scales, and Appellant’s billfold. With no testimony or evidence produced at trial to cast doubt upon this version of events, Appellant cannot contradict the elements of possession of cocaine and possession of heroin as established by the State in case number CR 2014 0118.\n\n{¶66} In regards to case number CR 2015 0361, the State’s uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that on January 17, 2015, after receiving an anonymous tip and surveilling the premises, law enforcement entered 1222 Catalpa Street after repeatedly requesting that Appellant come to the front door. Once inside the premises, and while conducting a protective sweep of the home, officers viewed a marijuana grow tent in plain view. Based on the information collected, officers obtained a search warrant and searched the premises in its entirety. During the\nsearch, officers located credit cards, mail, and other personal effects bearing Appellant’s name.\n\n{¶67} While Appellant contends that no witness had personal knowledge that he occupied the premises, the evidence indicates otherwise. Specifically, many of Appellant’s personal effects were found within the residence, which is indicative of occupation. Accordingly, we find that the uncontradicted evidence supports that Appellant was occupying the residence on January 17, 2015.\n\nImpeached Witness\n\n{¶68} A review of the record reveals that no witness for the State was impeached in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361.\n\nReliability of Evidence\n\n{¶69} With respect to case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant attempts to discredit the reliability of the testimony and evidence produced at trial, because ‘not one single witness [***] actually had personal knowledge of Appellant allegedly occupying the premises testified [to] at trial.’ (Br. of Appellant at 10). Appellant further classifies all of the testimony produced regarding occupation of the premises as ‘hearsay.’\n\n{¶70} However, we find that the State produced competent and credible evidence that Appellant was occupying 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio at the time the officers conducted their raid. Specifically, officers testified that they\nobserved Appellant leave the back of the duplex in an attempt to flee, and then run back inside once he saw that officers had the duplex surrounded. Furthermore, the evidence established that officers personally observed Appellant leave out of the back of the residence prior to it being breached. With eyewitness testimony confirming that Appellant was, in fact, inside the residence, we find no merit in Appellant’s argument in regards to reliability.\n\n**Self-Serving Testimony**\n\n{¶71} The record reveals that the trial court did not characterize any witness’s testimony as self-serving in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, on review, we do not find any indicia of self-serving testimony in either case and Appellant does not argue that testimony was self-serving on appeal.\n\n**Vague, Uncertain, Conflicting, or Fragmentary Evidence**\n\n{¶72} In case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant points to the evidence produced at the suppression hearing to cast into doubt officers’ testimony at trial. Specifically, Appellant argues that the officers, when testifying at the suppression hearing, described a ‘much more leisurely encounter at the suppression hearing than they did at trial.’ (Br. of Appellant at 10). However, Appellant fails to develop this argument and further fails to demonstrate how this ‘conflict’ in testimonies between the suppression hearing and trial creates a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting\nreversal. Even should Appellant establish that a true ‘conflict’ exists in the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and the trial, and that such issue was properly before this Court, we find that the record contains competent, credible evidence to support the trial court’s findings. *Phelps v. Horn’s Crop Serv. Ctr.*, 3rd Dist. Wyandot No. 16-89-8, 1990 WL 157282, * 2 (holding that the choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact).\n\n{¶73} Accordingly, we find that the weight of the evidence supports Appellant’s convictions. We further find that the jury did not lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting Appellant of possession of cocaine and heroin in case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant’s second assignment of error."}

For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n{¶75} ‘When a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel’s assistance, the defendant must show that the counsel’s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.” State v. Sanders, 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151, 2002-Ohio-350, 761 N.E.2d 18 quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). Additionally, “[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.” Id., at 694. See also, State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 137, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).\n\n{¶76} In analyzing a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, this court’s scrutiny of counsel’s performance must be highly deferential, with a ‘strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.’” Bradley, supra, at 142, quoting Strickland, supra, at 687-88. “Counsel’s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel’s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel’s performance.” Id.\n\nAnalysis\n\n{¶77} At the outset, we note that Appellant, during the course of the proceedings below, had five (5) different attorneys represent him. Interestingly, Appellant does not specify which trial counsel was ineffective. However, it appears from this assignment that Appellant questions the effectiveness of his trial counsel.\nAppellant initially argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because trial counsel failed to object to any of the hearsay regarding Appellant residing in the residence during the raid by police officers, as charged in case number CR 2015 0361. However, we note that the failure to make objections is not alone enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Conway*, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, ¶ 103. *See also, State v. Holloway*, 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831 (1988) (failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); *State v. Gumm*, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 428, 1995-Ohio-24, 653 N.E.2d 253 holding modified by *State v. Wogenstahl*, 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 1996-Ohio-219, 662 N.E.2d 311 (the failure to make objections does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel per se, as that failure may be justified as a tactical decision).\n\nNext, Appellant argues that his trial counsel’s performance was ineffective because trial counsel did not voir dire Sergeant Dana Sutherland (“Sutherland”), the State’s marijuana expert witness. This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, the record reveals, and the Appellant concedes, that trial counsel objected to the expert being certified as an expert witness, and the trial court overruled the objection. (*See, Trial Tr., Vol. II, at 286*). And second, the record reveals that the Appellant’s concerns with Sutherland’s qualifications to testify as an expert were addressed by the trial court prior to trial. (*Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol.*\nI, at 11). Given the trial court’s rulings, we do not find that Appellant’s trial counsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation under the facts presented.\n\nLastly, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective because his trial counsel failed to file a proper motion to sever the counts at the appropriate time during trial. However, the record is clear, and the Appellant concedes, that objections to the State’s motions to consolidate were made and a motion to sever was filed prior to trial. (See, CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 139; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 48). Despite Appellant’s objections and motion, the trial court found that the charges were of similar character and part of a common scheme or course of criminal conduct, then consolidated the cases and joined them for purposes of trial. (CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 163; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 82). Thus, because the trial court had already ruled on Appellant’s motion to sever, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that a subsequent trial counsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness by failing to file an additional motion to sever, and we overrule Appellant’s third assignment of error in its entirety."}
{"index": "084-Davis", "allegation_num": "allegation_4", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE APPELLANTS [SIC] MOTION TO DISMISS THE CASE BASED UPON VIOLATION OF HIS RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL.", "extracted_text": "Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss his cases based upon a speedy trial violation. Specifically, Appellant argues that the continuance granted at the request of the State beyond the February 21, 2017 trial date was unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n¶82 “Our standard of review upon an appeal raising a speedy trial issue is to count the expired days as directed by R.C. 2945.71, et seq.” State v. King, 3rd Dist. Marion No. 9-06-18, 2007-Ohio-335, ¶ 30. See also, State v. DePue, 96 Ohio App.3d 513, 516, 645 N.E.2d 745 (4th Dist.1994). “If any ambiguity exists, we construe the record in favor of the accused.” Id.\n\n¶83 The applicable statutory speedy trial provision, R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), provides that a person charged with a felony shall be brought to trial within two hundred and seventy (270) days after the person’s arrest. R.C. 2945.71(C)(2). In computing time under division (C)(2), “each day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charges shall be counted as three days.” R.C. 2945.71(E).\n\n¶84 Further, R.C. 2945.73(B) provides:\n\nUpon motion made at or prior to the commencement of trial, a person charged with an offense shall be discharged if he is not brought to trial within the time required by sections 2945.71 and 2945.72 of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). “R.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are ‘mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.’” King at ¶ 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). “However, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.” *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n{¶85} In the instant matter, both the State and Appellant agree that Appellant’s speedy trial rights were upheld throughout the proceedings up until Appellant’s scheduled jury trial on February 21, 2017. However, at the request of the State, Appellant’s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017, outside of the Appellant’s statutory speedy trial period. Thus, the question before us is not whether Appellant was brought to trial within the statutorily permitted time frame, but rather, was the speedy trial violation permissible under the circumstances of the case. We answer that question in the affirmative.\n\n{¶86} R.C. 2945.72, entitled “extension of time for hearing or trial,” allows for an extension of time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances. R.C. 2945.72(H) provides:\n\nThe time within which an accused must be brought to trial, or, in the case of felony, to preliminary hearing and trial, may be extended only by the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(H) The period of any continuance granted on the accused’s own motion, and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused’s own motion.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2945.72(H).\nThe resolution of this issue, therefore, depends upon whether the trial court’s continuance was reasonable. “Determining the ‘reasonableness’ of the continuance beyond the ninety-day stricture of R.C. 2945.71, invariably, ‘depends on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case.’” State v. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, ¶ 10, quoting State v. Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988). “‘In addition, precedent requires that such a continuance be necessary under the circumstances of the case.’” Id. quoting Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988) citing City of Aurora v. Patrick, 61 Ohio St.2d 107, 108-09, 399 N.E.2d 1220 (1980).\n\nOn February 3, 2017, the State requested a continuance of the trial date, due to the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision in State v. Gonzales. See, State v. Gonzales, 150 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-Ohio-8319, 81 N.E.3d 405, reconsideration granted, decision vacated, 150 Ohio St.3d 276, 2017-Ohio-777, 81 N.E.3d 419, reconsideration denied, 149 Ohio St.3d 1409, 2017-Ohio-2822, 74 N.E.3d 466. In Gonzales, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the offense level for possession of cocaine was determined only by the weight of the actual cocaine, not by the total weight of cocaine plus any filler. Id. at ¶ 22. This opinion was inconsistent with prior case law on the same topic. Id. at ¶ 51. Given the new purity requirements, the State requested a continuance to send Appellant’s cocaine to a lab equipped to determine the weight of actual cocaine, separate from the filler weight.\nThe trial court, on February 9, 2017, granted the State’s request for a continuance and set Appellant’s jury trial for May 16, 2017. (Case number CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 182; case number CR 2015, Doc. No. 109). In granting the continuance, the trial court acknowledged that State v. Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom. Furthermore, the trial court relied on the Seventh District Court of Appeal’s decision in State v. High, wherein the Appellate court held that an extension request by the State for testing of evidence was reasonable. State v. High, 143 Ohio App.3d 232, 242, 2001-Ohio-3530, 757 N.E.2d 1176.\n\nWe find that the continuance was reasonable in light of the need for additional time to conduct testing (of the drugs in question) in accordance with Gonzales. While Appellant argues that the State took “too long” (after the Gonzales decision was announced) to request the continuance, we find that the State’s request was made prior to the already scheduled jury trial.\n\nAppellant further argues that the continuance was unreasonable because the trial court focused on its schedule in denying Appellant’s motion to dismiss. However, “scheduling and docketing conflicts have been held to be reasonable grounds for extending an accused’s trial date beyond the speedy trial limit date by both [the Appellate Court] and the Supreme Court of Ohio. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, ¶ 11. See also, State v. Lee, 48 Ohio\nSt.2d 208, 210, 357 N.E.2d 1095 (1976) (continuance due to “crowded docket & judge’s conference” was reasonable). Thus, we find that the continuance was reasonable, and therefore met the exception requirement listed in R.C. 2945.72(H).\n\n¶92 For the foregoing reasons, we find Appellant’s fourth assignment of error not well taken and overrule the same."}

In examining the purposes and policies behind joinder, courts have expressed that: ‘joinder and the avoidance of multiple trials are favored to conserve judicial resources, including time and expense, reduce the chance of incongruous results in successive trials before different juries, and diminish inconvenience to the witnesses.’ State v. Clifford, 135 Ohio App.3d 207, 211, 733 N.E.2d 621 (1999), cause dismissed, 87 Ohio St.3d 1422, 717 N.E.2d 1108 (1999). ‘To prevail on a claim that the trial court erred in consolidating charges for trial, the defendant must demonstrate affirmatively (1) that his rights were prejudiced, (2) that at the time that the trial court ruled on the motion to consolidate, he provided the court with sufficient information so that it could weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant’s right to a fair trial, and (3) that given the information provided to the court, it abused its discretion in consolidating the charges for trial.’ (Emphasis added). Id. In reviewing Appellant’s argument, we find that the Appellant failed to demonstrate affirmatively exactly how his rights were prejudiced by joinder. Even though Appellant argues that questions exist concerning his actual dominion and control over items of contraband, we find this argument addresses the sufficiency of the evidence, not whether Appellant was prejudiced by the joinder of the cases. Next, Appellant argues that the evidence in one case would not have been admissible in the other case. However, this is not the standard for joinder announced in Crim.R. 13 or Crim.R. 8(A). Lastly, Appellant argues that ‘it is undeniable that juries do not like fugitives.’ (See, Br. of Appellant at 18). Appellant then argues that this fact, standing alone, was sufficient to establish that the trial court abused its discretion by joining the two cases. However, Appellant provides us no support for such assertion. Thus, when reviewed in its entirety, Appellant’s argument fails to demonstrate affirmatively that his rights were prejudiced and thus, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the trial court erred in joining the two cases."}

Godfrey was further informed that a maintenance man for the Catalpa residence had attempted to inspect the residence but was denied entry by Appellant. (Id. at 8). Godfrey knew Appellant had active warrants for his arrest, so he set up a surveillance of 1222 Catalpa Street on January 13, 2015. (Id. at 8-9). On January 17, 2015, Godfrey observed a Chrysler 300 in the driveway with temporary tags. (Id. at 10). When the Chrysler 300 left the residence, Godfrey followed the vehicle. (Id. at 11). The Ohio State Highway Patrol, in conjunction with the West Central Ohio Crime Task force, conducted a traffic stop of the vehicle due to a window tint violation. (Id.). Kunkleman, who was assisting Godfrey with 1222 Catalpa Street surveillance, spoke with the individuals in the Chrysler 300 and learned that they were visiting their friend “Ray” at the Catalpa residence in question. (Id. at 12).\nThe passenger of the Chrysler identified “Ray” as Appellant, and informed officers that Appellant had been living at the address for about a month. (Id. at 12). Because of this information, Godfrey verified that Appellant had active warrants and then set up a perimeter around 1222 Catalpa Street to arrest Appellant. (Id.).\nAfter the residence was surrounded, Godfrey knocked on the front door and ordered Appellant to come out. (Id. at 13). Instead, Appellant exited the rear of the house, but quickly ran back to the residence after observing law enforcement officials surrounding the duplex. (Id.). Officers eventually gained entry into the house, and the Appellant was arrested without incident. (Id. at 15). After Appellant’s arrest, law enforcement officers conducted a protective sweep of the residence to make sure that there were no other individuals or threats within the house. (Id.). In conducting the protective sweep of the residence, law enforcement officials observed a black tent in one of the rooms. (Id.). Because the tent was large enough for someone to hide in, officers looked inside it, finding marijuana plants and a “grow operation” inside. (Id. at 15-16).\nBased on observing the marijuana grow tent in the residence, officers secured the residence and sought out a search warrant for the premises. (Id. at 17-18). The reviewing judge found probable cause and signed the affidavit/search warrant for the residence. (Id. at 39-40; State’s Ex. 1). Based on the search of the residence, law enforcement officials found guns, drugs, electronics, I.D.’s, and paperwork. (Id. at 41; State’s Ex. 1)."}

In Appellant’s brief in support of his motion, Appellant set forth the procedural history leading up to the mistrial. Appellant challenged the admission of texts extracted from a separate analysis of his IPhone, asserting that the texts were not admissible pursuant to Crim.R. 16. Crim.R. 16 (B)(1), discovery, generally provides that upon receipt of a written demand for discovery by the defendant, the prosecuting attorney shall provide copies or photographs of any written or recorded statement by the defendant which is material to the preparation of a defense, or is intended for use by the prosecuting attorney as evidence at the trial. In chambers, the State acknowledged that the texts from Appellant’s IPhone had not been provided because they had not been intended for use at trial, except for possible rebuttal. However, defense counsel’s opening statement indicated the defense strategy would be to shift blame to another person, Cory Forshey, as a person who had access and who may have used Appellant’s phone during the relevant time period. Furthermore, it was indicated Appellant might take the stand to testify in this manner. The texts at issue demonstrated a conversation between Appellant and his girlfriend at the relevant times, which would also strongly suggest that Appellant was in control of his cell phone at the same time a discussion regarding the purchase of heroin by Tyler Miller was taking place. Based upon the above discussion in chambers, the State indicated the texts at issue would now need to be utilized during the State’s case in chief. Defense counsel asserted that the admission of the text messages would create a conflict of interest for him as he represented Cory Forshey in an unrelated matter in West Virginia. For the reasons which follow, we agree with the trial court’s finding that a mistrial was necessary and thus, did not abuse its discretion in ordering a mistrial. Further, we agree with the trial court’s finding that the State’s failure to provide the additional texts was not prosecutorial misconduct intentionally calculated to create or invite a mistrial. Consequently, we find the trial court did not err by denying Appellant’s motion to dismiss."}

ADDITIONALLY, APPELLANT VOGT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL WHEN HIS ATTORNEY FAILED TO REQUEST AN INSTRUCTION ON THE LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSE OF RECKLESS HOMICIDE. FIFTH, SIXTH, AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE I, SECTION 10 AND 16 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION.", "extracted_text": "The question of whether a particular offense should be submitted to the finder of fact as a lesser-included offense involves a two-tiered analysis. The first tier, also called the ‘statutory-elements step,’ is a purely legal question, wherein we determine whether one offense is generally a lesser-included offense of the charged offense. The second tier looks to the evidence in a particular case and determines whether ‘a jury could reasonably find the defendant not guilty of the charged offense, but could convict the defendant of the lesser-included offense.’ In State v. Deem, 40 Ohio St.3d 205, 533 N.E.2d 294 (1988), paragraph three of the syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio held: ‘An offense may be a lesser-included offense of another if (i) the offense carries a lesser penalty than the other; (ii) the greater offense cannot, as statutorily defined, ever be committed without the lesser offense, as statutorily defined, also being committed; and (iii) some element of the greater offense is not required to prove the commission of the lesser offense.’ In State v. Hipshire, 2nd Dist. Darke No. 2010-CA-07, 2011-Ohio-3863, the defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of reckless homicide. The trial court instructed the jury on the elements of involuntary manslaughter, but stated that it could find nothing to indicate that reckless homicide was a lesser-included offense in terms of statutory interpretation or common law decision. In Hipshire, the underlying felony offense for which Hipshire was indicted was a violation of R.C. 2903.16(A), failing to provide for a functionally impaired person, which required proof of the mental state of ‘knowingly.’ The appellate court held: ‘Although Hipshire should have been more attentive to his wife's condition, there is evidence that she was not malnourished, that she did receive food and medication, and that some degree of care was given. A jury could reasonably conclude that Hipshire showed heedless indifference to the consequences and perversely disregarded a known risk that his conduct was likely to result in his wife's death, thus meriting the Reckless Homicide instruction. Accordingly, the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on Reckless Homicide as a lesser-included offense.’ The Hipshire court ultimately concluded that the trial court based its decision on incorrect legal grounds, not on factual conclusions relating to the state of the evidence. In State v. Carusone, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C–010681, 2003–Ohio–1018, the appellate court considered the culpable mental states required for involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide and concluded that the mental states were inconsistent. However, Carusone is distinguishable in that Carusone was involved in an altercation with two victims. The court held: ‘We hold, under the facts of this case, that Carusone could not have been found guilty of both involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide. The evidence did not reasonably support findings that Carusone acted both knowingly and recklessly.’ In State v. Patterson, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2013-T-0062, 2015-Ohio-4423, a case similar to ours, the defendant was convicted for reckless homicide and corrupting another with drugs, along with other felonies. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Wright opined: ‘Involuntary manslaughter can be committed without reckless homicide also being committed.’ Assuming, as in Hipshire, there are occasions where reckless homicide may fairly be considered a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter, here, we do not find the trial court’s failure to give a lesser-included instruction was in error, let alone plain error. At trial, the defense theory of the case was that there was an absence of evidence that Appellant trafficked in drugs. Appellant’s involuntary manslaughter conviction is contingent only upon proof of the underlying felony trafficking. Defense counsel pointed out in closing that there was only circumstantial evidence of texting between Tyler Miller’s phone and ‘whomever’ was using Appellant’s phone. Defense counsel emphasized Appellant’s lack of a criminal record. Defense counsel’s closing argument emphasized that Appellant’s friend, Cory Forshey, had access to Appellant’s cell phone, thus attempting to plant the idea that Corey Forshey was the one trafficking in drugs the night Tyler Miller overdosed. It appears defense counsel’s strategy was ‘all or nothing,’ to argue for a complete acquittal of both charges. It would have been inconsistent for Appellant’s counsel to argue for complete acquittal while at the same time, attempt to argue that Appellant ‘knew of a dangerous situation,’ yet ‘failed to use ordinary care’ as set forth above in the definition of ‘recklessness.’ Generally, a failure to request a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense is presumed to be a matter of trial strategy. For the foregoing reasons, we find no plain error with regard to the trial court’s failure to give a lesser-included offense jury instruction. Related to the above argument, Appellant has also asserted he received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his attorney’s failure to request a lesser-included offense instruction. Given our finding that Appellant did not request the instruction as a matter of reasonable trial strategy, similarly, we find Appellant was not rendered the ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the lack of request for this instruction."}

According to the assistant prosecutor, she provided the interview recording to defense counsel marked “for counsel only.” The court reporter prepared a transcript of the interview at the state's request and provided defense counsel with a copy of the transcript. The assistant prosecutor suspected that defense counsel had violated Crim.R. 16(C) by giving the interview transcript to Svoboda or members of his family. According to her affidavit, the assistant prosecutor discussed the quandary with her supervisor and the “ethical hotline” and general counsel for the Cincinnati Bar Association. After getting the okay from her supervisor, the assistant prosecutor requested that Svoboda's jail cell be searched for a copy of the transcript. On April 12, 2019, a Hamilton County Sheriff's Deputy searched Svoboda's cell and removed all of his legal paperwork. Surveillance footage from the jail showed that the deputy took the paperwork to an office unmonitored by security cameras. Approximately 15 minutes later, the deputy left the office to meet the assistant prosecutor and brought her back to the office. The deputy and assistant prosecutor were in the office for approximately 17 minutes while the assistant prosecutor searched the paperwork. She did not find a copy of A.S.’s interview transcript. After the assistant prosecutor left, the deputy returned the paperwork to Svoboda's cell. On April 15, 2019, the parties gathered for trial, but the court continued the case to the next day because the assistant prosecutor informed the court that the state believed defense counsel had violated Crim.R. 16(C). On April 16, 2019, the assistant prosecutor explained to the court her suspicion that defense counsel had provided Svoboda or members of his family with a copy of the transcript from A.S.’s interview. Defense counsel denied any wrongdoing and informed the judge of the seizure and search of Svoboda's legal paperwork. Defense counsel told the court that he learned that the state had searched Svoboda's cell on the same day as the search. However, he explained that when he called the assistant prosecutor that day, she told him the search was unrelated to the prosecution. Svoboda's counsel filed a motion to disqualify the assistant prosecutor, claiming that Svoboda's legal paperwork contained notes taken during meetings with defense counsel discussing trial preparation and strategy. The state filed a motion in response and a motion for contempt against defense counsel for violating Crim.R. 16(C). On June 7, 2019, the parties appeared at a hearing to discuss the pending motions. The assistant prosecutor's supervisor represented the state. The assistant prosecutor did not appear at the hearing. The supervisor stated that the assistant prosecutor, in the presence of the sheriff's deputy, “leafed” through Svoboda's legal paperwork in a cursory manner. He stated that she was looking only for the transcript, which would have been easily identifiable and distinguishable from Svoboda's legal paperwork. He claimed that she did not examine the content of Svoboda's papers, did not take any notes, and did not make any copies. The supervisor stated that the assistant prosecutor had not gained any information about any of Svoboda's privileged communications. Nevertheless, the state agreed to the appointment of a special prosecutor and withdrew its motion for contempt. Defense counsel agreed to withdraw his motion to remove the assistant prosecutor, and agreed not to relitigate the issue with the special prosecutor. On July 10, 2019, in a written entry, the trial court stated that a special prosecutor would be appointed, and “the parties contemplate and agree that the Sixth Amendment claims and discovery issues which underlied the above motions will not be relitigated.” Two months later, on September 11, 2019, Svoboda filed a motion to dismiss the indictments on the grounds that the assistant prosecutor's search of his legal paperwork violated his Sixth Amendment rights. The state did not file a motion in opposition. The court denied the motion. A special prosecutor from Warren County was appointed to try the case. The special prosecutor told the court, “I know nothing about anything that was recovered from the Defendant's jail cell. Nothing has been provided to me, from any of the information and the stuff that I had received in this case, that came from the Defendant's jail cell. To me, it was as if the Defendant's jail cell was never searched because there is nothing in our file that would indicate [sic]. In fact, everything that I have is stuff that pertains prior to that.”"}

He complains that the purpose of this testimony was to portray him as a bad father unable to provide for his family. He cites the prosecutor's statement in closing argument: “[Svoboda] wants you to believe that he had absolute love and affection for, this child that he left in a house for sheriff's deputies to show up and escort her out as they were being evicted because of his decision making.”\n\nSvoboda did not object to A.S.’s testimony. Therefore, we review only for plain error. See State v. Smith, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-190507, 2020-Ohio-4976, 2020 WL 6158467, ¶ 81. To prevail on a claim that the trial court committed plain error, Svoboda must show that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was obvious, and (3) it affected the outcome of the trial. See id.\n\n“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.” State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, ¶ 21, quoting Evid.R. 404(B). But other-acts evidence is admissible for “other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” (Emphasis deleted.) Hartman at ¶ 22, quoting Evid.R. 404(B).\n\nThe state argues that the eviction served as an important temporal landmark in the family history, which helped A.S. identify when specific instances of abuse occurred. This could be a proper basis upon which to admit the testimony, but the state's assertion is undercut by the prosecutor's statement during closing argument where he inferred that Svoboda's actions belied his claims that he loved A.S. and would never sexually abuse her.\n\nBut even if we were to find A.S.’s testimony to be bad-acts evidence, its admission was not obvious error that affected the outcome of the trial. Svoboda was accused of repeatedly raping his stepdaughter for ten years. Evidence that he was irresponsible or reckless with his money was not so prejudicial as to rise to the level of plain error.\n\nSvoboda also points to A.W.’s testimony that A.S. had developed a physical reaction (a “tick”) in response to hearing Svoboda's name as further evidence that the state sought to convict Svoboda on the basis that he was a bad father. However, this testimony has nothing to do with other-acts evidence. The eighth assignment of error is overruled."}

DeMarco, 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\nVoir Dire\n\n¶ 12 Appellant makes two arguments under this first assignment of error. In the first he argues the trial court improperly permitted the state to present factual elements of its case during voir dire over his counsel's objection. We disagree.\n\n¶ 13 Because the scope of voir dire lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, we review Appellant's argument for an abuse of discretion. State v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, ¶ 28. In order to find an abuse of discretion, we must determine the trial court's decision was unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983).\n\n¶ 14 \"The scope of voir dire * * * varies depending on the circumstances of each case.\" State v. Bedford, 39 Ohio St.3d 122, 129, 529 N.E.2d 913 (1988). A prosecutor has a right to give an overview of the facts of the case and of those involved in order to ascertain whether prospective jurors know anything about the offense. State v. Tyler, 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 32, 553 N.E.2d 576 (1990). While jurors must be impartial, they need not be completely ignorant of the facts and issues involved in a case to be qualified as jurors.\nState v. Gross, 97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, ¶ 38. \"The purpose of voir dire is not to establish how a juror will vote on the case to be tried; it is to discover whether any juror has a bias that would prevent him or her from individually weighing the facts of the case.\" State v. Madison, 160 Ohio St.3d 232, 2020-Ohio-3735, 155 N.E.2d 867, ¶ 24.\n\n¶ 15 In support of his argument that the trial court erred in permitting the state to present factual evidence of its case during voir dire over his counsel's objection, Appellant directs us to pages 128-137 of the transcript. Within these pages the prosecutor asked the prospective jurors where they believed sexual assaults occurred and instances they could think of where there would be no evidence of a sexual assault. Transcript of Trial (T.) 128-130. One prospective juror answered there may not be physical evidence if there had been a passage of time. T. 130. The prosecutor responded \"[t]hat is something that is called delayed reporting.\" He then asked if any of the prospective jurors were familiar with the term. T.131. Counsel for Appellant objected.\n\n¶ 16 At a side bar counsel for Appellant argued the prosecutor was \"starting to put into play facts not in evidence and we're trying to condition the jury on the case facts.\" T. 132. In response the prosecutor pointed out he had not referred to any victims and that whether or not jurors could accept the idea that sexual assault cases can be proven without physical evidence and whether they were open to the idea of delayed reporting was central to whether a potential juror in this matter could fairly weigh the evidence. T. 131. The trial court overruled Appellants objection but cautioned the prosecutor: \"* * *make sure you stay really narrow with regard to this line of questioning.\" T. 133. The\nprosecutor continued his voir dire and counsel for Appellant raised no further objection. T. 133-137.\n\n¶ 17 Appellant argues that after the trial court overruled his objection, the prosecutor went on to explain the science behind delayed reporting and polled jurors on the same. But the record simply does not support Appellant's allegations. Rather, the record reflects the prosecutor asked if jurors would immediately discount the testimony of a child who did not report their abuse right away and further asked if jurors would be willing to listen to an expert explain why there may not be physical signs of trauma as a result of sexual assault. T. 134-137.\n\n¶ 18 Upon review of the record, we find the state's questioning of the venire was narrowly tailored to determine whether any potential jurors harbored any bias which would make them ill-suited to determine this particular matter. Based on the circumstances of this case, the trial court's decision to overrule Appellant's objection was not error. We therefore reject Appellant's arguments pertaining to voir dire.\n\nHearsay\n\n¶ 19 Appellant next argues the trial court erred in permitting hearsay testimony from J.M. the mother of V.1 and V.2. We disagree.\n\n¶ 20 The admission or exclusion of evidence rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Sage, 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 180, 510 N.E.2d 343 (1987). As a general rule, all relevant evidence is admissible. Evid.R. 402; cf. Evid.R. 802. We therefore review this issue for an abuse of discretion.\n¶ 21} Hearsay is \"a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Evid.R. 801(C).\n\n¶ 22} Appellant directs us to pages 425 and 426 of the transcript wherein the state was conducting direct examination of J.M., mother of the victims. The relevant portion reads:\n\n[The State]: Going back to August of 2017, do you remember a conversation you had with your daughter [V.1]?\n\n[J.M]: Yes\n\n[The State]: * * * And what was that conversation about?\n\n[Counsel for Appellant] Objection; hearsay Your Honor.\n\n[The State]: Your Honor, it goes to - -\n\n[The Court]: Overruled. Go Ahead.\n\n[The State]: What was that conversation about?\n\n[J.M.]: She said [Appellant] raped and molested her.\n\n[The State]: All right. Based on that conversation what did you do?\n\n[J.M.]: I called the sheriff's department.\n\n¶ 23} Appellant further directs our attention to page 428 of the transcript. At this point the state's direct examination of J.M. focused on the fact she is a recovering drug addict and that her drug abuse had impacted her ability to properly parent her children:\n[The State]: Taking drugs, did that have an impact on your ability to be a good mother?\n\n[J.M]: Yes it did.\n\n[The State]: did you place yourself in front of your children?\n\n[J.M]: Do I? Yes.\n\n[The State]: Did you then?\n\n[J.M.]: No.\n\n[The State]: * * * Did you put yourself - - your needs in front of your children's needs?\n\n[J.M.]: Oh, yes.\n\n[The State]: And do you remember a time when [V.1] talked to you about something that was going on with [Appellant]?\n\n[Counsel for Appellant]: Objection, Your Honor. It's hearsay.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Court: Stop.\n\n[Counsel for Appellant]: There's no foundation.\n\nThe Court: Overruled.\n\n[The State]: Do you remember a time when you were on drugs [V.1.] talking to you about something going on with defendant?\n\n[J.M.]: I know she did. I don't remember the details.\n\n[The State]: Okay. Do you remember the nature of what she told you was going on?\n\n[J.M]: I remember she used the word rape.\n[The State]: Okay. Did you report it?\n\n[J.M.]: No.\n\n[The State]: Did you believe her?\n\n[J.M.]: No.\n\n[The State]: When you were told this time, what did you do?\n\n[J.M.]: I contacted law enforcement.\n\n[The State]: And did you make arrangements for your girls to go to Children's Hospital?\n\n[J.M.]: I did.\n\n{¶ 24} T. 427-429.\n\n{¶ 25} Appellee argues this testimony was not hearsay because it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. We agree. The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that if a statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, it is not prohibited by the hearsay rule and will be admissible, subject to the standards governing relevancy and undue prejudice. State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 196, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 262-263, 473 N.E.2d 768 (1984). Thus \"'testimony which explains the actions of a witness to whom a statement was directed, such as to explain the witness' activities, is not hearsay.'\" Id., quoting Maurer at 262.\n\n{¶ 26} Here, J.M.'s testimony in the first instance was limited to a single statement made by V.1 to explain why J.M. involved law enforcement. In the second instance J.M.'s testimony explained why she initially did nothing about the ongoing abuse. Each statement, therefore, was elicited to explain J.M's actions.\n¶ 27 In factually similar cases, such testimony was not hearsay. *State v. Hoseclaw*, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-12-31, 2013-Ohio-3486 ¶ 48 (\"The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the witness to testify concerning the victim’s statement that she was raped since it was offered not for its truth but to show why the witness reported the rape to the victim’s mother, which the mother, then, reported to law enforcement.\"). *State v. Dunn*, 9th Dist. No. 04CA008549, 2005-Ohio-1270, ¶ 17, *State v. Thomas*, 61 Ohio St.3d 223, 232, 400 N.E.2d 401 (1980) (\"It is well established that extrajudicial statements made by an out-of-court declarant are properly admissible to explain the actions of a witness to whom the statement was directed\").\n\n¶ 28 Moreover, even if that were not true, J.M.’s testimony was cumulative to that of V.1 making its admission harmless error. T. 452-453, 458. \"[T]he erroneous admission or exclusion of hearsay, cumulative to properly admitted testimony, constitutes harmless error.\" *State v. Hogg*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 11AP-50, 2011-Ohio-6454, ¶ 46.\n\n¶ 29 Appellant’s complaints regarding both voir dire and the admission of hearsay evidence are without merit. Since we do not find multiple instances of harmless error, the doctrine of cumulative error is inapplicable. The first assignment of error is overruled."}

The granting or denial of a motion in limine is a tentative, interlocutory,\nprecautionary ruling reflecting the trial court's anticipatory treatment of an evidentiary issue. *State v. Grubb*, 28 Ohio St.3d 199, 201, 503 N.E.2d 142 (1986). A motion in limine does not preserve an issue for appeal. *Id.* Rather, in order to preserve the error, the evidence must be presented at trial, and a proper objection lodged. *Id.* paragraph two of the syllabus (1986). Once properly preserved an appellate court will then review the trial court's ruling on the objection rather than the ruling on the motion in limine. See *Wray v. Herrell*, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 93CA08, 1994 WL 64293.\n\n{¶ 32} In his reply brief, Appellant cites five instances wherein the state referred to V.1 and V.2 as \"victims.\" Our examination of the record reveals Appellant did not lodge an objection in any of these five instances. We further note four of these instances occurred during closing argument. Transcript of Trial, Volume III (T. III), 621, 624-625, 632, 651-652. Even if Appellant had objected there would be no error because in closing argument a prosecutor may comment freely on \"what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.\" *State v. Lott*, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990), quoting *State v. Stephens*, 24 Ohio St.2d 76, 82, 263 N.E.2d 773 (1970). Referring to the child victims as such in closing argument would therefore not be improper.\n\n{¶ 33} The remaining transcript reference cites to a single instance during trial wherein the prosecutor referred to the V.1 as \"victim.\" This instance occurred during the direct testimony of Katharine Doughty, a pediatric nurse practitioner who examined the children following their disclosure of sexual abuse by Appellant. Again, even if Appellant had objected to this use of the word \"victim\" we would find no prejudicial error as this was one isolated incident which took place during a three-day trial.\nFinally, in his February 2020 Motion in Limine Regarding the Term Victim as well as here on appeal, Appellant relies on State v. Almedom, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-852, 2016-Ohio-1553 to support his argument that the trial court should have prohibited the prosecutor from using the term \"victim\" with respect to V.1 and V.2. In Almedom, however, most of the offending references were made by the trial court judge, not the prosecutor. Additionally, the improper references were made throughout the entire trial. The Almedom court also found that defense counsel's ineffective assistance, linked with the trial court's and prosecutor's prejudicial comments, \"undermined the proper function of the adversarial process\" so that it could not \"be sure a just result was produced.\" Id. at ¶10. The instant matter presents no comparable facts.\n\nAppellant failed to preserve this argument for review and even if he had, it would be without merit. The final assignment of error is overruled."}

Although Sipple raised multiple arguments in his motion to suppress, on appeal he only argues that any statements made during the December 2016 incident were not relevant to his prosecution for unauthorized use, or that the probative value of such evidence was outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice. Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. State v. Castagnola, 145 Ohio St.3d 1, 2015-Ohio-1565, ¶ 32, citing State v. Burnside, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, ¶ 8. An appellate court must accept the trial court's findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. Burnside at ¶ 8. \"Accepting these facts as true, the appellate court must then independently determine, without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.\" Id. In this case, the trial court orally denied the motion to suppress after the hearing and did not enter written findings of fact. Sipple argues any statements to Officer Stock during the December 2016 incident were not relevant to his prosecution for unauthorized use of a computer. Generally, relevant evidence is admissible, except where excluded by the federal or state constitutions, statute, or rule. Evid.R. 402. Relevant evidence is \"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Evid.R. 401. Sipple was charged with unauthorized use of a computer, in violation of R.C. 2913.04. As relevant to this case, that statute prohibits knowingly gaining access to a computer or computer system without the consent of the owner of the computer or computer system. Officer Stock testified Sipple stated he deleted records from the slate room computer and was intoxicated when he did it. If true, this statement would constitute an admission of having accessed the slate room computer, which is a fact of consequence to determining whether Sipple committed the charged offense. Thus, evidence regarding Sipple's statements during the December 2016 incident was relevant to the present case. Sipple further argues that even if the statements were relevant, they should have been suppressed due to the risk of undue prejudice. Relevant evidence \"is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\" Evid.R. 403(A). Sipple appears to argue there was a risk of undue prejudice because the statements were alleged to have been made while he was in a police cruiser. Exclusion of relevant evidence due to undue prejudice involves more than mere prejudice, because anything adverse to a party's case could be deemed prejudicial to that party. State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, ¶ 8. \"Unfair prejudice is that quality of evidence which might result in an improper basis for a jury decision. Consequently, if the evidence arouses the jury's emotional sympathies, evokes a sense of horror, or appeals to an instinct to punish, the evidence may be unfairly prejudicial.\" Id. at ¶ 24, quoting Oberlin v. Akron Gen. Med. Ctr., 91 Ohio St.3d 169, 172 (2001). A review of the trial transcript indicates Officer Stock did not testify on direct examination that Sipple's statements during the December 2016 incident occurred while Sipple was in a police cruiser. To the extent the jury became aware that this conversation occurred while Sipple was in a police cruiser, that fact was raised by Sipple's trial counsel in the course of cross-examining Officer Stock in impeaching his credibility based on the fact that no recording of the conversation from the cruiser's dash camera was preserved. Moreover, there was no testimony suggesting to the jury that Sipple was arrested or charged with any crime as a result of the December 2016 incident. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude this was the type of evidence that would arouse the jury's sympathies, evoke a sense of horror, or appeal to the jury's instinct to punish Sipple, and the trial court did not err by failing to exclude the evidence based on the risk of undue prejudice."}
{"index": "090-Sipple", "allegation_num": "allegation_2", "allegation": "The trial court erred in denying Defendant-Appellant's motion to declare a mistrial.", "extracted_text": "Sipple asserts the trial court erred by denying a mistrial. As noted above, Sipple's trial counsel moved for a mistrial after the prosecutor asked Officer Ortega whether he was familiar with Sipple, and the trial court denied that motion. Sipple does not contest that denial on appeal. Rather, Sipple argues the trial court should have granted a mistrial based on a comment made by the prosecutor in closing argument. Sipple cites the following comment by the prosecutor and the sidebar exchange that followed:\n\n[Prosecutor]: And the defendant happened to testify, so you have to use that same metric when you think about his testimony. You heard that he had just graduated and gotten his CPA. He was going to be sitting for the CPA license. His job and his future were on the line, and along comes another OVI arrest, another charge on his record, or something on his record.\n\n[Sipple's trial counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.\n\n[Prosecutor]: Strike that, Your Honor.\n\nThe Court: Can you approach?\n\n(Tr. Vol. II at 360.) The trial court then conducted a sidebar discussion with counsel:\n\n[Sipple's trial counsel]: Again, Your Honor, same objection I keep making. I understand that in the heat of the moment we say things we are not supposed to say, but I don't know what else to do. I just think it is improper. I don't think it is intentional, but I think it is improper. It is another comment on his record.\n\nThe Court: Uh-huh.\n\n[Sipple's trial counsel]: And it is not in evidence.\n\nThe Court: Closing arguments are not evidence, and I will reread that again. Don't bring it up anymore.\n\n[Prosecutor]: That was unintentional.\n\nThe Court: Motion for mistrial denied.\n\n[Sipple's trial counsel]: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n(Tr. Vol. II at 360-61.)

The state contends that “there is ample evidence to support a rational trier of fact’s decision that penetration occurred.”\n\nIn State v. Falkenstein, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 83316, 2004-Ohio 2561, ¶ 16, this court held that “evidence of slight penetration, entering the vulva or labia, is sufficient to support a rape conviction.” The Falkenstein Court further held that “there was sufficient evidence that could lead a rational trier of fact to conclude that appellant penetrated the victim by placing his penis on the outside of the victim’s vagina.” Id.\n\nC.H. testified that she was asleep and woke up to Roan penetrating her with his penis while lying on top of her. Ohio courts have consistently held that a victim’s testimony alone is sufficient to support a rape conviction. State v. Blankenship, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 77900, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 5520, 11 (Dec. 13, 2001). “[T]estimony, if believed, is sufficient to prove each element of the offense of rape. There is no requirement that a rape victim’s testimony be corroborated precedent to conviction.” (Citation omitted.) Id. Furthermore, this court has held that “sleep constitutes a mental or physical condition that substantially impairs a person from resisting or consenting to sexual conduct.”\nState v. Clark, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90148, 2008-Ohio-3358, ¶ 21. Thus, C.H.’s testimony alone can provide sufficient evidence of substantial impairment rape pursuant to R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c). While Roan’s testimony contradicts C.H.’s testimony that this event occurred, when reviewing whether a conviction is supported by sufficient evidence, we look to whether the state presented sufficient evidence, not whether that evidence was rebutted by the defense. Thus, upon review of the state’s evidence, namely C.H.’s testimony that Roan penetrated her vagina while she was sleeping, we find sufficient evidence to convict Roan of substantial impairment rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c).\n\nTurning to the rapes in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), Roan argues that there was insufficient evidence of force or threat of force. Force is defined in R.C. 2901.01(A)(1) as “any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.”\n\nC.H. testified that she “was describing [Roan] forcing his penis inside me” when she woke up the first time. According to C.H., she pushed Roan off of her and jumped out of bed. As to the next count of rape, C.H. testified that Roan digitally penetrated her vagina. According to C.H., she did not move other than to “try to squeeze my legs closed and cross them.” C.H. testified as follows about what happened next:\n\nBut he does — his fingers do go inside of me. * * * At that point, I kind of realized the only way that this is going to end and I can go home is if he gets what he wants at that point, because then I realized he’s completely naked. * * * I was just still, and I was trying to cross my legs and hope that the body language would make him realize that this isn’t\nwhat I want. * * * I just remember just wanting to leave, just being —\nwiggling and just uncomfortable.\n\nOhio courts have held that force may be established when the victim\ntestifies that she resisted the defendant during the rape. See State v. Zimpfer, 2d\nDist. Montgomery No. 26062, 2014-Ohio-4401, ¶ 48; State v. Miller, 9th Dist.\nSummit No. 27048, 2015-Ohio-279, ¶ 37.\n\nAdditionally, this court has held the following regarding forcible\nrape: “Force need not be overt and physically brutal, but can be subtle and\npsychological. As long as it can be shown that the rape victim’s will was overcome\nby fear or duress, the forcible element of rape can be established.” State v. Fowler,\n27 Ohio App.3d 149, 154, 500 N.E.2d 390 (8th Dist.1985).\n\nHere, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, C.H.’s testimony was sufficient to support Roan’s convictions for rape,\nand his first assigned error is overruled."}

While Roan’s testimony contradicts C.H.’s testimony that this event occurred, when reviewing whether a conviction is supported by sufficient evidence, we look to whether the state presented sufficient evidence, not whether that evidence was rebutted by the defense.

We disagree.\na. Standard of Review\n\nOur standard of review is set forth in Strickland v. Washington (1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed. 674. Ohio adopted this standard in the case of State v. Bradley (1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373. These cases require a two-pronged analysis in reviewing a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. First, we must determine whether counsel’s assistance was ineffective; whether counsel’s performance\nfell below an objective standard of reasonable representation and was violative of any of his essential duties to the client. If we find ineffective assistance of counsel, we must then determine whether or not the defense was actually prejudiced by counsel’s ineffectiveness such that the reliability of the outcome of the trial is suspect. This requires a showing there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional error, the outcome of the trial would have been different. *Id.*\n\n**¶26** Trial counsel is entitled to a strong presumption that all decisions fall within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. *State v. Sallie* (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 673, 675, 693 N.E.2d 267. In addition, the United States Supreme Court and the Ohio Supreme Court have held a reviewing court “need not determine whether counsel’s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies. *Bradley* at 143, 538 N.E.2d 373, quoting *Strickland* at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Even debatable trial tactics and strategies do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Clayton*, 62 Ohio St.3d 45, 402 N.E.2d 1189 (1980). Counsel’s decision to challenge or exclude a juror is typically attributed to trial strategy. *State v. Mundt*, 115 Ohio St.3d 22, 2007-Ohio-4836, 873 N.E.2d 828, ¶64.\n\n**b. Failure to strike a biased juror**\n\n**¶27** In order to demonstrate that Appellant’s trial counsel’s performance was objectively unreasonable in light of counsel’s failure to strike a juror, Appellant “*must* show that [a] juror was *actually biased* against him.” (Emphasis added in *Mundt.*) *Mundt*, at ¶67, quoting *Miller v. Francis*, 269 F.3d 609, 616 (6th Cir.2001). “Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’-the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference that the person will not act with entire impartiality.” *United States v. Torres*, 128 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir.1997), citing\nUnited States v. Wood, 299 U.S. 123, 133, 57 S.Ct. 177, 81 L.Ed. 78 (1936). Therefore, Appellant must prove that the juror, because of the juror’s partiality or biases, was not “capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence” before that juror. Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 217, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982).\n\n¶28 Actual bias can be found from either a juror’s express admission or from circumstantial evidence of the juror’s biased attitudes. Hughes v. United States, 258 F.3d 453, 459 (6th Cir.2001). In other instances, courts have found actual bias when a juror unequivocally states he or she cannot be fair due to a law-enforcement bias, id at 459-460, when a juror’s opinion of the defendant’s guilt based on pretrial publicity was fixed, Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 727-728, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961), or when a juror’s expressed views on the death penalty would “prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties,” Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 728, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992), quoting Adams v. Texas, 448 U.S. 38, 45, 100 S.Ct. 2521, 65 L.Ed.2d 581 (1980).\n\n¶29 In the case sub judice, juror No. 34 stated he had previously been charged with disorderly conduct while intoxicated and criminal damaging property a few months before the trial. When asked by the trial court, juror No. 34 indicated that he had been treated fairly and that he bore no ill will towards the police. Juror No. 34 went on to explain to the court that he wore a Thin Blue Line sweatshirt, showing support for law enforcement, to court. The trial court then asked if he bore ill will toward either side. The Juror answered in the negative. The trial court then followed up asking juror No. 34 if he could remain fair and impartial, given the incident with police. He indicated he would be able to be fair and impartial.\nDefense counsel did have a peremptory challenge, and failed to strike juror No. 34.\n\nThis Court has previously held that “‘[few decisions at trial are as subjective or prone to individual attorney strategy as juror voir dire, where decisions are often made on the basis of intangible factors.’” State v. Dixon, 5th Dist Muskingum No. CT2013-0055, 2014-Ohio-4235, ¶82, citing Miller 269 F.3d at 620. In summary, even though juror No. 34 pointed out to the court he was wearing a Thin Blue Line sweatshirt, he had also previously been charged with disorderly conduct while intoxicated, and he also indicated he could be impartial. Therefore, we conclude counsel’s seating of juror No. 34 did not fall below an objective standard of reasonable representation."}

The term abuse of discretion implies that the court’s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157 (1980). An abuse of discretion involves views or actions \"that no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken.\" State v.

Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 267 (1984).\n\n{¶ 25} As noted above, in this case, counsel for appellant moved for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument. In the context of closing arguments, the test for prosecutorial misconduct is \"whether 'the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.' \" State v. Fudge, 10th Dist. No. 16AP-821, 2018-Ohio-601, ¶ 48, quoting State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 (1984). In determining whether allegedly improper remarks resulted in prejudice to the defendant, a reviewing court must consider \"'(1) the nature of the remarks, (2) whether an objection was made by counsel, (3) whether corrective instructions were given by the court, and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendant.' \" (Further quotations and citations omitted.) Id. at ¶ 47, quoting Aleshire at ¶ 42. Furthermore, because isolated instances of prosecutorial misconduct are deemed harmless, \"'the closing argument must be viewed in its entirety to determine whether the defendant has been prejudiced.' \" Id. at ¶ 48, quoting State v. Muhleka, 2d Dist. No. 19827, 2004-Ohio-1822, at ¶ 85, quoting State v. Stevens, 2d Dist.

Id., quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, citing State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165 (1990). The prosecutor is likewise free to \"state his or her opinion if it is based on the evidence presented at trial.\" State v.

Thompson, 3d Dist. No. 7-16-10, 2017-Ohio-792, ¶ 26, citing Pang v. Minch, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 187 (1990).\n\n¶ 29 In this case, as noted previously, after the jury had retired to commence deliberations, defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor's alleged misconduct during closing arguments. Defense counsel specifically averred:\n\nYour Honor, I try to be restrained during closing arguments, but particularly when counsel in rebuttal makes statements, it becomes even more difficult. But I would note my objection and even move for a mistrial based upon comments that were made on rebuttal. First of all, one comment was made to the jurors that they, too, should be outraged. And that was made in response to or during her explanation about the community standards. But that's an invitation for this jury to decide this case based upon emotion and not the facts or the law in this case, which specifically they are told not to do. Another objection I have is several times in her argument she stated that it doesn't matter that Hanna injected herself. Well, so she is asking the jury to again ignore the evidence. The jurors' responsibility is to consider all of the evidence and the fact that that particular comment or the other point of my presentation that it is not in the jury instructions is still relevant to their deliberations, both in terms of evaluating the evidence and specifically in weighing whether or not the death was the proximate cause of my client's conduct versus that of Hanna's conduct. So for those reasons, we make our objections and we would make our motion.\n\n(Tr. at 451-52.)\nAfter listening to arguments from both the prosecutor and defense counsel, the trial court denied the motion for a mistrial, stating:\n\nI instructed the jury prior to taking evidence and during my instructions that closing statements of counsel are not evidence and should not be considered by them as evidence. I will deny your motion for a mistrial. I will note your objection.\n\n(Tr. at 453.)\n\nA review of the record reveals that during rebuttal closing arguments, the prosecutor stated to the jury, \"[d]isturbing photographs, I hope they are disturbing to you. They should be disturbing to you. They should be disturbing and y'all should be outraged.\" (Tr. at 436.) Defense counsel did not object to the foregoing remarks at the time they were made.\n\nThe prosecutor also stated to the jury, \"[t]he Judge has given you all of the law on these jury instructions. Right? That is the law that you've got to follow. And not one place in here will you find if Hanna Geiger, the victim, injected herself or because she wanted the drugs, that that means he is not culpable. You won't find that in here.\" (Tr. at 439.) Defense counsel lodged a general objection to the foregoing statement, but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 439.)\n\nThe prosecutor continued rebuttal closing arguments and informed the jury, \"[a]gain, I never once said that she didn't inject herself. And you know, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day it doesn't matter if she injected it, smoked it, ate it. He still provided that cocaine to her.\" (Tr. at 443.) Defense counsel made no objection to the foregoing remarks at the time the prosecutor made them.\n\nThe prosecutor also stated to the jury, \"[y]ou are here to judge the facts and determine whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, Andrew Nichols -- not Hanna Geiger. She's not on trial here. She is the victim in this case.\" (Tr. at 444.) Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor's use of the word \"victim,\" but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 444.)\n\n---\n\n6 It is unclear from the transcript to which part or parts of the statement counsel was specifically objecting; however, appellant stated in his appellate brief that the objection was premised on the use of the word \"victim\" in describing Hanna Geiger.\nContinuing rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor informed the jury, \"[y]ou have to decide this case. You follow the law, and it is did we prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt. I submit to you we did. And now he just wants to blame the victim, Hanna.\" (Tr. at 446.) Defense counsel again objected to the use of the word \"victim\" by the prosecutor, but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 446-47.)\n\nUpon consideration, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant appellant's motion for mistrial premised on the foregoing remarks made by the prosecutor during rebuttal closing argument. First, regarding appellant's contention that the prosecutor improperly invited the jury to decide the case based on emotion rather than the facts of the case or the applicable law by stating to the jurors that they should be \"outraged\" by what they saw in the photographs presented at trial, we reiterate that defense counsel made no objection to this remark at the time it was made. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error on this point. Fudge at ¶ 49.\n\nFurthermore, we find no improper conduct on the part of the prosecutor in commenting that the jurors should be outraged in viewing the photographs. This is so, because \"outrage\" is an element of the offense of gross abuse of a corpse,7 one of the counts with which appellant had been charged. When this comment is viewed in context with the indictment, the jury instructions, and the prosecutor's earlier closing argument on this point (Tr. at 409-11), it is apparent that the comment was meant to reference the element of outrage included in the offense. (Tr. at 409-11.) As the prosecutor had to prove this element, it was not improper to urge the jury that they should be outraged by the photographs they viewed because the photographs were direct evidence of the treatment of Hanna Geiger's body by appellant. Put another way, this remark by the prosecutor was an entirely fair one because it was based on \"'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.'\" (Further citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48, quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, quoting Lott at 165. The jurors would have understood the prosecutor's comment in this context and they would not have taken the prosecutor's comment to be an invitation to abandon their responsibility to decide the case based on the law and the facts and instead improperly decide the case based on emotion. There was no\n\n---\n\n7 R.C. 2927.01(B) provides that \"[n]o person, except as authorized by law, shall treat a human corpse in a way that would outrage reasonable community sensibilities.\"\nmisconduct on the part of the prosecutor in urging the jurors to be outraged by the photographs of Hanna's body, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis.\n\n¶ 38 Next, we turn to appellant's complaint that the prosecutor improperly used the word \"victim\" to describe Hanna Geiger three times during rebuttal closing argument. As set forth above, defense counsel lodged an objection each time the prosecutor referred to Hanna Geiger as a victim, and the trial court overruled each objection. In support of appellant's argument that the prosecutor's use of the term \"victim\" during closing argument substantially affected the jurors' impartiality in evaluating the evidence to the prejudice of appellant, he cites to State v. Almedom, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-852, 2016-Ohio-1553, in which this court determined, sua sponte, that defense counsel in that case had been ineffective by failing to object to repeated references made by the trial judge to the child witnesses as \"victims.\"\n\n¶ 39 We find Almedom readily distinguishable from the instant matter. First and foremost, in Almedom, the offending references to the witnesses as \"victims\" were made by the trial judge, not the prosecutor. While a trial judge must remain detached and neutral in any matter before the court, the prosecutor is not constrained by any such obligation of neutrality. State v. Harper, 10th Dist. No. 01-AP-201, 2001-Ohio-8875. Secondly, in Almedom, the improper references were made throughout the entire trial. Here, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a \"victim\" were made only during rebuttal closing argument. As discussed above, during closing argument, the prosecutor is free to comment on \"what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.\" (Internal quotations and citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48. In our view, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a \"victim\" entailed fair comment on what the evidence had shown and were not improper. Thus, there was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in referring to Hanna Geiger as a victim, and there was no error on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis.\n\n¶ 40 Finally, we address appellant's contention that, in referencing the court's instructions to the jury, the prosecutor improperly asked the jury to disregard evidence by stating it did not matter that Hanna Geiger injected herself with the cocaine for purposes of determining whether appellant was culpable in Hanna's death. We reiterate that defense\ncounsel made no objection to this remark at the time it was made. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error on this issue. *Fudge* at ¶ 49.\n\n¶ 41 Furthermore, we do not agree that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by asserting that for purposes of determining appellant’s culpability in Hanna Geiger’s death, whether Hanna injected the narcotics herself was of no import. Instead, we find the prosecutor was appropriately arguing the legal insignificance of this evidence as it pertained to the jury’s consideration of the involuntary manslaughter charge. This is so because pursuant to the court’s instructions, appellant was culpable in Hanna’s death if the jury found that appellant provided Hanna with the cocaine. Put another way, the fact that Hanna injected herself would not negate appellant’s culpability. Indeed, the prosecutor conceded that Hanna injected herself in explaining why this fact did not negate appellant’s culpability or provide a legal defense to the charge of involuntary manslaughter. (Tr. at 439, 443.) In short, Hanna’s act of self-injection “would not change the basic fact that the victim took the drugs furnished by [the defendant] and died as a result.” *State v. Price*, 8th Dist. No. 107096, 2019-Ohio-1642, ¶ 89. The prosecutor did not improperly tell the jury that it did not matter if Hanna injected herself, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis.\n\n¶ 42 Moreover, in considering all of appellants’ assertions of alleged prosecutorial misconduct during rebuttal closing argument, we observe the trial court instructed the jury “[t]he evidence does not include the indictment or opening statements or closing arguments of counsel. The opening statements and closing arguments of counsel are designed to assist you. They are not evidence.” (Jury Instr. at 2.) Thus, we presume that the jurors followed these instructions and the verdict was not based on the content of the closing arguments. *Fudge* at ¶ 52, citing at ¶ 26, citing *Pang* at 187.\n\n¶ 43 In short, appellant has failed to establish any prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments which resulted in appellant being deprived of a fair trial.

This statement also included a reference to Hanna being a “victim,” and appellant stated in his appellate brief that the objection was premised on the use of the word “victim” in describing Hanna Geiger.\nmistrial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct, and appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled."}

R.C. 2903.04 provides, in relevant part:\n\n(A) No person shall cause the death of another or the unlawful termination of another's pregnancy as a proximate result of the offender's committing or attempting to commit a felony.\n\n* * *\n\n(C) Whoever violates this section is guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Violation of division (A) of this section is a felony of the first degree.\nIn State v. Losey, 23 Ohio App.3d 93, 95 (10th Dist.1985), construing former R.C. 2903.04, this court stated that for purposes of determining culpability for involuntary manslaughter, \"'proximate result' bears a resemblance to the concept of 'proximate cause' in that defendant will be held responsible for those foreseeable consequences which are known to be, or should be known to be, within the scope of the risk created by his conduct.\" Id. at 95. Further, \"[i]t is not necessary that the accused be in a position to foresee the precise consequence of his conduct; only that the consequence be foreseeable in the sense that what actually transpired was natural and logical in that it was within the scope of the risk created by his conduct.\" Id. at 96. Thus, the issue of whether the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that appellant's acts were the proximate cause of Hanna Geiger's death is resolved by whether Hanna Geiger's death reasonably could be anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result based upon the facts and circumstances of this case. State v. Platt, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1148, 2005-Ohio-705, ¶ 33.\n\nAppellant argues that Hanna's death was not within the foreseeable scope of risk created by his conduct when he provided her with the cocaine because he did not administer the cocaine to her; he did not mix the shot for her; and he \"had no prior knowledge as to whether or not the decedent consumed a large mixture of drugs and was inebriated prior to the consumption of the cocaine.\" (Appellant's Brief at 27.) Notably, the latter assertion is wholly belied by appellant's own admission during his interview that Hanna did not appear to be sober, appeared to be high when she arrived at the home the night she died, and had told him she had been smoking crack since she left the hospital. (Tr. at 342-43.)\n\nEven if appellant had not known she was high upon arrival, however, Hanna's overdose death was within the foreseeable scope of risk created by appellant's act of giving her the cocaine. We observe that over the past decade, Ohio courts have widely acknowledged that the possibility of an overdose death is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of providing a controlled substance to another person. See, e.g., State v. Sabo, 3d Dist. No. 14-09-33, 2010-Ohio-1261; State v. Vogt, 4th Dist. No. 17CA17, 2018-Ohio-4457; State v. Veley, 6th Dist. No. L-16-1038, 2017-Ohio-9064, ¶ 25 (finding death need not be actually envisioned to be foreseeable); State v. Wells, 12th Dist. No. CA2016-02-009, 2017-Ohio-420, ¶ 39 (finding \"[t]here is nothing extraordinary or surprising about the\nmanner of [decedent's] death in relation to appellant's actions. Appellant provided drugs to a known drug abuser. The possibility of an overdose is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of providing a controlled substance to another”). Upon consideration, we find we are of like mind.\n\n{¶ 52} Furthermore, although in his brief appellant specifically attempts to distinguish Sabo from the facts of this case, the attempt wholly fails as the facts of the cases bear much more in resemblance to each other than in difference. In both cases there was evidence of decedent's inebriated condition, which appellant admitted in this case (Tr. at 342-43); that the decedent and appellant had taken other substances together, which appellant admitted in stating he and Hanna were both smoking the cocaine initially (Tr. at 310); and that the defendant warned the decedent about using the illegal substance, which appellant admitted in stating he told Hanna not to inject the cocaine (Tr. at 311.). Thus, contrary to appellant's argument, under the facts of this case, a rational trier of fact could readily have found that the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant's conduct was the proximate cause of Hanna's death. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that this element of the crime was met. And, because there was no conflicting testimony on this issue for the jury to resolve, appellant's conviction of involuntary manslaughter was not against the manifest weight of the evidence."}

We do not agree.\n\n¶ 55 In reviewing a trial court's determination of whether a defendant's offenses should merge pursuant to R.C. 2941.25, otherwise known as the multiple counts statute, an appellate court conducts its review de novo. Flood at ¶ 25, citing State v. S.S., 10th Dist. No. 13AP-1060, 2014-Ohio-5352, ¶ 28, citing State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 482, 2012-Ohio-5699, ¶ 1. Thus, although we must apply the law to the facts of the individual case\nbefore us in making a legal determination as to whether R.C. 2941.25 allows multiple convictions, \"'[t]hat facts are involved in the analysis does not make the issue a question of fact deserving of deference to a trial court.'\" \" Id., quoting S.S. at ¶ 28, quoting Williams at ¶ 25.\n\n¶ 56 R.C. 2941.25 provides:\n\n(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.\n\n(B) Where the defendant's conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\n\n¶ 57 \"'When the defendant's conduct constitutes a single offense, the defendant may be convicted and punished only for that offense. When the conduct supports more than one offense, however, a court must conduct an analysis of allied offenses of similar import to determine whether the offenses merge or whether the defendant may be convicted of separate offenses.'\" Flood at ¶ 27, quoting State v. Ruff, 143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015-Ohio-995, ¶ 24.\n\n¶ 58 In determining whether two offenses are allied offenses that merge into a single conviction, we \"'must evaluate three separate factors: the conduct, the animus, and the import.'\" Flood at ¶ 28, quoting State v. Harris, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-683, 2016-Ohio-3424, ¶ 42, citing Ruff at paragraph one of the syllabus. \"'If any of the following is true, the offenses cannot merge and the defendant may be convicted and sentenced for multiple offenses: (1) the offenses are dissimilar in import or significance—in other words, each offense caused separate, identifiable harm, (2) the offenses were committed separately, and (3) the offenses were committed with separate animus or motivation.'\" Flood at ¶ 28, quoting Ruff at ¶ 25. \"Ultimately, if the harm resulting from each offense is separate and identifiable, the offenses are of dissimilar import and do not merge.\" Id., citing Harris at ¶ 42, citing Ruff at ¶ 25.\n\n¶ 59 Appellant argues the trial court erred in failing to merge all five offenses for purposes of conviction and sentencing because they all emanate from his conduct of\nacquiring cocaine. This is not so. With respect to the offense of gross abuse of a corpse and the offense of tampering with evidence, the conduct of appellant was wholly separate and distinct both from each other and from the other three offenses. The tampering with evidence charge arose from appellant disposing of Hanna's purse and car. The gross abuse of a corpse charge arose from putting Hanna's body wrapped in trash bags in the basement and leaving it there for over a month after she had died. These acts exist separately and apart from the act of acquiring cocaine and should neither merge with each other nor with any of the other three offenses pursuant to R.C. 2941.25.\n\n¶ 60 With respect to the remaining three offenses of trafficking in drugs, corrupting another with drugs, and involuntary manslaughter, the offenses do not merge because of the dissimilar import of the offenses. As argued by the state, the three offenses clearly escalate in terms of import and the significance of the harm. Trafficking need not involve any harm at all and is a fifth-degree felony. Corrupting another with drugs requires serious harm and is a second-degree felony. Involuntary manslaughter requires death, the most serious harm of all, and is a first-degree felony. The three offenses clearly require differing degrees of harm.\n\n¶ 61 Further, we note that when the trial court conducted its analysis on the merger issue, it specifically addressed why it would not be proper to merge the corrupting another with drugs offense and the involuntary manslaughter offense as requested by appellant. The trial court rightly concluded that the physical harm caused by the corrupting with drugs was not Hanna's death; rather, it was the harm which occurred during the period of time between Hanna's ingestion of the cocaine and her death, which the coroner's expert testified could have been as long as 10 or 15 minutes. (Tr. at 222.) As urged by the state, the different timing of the offenses serves to further solidify the fact that the offenses are dissimilar in import.\n\n¶ 62 In sum, we find the five separate offenses for which appellant was convicted have different import and significance of harm, and the trial court did not err when it determined that none of them should merge for purposes of sentencing. Accordingly, appellant's third assignment of error is overruled."}

Lovasco*, 431 U.S. 783, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977). The Ohio Supreme Court has held that “[a]n unjustifiable delay between the commission of an offense and a defendant’s indictment therefor[e], which results in actual prejudice to the defendant, is a violation of the right to due process of law.”  *State v. Luck*, 15 Ohio St.3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097 (1984), paragraph two of the syllabus.

First, the burden is on the defendant to present evidence of actual prejudice; once a defendant does so, the burden then shifts to the state to produce evidence of a justifiable reason for the delay.  *Id.* at ¶ 13, citing *State v. Whiting*, 84 Ohio St.3d 215, 217, 702 N.E.2d 1199 (1998). “A court must determine whether the defendant has established actual prejudice to his ability to defend himself before independently determining whether the state met its burden of establishing a justifiable reason for the delay in bringing charges.”  *State v.

The “*possibility* that memories will fade, witnesses will become inaccessible, or evidence will be lost is not sufficient to establish actual prejudice.”  (Emphasis\nId. at ¶ 105, citing Marion at 325-326. Those are “the real possibilit[ies] of prejudice inherent in any extended delay,” and statutes of limitations sufficiently protect against them. Marion at 326.

State v. Smith, 87 Ohio St.3d 424, 442, 721 N.E.2d 93 (2000), citing Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d at 14, 470 N.E.2d 883. The touchstone of analysis ‘is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.’ Id., citing Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982).\n\n{¶37} In the instant matter, Lynch takes issue with the prosecutor’s comments about the rape kit examination procedure that M.H. went through at the hospital after disclosing the allegations against Lynch to her mother. During closing arguments, the prosecutor stated, in relevant part,\n\nNow, let’s talk about what happened to [M.H.] as a result of her disclosing what [Lynch] did to her.\n\nWhen she said what he did, when she said what he did, this is what happened to her. She had to go to the hospital. As a 12-year-old girl, she had to have her legs up in stirrups with her knees apart, a speculum inserted into her vagina, swabs stuck five to six centimeters into her vagina, swabbing her vagina, and swabbing her cervix. That’s what happened as a result of [M.H.] telling her mom what [Lynch] did to her.\n\n(Tr. 1284.) The prosecutor continued, ‘[a]t the hospital [M.H.] says who did this to her. Cornelius Lynch. And [Dr. Keith Lim] puts her in the stirrups, and he has her spread her legs. He has to insert a speculum into a child, all things [M.H.] had to endure for telling people what [Lynch] did to her[.]’ (Tr. 1287.)\n\n{¶38} Lynch argues that ‘[t]here was no proper reason, no justification for [the prosecutor’s] gratuitous statements to the jury. [The statements’] purpose, their only purpose, was to inflame, to prejudice, to create sympathy for M.H. And that is an improper purpose.’ Appellant’s brief at 8. We disagree.\n\n{¶39} Initially, we note that defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor’s statements about the rape kit examination procedure. Accordingly, Lynch has waived the issue on appeal except for plain error. Pate, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 95382, 2011-Ohio-1692, at ¶ 21, citing State v. Owens, 51 Ohio App.2d 132, 146, 366 N.E.2d 1367 (9th Dist.1975). Accord State v. Harris, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104329, 2017-Ohio-2751, ¶ 83. Under Crim.R. 52(B), ‘[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.’ Moreover, ‘[p]lain error does not exist unless, but for the error, the outcome at trial would have been different.’ State v. Joseph, 73 Ohio St.3d 450, 455, 653 N.E.2d 285 (1995), citing State v. Moreland, 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 552 N.E.2d 894 (1990).\n\n{¶40} One of the defense’s theories of the case was that M.H. made up the allegations against Lynch because she did not want her mother to marry him. On direct examination, Lynch testified that there was stress and tension in the home, both before and after M.H. alleged that he raped her. He explained that S.P.’s children did not care for him, did not want him in the home, and wanted S.P. to be with their father. During closing arguments, defense counsel stated that when S.P. took M.H. to the hospital, S.P. told the doctors that she was sure that M.H. made up the allegations against Lynch ‘because [her children] want [S.P.] to get back with their natural father[.]’ (Tr. 1304-1305.) Defense counsel further explained that while S.P. was going to marry Lynch, her children did not want him around and wanted him out of the house.\n\n{¶41} After reviewing the record and the purportedly improper remarks in context, we cannot say that prosecution’s comments about the rape kit examination procedure were improper. The prosecutor’s comments about the rape kit examination procedure were made to rebut the defense’s theory that M.H. fabricated the allegations and to support the prosecution’s theory that Lynch did, in fact, rape M.H. Furthermore, the prosecutor’s comments were supported by evidence in the record.\n\n{¶42} M.H. testified that her mother took her to the hospital where an examination was performed ‘[i]n [her] vagina area.’ (Tr. 1066.) Dr. Lim testified that he conducted M.H.’s rape kit examination and he described the procedure in detail. Based on this evidence, the prosecutor reasonably inferred that M.H. would not assent to or endure an invasive rape kit examination if she made up the allegations. The prosecutor’s comments fairly represented the state’s interpretation of the evidence that it presented during trial, and the prosecutor is entitled to latitude to argue the state’s interpretation of the evidence. See State v. Ketterer, 111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, ¶ 172.\n\n{¶43} Finally, the trial court instructed the jury that it must decide the case based on the evidence presented and that ‘closing arguments do not constitute evidence.’ (Tr. 1322.) We presume that the jury heeded the trial court’s instructions. State v. Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, ¶ 157."}

Because there was no manifest necessity for the trial court to grant a mistrial, the constitutional protection against being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense required that the charges against [Lynch] be dismissed.", "extracted_text": "The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, protects a criminal defendant from multiple prosecutions for the same offense. Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 671, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982). The Double Jeopardy Clause does not, however, bar reprosecution in every case. Where a defendant requests a mistrial, double jeopardy does not bar a retrial unless the defendant’s request for a mistrial is precipitated by prosecutorial misconduct intended to provoke a defendant into seeking a mistrial. *N. Olmsted v. Himes*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 84076 and 84078, 2004-Ohio-4241, ¶ 36-37.\n\nIn the instant matter, we initially find no merit to Lynch’s assertion that he explicitly objected to the trial court declaring a mistrial. In fact, the record reflects that defense counsel requested a mistrial after the foreperson informed the trial court about the issues that arose with Juror 7: ‘Your Honor, I would — I think we’re in a position now — with the alternate being excused yesterday, I think we’re in the same position we would be in with a hung jury, and I would request a mistrial.’ (Tr. 518.) Defense counsel reiterated this request while the trial court was polling the individual jurors about these issues: ‘Your Honor, we’re asking for a mistrial.’ (Tr. 552.)\n\nLynch appeared to disagree with defense counsel’s request for a mistrial. When counsel stated that the defense was asking for a mistrial, Lynch asserted, ‘[n]o, no, we’re not.’ (Tr. 553.) In his appellate brief, Lynch appears to suggest that this statement demonstrates that he wanted to proceed with 11 jurors.\n\nIt is well established that ‘although a defendant has the right to counsel or the right to act pro se, a defendant does not have any right to ‘hybrid representation.’’ *State v. Mongo*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100926, 2015-Ohio-1139, ¶ 13, quoting *State v. Martin*, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, ¶ 29. This court has explained, ‘when counsel represents a criminal defendant, a trial court may not entertain a defendant’s pro se motion.’ *Mongo* at ¶ 14.\nLynch was represented by counsel in the first prosecution, and thus, the trial court could not entertain Lynch’s pro se objection to granting a mistrial. Furthermore, when the trial court declared a mistrial, neither defense counsel nor Lynch objected. Lynch does not argue nor does the record indicate that the state invited a mistrial. Accordingly, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a second prosecution.\n\nAssuming, arguendo, that Lynch objected to a mistrial, the record reflects that a manifest necessity existed for the mistrial.\n\nWhere a defendant objects to a mistrial, the defendant may be retried if ‘manifest necessity’ exists for the mistrial, State v. Gunnell, 132 Ohio St.3d 442, 2012-Ohio-3236, 973 N.E.2d 243, ¶ 25, or if ‘the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.’ State v. Glover, 35 Ohio St.3d 18, 19, 517 N.E.2d 900, quoting State v. Widner, 68 Ohio St.2d 188, 189, 429 N.E.2d 1065 (1981), citing [Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 505, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978)].\n\n‘Manifest necessity’ means a ‘high degree’ of necessity must exist before a mistrial may properly be declared. However, it does not require a showing that a mistrial was ‘absolutely necessary’ or that there was no other alternative but to declare a mistrial. Washington at 511.\n\nThere is no ‘mechanical formula’ for determining what constitutes a ‘manifest necessity’ for a mistrial: ‘[T]he manifest-necessity standard ‘abjures the application of any mechanical formula by which to judge the propriety of declaring a mistrial in the varying and often unique situations arising during the course of a criminal trial.’’ Gunnell at ¶ 27, quoting Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U.S. 458, 462, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973). What constitutes a manifest necessity for a mistrial is, therefore, left to the discretion of the trial court to be decided on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all the relevant circumstances.\n\nState v. Marshall, 2014-Ohio-4677, 22 N.E.3d 207, ¶ 21-22 (8th Dist.).\n\nLynch argues that there was no manifest necessity for the trial court to declare a mistrial. In support of his argument, Lynch suggests that although the alternate juror had been discharged, the alternate could have been brought back. Lynch asserts that the trial court failed to investigate the possibility of bringing back the alternate. These arguments are unsupported\nby the record.\n\nThe record reflects that the trial court made multiple attempts to reach the alternate juror. The jury commissioner attempted to contact the alternate juror, left the alternate a voicemail, and told the alternate to return the phone call. (Tr. 520.) Before declaring a mistrial, the trial court stated, ‘I would like to see if the alternate is available,’ and ‘I’m going to * * * see if we can get ahold of the alternate, if the alternate is available.’ (Tr. 530, 566.) When the trial court declared a mistrial, it explained, ‘we don’t have the alternate here to replace [Juror 7] with an alternate. It’s my understanding the alternate was discharged from jury service yesterday after the Court had let the alternate go from this trial, prior to this jury’s deliberations.’ (Tr. 571.)\n\nAfter review, we find that the trial court acted reasonably in determining that a manifest necessity existed for the declaration of a mistrial. The record reflects that the trial court exercised sound discretion in determining that Juror 7 was unable to follow the court’s instructions and perform his duty. After learning about the issues that arose with Juror 7, the trial court conducted a thorough inquiry, questioning the foreperson, Juror 7, and each juror separately. The trial court permitted defense counsel and the prosecution to question the jurors as well. Furthermore, before deciding to discharge Juror 7 or declare a mistrial, the trial court made multiple attempts to reach the alternate juror. The trial court only declared a mistrial after determining that (1) the jury would not be able to reach a fair and just resolution in the case with Juror 7 on the panel and (2) the alternate juror could not be reached. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by determining that there was a manifest necessity to declare a mistrial."}

At that time, she said that she had met Powell at a K-Mart, rather than a convenience store. She omitted smoking marijuana with him. She described the passenger in Powell’s car as a black man. She also stated that Powell had raped her in the car. D.E. admitted in her trial testimony that she lied to the police because she did not want her father to know that she had smoked marijuana, because she felt it was her fault, and because she just wanted everything to go away.\n\n4 Although in 2007, the police had obtained a hit that Powell’s DNA matched the DNA from D.E.’s rape kit, an interview with D.E. was not arranged until April 2015. In a blind administration of a photo array, D.E. identified Powell with 100% certainty as the man who raped her. A cold-case investigator interviewed Powell in a North Carolina prison in August 2015. He said that he did not remember D.E., but in 1997 he was taking a lot of drugs and did not remember much. He also consented to buccal swabs for further DNA testing. This testing confirmed that Powell was the sole contributor for seminal fluid found on D.E.’s underwear.\n\n6 A.W. gave the following testimony at the January 2018 trial. On November 16, 1998, A.W. was a fifteen-year-old girl. On that date, as she was walking to school, a two-door car driven by a man she knew from the neighborhood pulled up beside her. A dark-skinned man with dreadlocks was in the passenger seat. While she was talking to the driver, the passenger pulled her into the car. She further testified that she remembers the car heading east and stopping at a large house, but she also believed that she was drugged, because she remembers waking up in the house, in which there were a lot of people, a lot of noise, and a lot of drug activity. When she woke up, the driver, the man she knew, was raping her. A.W. testified that when she woke up later, she was alone in a room. She was able to put on her clothes and leave the house. She then went to a telephone and called her grandparents, who came and drove her to a hospital, where a rape kit was collected. A.W. further testified that Carlin Powell was the man she knew from the neighborhood and who raped her.\n\n7 As elicited on cross-examination, A.W. gave a different version of events to the police at the hospital on November 18, 1998. She was at a convenient store to get change for a bus ride to school, when a four-door car with four men pulled up beside her. She said it had a New Orleans license plate, with seat cushions and cigarette burns. A man did pull her into the car, and she gave a more explicit version of the drive. When they arrived at the house, the four men stripped her and took turns raping her. When she was able to leave, she took a bus to Tower City before her grandparents took her to the hospital."}

If the indictment is not brought to trial within that time period, the trial court shall enter an order dismissing the indictment with prejudice. Powell’s request for final disposition was docketed with the trial court on March 15, 2016. His trial started on January 22, 2018, clearly more than 180 days after the time began to run.

The prosecutor asked a prospective juror if the puzzle was an image of the Statue of Liberty, and the juror had about 20 percent of the puzzle complete, would the prospective juror know that it was the Statue of Liberty. The prospective juror replied in the affirmative. The prosecutor then continued by then talking about a puzzle that depicted the prosecutor, noting that the juror did not know her and that “[y]ou’d probably need 90% of it.” The prosecutor said that “that example is what I like to use for reasonable doubt, because there is no percentage that we can put on reasonable doubt. I wish I could but we can’t. Sometimes you need 20% or 40%, sometimes you need 90% of it, and it’s okay.” The prosecutor concluded by noting that “it’s not absolute certainty,” telling the prospective juror that “[t]he judge will instruct you that it’s not absolute certainty,” and asking the prospective juror not to hold her to the standard of absolute certainty."}

Ricks, 136 Ohio St.3d 356, 2013-Ohio-3712, 995 N.E.2d 1181. But Ricks doesn’t apply here.\n\nRicks was a case involving the admission of statements made to law enforcement officers that were repeated by officers during their testimony. The argument for allowing the statements made to the officers had been that they were not being offered for the truth of the matters asserted, but rather for the purpose of explaining why the investigation proceeded in the manner that it did. Id. at ¶ 20.\nTherefore, the statements were not hearsay. *Id.*, citing *State v. Thomas*, 61 Ohio St.2d 223, 232, 400 N.E.2d 401 (1980).

The weapon was not discharged during the incident, and no weapon was recovered.\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court has addressed the level of proof required to meet the burden of proof regarding the operability of a firearm.\n\nIn determining whether an individual was in possession of a firearm and whether the firearm was operable or capable of being readily rendered operable at the time of the offense, the trier of fact may consider all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the crime, which include any implicit threat made by the individual in control of the firearm. *State v.

Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of fact and law. The trial court, acting as the trier of fact, is in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate witness credibility. Therefore, we must accept the facts as found by the trial court as long as they are supported by competent, credible evidence. See State v. Burnside, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, ¶ 8. We must independently review, however, the trial court’s legal conclusions based on the facts to determine whether, as a matter of law, the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard. Id.; see State v. Billups, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150500, 2017-Ohio-4309, ¶ 5. Martin argues that the one-person arrest-scene show-up in which Rickman, Cannon, and Johnson identified him was impermissibly suggestive. Martin challenges as suggestive the fact that he was the only suspect presented at the show-up, he was in handcuffs in the back seat of a police cruiser, and the police failed to resort to less suggestive means like a more traditional lineup. He further contends that the identifications were unreliable under the totality of the circumstances. He maintains that none of witnesses' observations satisfy the factors set forth in Neil v.

Although DiPuccio could not identify Martin as his attacker, Rickman, Cannon, and Johnson each identified Martin as the attacker both before the trial and at the trial. They each testified that they had witnessed Martin attack DiPuccio with a knife, cutting and stabbing him multiple times in the head, face, and body. They then saw Martin walk down the sidewalk and down an alley. Rickman and Johnson called 911 during the attack. Their calls were admitted into evidence and played for the jury. During his 911 call, Johnson stated that he was following Martin so he could alert police to his whereabouts. Johnson can be heard on the 911 call telling the security officers to apprehend Martin. Contrary to Martin's assertions, Johnson testified at trial that he never lost sight of Martin and he was confident that Martin was the perpetrator of the offenses. Rickman, Cannon, and Johnson individually identified Martin as the perpetrator within 30 minutes of the offenses. Rickman's and Johnson's descriptions of the perpetrator's clothing at trial were consistent with the descriptions they had provided on the 911 calls. All three eye witnesses' descriptions were consistent with a photograph of Martin that had been taken the day of the offenses. Each testified unequivocally that Martin had been the perpetrator. The police apprehended Martin at the back of the building where DiPuccio had been attacked. Machol testified that she had seen a man matching Martin's description bend down near her vehicle in the parking lot behind the Taft building. The police recovered a skull cap in the alley, and two knives, one in the alley near the dumpster and one under Machol's car. DiPuccio, Rickman, Cannon, and Johnson identified the larger knife that had been recovered under Machol's vehicle as the knife that Martin had used to cut and stab DiPuccio. We hold that the state presented sufficient evidence to prove Martin guilty of attempted murder and tampering with the evidence."}

Martin contends that defense counsel was unprepared to go to trial and should have sought a continuance at the outset of the trial to determine whether he wanted to testify at the trial. Martin asserts that the result of his trial would have been different had defense counsel communicated more thoroughly with him and been more prepared for trial. We disagree.\n\nTo prevail on his claim of the ineffective assistance of trial counsel, Martin “must show that [his] counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness” and that he was prejudiced by counsel's deficient performance. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Prejudice is demonstrated by showing “that there is a reasonable probability that, but for * * * [the] errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Id. at 694. Both prongs of the test must be\nmet to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel. *Id.* at 697; *see State v. Bradley*, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\nMartin’s claims of ineffectiveness are belied by the record. Martin was represented by two attorneys during the trial. Just prior to the start of the trial, they told the court that they had discussed with Martin both orally and by way of a written letter the state’s offer of a plea deal with an eight-year prison sentence, and they had told Martin that if he proceeded to trial and was found guilty of all the offenses that he could be sentenced to 14 years in prison, but Martin had stated that he wanted to reject the plea deal and proceed to trial.\n\nDefense counsel told the court that they had worked hard on the case, but that they were at a disadvantage, not because of their efforts, but because Martin would not share factual information about the case with them and would not tell them if he wanted to testify at trial. One defense counsel told the court that he had reminded Martin that his case had been pending for two years and 134 days and that time was of the essence with the impending trial.\n\nThe trial court questioned Martin about defense attorneys’ impression of the case, including the potential consequences of proceeding to trial, and asked Martin if he still desired to have his case tried to a jury. Martin told the court that he wanted new attorneys. The trial court denied his request, reminding Martin that it had denied his request for attorneys the day before. The trial court told Martin that he had four prior attorneys, his current defense counsel knew what they were doing and they were zealously representing him. Martin told the court that he still wanted to proceed to trial.\n\nFollowing the presentation of the state’s witnesses and the trial court’s denial of his Crim.R. 29 motion, defense counsel informed the trial court on the\nrecord that they were not going to present any evidence. Defense counsel then asked Martin if he had confidence in his attorneys’ representation. Martin responded affirmatively. Defense counsel told the court that Martin had changed his mind and did not wish to testify. Counsel told the court that they had explained to Martin that it was certainly his 100 percent right to testify or not testify, and that Martin had decided not to testify. When asked by defense counsel if that was correct, Martin responded affirmatively. Immediately thereafter, in the presence of the jury, the defense rested without presenting evidence."}

See R.C. 2929.14(A). With respect to the trial court’s imposition of consecutive sentences, the trial court must engage in a three-step analysis and make certain findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). The court must find that the consecutive sentences are necessary either to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender; the imposition of consecutive sentences is not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and the danger he poses to the public; and at least one of the conditions listed in R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(a)-(c) applies. In State v. Bonnell, 140 Ohio St.3d 209, 2014-Ohio-3177, 16 N.E.3d 659, syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court held that when a trial court imposes consecutive sentences, it must not only announce the requisite consecutive-sentencing findings at the sentencing hearing, but it must also incorporate those findings into the sentencing entry. The trial court is not required to provide a 'word-for-word' recitation of the language or to provide reasons to support the findings, as long as the reviewing court can discern that the trial court engaged in the correct analysis and can determine that the record contains evidence to support the findings. *Id.* at ¶ 29. Despite Martin’s assertions to the contrary, the record reflects that the trial court complied with *Bonnell*. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court orally announced the necessary findings for consecutive sentences. It stated that consecutive prison terms were necessary to protect the public from future crime and punish Martin for the offenses and were not disproportionate to the seriousness of his conduct and the danger he posed to the public, and 'his criminal conduct and criminal history demonstrated consecutive sentences were necessary to protect the public from future crime.' The trial court additionally stated that Martin’s 'failure to recognize his conduct [or] show remorse was alarming.' The trial court was not required to give any reasons to support its findings. *See State v. McGee*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150496, 2016-Ohio-7510, ¶ 32, citing *Bonnell* at syllabus.

Appellant also argues that his counsel was ineffective because he did not renew his motion to sever count two at the close of the evidence in this case. Had Appellant renewed his motion to sever at the close of the evidence, our standard in reviewing Appellant’s first assignment of error would have been abuse of discretion, as opposed to plain error. But, even under an abuse of discretion standard of review, we find that the outcome of Appellant’s motion to sever would not have changed because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s motion to sever. The trial court’s denial was not an abuse of discretion because Appellant did not sustain his burden of proving that a failure to sever would result in prejudice to him, and even assuming arguendo the trial court’s denial of Appellant’s motion to sever would result in prejudice, any such prejudice was negated because there was evidence ‘amply sufficient to sustain each verdict,’ and the evidence supporting the charges was direct and simple. In other words, but for counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would not have been different, and absent such prejudice, Appellant’s claim for ineffective assistance of counsel fails.

The Law\n\na. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n¶68 “When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction, an appellate court's role is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether the evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Simms, 165 Ohio App.3d 83, 86, 844 N.E.2d 1212 (4th Dist. 2005), ¶ 9, citing State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. The question is “whether, after\nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.” *Id.*, citing *Jenks*. In a sufficiency review, the reviewing court does not “weigh the evidence.” *Id.*\n\nb. Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n\n{¶69} In a manifest-weight-of-the-evidence review, the court examines “the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses, and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.” *State v. Simms*, 165 Ohio App.3d 83, 844 N.E.2d 1212, ¶ 17 (4th Dist. 2005), citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. However, “[i]n making this review, the appellate court must be mindful that the original trier of fact was in the best position to judge the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given the evidence.” *Simms* at ¶ 18, citing *State v. DeHass*, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus (1967). “‘A reviewing court will not reverse a conviction where there is substantial evidence upon which the court could reasonably conclude that all the elements of an offense have been proven\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.’ ” Simms, at ¶ 19 quoting State v. Eskridge, 38 Ohio St.3d 56, 526 N.E.2d 304, paragraph two of the syllabus (1988).\n\n2. Criminal Convictions\n\na. Rape\n\nR.C. 2907.02 provides:\n\n(A)(1) No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another who is not the spouse of the offender or who is the spouse of the offender but is living separate and apart from the offender, when any of the following applies:\n\n* * *\n\n(b) The other person is less than thirteen years of age, whether or not the offender knows the age of the other person. (Emphasis added.)\n\nR.C. 2907.01(A) provides:\n\n“Sexual conduct” means vaginal intercourse between a male and female; anal intercourse, fellatio, and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex; and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of the body or any instrument, apparatus, or other object into the vaginal or anal opening of another.\nPenetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal or anal intercourse. (Emphasis added.)\n\n¶71 Appellant questions A.C.’s credibility and argues that even if she can be believed, her testimony can only prove sexual contact, as opposed to sexual conduct, which is required for rape because her testimony did not allege penetration.\n\n¶72 The State argues that the physical evidence of injury to A.C.’s genital area, including her hymen, as well as the testimonial evidence identifying Appellant as the assailant, was sufficient to support Appellant’s conviction and to show that his conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n¶73 Under a sufficiency review, with regard to whether penetration occurred, there is at least some evidence that Appellant’s thumb penetrated A.C.’s vagina and there is a significant amount of evidence that A.C. suffered physical injuries to her genital area, including “abrasions, redness, and swelling in her vaginal area, and her hymen was “beefy red in appearance and swollen,” which was “not normal.” Further, there was male DNA recovered from A.C.’s genital area. Finally, A.C. identified Appellant as the perpetrator. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that any rational trier of fact could have found the\nessential elements of the rape, including sexual conduct (i.e. penetration), beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n{¶74} With regard to the manifest weight of the evidence review, there is testimonial evidence that Appellant merely “touched” A.C. over clothing in her genital area, but there is also evidence that Appellant put his thumb “in” A.C.’s vagina. A.C. initially identified the perpetrator as a man named Peter, but later identified Appellant as the perpetrator. However, the physical injuries suffered by A.C. are undisputed and support more than an innocent touching of A.C.’s vagina. After carefully considering this critical evidence, as well as the remainder of the record, weighing the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considering the credibility of witnesses, and resolving those conflicts in the evidence, we conclude that the jury did not clearly lose its way so as to create a manifest miscarriage of justice that Appellant’s conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\n\n{¶75} Accordingly, we reject Appellant’s argument that his rape conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence, or is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nb. Illegal Use of a Minor in Nudity-Oriented Material\n\n{¶76} Appellant was convicted of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material under R.C. 2907.323(A)(3), which provides that “No\nperson shall do any of the following: “* * * Possess or view any material or performance that shows a minor or impaired person who is not the person's child or ward in a state of nudity, unless” one of the enumerated exceptions applies, which are not applicable in this case. (Emphasis added.)\n\n{¶77} Appellant argues the State failed to prove that the images found on his PS3 were minors, and therefore his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence and is against the manifest weight of the evidence. In response, the State argues that the age of the persons in the images found was a question of fact for the jury to determine.\n\n{¶78} Although R.C. 2907.323 does not define “minor,” under Ohio law, a minor is anyone under 18 years of age. R.C. 3109.01. “Where the title, the text, the visual representation, and other factors gleaned from the material or performance represent or depict the person as a minor, the trier of fact may infer that the person is an actual minor.” State v. Kraft, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-060238, 2007-Ohio-2247, ¶ 88.\n\n{¶79} The jury was apparently able to view the images from Appellant’s PS3. Further, the evidence shows that some of the images are titled “Teen Panty Pics,” and the websites visited include “Teen Fuck Hardcore,” “Free Hardcore Teen,” “Free Teen Russian,” “X Videos Porn at Ultra Young Sex,” etc. We find that there was sufficient evidence to support\nAppellant’s conviction from which the jury could infer that Appellant possessed images of minors.\n\n{¶80} Furthermore, after weighing the evidence and considering all reasonable inferences, we find that there is substantial evidence upon which the court could reasonably conclude that the persons in the images are minors. Therefore, we also find that Appellant’s convictions for illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n{¶81} Accordingly, we reject Appellant’s argument that his conviction for illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material is not supported by sufficient evidence, or is against the weight of the evidence.\n\nc. Kidnapping\n\n{¶82} The State charged Appellant with kidnapping under R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), which provides that:\n\nNo person, by force, threat, or deception, or, in the case of a victim under the age of thirteen or mentally incompetent, by any means, shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, for any of the following purposes: * * * (4) To engage in sexual activity, as\ndefined in section 2907.01 of the Revised Code, with the victim against the victim's will * * *.\n\n{¶83} Appellant argues that there is no evidence that A.C.’s liberty was restrained. In response, the State argues that the apparent bruising, and that the “touching” by Appellant, is evidence that A.C. was restrained during the rape.\n\n{¶84} Initially, we note that we have already held that Appellant’s rape convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and “by definition, inherent in every act of rape is a kidnapping offense.” State v. Stewart, 4th Dist. Ross No. 44331, 1982 WL 5952, at *5. Moreover, we agree with the State that the bruising could be considered evidence of restraint that occurred during the rape.\n\n{¶85} Therefore, we find that there is sufficient evidence to support Appellant’s kidnapping conviction, and in reviewing the entire record, we do not find that the jury lost its way so as to create a manifest injustice justifying a reversal of his kidnapping conviction. Accordingly, we reject Appellant’s arguments that his kidnapping convictions are not supported by sufficient evidence or are against the weight of the evidence.\n\nd. Endangering Children\nAppellant was convicted of endangering children under R.C. 2919.22 (A), which in pertinent part provides: “No person, who is * * * in loco parentis of a child under eighteen years of age * * * shall create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support * * *.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nAppellant argues that there is no evidence he was in loco parentis to A.C., and therefore he could not be charged with endangering children. Appellant argues that as merely Sheri Trout’s live-in boyfriend, he was not in loco parentis to A.C.\n\nIn response, the State argues that there is evidence that Sheri Trout had a visitation order and Appellant lived in the same house when A.C. would come to visit. The State argues that A.C. suffered trauma as the result of inaction by Sheri and the action of Appellant.\n\nR.C. 2919.22 does not define the term “in loco parentis.” However, the Supreme Court has defined the term “in loco parentis” as being “charged, factitiously, with a parent's rights, duties, and responsibilities.” State v. Noggle, 67 Ohio St.3d 31, 33, 1993-Ohio-189, 615 N.E.2d 1040, citing Black's Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1990) 787, superseded by statute on other grounds. “A person in loco parentis has assumed the same duties as a guardian or custodian, only not through a legal proceeding.”\nId.\n\n¶90 Appellant was not married to Sheri. He was merely her live-in boyfriend, which does not, in and of itself, create an *in loco parentis* relationship with A.C. And the State points us to no evidence in the record indicating that Appellant was “charged, factitiously with parental rights, duties, and responsibilities” regarding A.C.\n\n¶91 Accordingly, we find that even viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, no rational trier of fact could have found that Appellant was *in loco parentis*, and therefore absent evidence of that required element, a jury could not convict Appellant of endangering children. Therefore, we sustain Appellant’s argument that there was insufficient evidence supporting his conviction for endangering children.\n\ne. Intimidation of a Victim\n\n¶92 Appellant was convicted of intimidating a witness under R.C. 2921.04(B)(1), which provides, “No person, knowingly and by force or by unlawful threat of harm to any person or property or by unlawful threat to commit any offense or calumny against any person, shall attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder * * * the victim of a crime * * * in the filing or prosecution of criminal charges * * *.”\nAppellant argues that even if A.C. believed that Appellant told her to lie and say that Peter assaulted her, there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction for intimidation of a witness. Appellant argues that there is no evidence that Appellant attempted to prevent A.C. from filing charges. Therefore, he argues, there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction.\n\nIn response, the State argues that there is evidence of intimidation in that Appellant had hit A.C. in the past. The State argues that the impact of Appellant’s abuse, as well as telling A.C. to lie, is evident.\n\nIn State v. Muniz, the Eighth District Court of Appeals found that “where a defendant is charged with intimidation of a ‘victim of crime,’ an essential element of the charge is that the underlying crime occurred and thus created a victim.” Muniz, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 93528, 2010-Ohio-3720, ¶ 20. As such, the court reasoned that Muniz was “entitled to notice of the predicate crime in the indictment” because “[t]he charge of intimidation of a crime victim presupposes an earlier crime has been committed.” Id. at ¶ 19-20 (also explaining that these types of cases are “analogous to cases in which a defendant is charged with a crime that has its foundation on unindicted predicate acts”). Finding that “the record [was] unclear as to the nature of the predicate offense[,]” the Muniz court ultimately held that “[t]he\nstate’s failure to give notice of the underlying predicate acts in the indictment [rendered] it defective from the outset, and therefore fatal to her conviction.” *Id.* at ¶ 21, 23.\n\n{¶96} Nine years later, the Eighth District Court of Appeals revisited this issue in an en banc decision involving the crime of intimidation of a witness, as opposed to intimidation of a victim. *State v. Sanders*, 2019-Ohio-2566, -- N.E.3d --. The court reversed course somewhat, holding that “the fact that an underlying criminal or delinquent act occurred is not an essential element of the crime of intimidation of a witness.” *Id.* at ¶ 5. In reaching its decision, the court reviewed its prior holding in *Muniz*, noting that in *Muniz* it was not clear from the record that an underlying criminal act had occurred or the nature of the criminal act. *Id.* at ¶ 17. The *Sanders* court qualified its decision with respect to its prior holding in *Muniz*, stating as follows:\n\nNothing in this en banc opinion shall be construed to undermine the holding of *Muniz*, with respect to notice requirements. We maintain that a defendant is entitled to adequate notice of the crimes against which they must defend themself.\n\n*Sanders* at ¶ 8.\nUltimately, the Sanders court held that “[a charge of intimidation does not require a conviction on the underlying offense.” Id. at ¶ 9. However, the court explained that the State must prove as follows:\n\nA charge of intimidation does not require a conviction on the underlying offense. Had that been the legislature’s intent, it could easily have used the words “criminal conviction” or “delinquent adjudication” rather than “criminal or delinquent act.” Instead, the state need only prove that the intimidation victim had knowledge about a fact or facts concerning the underlying criminal or delinquent act, and that the defendant knowingly and by force or threat of harm intimidated the victim because of the victim’s knowledge of facts concerning the matter.\n\nId.\n\nIn support of its reasoning, the court stated as follows:\n\nWhile a defendant must be apprised of the nature of the underlying criminal or delinquent act, that act is not a separate element of the offense that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In holding that the occurrence of the underlying act is an essential element\nof intimidation, this court imposed an unworkable burden on the state. In making a case for intimidation, a prosecutor is not required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the predicate act occurred. Such a requirement, particularly in cases where the underlying offense may have been committed by someone other than the defendant in the intimidation case, would require a trial within a trial that we do not believe was intended or contemplated by the legislature in enacting R.C. 2921.04.\n\nId.\n\n¶99 Here, there was no evidence in the record and nothing in the indictment indicating a crime had occurred at the time Appellant allegedly intimidated the victim. More specifically, there is no evidence indicating at times Appellant may have “hit” the child in the “past” or that any criminal act related to the current case had occurred yet. Furthermore, telling A.C. to lie does not constitute intimidation of a victim of a crime.\n\n¶100 Therefore, even after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that any rational trier of fact could not have found that there was evidence of a “threat of harm” to influence or intimidate A.C. pertaining to the charges against Appellant. Accordingly,\nwe sustain Appellant’s argument that his conviction for intimidating a victim is not supported by sufficient evidence."}

Smith, 49 Ohio St.3d 137, 140 (1990). However, Evid.R. 404(B) permits other-acts evidence for other purposes, including but not limited to the purposes identified in the rule. Id. See also Morris at ¶ 13. The rule provides that \"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\" Evid.R. 404(B). See also R.C. 2945.59.\n\n¶ 29 \"Another consideration permitting the admission of certain other-acts evidence is whether the other acts 'form part of the immediate background of the alleged act which forms the foundation of the crime charged in the indictment' and are 'inextricably related' to the crime.\" Morris at ¶ 13, quoting State v. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 73 (1975). Thus, \"[e]vidence of other crimes may be presented when\" those crimes tend \"logically to prove any element of the crime charged.\" State v. Horsley, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-350, 2006-Ohio-1208, ¶ 24.\n\n¶ 30 To determine the admissibility of the other-acts evidence, a court must first \"consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, ¶ 20, citing Evid.R. 401. Second, a court must \"consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in conformity therewith or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B).\" Id. Finally, the court must \"consider\nwhether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the\ndanger of unfair prejudice.\" *Id.*, citing Evid.R. 403.\n\n{¶ 31} A number of the rape charges at issue charged appellant pursuant to R.C.\n2907.02(A)(2), which provides that \"[n]o person shall engage in sexual conduct with\nanother when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat\nof force.\" \"Force\" is defined as \"any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted\nby any means upon or against a person or thing.\" R.C. 2901.01(A)(1).\n\n{¶ 32} To prove the force element of a sexual offense, the state must establish force\nbeyond that force inherent in the crime itself. *State v. Griffith*, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-1042,\n2006-Ohio-6983, ¶ 17, citing *State v. Dye*, 82 Ohio St.3d 323 (1998). However, the \"force\nand violence necessary to commit the crime of rape depends upon the age, size and strength\nof the parties and their relation to each other.\" *State v. Eskridge*, 38 Ohio St.3d 56 (1988),\nparagraph one of the syllabus. In cases involving parents or stepparents sexually abusing\ntheir children, the force \" 'need not be overt or physically brutal, but can be subtle and\npsychological. As long as it can be shown that the rape victim's will was overcome by fear\nor duress, the forcible element of rape can be established.' \" *Id.* at 58-59, quoting *State v.\nFowler*, 27 Ohio App.3d 149, 154 (8th Dist.1985). *See also Griffith* at ¶ 17; *Dye* at 326.\n*Compare State v. Schaim*, 65 Ohio St.3d 51 (1992), paragraph one of the syllabus.\n\n{¶ 33} Thus, evidence of a defendant's prior acts of violence may demonstrate why\na victim's will was overcome by their fear of the defendant, and thereby establish the force\nelement of a rape charge. *See State v. Williamson*, 8th Dist. No. 80982, 2002-Ohio-6503,\n¶ 23 (noting the \"evidence of the physical violence that occurred in the household [was]\nrelevant to and probative of the method of control used by defendant to rape and sexually\nabuse the victim\"); *State v. Jordan*, 2d Dist. No. 26163, 2016-Ohio-603, ¶ 21 (holding that\nthe \"other-acts evidence\" of the defendant's violent acts was \"relevant to the element of\nforce\"); *State v. Scott*, 5th Dist. No. 11CA80, 2012-Ohio-3482, ¶ 28-29 (noting the evidence\nindicating that the defendant killed the victim's baby sister \"was offered to show the victim's\nstate of mind; * * * and why she was in fear of [defendant],\" and thus was not \"improper\npropensity evidence, but instead tend[ed] to show an element of the crime [of rape], force\").\n\n{¶ 34} N.F. explained he did not want to engage in the sexual acts with appellant,\nbut stated he \"never questioned what\" appellant told him to do, because if he questioned\nappellant that \"results to physical violence or physical abuse.\" (Tr. Vol. II 108.) Thus, the physical abuse evidence demonstrated N.F.'s will was overcome by his fear of appellant, and explained why N.F. did not resist appellant's demands for sexual activity.\n\n{¶ 35} Additionally, during N.F.'s testimony, the court provided the jury with the following limiting instruction:\n\nLet me just advise you that I have permitted testimony on the direct examination of this witness dealing with alleged prior bad acts on behalf of the [appellant] in this case. I did not admit that evidence to show that [appellant], if he did commit a bad act before, he acted in conformance with that action with respect to [N.F.] and the matters that you are to decide, the sexual-related offenses.\n\nBut I have permitted that to be introduced for the purpose of showing [N.F.'s] state of mind and whether he was fearful of [appellant]. So you can only consider it for that purpose and that purpose only.\n\n(Tr. Vol. II at 69-70.)\n\n{¶ 36} We presume the jury followed the court's instruction. State v. Jones, 135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, ¶ 194. Appellant argues the trial court's failure to reiterate the limiting instruction when other witnesses testified to the physical abuse, or to reiterate the instruction in the final jury instructions, amounts to plain error. Although \" 'the failure to give any limiting instruction constitutes plain error,' \" here the trial court did provide the jury with a limiting instruction the first time the other-acts evidence was presented. State v. Shaw, 2d Dist. No. 21880, 2008-Ohio-1317, ¶ 13, quoting State v. Tisdale, 2d Dist. No. 19346, 2003-Ohio-4209, ¶ 47 (noting that \" '[t]he limiting instruction should be given at the time the \"other acts\" evidence is received' \"). Accordingly, we do not find plain error.\n\n{¶ 37} The evidence of physical abuse was relevant to a fact of consequence, as it established the force element of the rape charges. Williams at ¶ 20. The evidence was not presented to prove appellant acted in conformity therewith, and the court instructed the jury the evidence was not to be used for that purpose. Id. The probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, and any danger of unfair prejudice was reduced by the court's limiting instruction. Id. at ¶ 24.\nAppellant further argues that, even if N.F.'s testimony of the physical abuse was admissible, the additional evidence from L.A., C.A.W., and children services caseworkers regarding the physical abuse deprived him of a fair trial. However, appellant testified N.F. had lied about all of the sexual abuse allegations. The testimony from the other witnesses corroborated N.F.'s testimony regarding the physical abuse and, thus, served to bolster N.F.'s credibility. Evidence which impeaches or bolsters witness credibility \"is of consequence to the action because it might determine whether the jury believes a particular witness.\" State v. Moore, 40 Ohio St.3d 63, 65 (1988).\n\nMoreover, appellant admitted his methods of disciplining N.F. constituted physical abuse. In closing, defense counsel relied on the fact that appellant \"freely told\" the jury that \"his methods of disciplining [N.F.] were not good,\" to bolster appellant's credibility. (Tr. Vol. V at 94.) The defense also argued the years of physical abuse, coupled with appellant cutting N.F. off financially, provided N.F. with the motivation to fabricate the sexual abuse allegations against appellant. (See Tr. Vol. V at 94-95.)\n\nTo the extent that some of the physical abuse evidence may have been unnecessarily cumulative, the admission of such evidence amounts to harmless error. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect one. State v. Williams, 38 Ohio St.3d 346, 349 (1988). \"The harmless-error doctrine recognizes the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant's guilt or innocence,\" and thus focuses \"on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.\" Id. An error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt when the remaining evidence, standing alone, constitutes overwhelming proof of defendant's guilt. Id. See also State v. Tucker, 10th Dist. No. 00AP-670, 2002-Ohio-3274, ¶ 44; Morris at ¶ 32; Crim.R. 52(A).\n\nThe evidence of the crimes for which the jury returned guilty verdicts was considerable. In addition to N.F.'s detailed description of each sexual act, L.A. testified to the sexual activity that occurred between herself, N.F., and appellant, and C.A.W. provided circumstantial evidence that sexual activity occurred between appellant, L.A., and N.F. Accordingly, as the record contains overwhelming evidence of appellant's guilt on the sex crimes, any error in the admission of physical abuse evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."}

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 89 (1986), the Supreme Court of the United States held that a prosecutor’s racially motivated exercise of preemptory challenges violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. State v. Holder, 11th Dist. Geauga Nos. 2001-G-2345 & 2001-G-2350, 2002-Ohio-7124, ¶40, citing Batson at 89. Batson has also been extended to prohibit preemptory strikes based on gender. Id., citing J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127(1994), at syllabus. As the Fourteenth Amendment protects the rights of prospective jurors to be free from discriminatory challenges, the exercise of even one peremptory challenge in a purposefully discriminatory manner violates equal protection. *Id.*, citing *State v. Gowdy*, 88 Ohio St.3d 387, 393 (2000). A trial court’s findings of no discriminatory intent will not be reversed on appeal absent a determination that it was clearly erroneous. (Citation omitted.) *Id.*\n\n{¶50} There is a three-part process for proving a *Batson* violation. *Id.* at ¶41. First, a party must establish a prima facie case of discriminatory purpose, which can be done by pointing to a pattern of challenges against a particular race or gender. *Id.* Second, if a prima facie case is established, the burden of production then shifts to the proponent of the strike to come forward with a race or gender-neutral explanation. *Id.* Third, and finally, if a race or gender-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must decide whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful discrimination. *Id.*, citing *Gowdy* at 392-93.\n\n{¶51} A review of the transcript reveals that the state used only two of its four peremptory challenges, electing to strike first, a male, and then second, the female juror at issue. Immediately upon exercising its second challenge on the female juror, defense counsel asked the state “to provide a gender neutral reason for excusing her.” After disagreeing about the analysis of *Batson*, the state provided a gender neutral reason for striking the potential female juror: “Frankly – and I’ll be very frank. The reason for the State’s peremptory is because we believe [the juror] was not truthful in the courtroom. Because on her application she indicated she suffered from rheumatoid arthritis. And when we asked her in open court what medical conditions, if there’s anybody that had some serious medical conditions, that she didn’t note that. So we were concerned frankly for her - -.”\n\n{¶52} After inquiring if defense counsel wished to be heard further on their objection, the court determined: “Okay. I’m looking down the list. So currently there are three women I think on the panel. And the only other woman who was on the panel who’s been excused was excused by the Defense. So I’m gonna overrule this objection to the challenge. I think the State can fairly excuse [the juror] on a peremptory challenge.”\n\n{¶53} After this female juror was excused, the final jury included three women and two female alternates. Prior to the peremptory challenges, the record reflects the state raised approximately 13 jurors to strike for cause, with approximately half male and half female. All of the state’s explanations were gender neutral on their faces and otherwise supported by the transcript.\n\n{¶54} Ms. McEndree cites the Seventh District Court of Appeals’ holding in State v. Barker, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 05-JE-21, 2006-Ohio-1472, in support of the proposition that “the use of a peremptory challenge to exclude a single prospective juror, without more, can establish a prima facie cause of discrimination.” While this is an accurate statement of the law, it has no bearing on the present case.\n\n{¶55} In Barker, the Seventh District found that the appellant, who was African American, had met his burden of making a prima facie case of discrimination in that the state wished to exercise its peremptory challenge to excuse the only African-American juror, and as such, the prosecutor’s use of a peremptory challenge to excuse the juror could be viewed as discriminatory. Id. at ¶18. As in the present case, however, the prosecutor put forth a valid, neutral explanation for excusing the juror that was reasonable\nand understandable. *Id.* at ¶19-20. For similar reasons, we cannot conclude that the trial court’s finding of no discrimination was clearly erroneous.\n\n¶56 Ms. McEndree’s second assignment of error is without merit."}

{"index": "357- Mcendree", "allegation_num": "allegation_4", "allegation": "The trial court erred in precluding a finding on involuntary manslaughter.", "extracted_text": "Ms. McEndree argues her trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter. This case, however, does not support an acquittal on the aggravated murder charge and a conviction of voluntary manslaughter. R.C. 2903.03(A), which defines 'voluntary manslaughter,' states 'no person, while under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which is brought on by serious provocation occasioned by the victim that is reasonably sufficient to incite the person into using deadly force, shall knowingly cause the death of another * * *.' Voluntary manslaughter is considered an inferior-degree offense to aggravated murder. 'Before giving an instruction on voluntary manslaughter in a murder case, the trial court must determine 'whether evidence of reasonably sufficient provocation occasioned by the victim has been presented to warrant such an instruction.' In making that determination, trial courts must apply an objective standard: 'For provocation to be reasonably sufficient, it must be sufficient to arouse the passions of an ordinary person beyond the power of his or her control.' Ms. McEndree’s trial counsel could not have been deficient in failing to request a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter when there was no evidence of provocation. In her recorded confession with the police, Ms. McEndree was asked if she took the gun in anger. Ms. McEndree replied she did not; she just wanted to end it. She also told the police the victim had pulled her hair and wanted to do drugs. Mr. McCann’s actions did not provide sufficient provocation to warrant an instruction on voluntary manslaughter. Further, there was no evidence that Mr. McCann was the aggressor. Ms. McEndree told the police that she stole the gun from her neighbor because she had 'had enough;' she was not angry but was 'used to' the abuse. She then rode her bicycle back to the house and shot Mr. McCann on sight. Thus, the evidence shows that when Ms. McEndree killed Mr. McCann, she was not under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage. Thus, in Elmore, supra, similarly to Ms. McEndree, the appellant did not provide sufficient provocation to warrant an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, and there was no evidence that the victim was the aggressor. Likewise in State v. Lee, trial counsel was not deficient in failing to request a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter, considering that the evidence at trial did not support a finding that defendant acted under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage. In State v. Handwork, we found the jury’s verdict convicting appellant of murder rather than voluntary manslaughter was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because appellant told investigators, when asked if he was angry, that he was 'not angry, but scared.' The Fifth District aptly explained in State v. Byerly that the interval between the provocation and the fatal blow must be so close in time that the defendant had no time to 'cool off.' Because there was absolutely no evidence that the defendant was under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, there was no evidence adduced at trial which would allow the jury to reasonably reject the greater offense of aggravated murder and find defendant guilty of the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter. Furthermore, the Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that the 'failure to request instructions on lesser-included offenses is a matter of trial strategy and does not establish ineffective assistance of counsel,' especially where, as here, the evidence does not support such an instruction."}

Hope at ¶132. The focus is ‘the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.’ (Citations omitted.) Thus, prosecutorial misconduct is not grounds for reversal unless it so taints the proceedings that a defendant is deprived of a fair trial. (Citation omitted.) Id.\n\nFirst, as noted above, pursuant to R.C. 2945.392(B), the defendant may introduce expert testimony that he or she suffered from BWS as evidence to establish the ‘requisite impairment at the time of the offense.’ Thus, as previously noted, the Supreme Court of Ohio ‘[did] not establish a new defense or justification’ in allowing the admission of expert testimony regarding battered-woman syndrome for the first time in State v. Koss[,] [supra] * * *. Rather, [the Supreme Court of Ohio] held that expert testimony on battered-woman syndrome is admissible as evidence to prove one element of self-defense.’ State v. Goff[,] 128 Ohio St.3d 169, 2010-Ohio-6317, ¶35. Thus, such evidence is equally admissible to support an insanity defense.\n\nSecond, the state was permitted to have their own expert testify as to BWS and whether Ms. McEndree suffered from BWS at the time of the offense. In Goff, the Supreme Court of Ohio went on to hold that ‘[b]y putting her mental state directly at issue and introducing expert testimony based upon her own statements to the expert, the defendant opens the door to a limited examination by the state’s expert concerning battered-woman syndrome and its effect on the defendant’s behavior. Courts have the inherent authority to preserve fairness in the trial process, and allowing the defendant to present expert testimony on the specific effects of battered-woman syndrome on the defendant while denying the prosecution the ability to introduce such evidence would unfairly handicap the prosecution and prevent the trier of fact from making an informed decision.’ Id. at ¶58.\nA review of the testimony of the state’s expert, Dr. Gazley, reveals he explained BWS, stating that it was a legally recognized syndrome in the state of Ohio, but that it is not recognized ‘in the clinical psychology classification.’ He also opined one can be a battered woman but not suffer from BWS. He explained whether an individual suffers from BWS depends on the individual and the traumatic series of events. It does not always end in the ‘syndrome cluster’ known as BWS. Although Dr. Gazley believed Ms. McEndree was a ‘severely abused woman,’ he did not feel she exhibited the characteristics BWS because she did not demonstrate learned helplessness and she still had the capacity to think rationally, make informed decisions, and utilize her rational thinking.\n\nThe state was permitted to present their expert testimony on BWS and whether it affected Ms. McEndree and her sanity at the time of the offense. ‘The paramount concern of fairness of the trial requires only that the state be given the same opportunity to present testimony on battered-woman syndrome as the defendant.’ Goff at ¶59."}

The issue of whether the trial court prejudiced Makin by not granting a continuance to secure the appearance of an expert witness was already addressed through the second assignment of error as raised on direct appeal. This court held that: In the second assignment of error, Makin argues the trial court abused its discretion when it denied defense counsel’s request for a continuance in order to secure the appearance of Melvin Robertson (“Robertson”) — a witness for the defense. The decision to grant or deny a motion for continuance is left to the broad and sound discretion of the trial judge, and an appellate court may not disturb the trial court’s ruling absent an abuse of discretion. *Cleveland v.

In the instant case, defense counsel asked for a continuance, after the state rested its case, so two witnesses — Robertson and Jeff White (“White”) — could be brought into court to testify for Makin. Defense counsel noted that he had subpoenas issued for both individuals the day before, but his efforts to contact them have been unsuccessful. Robertson was the individual Makin was meeting with on Noble Road. White is an expert on auto mechanics repair and damage. With respect to Robertson, defense counsel stated: I will say from the nature of the testimony, I don’t know that Mr. Robertson being here or not for that purpose caused him any significant damage, because both from the State’s side and from my client, there seems to be testimony that my client was meeting with a person in a parking lot.

Here, defense counsel stated that Robertson’s absence did not cause Makin any prejudice because both Makin and the state essentially agreed that Makin was meeting someone in a parking lot. This testimony would have been more cumulative than substantially favorable to Makin.

Since the entire issue before the jury was whether minors were ‘likely to view’ Mr. Fornshell’s conduct—a video from the same day, in a bookstore, showing him engaged in likely inappropriate activity with children in sight poses a substantial ‘danger of unfair prejudice.’\n\n{¶19} The problem for Mr. Fornshell, however, is that the video in question was stipulated to by the parties, which limits Mr. Fornshell’s challenge to plain error. State v. Gross, 97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, ¶ 49 (“In fact, on one of the transcript pages Gross cites, his counsel stipulates to the admission of the nine photographs in question. Consequently, Gross has forfeited all but plain error.”), modified on other grounds, State v.

Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002) (“[Defendant] failed to object * * * at trial and thereby forfeited all but plain error.”). To demonstrate plain error, he must show that (1) there was an error, i.e., the court broke a legal rule, (2) the error was plain, i.e., obvious in the course of the proceedings, and (3) the error affected substantial rights, i.e., it clearly determined the trial’s outcome. Id. at 27. See State v. Sanders, 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 263, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001) (“Plain error exists only when it is clear that the verdict would have been otherwise but for the error.”); State v.

Webster, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-120452, 2013-Ohio-4142, ¶ 41 (quoting Long).\n\n{¶21} The first two prongs of this test are easily met by our preceding Evid.R. 403 analysis and the trial court’s own belated recognition of its mistake. Where Mr. Fornshell comes up short, however, is the extent to which the video determined his conviction. His trial counsel admitted Mr. Fornshell’s guilt of the misdemeanor offense of public indecency described in R.C. 2907.09(A)(2)—the trial strategy sought to avoid conviction for a felony by challenging the ‘likely to view’ requirement. We must ask whether, without the Mason video, the jury still would have found that a minor was likely to view and be affronted by the conduct.\n\n{¶22} As should be apparent from our discussion of the Madeira video footage and evidence, ample evidence supported Mr. Fornshell’s conviction.\nMultiple witnesses testified to the presence of children in the store, and to the proximity of the children's book section to where Mr. Fornshell lingered too long in the self-help section. Against the backdrop of this evidence, Mr. Fornshell cannot show that the admission of the Mason video tipped the balance at trial. Because Mr. Fornshell cannot show that admission of the Mason video impacted the outcome of the trial, he cannot succeed on a plain-error challenge. See, e.g., State v. McKelton, 148 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-Ohio-5735, 70 N.E.3d 508, ¶ 196-197, quoting State v. Mammone, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942, 13 N.E.3d 1051, ¶ 69 (“[A]ny minimal probative value that [the evidence] may have had was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Nevertheless, given the overwhelming evidence of [the defendant’s] guilt, we are unpersuaded that but for these photos, ‘the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.’ ”). We accordingly find no plain error here and overrule the second assignment of error.\n\n{¶23} In tandem with the above, Mr. Fornshell utilizes the failure to object to this video as a springboard for questioning his counsel’s effectiveness. To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, Mr. Fornshell must demonstrate (1) that his counsel's ineffectiveness was ‘so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment’ and (2) that his counsel’s errors were ‘so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.’ Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).\n\n{¶24} In this case, we conclude that the second prong of this analysis is the functional equivalent to the third prong of the plain-error analysis. Short of affecting the outcome of his trial, which—due to the wealth of photographic, video, and testimonial evidence discussed above, it did not—Mr. Fornshell's trial counsel's errors did not operate to deprive Mr. Fornshell of a fair trial. We accordingly overrule his third assignment of error."}

{"index": "367-Fornshell", "allegation_num": "allegation_6", "allegation": "The record does not support the prison sentence imposed.", "extracted_text": "Mr. Fornshell asserts that the record does not support the prison sentence imposed. We may reduce or otherwise modify this sentence only if we find, clearly and convincingly, that his sentence is not supported by the record or is contrary to law. R.C. 2953.08(G)(2).\n\n{¶30} Initially, the state contends that this aspect of the appeal is moot because Mr. Fornshell has completed his sentence. The fact that a sentence has run its course does not necessarily moot the appeal of a felony conviction. State v. Golston, 71 Ohio St.3d 224, 227, 643 N.E.2d 109 (1994) (“[A]n appeal challenging a felony conviction is not moot even if the entire sentence has been satisfied before the matter is heard on appeal.”). However, the principle from the Golston case—that the collateral consequences of a felony conviction give rise to the right to challenge it—“is not served, and thus an appeal is moot, when, as here, the appellant challenges only his sentence, and his completion of his sentence leaves him without a remedy affecting his conviction.” (Citations omitted.) State v. Ysrael, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-140148, 2015-Ohio-332, ¶ 13. Here, Mr. Fornshell does not challenge any of the collateral effects of his sentence, but only the fact of the prison sentence itself. Although this may well be moot, we have no substantiation in the record to establish that Mr. Fornshell has completed his sentence, and thus we turn to the merits of his sentencing challenge.\n\n{¶31} Mr. Fornshell points to the failure of the trial court to order a court clinic evaluation or to impose community control as the basis for overturning his sentence. Yet he identifies no authority obligating a trial court to allow the court clinic evaluation to go forward. Relatedly, while he cites R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a), which compels courts to use a community-control sanction or a combination of\ncommunity-control sanctions in certain instances of fourth- and fifth-degree felonies, he overlooks the exception in (B)(1)(b): “The court has discretion to impose a prison term upon an offender who is convicted of * * * a felony of the * * * fifth degree that is not an offense of violence or that is a qualifying assault offense if any of the following apply: * * * (v) The offense is a sex offense that is a * * * fifth degree felony violation of any provision of Chapter 2907 of the Revised Code.” That exception applies here. Nevertheless, the trial court did consider a particular community-control sanction, but Mr. Fornshell had already completed it. It did not consider lesser sanctions in light of his past history of similar offenses in Ohio, Kentucky, and California.\n\n{¶32} Mr. Fornshell also challenges the trial court’s alleged failure to consider the purposes and principles of sentencing in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. But our review of the transcript shows to the contrary. The trial court considered his evidence of mitigation at sentencing, during which he discussed his bipolar disorder, total disability, and nervous breakdowns. The judge evaluated this and described the sentencing purposes and principles, and Mr. Fornshell has not adequately demonstrated any potential flaws in the court’s analysis. We accordingly overrule his sixth assignment of error."}
{"index": "372-Miller", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "I. Manifest Weight and Sufficiency of Evidence", "extracted_text": "Miller argues in his first two assignments of error that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence and were not supported by sufficient evidence.\n\nWhen reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a criminal conviction, an appellate court examines the evidence to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would support a conviction. State v. Gross, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2018-01-001, 2018-Ohio-4557, ¶ 15. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Baikov, 12th Dist. Fayette No. CA2019-11-023, 2020-Ohio-4876, ¶ 13.\n\nA manifest weight of the evidence challenge examines the \"inclination of the greater amount of credible evidence, offered at a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.\" State v. Barnett, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-09-177, 2012-Ohio-2372, ¶ 14. To determine whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the reviewing court must look at the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether in resolving the conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. State v. Morgan, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2013-08-146 and CA2013-08-147, 2014-Ohio-2472, ¶ 34.\n\nQuestions regarding witness credibility and weight of the evidence \"are primarily matters for the trier of fact to decide since the trier of fact is in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given the evidence.\" State v. Walker, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2006-04-085, 2007-Ohio-911, ¶ 26. As a result, \"the question upon review is whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost\nits way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed.\" State v. Erdmann, 12th Dist. Clermont Nos. CA2018-06-043 and CA2018-06-044, 2019-Ohio-261, ¶ 23. Therefore, an appellate court will overturn a conviction due to the manifest weight of the evidence only in extraordinary circumstances when the evidence presented at trial weighs heavily in favor of acquittal. State v. Blair, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2014-01-023, 2015-Ohio-818, ¶ 43."}
