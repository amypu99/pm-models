Sanders maintains that the state did not prove that the child’s death was the result of murder, nor did it prove who committed the murder. She argues that because Renode had been charged with the child’s murder, but had yet to be tried, the court allowed the jury to assume that Renode murdered the child. She maintains that this assumption was a failure of proof on the intimidation count and otherwise tainted her ability to receive a fair trial. The intimidation charge did not require the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a murder occurred, much less who committed the murder. Had that been the legislature’s intent, it could easily have used the words ‘criminal conviction’ or ‘delinquent adjudication’ rather than ‘criminal or delinquent act.’ The state only had to prove that the victim had knowledge about a fact or facts concerning the child’s death and that Sanders knowingly and by force or threat of harm intimidated the victim because of the victim’s knowledge of facts concerning the matter. As charged in the indictment, the to-wit clause referencing murder applied merely to describe the circumstances of the criminal act; the precise nature of the criminal act was not a separate element of proof for the offense of intimidation. The evidence showed that the victim of the intimidation count, who was 13 years of age at the time, slept at the house where the stabbing occurred. He testified that after family members found the child, he personally saw the child on a bedroom floor, wrapped in a quilt and bleeding (the child had been stabbed in the neck). The child’s mother told the victim to go to a local grocery store and locate her fiancé. The victim found the fiancé with Sanders and Renode. After the victim said that the child ‘was bleeding’ and might be dead, the fiancé and Renode started running to the house, but Sanders only walked, telling the victim that the child was ‘not dead, he’s okay.’ When they returned to the house, Renode went to the bedroom, but Sanders remained outside. The child testified that Renode then came out of the bedroom ‘really quick and said I have to get out of here * * *.’ Trial testimony established that Sanders and Renode had previously stayed at the mother’s house, but were told to move out after ‘a bunch of altercations’ with her children. As she was moving out, Sanders told the mother that ‘I’ll be back and I’m going to kill you and your kids.’ Sanders and Renode returned to the house a few weeks later, claiming that they were homeless and needed a place to stay. The mother took them in as an act of charity. Two days later, the mother became upset after discovering that Renode had given an alcoholic drink to the child. After sending the child to bed, the mother, her fiancé, Sanders, and Renode watched a movie. The mother checked on the child and found him sleeping on the floor, so she told Sanders and Renode that they could sleep in the child’s bed. When the mother checked on the child two hours later, she found the child wrapped in a quilt and bleeding from a stab wound to the neck. Sanders and Renode were no longer in the house. The day after the child’s death, the mother’s fiancé found a pair of blood-soaked pants belonging to Renode in a clothes pile in one of the bedrooms. The child’s mother testified that in the days following the stabbing, Renode’s name was mentioned most frequently in speculation about who killed her son, given that bloody pants belonging to Renode were found in the house. Four days after the stabbing, the victim and his girlfriend were walking down the street where the stabbing occurred. They saw a car driving slowly down the street, with Renode and Sanders in the back seat. Renode, sitting behind the driver, extended a gun out the car window and fired about six times. Two bullets struck a vehicle next to where the victim was standing. The car then sped away. The state offered no expert testimony on the cause of the child’s death, nor did it offer any evidence in the form of police testimony regarding an investigation into the child’s death. Nevertheless, the jury could reasonably infer that the child, having been stabbed in the neck and wrapped in a quilt, died as result of foul play that rose to the level of a criminal act. *Jackson v. Virginia*, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (it is ‘the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts’). Evidence that Renode and Sanders may have been involved in the child’s death provided a motive for intimidation. The victim testified that Renode and Sanders both made incriminating statements on the night of the child’s death. And the discovery of Renode’s bloody pants appeared to tie him to the death. These background facts put into perspective the victim’s testimony that the car in which Sanders and Renode were traveling slowly down the street slowed down and that Renode fired multiple shots at him. A rational trier of fact could have found the shooting to be an act to intimidate the victim from testifying in a future criminal proceeding related to the child’s death. *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. The facts support that the shots were intended to injure the victim and/or intimidate him. There is no evidence of any other plausible explanation for the shooting. In addition to the direct evidence of intimidation, the jury could rationally find that Sanders fled the jurisdiction with Renode, an act that showed a consciousness of guilt. *State v. Eaton*, 19 Ohio St.2d 145, 249 N.E.2d 897 (1969), paragraph six of the syllabus (‘Flight from justice * * * may be indicative of a consciousness of guilt.’). Testimony showed that warrants were issued for the arrest of Sanders and Renode just days after the shooting. It is unclear when the two left Ohio, but Renode was forcibly apprehended six months later in Indiana. Although there was no evidence that Sanders fired the shots at the victim, a rational trier of fact could find Sanders complicit in intimidating the victim; that is, that she acted with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense and she aided and abetted Renode. See R.C. 2923.03(A). Aiding and abetting can be inferred by presence, companionship, and conduct before and after the offense is committed. *State v. Johnson*, 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 245, 754 N.E.2d 796 (2001). Evidence that Sanders and Renode were together on the night the child died, along with incriminating statements both she and Renode later made, shows that Sanders would have benefitted just as much as Renode by intimidating the victim. This self-interest and companionship was sufficient evidence from which the jury could infer that Sanders was complicit in committing intimidation.\"\n}\n```"}

He claims that he was unaware of the existence of the exhibits until trial commenced.\\n\\nCrim.R. 16(B) provides: Upon receipt of a written demand for discovery by the defendant * * *, the prosecuting attorney shall provide copies or photographs, or permit counsel for the defendant to copy or photograph, the following items related to the particular case indictment, information, or complaint, and which are material to the preparation of a defense, or are intended for use by the prosecuting attorney as evidence at the trial, or were obtained from or belong to the defendant, within the possession of, or reasonably available to the state, subject to the provisions of this rule: * * * (5) Any evidence favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment[.]\\n\\nTucker acknowledges that he made no written request for discovery in the trial court, but indicates that the state provided initial discovery responses on October 14, 2016. He maintains that the state proceeded as if discovery had been requested. He also claims that the trial court treated this receipt of discovery responses as a tolling event for speedy-trial purposes, but at trial, it “acted as if no request was ever made.” He maintains that “the lower court cannot claim one thing at trial and the exact opposite in a subsequent judgment entry.” The state responds that the trial record makes clear that Tucker made the deliberate decision not to request discovery—despite knowing that the video recording existed—because he did not want to toll the speedy-trial clock. It also argues that Tucker’s argument is barred by res judicata because it could have been raised on direct appeal.\\n\\nThe trial court in its judgment appears to have treated Tucker’s argument concerning the non-disclosure of exhibits as a claim that new evidence had been discovered. It concluded that “the discovery of new evidence of innocence after a defendant has been tried, convicted and sentenced does not constitute a triable post-conviction claim of substantive constitutional magnitude,” however, it noted that it had “considered the argument and sees no merit in it under these facts.”\\n\\nA trial court’s decision to deny a petition for postconviction relief involves mixed questions of law and fact. We review the trial court’s decision on factual issues using a manifest weight standard of review, and we review the trial court’s decision on legal issues de novo.” State v. Neyland, 6th Dist.

No. L-01-1281, 2002-Ohio-5201, ¶ 6.\\n\\nHere, the record here is very clear that Tucker made the deliberate decision not to request discovery. The October 26, 2016 trial transcript contains the following exchange relative to this point: The court: I need to address on the record, that the Court notes that the defense in this case did not request discovery. [Defense counsel], let’s address this issue.\\n\\n[Defense counsel]: Judge, I did not request discovery in this case and I advised the State that I did not. Mr. Tucker was represented at the arraignment by [former counsel] but had indicated at that time to this Court and through [former counsel] to me that he did not want to waive any of his speedy trial rights. * * * And so I explained to him that if I were to request discovery, pursuant to case law and rule, the speedy trial time is tolled based upon a request for discovery and stays tolled until reciprocal discovery is provided. With that understanding, he had agreed that he does not want to waive that speedy trial time, therefore, is in agreement with my not requesting discovery in this case. I explained to him in full that that put us at somewhat of a disadvantage because we are flying a little bit blind. We knew the facts of the case and we had discussed it previously, but there were evidentiary issues that could present themselves that I would not have access to because I had not requested discovery. My client indicated he was comfortable with going forward on that basis.\\n\\nThe court: Mr. Tucker, is that correct?\\n\\nThe defendant: Yes, Your Honor, it is.\\n\\nThe court: And you directed your attorney not to request discovery specifically for that reason?\\n\\nThe defendant: Yes, Your Honor, I did.\\n\\nThe court: So that his failure to request discovery is not any failing on his part to represent you effectively, that is following your direction?\\n\\nThe defendant: That is correct, Your Honor. Yes.\\n\\nThe court: All right.\\n\\n[The state]: * * * I would note that I have a second DVD that was available for inspection, and the DVD surveillance video from the parking lot of Walmart where the defendant allegedly tried to run over J.R.\\n\\nThe court: All right, well this is apparently a tactical decision on the part of the defendant. * * *\\n\\n[Defense counsel]: Judge, I did want to put on the record just for information with regard to the tactical decision to not request discovery, Mr. Tucker and I had discussed tactically the potential for that video that the State talked about – of the parking lot – existing and us not having access to it. So we had discussed that possibility, and even with that understanding, he still was in agreement not to request discovery.\\n\\nThe court: Is that right, Mr. Tucker?\\n\\nThe defendant: Yes, Your Honor, it is.\\n\\nThe record is clear that Tucker made a conscious, tactical decision, not to request discovery and was advised by counsel of the potential consequences of that decision. Accordingly, we find no error in the trial court’s denial of Tucker’s petition for postconviction relief. We also agree with the state that this was an issue that could have been raised on direct appeal, therefore, Tucker is barred by res judicata from raising this issue now. See State v. Henson, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-11-068, 2012-Ohio-3730, ¶ 20 (“Under res judicata a convicted defendant is barred from litigating issues that were raised or could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal from the judgment of conviction.”).\"\n}\n```"}

We disagree.\\n\\nOrdinarily, a trial court is vested with broad discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence in any particular case, so long as such discretion is exercised in line with the rules of procedure and evidence.” *Rigby v. Lake City*, 58 Ohio St.3d 269, 271 (1991). The appellate court must limit its review of the trial court’s admission or exclusion of evidence to whether the trial court abused its discretion. *Id.* The abuse of discretion standard is more than an error of judgment; it implies the court ruled arbitrarily, unreasonably, or unconscionably. *Blakemore v. Blakemore*, 5 Ohio St.3d 217 (1983). Generally, all relevant evidence is admissible. Evid.R. 402.\\n\\nEvid.R. 404(B) provides:\\n(B) Other crimes, wrongs or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\\n\\nR.C. 2945.59 provides:\\nIn any criminal case in which the defendant’s motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\\n\\nRule 404(B) of the Ohio Rules of Evidence and R.C. 2945.59 preclude admission of other acts evidence to prove a character trait in order to demonstrate conduct in conformity with that trait. *State v. Williams*, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, ¶16. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts of an accused tending to show the plan with which an act is done may be admissible for other purposes, such as those listed in Evid.R. 404(B); to show “proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.”\\n\\nIn considering other acts evidence, trial courts should conduct a three-step analysis. The first step is to consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Evid.R. 401. Next, the trial court must consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in conformity with the character or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B), proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident. Finally, a trial court is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Evid.R. 403, *Williams*, at ¶¶19-20.\\n\\n“Because R.C. 2945.59 and Evid.R. 404(B) codify an exception to the common law with respect to evidence of other acts of wrongdoing, they must be construed against admissibility, and the standard for determining admissibility of such evidence is strict.” *State v. Broom*, 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 281-82, 533 N.E.2d 682 (1988).\\n\\nAs cautioned by the Ohio Supreme Court in *State v. Lowe*, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 634 N.E.2d 616 (1994), “…we therefore must be careful…to recognize the distinction between evidence which shows that a defendant is the type of person who might commit a particular crime and evidence which shows that a defendant is the person who committed a particular crime.” *Id.* at 530. Evidence to prove the character of person the defendant is to show he acted in conformity therewith is barred by Evid.R. 404(B).\\n\\nWe must first determine whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact of consequence to determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. In *Williams*, the Ohio Supreme Court found testimony of prior acts describing grooming techniques were relevant to show the defendant’s intent was sexual gratification. *Williams*, supra, ¶22. Gross Sexual Imposition, with which the defendant was charged, requires “sexual contact.” R.C. 2907.05(A)(1). R.C. 2907.01 defines “sexual contact” to require the touching be for the purpose of “sexual arousing or gratifying either person.” In the instant case, Appellant was charged with both Rape and Gross Sexual Imposition, making intent of sexual gratification an element which the State must prove.\\n\\nThe second step is to consider whether the evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show conformity therewith, or whether the acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose.\\n\\nIn the case *sub judice*, Appellee was permitted to introduce the testimony of another child Appellant raped in similar fashion to that of ZS and AW, raping young female children living in the same home as Appellant when other adults were not around. In its Judgment Entry dated December 19, 2019, the trial court stated, “the sought-after testimony is relevant because it may tend to prove what the prosecution alleges was the defendant’s motive and intent: to derive sexual gratification from groping and raping children.” We find the legitimate purpose of proving Appellant’s intent to derive sexual gratification from groping and raping children relevant for the charge of Gross Sexual Imposition.\\n\\nThe final step is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. In the case sub judice, the trial court gave a limiting instruction before the testimony, after the testimony, and at the close of trial, that the evidence may not be considered as character evidence and that Appellant acted in accordance with any such character trait. In Williams, the Ohio Supreme Court allowed the testimony because:\\nThe evidence is not unduly prejudicial, because the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence could not be considered to show that Williams had acted in conformity with a character trait. This instruction lessened the prejudicial effect of A.B.’s testimony, and A.B. corroborated J.H.’s testimony about the sexual abuse, which had been denied by Williams. Thus Evid.R. 404(B) permitted admission of evidence of William’s prior crime because it helped to prove motive, preparation, and plan on the part of Williams. The prejudicial effect did not substantially outweigh the probative value of that evidence.134 Ohio St.3d 521, ¶24.\\n\\nIn the case sub judice, the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence could not be considered to show that Appellant had acted in conformity with a character trait. The testimony tended to show Appellant’s motive to show sexual gratification for groping and raping children. The prejudicial effect did not outweigh the probative value of that evidence.\\n\\nMoreover, assuming, arguendo, the trial court erred in admitting testimony from LC and EB, we find any error was harmless. Crim.R. 52(A) defines harmless error as “[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.” Before constitutional error can be considered harmless, we must be able to “declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Where no reasonable possibility exists that the unlawful testimony contributed to a conviction, the error is harmless and therefore will not be grounds for reversal. State v. Lytle, 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 358 N.E.2d 623 (1976), paragraph three of the syllabus, vacated on other grounds in Lytle v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 910, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1978).\\n\\nIn the case at bar, there was overwhelming evidence, as set forth above, of Appellant’s guilt. The two victims testified in detail how Appellant raped them when they were little girls, both recounted multiple specific instances and identified Appellant as their abuser. Accordingly, we find any error in admitting the testimony did not have an impact on the verdict, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the other evidence in the case established Appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\\n\\nc. Prosecutor’s statements during closing arguments.\\n\\nAppellant argues the prosecutor is arguing Appellant is acting in conformity with a character trait when the prosecutor remarked Appellant is attracted to young girls and is motivated to have sexual relations with them. As Appellant did not object to the remarks during closing arguments, he has waived all but plain error. An error not raised in the trial court must be plain error for an appellate court to reverse. *State v. Long*, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978) at paragraph one of the syllabus; Crim.R. 52(B). To prevail under a plain error analysis, Appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different but for the error. *Id.* at paragraph two of the syllabus. Notice of plain error “is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” *Id.* at paragraph three of the syllabus.\\n\\n“A presumption always exists that the jury has followed the instructions given to it by the trial court.” *Pang v. Minch*, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 187, 559 N.E.2d 1313 (1990), at paragraph four of the syllabus, *rehearing denied*, 54 Ohio St.3d 716, 562 N.E.2d 163.\\n\\nAs noted above, the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence could not be considered to show that Appellant had acted in conformity with a character trait. Appellant has not demonstrated that “but for” this isolated statement by the prosecutor, he would not have been convicted of the crimes.\\n\\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of prior acts of child molestation.\\n\\nAppellant’s sole Assignment of Error is overruled.\\n\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Delaware County, Ohio, is hereby affirmed.\\n\\nBy: Wise, John, J.\\n\\nBaldwin, P. J., concurs.\\n\\nWise, Earle, J., concurs separately\\n\\nJWW/br 0322\\n\\nWise, Earle, J., concurs separately.\\n\\n¶ 42 I concur in the judgment of the majority.\\n\\n¶ 43 While I find error, I find it to be harmless and specifically concur with paragraphs 33 and 34 of the majority opinion.\\n\\n¶ 44 I write separately because I find the other-acts evidence should not have been admitted.\\n\\nThe trial court’s December 19, 2019, judgment entry allowed the other-acts evidence because it found the evidence fit several of the exceptions in Evid.R. 404(B) and R.C. 2945.59.\\n\\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of Ohio recently reviewed the admission of other-acts evidence in two cases decided on September 22, 2020; State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, and State v. Smith, --- Ohio St.3d ---, 2020-Ohio-4441, --- N.E.3d ---. In Hartman at ¶ 19, the court sought to “clear up some of the confusion that exists regarding the use of other-acts evidence.” One issue it made clear was that “the admissibility of other-acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) is a question of law.” Id. at ¶ 22. The question of “whether the evidence is offered for an impermissible purpose does not involve the exercise of discretion” and is subject to review de novo. Id. If a permissible nonpropensity purpose is found, the trial court then has discretion to admit other-acts evidence. Id.\\n\\nPURPOSES FOR WHICH OTHER-ACTS EVIDENCE WERE ADMITTED\\n\\nThe trial court considered whether the evidence supported permissible purposes pursuant to R.C. 2945.59 and Evid.R. 404(B) and found several exceptions. In its judgment entry at page 7, the trial court found:\\n\\nThe factual overlap between the prospective testimonies [of the witnesses] may point to a motive and intent: engaging in the sexual abuse of minors for sexual gratification. Detailed other-acts testimony here may help the jury identify [appellant] by a common scheme, plan, system, or modus operandi – a “behavioral fingerprint” – aimed at the targeting, grooming, and raping of children. The testimony about prior acts of child sex abuse may cast significant doubt, too, on the possibility that any of the alleged conduct in the present matter was accidental. (Citation omitted, emphasis added.)\\n\\nThe trial court further defined the purposes of the other-acts evidence in the instructions it gave to the jury prior to deliberation (T. at 955-956):\\n\\nIf you find that the evidence about other acts on the part of the Defendant is true, then you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether that evidence proves: one, the absence of a mistake or an accident on his part on the dates of the crimes at issue in this case; two, his motive or his intent on the dates of the crimes at issue in this case; three, his knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the crimes at issue in this case; or, four, his use of a particular method of selecting, grooming, and sexually abusing minor victims. The evidence about other acts may not be considered by you for any other purpose. (Emphasis added.)\\n\\nANALYSIS OF OTHER-ACTS EVIDENCE\\n\\nThe four nonpropensity reasons for admission of the evidence given by the trial court to the jury will be discussed out of order.\\n\\n1. ABSENCE OF A MISTAKE OR AN ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe trial court first instructed the jury the other-acts evidence may be used to show appellant’s actions were not a mistake nor accidental. Appellant plead not guilty making a general denial of all allegations. He did not testify, nor did the police testify as to statements made by appellant. The record does not reflect any indication he ever claimed mistake or accident. Additionally, the state made no argument that appellant raised a defense claiming the acts were accidental.\\n\\nIn Smith, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed lack of mistake evidence. In Smith, the defendant was charged in 2016 with rape, gross sexual imposition and disseminating matter harmful to a juvenile. The victim was his granddaughter. The allegations were he rubbed oil on her body under her clothes on her chest, buttock and vagina then licked her breast and vagina. He played a pornographic film showing oral and vaginal intercourse. The next morning he pressed his penis into her backside and began to remove her underwear; she moved away and he stop. He denied any of this was for sexual purposes. He admitted that he rubbed lotion on the child’s body, but any inappropriate touching of private parts was accidental. He claimed that if his penis did touch her it was accidental because he tends to get erections in his sleep. He further claimed an R-rated movie accidentally began to play for a few seconds when he attempted to play a cartoon on a DVD. The state sought to admit other-acts evidence from a 1986 allegation that he did similar things to one of his daughters. The Smith court held the prior testimony was admissible to rebut the defendant’s claim that his 2016 acts were accidental, inadvertent or a mistake.\\n\\nIn the instant case there is no such claim by appellant. In Hartman, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio at ¶ 27 stated, “it is not enough to say the evidence is relevant to a nonpropensity purpose. The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a ‘material’ issue that is actually in dispute....”\\n\\nBecause there is no claim of mistake or accident before the jury, there is nothing for the prosecution to rebut on this issue. I find the evidence may not be admitted for a legitimate purpose under this exception to the rule.\\n\\n3. KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE CRIMES\\n\\nThis purpose was not addressed in the trial court’s judgment entry. It is unclear from the record exactly what nonpropensity purpose, “his knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the crimes,” refers to in this case. Typically, this type of other-acts evidence is admitted to show a defendant’s awareness, such as knowledge that he possessed contraband or his awareness of illegal activity. I find under the facts of this case, this is not a permissible purpose to admit other-acts evidence.\\n\\nPURPOSES 2. AND 4.\\n\\nThe next two purposes are the focus of the case as highlighted by the prosecutors’ statements to the jury.\\n\\nIn closing argument, the state told the jury: “So for our purposes, we’re asking that you consider this evidence of other acts on the issues of motive and method. Specifically, his motive and his intent to engage in sexual conduct with minor girls and his method of selecting, grooming, and sexually abusing these minor girls.” T. at 908. Later in rebuttal, the state again argued to the jury how it should use this evidence. “So yes, of course you can consider [L.C.’s] testimony for those purposes that we discussed in our first closing which was to show method and to show motivation that Ron Williams is attracted to underage girls.” T. at 944.\\n\\n4. USE OF A PARTICULAR METHOD OF SELECTING, GROOMING, AND SEXUALLY ABUSING MINOR VICTIMS\\n\\nThe state sought to use the other-acts evidence to show appellant used a particular method of selecting, grooming and abusing his victims. In its judgment entry, the trial court found the other-acts evidence may be helpful to the jury to identify appellant by this common scheme or plan, modus operandi or behavioral fingerprint.\\n\\nThis type of other acts evidence is a permissible purpose if the identity of the actor is an issue in actual dispute. “[Modus operandi] is evidence of signature, fingerprint-like characteristics unique enough ‘to show that the crimes were committed by the same person.’ Evidence of modus operandi is relevant to prove identity.” Hartman, supra, at ¶ 37. (Citations omitted.)\\n\\nIn the instant case there is no question as to who may have done the acts. Both victims were clear the actor was appellant. The only question before the jury was whether the acts occurred. I find the other-acts evidence to prove identity by showing modus operandi or a behavioral fingerprint is not permissible because identity is not in dispute.\\n\\nIn State v. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 330 N.E.2d 720 (1975), the Supreme Court of Ohio discussed the two factual situations where the defendant’s scheme, plan or system pursuant to R.C. 2945.59 is relevant. One is identity, which as discussed above is not at issue here. The other, as cited in Curry at 73 is when:\\n\\n[T]he “other acts” form part of the immediate background of the alleged act which forms the foundation of the crime charged in the indictment.\\n\\nTo be admissible pursuant to this sub-category of ‘scheme, plan or system’ evidence, the ‘other acts’ testimony must concern events which are inextricably related to the alleged criminal act. The July 8, 1972, incident and the December 22, 1972, incident are not so related; they are chronologically and factually separate occurrences.\\n\\nThe Hartman court at ¶ 13 cited Curry to re-emphasize the connection of the other-acts evidence to the current crime:\\n\\nCommon-plan evidence generally concerns events that are “inextricably related’ to the crime charged. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d at 73. The other acts form the “immediate background” of the present crime: they are typically either part of the “same transaction” as the crime for which the defendant is on trial or they are part of “a sequence of events” leading up to the commission of the crime in question.\\n\\nIn Curry there was a five to six-month gap between the charged acts and the other-acts. In our current case there is a at least a seventeen-year gap between the “chronological and factually separate” other-acts and the current charges. I find the other-acts evidence is not admissible pursuant to a common scheme, plan or system exception.\\n\\n2. MOTIVE OR INTENT\\n\\nMotive and intent can be distinct issues. In Hartman at ¶ 48, motive is described as a specific reason for committing a crime. If a person commits a murder to cover up a previous crime, the other-acts evidence of the previous crime may tend to prove the motive for the murder, a permissible nonpropensity purpose. Id. Motive is not typically an element of a criminal offense. Intent is normally an element. Did a person act with the purpose to cause a certain result which culminated in a criminal offense? In the murder example, the motive may be to want a person dead; the intent is the mental purpose to do the act to cause the death (to pull the trigger of a gun). In this case, the trial court and the arguments of the prosecutor appear to treat the terms as one. The evidence was admitted to show appellant’s intent was to derive sexual gratification from the acts alleged in the charge of gross sexual imposition.\\n\\nGenerally, intent is “not a material issue for other-acts purposes unless it is genuinely disputed – in most cases, ‘the act speaks for itself.’ ” Hartman at ¶ 55. However, when the crime charged is one of specific intent, such intent is a material issue in the case. Id. The crime of gross sexual imposition requires the state prove appellant had the specific intent to perform the act(s) for the sexual gratification of himself or another. This is a potential proper purpose for other-acts evidence to be considered. However, based upon the facts of this case, a more thorough examination of the purpose is warranted.\\n\\nThe decision on whether to allow other-acts evidence on the single count of gross sexual imposition should not be considered in a vacuum. Appellant faced sixteen counts of rape as well. The testimony relating to these counts was replete with explicit accounts of sexual conduct that left no question as to appellant’s intent. A single jury heard all of the testimony from both victims. There is certainly an argument, in light of the extensive testimony in the rape counts, that the element of sexual gratification in gross sexual imposition is not in actual dispute.\"\n}\n```"}

When reviewing an argument challenging the weight of the evidence, an appellate court may not substitute its view for that of the trier of fact, but reviews the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses, and determines whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the finder of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), quoting State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983). Because the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses at trial, we must defer to the factfinder’s decisions whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses. *State v. Lawson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4* (Aug. 22, 1997). The fact that the evidence is subject to different interpretations does not render the conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. *State v. Wilson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22581, 2009-Ohio-525, ¶ 14. A judgment of conviction should be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence only in exceptional circumstances. *Martin* at 175. At trial in August 2019, the State’s evidence at trial established the following facts. On September 17, 2018, Breneman was released from prison and placed on post-release control. Parole Officer Chris Caughman reviewed the conditions of Breneman’s post-release control with Breneman, and Breneman signed the document listing those conditions. One of the conditions was that Breneman must obtain the permission of his parole officer before changing his residence. Breneman reported that he would be residing at the home of his parents (his mother and step-father) in Champaign County. Breneman’s step-father testified that he and his wife had resided at that location since 1981. Parole Officer Patrick Powell was assigned as Breneman’s initial supervising parole officer upon Breneman’s release from prison. Breneman was required to meet with Powell the first and third Thursday of each month, plus have random home visits. Powell testified that Breneman was compliant with his post-release control for the remainder of 2018. Powell had one contact with Breneman in January 2019, and they had no contact in February 2019. Powell testified at trial that he last had contact with Breneman on January 22, 2019. Powell stated that he was concerned about the lack of contact, and he repeatedly went by Breneman’s reported residence (Breneman’s parents’ home), but no one answered the door. Powell also left voicemail messages for Breneman that went unreturned. On March 11, 2019, Parole Officer Brandon Deskins was assigned to be Breneman’s parole officer. Deskins attempted to locate Breneman. On April 3 and 4, Deskins went to Breneman’s parents’ home and left business cards in the front door, asking Breneman to contact him. Breneman’s mother had significant health issues, which required her to take multiple medications, including 7.5-325mg Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen tablets, known as Norco. The parties stipulated that Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen is a Schedule II dangerous drug and is a controlled substance. On April 7, Breneman’s step-father picked up her prescription for a 28-day supply of Norco, which consisted of 112 pills. Breneman’s mother kept her Norco pills on a nightstand in the master bedroom of her home. On April 15 or 16, the bottle of Norco pills went missing. Breneman’s step-father testified that, on April 15, his wife called him into the master bedroom and told him that her pills were missing. He stated that he looked for the Norco bottle, but did not find it. Breneman’s step-father indicated that Breneman and two of Breneman’s children (ages 8 and 12) had come to the house that day. Breneman had stayed for approximately 15 minutes. Breneman’s step-father did not see Breneman take the pills. Breneman’s mother believed that the pills went missing on April 16. She recalled Breneman’s being in the master bedroom of her home and asking her if he could have five of her Norco pills. Breneman’s mother told him that he could not, explaining “My medicine is counted out; only get so many for 28 days.” She left Breneman in the master bathroom, brushing his teeth, while she went into the kitchen. Breneman’s mother testified that the Norco pills were in the master bedroom at that time, and she stated that Breneman left 30 seconds after she went into the kitchen. When she returned to the master bedroom to take a Norco pill, she noticed that the pills were gone, and she called to her husband to tell him the pills were missing. Breneman’s mother also did not see Breneman take the pills, but she believed that he did so. Breneman’s step-father did not know exactly how many pills remained in the bottle on April 15. He thought his wife took four to six pills per day. Breneman’s mother also did not know how many pills she had taken, but she estimated that she had taken six to nine pills over the nine days since April 7. She testified that she did not take 50 or 60 pills. The parties stipulated that 30 or more Norco tablets equals or exceeds the bulk amount. On April 18, Parole Officer Deskins received a call from Breneman’s step-father, who expressed concern that Breneman had stolen his wife’s medication. Deskins asked Breneman’s step-father if they had filed a police report, and the step-father indicated that he had not. Deskins told him to contact the police and file a report if they believed a crime had been committed. Deskins testified that Breneman’s step-father further stated that Breneman had not been living at the residence for approximately two weeks. At one point, Breneman’s step-father testified that Breneman had lived at their home prior to April 15, but he had been asked to leave. In different portions of their testimony, Breneman’s parents testified that Breneman lived at their home on April 15. Parole Officer Deskins declared Breneman to be “whereabouts unknown” and in violation of his post-release control. As a result of that designation, the Adult Parole Authority would wait 30 days and then issue an arrest warrant. Deskins testified that Breneman did not contact him personally or through others. Breneman’s mother contacted the police about the missing pills on April 19, the day after her husband spoke with Deskins. At trial, Breneman’s parents explained the delay, indicating that they had hoped the person who took the pills would return them. Officer Tyler Reasor of the Urbana Police Department responded to Breneman’s parents’ home. They reported to Officer Reasor that their son, Breneman, had stolen more than 100 Norco pills. Officer Reasor was informed that only Breneman’s parents and Breneman had been in the house. Officer Reasor attempted to locate Breneman, but was unable to find him. Officer Reasor spoke with Parole Officer Deskins in an attempt to locate Breneman, but Deskins said that he did not know where Breneman was either. In May 2019, Sheila Sanders had a 1995 Toyota Corolla that was titled in her name. Sanders had gotten the vehicle from her sister in January 2019, and had agreed to sell the vehicle to her (Sanders’s) daughter, Lora Smith, for $400. Sanders testified that Smith had fully paid for the vehicle, but the transfer of title was contingent on Smith’s obtaining a valid driver’s license; Smith had not yet obtained one. Smith testified that she considered herself the owner of the Corolla after the last payment was made in March 2019, and that she bought the car for both herself and Breneman, whom she was then dating. Smith testified that she was arrested on March 28, and Breneman had the keys to the Corolla then. She indicated that Breneman was supposed to return the keys to her mother. On May 6, 2019, Sheila Sanders let Breneman borrow the Corolla. Sanders testified that Breneman told her that he wanted to go to Springfield and would bring the car back that night, in a couple hours. Breneman never returned the car. Sanders tried to contact Breneman, but he had left his phone at her home and she was unable to reach him. Sanders and Smith both testified that they spoke about the car, and Smith told Sanders to report the car as stolen. On May 14, a friend of Sanders spotted the Corolla at a gas station, and Sanders contacted the police. On May 14, 2019, Deputy Jayde Sheeley of the Champaign County Sheriff’s Office responded to call from Sheila Sanders, reporting her vehicle missing. Detective Glenn Kemp later reviewed Sheeley’s report and confirmed with Sanders that the vehicle had not been recovered. Kemp also checked with dispatch and learned that the vehicle had been entered into LEADS as stolen. The vehicle was later recovered in the possession of Suluki Evans. Evans testified that Breneman sold him the Corolla for $500 (Evans said that he still owed $200), and that Breneman led him to believe that he (Breneman) had title to the vehicle. After the 30-day period with Breneman listed as “whereabouts unknown” had passed, the Ohio State Highway Patrol issued a warrant for Breneman’s arrest. On May 20, 2019, Officer Seth Dale, a police officer for Wittenberg University, approached Breneman and another individual after seeing them attempt to open a door to a closed building. After checking with dispatch, Officer Dale learned that Breneman had an arrest warrant for a parole violation. Breneman attempted to flee but was quickly apprehended and taken to jail. On May 21, Parole Officer Deskins learned of Breneman’s arrest and interviewed Breneman at the jail about the alleged theft of medication, car theft, and absconding. Breneman denied taking medication from his mother. He told Deskins, “She doesn’t get nothing.” As for the car, Breneman stated that he had borrowed the car many times and it had never been a problem. Breneman told Deskins, “I paid for that car.” Breneman claimed to have returned the car within the next day or two, and he denied knowing where the car was located. When asked about absconding, Breneman told Deskins that he had been living in Springfield on and off at different people’s residences, and mentioned two women. Breneman said that his parents’ home was still his residence, but he was not staying there. Breneman explained that he did not report as required, because “I knew you guys were going to arrest me. I think Patrick Powell was going to arrest me.” After deliberations, the jury found Breneman guilty of the five charged offenses: theft of drugs, aggravated possession of drugs, escape, grand theft of a motor vehicle, and receiving stolen property. With respect to the theft of drugs charge (Count 1), the jury further found that the offense involved a dangerous drug and that Breneman previously was convicted of a felony drug abuse offense. As to the aggravated possession of drugs charge (Count 2), the jury further found that the amount of drug involved was equal to or in excess of the bulk amount. Breneman did not present any witnesses. Rather, through cross-examination, he raised whether his mother, who managed her use of Norco, was often confused and may have misplaced the prescription bottle. Defense counsel also raised that Breneman’s two children could have been present when the Norco pills went missing. Counsel emphasized that Breneman’s mother was unsure of how many pills she had taken from the bottle and how many were left. In reaching its verdict, the jury was free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of each witness and to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented. State v. Baker, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25828, 2014-Ohio-3163, ¶ 28. It was the province of the jury, as the trier of fact, to weigh the evidence and determine whether the State had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Breneman committed each of the charged offenses. Upon review of the testimony of both of Breneman’s parents, the jury could have reasonably concluded that, on or about April 15, Breneman’s mother had her prescription Norco pills on her nightstand, that Breneman stole the pills from the master bedroom, that the amount remaining in the bottle equaled or exceeded the bulk amount, and that the Norco pills were a Schedule II dangerous drug and a controlled substance. The fact that no one observed Breneman take his mother’s Norco medication did not require a different conclusion. Breneman stipulated that he had a prior felony drug abuse offense conviction. The jury’s guilty verdicts as to theft of drugs and aggravated possession of drugs were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\"\n}\n```"}

At trial in August 2019, the State’s evidence at trial established the following facts. On September 17, 2018, Breneman was released from prison and placed on post-release control. Parole Officer Chris Caughman reviewed the conditions of Breneman’s post-release control with Breneman, and Breneman signed the document listing those conditions. One of the conditions was that Breneman must obtain the permission of his parole officer before changing his residence. Breneman reported that he would be residing at the home of his parents (his mother and step-father) in Champaign County. Breneman’s step-father testified that he and his wife had resided at that location since 1981. Parole Officer Patrick Powell was assigned as Breneman’s initial supervising parole officer upon Breneman’s release from prison. Breneman was required to meet with Powell the first and third Thursday of each month, plus have random home visits. Powell testified that Breneman was compliant with his post-release control for the remainder of 2018. Powell had one contact with Breneman in January 2019, and they had no contact in February 2019. Powell testified at trial that he last had contact with Breneman on January 22, 2019. Powell stated that he was concerned about the lack of contact, and he repeatedly went by Breneman’s reported residence (Breneman’s parents’ home), but no one answered the door. Powell also left voicemail messages for Breneman that went unreturned. On March 11, 2019, Parole Officer Brandon Deskins was assigned to be Breneman’s parole officer. Deskins attempted to locate Breneman. On April 3 and 4, Deskins went to Breneman’s parents’ home and left business cards in the front door, asking Breneman to contact him. Breneman’s mother had significant health issues, which required her to take multiple medications, including 7.5-325mg Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen tablets, known as Norco. The parties stipulated that Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen is a Schedule II dangerous drug and is a controlled substance. On April 7, Breneman’s step-father picked up her prescription for a 28-day supply of Norco, which consisted of 112 pills. Breneman’s mother kept her Norco pills on a nightstand in the master bedroom of her home. On April 15 or 16, the bottle of Norco pills went missing. Breneman’s step-father testified that, on April 15, his wife called him into the master bedroom and told him that her pills were missing. He stated that he looked for the Norco bottle, but did not find it. Breneman’s step-father indicated that Breneman and two of Breneman’s children (ages 8 and 12) had come to the house that day. Breneman had stayed for approximately 15 minutes. Breneman’s step-father did not see Breneman take the pills. Breneman’s mother believed that the pills went missing on April 16. She recalled Breneman’s being in the master bedroom of her home and asking her if he could have five of her Norco pills. Breneman’s mother told him that he could not, explaining “My medicine is counted out; only get so many for 28 days.” She left Breneman in the master bathroom, brushing his teeth, while she went into the kitchen. Breneman’s mother testified that the Norco pills were in the master bedroom at that time, and she stated that Breneman left 30 seconds after she went into the kitchen. When she returned to the master bedroom to take a Norco pill, she noticed that the pills were gone, and she called to her husband to tell him the pills were missing. Breneman’s mother also did not see Breneman take the pills, but she believed that he did so. Breneman’s step-father did not know exactly how many pills remained in the bottle on April 15. He thought his wife took four to six pills per day. Breneman’s mother also did not know how many pills she had taken, but she estimated that she had taken six to nine pills over the nine days since April 7. She testified that she did not take 50 or 60 pills. The parties stipulated that 30 or more Norco tablets equals or exceeds the bulk amount. On April 18, Parole Officer Deskins received a call from Breneman’s step-father, who expressed concern that Breneman had stolen his wife’s medication. Deskins asked Breneman’s step-father if they had filed a police report, and the step-father indicated that he had not. Deskins told him to contact the police and file a report if they believed a crime had been committed. Deskins testified that Breneman’s step-father further stated that Breneman had not been living at the residence for approximately two weeks. At one point, Breneman’s step-father testified that Breneman had lived at their home prior to April 15, but he had been asked to leave. In different portions of their testimony, Breneman’s parents testified that Breneman lived at their home on April 15. Parole Officer Deskins declared Breneman to be “whereabouts unknown” and in violation of his post-release control. As a result of that designation, the Adult Parole Authority would wait 30 days and then issue an arrest warrant. Deskins testified that Breneman did not contact him personally or through others. Breneman’s mother contacted the police about the missing pills on April 19, the day after her husband spoke with Deskins. At trial, Breneman’s parents explained the delay, indicating that they had hoped the person who took the pills would return them. Officer Tyler Reasor of the Urbana Police Department responded to Breneman’s parents’ home. They reported to Officer Reasor that their son, Breneman, had stolen more than 100 Norco pills. Officer Reasor was informed that only Breneman’s parents and Breneman had been in the house. Officer Reasor attempted to locate Breneman, but was unable to find him. Officer Reasor spoke with Parole Officer Deskins in an attempt to locate Breneman, but Deskins said that he did not know where Breneman was either.

{"index": "079-JARRELL", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "The trial court erred by prohibiting testimony and evidence relating to Battered Child Syndrome and/or PTSD as said evidence was admissible pursuant to the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in State v. Nemeth.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding Dr. McPherson’s report and her potential testimony, which was relevant to his argument regarding voluntary manslaughter. As the evidence was intended to demonstrate a history of child abuse that triggered Appellant’s sudden passion and fit of rage, he argues this evidence is admissible pursuant to Nemeth. The evidence was also necessary to respond to the state’s repeated commentary on his lack of corroboration regarding his allegations of sexual abuse. The state responds that Dr. McPherson did not diagnose Appellant with battered child syndrome, thus her report and the potential testimony of Appellant’s mother and sister are irrelevant. The state also argues that Appellant did not testify that he acted under a sudden passion or a fit of rage. Even so, the state points out that words are generally insufficient to support a voluntary manslaughter claim. There are four separate evidentiary issues within this assignment of error, including the admissibility of: (1) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving T.J., (2) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving a childhood acquaintance, (3) evidence of a head injury Appellant suffered as a child, and (4) testimony from Appellant’s mother and sister pertaining to the abuse inflicted by T.J. While each argument is related, a distinct analysis of each is required. Appellant was diagnosed with PTSD. According to Dr. McPherson’s report, her diagnosis was based on an interview with Appellant, psychological testing, ancillary information, and an interview with Appellant’s sister. Appellant’s sister spoke to Dr. McPherson about an incident where she observed Appellant and T.J. engaging in inappropriate behavior. The report detailed the alleged sexual abuse of Appellant by T.J. and was consistent with Appellant’s testimony; however, the report provided a more in-depth look at the abuse. The report also addressed abuse Appellant suffered from a childhood acquaintance and a head injury he suffered as a child. These latter two incidents are limited to a few lines in the report. According to the report, Appellant’s coping mechanism involves a high level of emotional reactivity due to the extent of his trauma. The report also noted that Appellant has an issue with male sexuality due to T.J. subjecting him to male partners at a young age. Dr. McPherson found that Appellant’s description of the abuse was consistent with her test results. Based on the testing, Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with major depressive disorder, PTSD as a result of multiple sexual abuse experiences, and substance abuse and dependance. Dr. McPherson opined that the abuse perpetrated by T.J. is considered extreme based on Appellant’s repeated victimization. Child Abuse - T.J. The leading case regarding child abuse that results in the killing of the abuser is Nemeth. In Nemeth, the defendant’s mother violently physically abused him for several years. Id. at 202. On the date of the incident, the defendant’s mother was abusive and, believing his life was in danger, he killed her. The defense sought to introduce a report diagnosing him with PTSD/battered child syndrome for purpose of establishing a self-defense claim and as a justification for a lesser included offense to murder. Id. at 204. At oral argument in the instant case, the state suggested that Nemeth is limited to cases involving violent abuse and does not apply to cases involving sexual abuse. Contrary to the state’s claim, there is no support for the argument that Nemeth is limited to violent abuse, alone. Nemeth clearly articulates a general rule that expert testimony is admissible if it is relevant. While it is true that Nemeth involved violent abuse, nothing within the opinion limits its application to that type of abuse. In fact, the oral arguments in Nemeth relied on a case involving sexual abuse and this is discussed in Nemeth. Nemeth, 82 Ohio St.3d at 207, 694 N.E.2d 1332 (1998), citing State v. Stowers, 81 Ohio St.3d 260, 690 N.E.2d 881 (1998); Nemeth at fn. 1, citing Stowers, supra. While Stowers did not involve the death of the abuser, it did involve the admissibility of expert testimony on the issue of whether a violently abused child fits the general characteristics observed in sexually abused children. Id. at 262. The Nemeth Court applied Stowers’ guiding principles and determined that “[g]eneral information on battered child syndrome would also tend to show that [the defendant’s] behavior was consistent with that of an abused child and would lend support to his testimony that he had been abused both generally and just prior to the killing.” Nemeth at 207, citing Stowers, at 262. If the Nemeth Court found it appropriate to rely on Stowers, then it stands to reason that Nemeth is applicable to sexual abuse cases where expert testimony is offered by the defense. Notably, Nemeth has been applied to several other cases involving sexual abuse. See State v. Butts, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108381, 2020-Ohio-1498; State v. Slaven, 5th Dist. Delaware No. 12 CAA 08 0062, 2013-Ohio-3552; State v. Jennings, 10th Dist. Franklin 2001 WL 1045490 (Sept. 13, 2001). Although none of these cases involved the death of the abuser, their reliance on Nemeth furthers the proposition that this case is not limited to physically violent child abuse claims, but stands for the proposition that if expert testimony is relevant and satisfies Evid.R. 702, it is admissible. Significantly, the Nemeth Court specifically stated that: The defense in this case did not ask that battered child syndrome be recognized as a new defense or an independent justification for the killing of an abusive parent. The proffer made at trial was limited to expert testimony that would explain the psychological effects of long-term child abuse, and was proffered in support of a self-defense theory as well as a charge on voluntary manslaughter. As such, the issue before us is an evidentiary matter and is governed by the Ohio Rules of Evidence. Because there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court's exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant, we need not reach the constitutional issues addressed by the court of appeals. Id. at 206-207. We note that the state relies on State v. Hamad, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2017-T-0108, 2019-Ohio-2664, appeal not allowed, 157 Ohio St.3d 1466, 2019-Ohio-4419, 133 N.E.3d 537. However, Hamad is readily distinguishable from the instant case. In Hamad, the record demonstrated that “there [was] no history of physical abuse between the victims.” Id. at ¶ 98. The record also showed that “[u]ntil the assault and shooting took place on February 25, only verbal threats and harassing behavior had been exchanged” between the defendant and victim. Id. In the instant case, there was an attempt to present evidence of a lengthy history of sexual abuse that appears to span more than two decades. Hamad did not involve either violent physical or sexual abuse. Instead, it involved “an exchange of offensive communications” that led to a physical confrontation. Id. at ¶ 2. The state also argues that Nemeth does not apply because Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with PTSD, not battered child syndrome. This argument ignores the plain language of Nemeth, which explained that battered child syndrome has many labels, including PTSD. The Nemeth Court noted that the psychological effects and behavioral symptoms have long been recognized by the medical and legal professions regardless of which term is used. *Id.* at 206. In the trial court’s decision to grant the state’s motion in this case, the court referenced *Nemeth* but relied on *State v. Fulmer*, 117 Ohio St.3d 319, 2008-Ohio-936, 883 N.E.2d 1052; *State v. Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982); and *State v. Jackson*, 32 Ohio St.2d 203, 291 N.E.2d 432 (1972). In *Fulmer*, the defendant produced expert testimony that he acted under the influence of an aspirin overdose at the time of the incident. The defense attempted to use the evidence to show that he was “metabolically deranged.” *Id.* at ¶ 64. The Court determined that the evidence was relevant to whether the defendant was capable of forming the requisite intent to commit the crime at issue. *Id.* As such, the Court determined the defense was the functional equivalent of a diminished capacity defense, which is not recognized within Ohio. *Id.* at ¶ 69. In *Wilcox*, the defendant attempted to introduce evidence to show that he was “borderline retarded, schizophrenic, dyslexic, and to be suffering from organic brain syndrome.” *Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d at 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982). The Court held that “a defendant may not offer expert psychiatric testimony, unrelated to the insanity defense, to show that the defendant lacked the mental capacity to form the specific mental state required for a particular crime or degree of crime.” *Id.* at 199. In *Jackson*, the defendant similarly attempted to introduce evidence that he was suffering from a mental disease or defect which so impaired his reason at the time of the criminal act that he did not act knowingly. *Id.* at 205-206. In a limited analysis, the Court explained that in order to attack intent based on capacity, a defendant must show that he was either too intoxicated to form intent (a state of unconsciousness) or have such “defect of reason as not to know the nature and quality of the illegal act or that it is wrong (insane).” *Id.* at 206. We note that *Fulmer* was decided after *Nemeth* but does not cite to *Nemeth*. This is because the two cases address wholly separate issues. *Fulmer*, along with *Jackson* and *Wilcox*, address evidence of an impaired mental state which is intended to show that the defendant did not act knowingly, whereas *Nemeth* addresses evidence of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant in order to support either a self-defense instruction or voluntary manslaughter charge. As the evidence in this case was sought in an attempt to show that the history of abuse caused Appellant to become enraged and act with sudden passion, and not to argue that he was so impaired he lacked the ability to understand the nature of his actions, *Nemeth* and not *Fulmer, Jackson*, and *Wilcox*, applies. In accordance with *Nemeth*, such evidence is admissible so long as it is relevant and meets the criteria of Evid.R. 702. *Id.* at 207. Pursuant to Evid.R. 401: “‘Relevant evidence’ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” The state contends that the evidence is irrelevant, relying on *State v. Sallie*, 81 Ohio St.3d 673, 693 N.E.2d 267 (1998). However, *Sallie* is also readily distinguishable from the instant matter. The issue before the *Sallie* Court was whether trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to argue that the defendant suffered from battered woman’s syndrome. At trial, however, the defendant did not claim self-defense. Rather, she claimed the shooting was an accident. As the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental, and not a conscious act of self-defense, the Court concluded that any evidence regarding battered woman’s syndrome was irrelevant. *Id.* at 676. The *Nemeth* Court held that evidence of child abuse is relevant to the determination of whether the accused “had acted with prior calculation and design as charged in the indictment, (2) had acted with purpose as required for the lesser included offense of murder, (3) had created the confrontation or initiated the confrontation or initiated the aggression, and (4) had an honest belief that he was in imminent danger.” *Id.* at 207. Relevant to the instant matter, the *Nemeth* Court also explained that Expert testimony on battered child syndrome would, in this case, tend to enhance the probability that [the defendant’s] account of the facts leading up to the killing was truthful and would lend credibility to his assertion that he was in a state of rage and dissociation at the time of the killing. A diagnosis of battered child syndrome and an explanation of its effects would therefore be relevant in determining whether the case warranted a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter. *Id.* at 207-208. At the outset, it is important to consider the *Nemeth* court’s explanation that “[t]he triggering event for posttraumatic stress disorder can be any traumatic event that involved ‘actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others’ and where the person’s response involved ‘intense fear, helplessness, or horror.” *Id.* at 212. The Court explained that these responses are triggered by an “interpersonal stressor” that can manifest itself in “fear and anxiety, abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control, reenacting or physiologically reexperiencing the abuse, avoidance (often in the form of hypervigilance), helplessness, somatic complaints, and various forms of dissociation.” *Id.* at 213. As in *Nemeth*, Appellant argues that Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony was relevant to lend credence to his account of the facts leading up to the killing and to provide credibility for his assertion that he was in a state of rage at the time of the incident, both of which are aspects of his voluntary manslaughter argument. He also contends that the evidence is admissible to rebut the state’s repeated comments that he could not corroborate his abuse claims, and to dispel any misconceptions the jurors may have had as to why he did not previously inform anyone of the abuse. We begin our review of Appellant’s voluntary manslaughter argument by noting that the trial court did instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. Thus, the trial court implicitly found that Appellant’s testimony, limited as it was, provided a sufficient basis to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction. However, contrary to the state’s contentions, we cannot limit our analysis of Appellant’s voluntary manslaughter argument to his testimony, alone. This is because the question before us is whether Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony would have made a voluntary manslaughter conviction more or less probable. Thus, in determining whether that evidence is relevant, we must also consider the extent of what Dr. McPherson’s report and potential testimony would have added to Appellant’s testimony. In beginning our review of Appellant’s testimony, we first address the state’s assertion that a defendant must specifically state legal “buzzwords” such as “sudden passion” and “fit of rage” within their testimony. This assertion is incorrect. Unlike attorneys, lay members of society tend to lack the legal knowledge and sophistication to articulate these terms. Even without using those specific terms, a defendant can sufficiently demonstrate the concepts by describing emotions, actions, or reactions that emulate this standard. Here, Appellant did not explicitly use the phrases “sudden passion” or “fit of rage” during his testimony. Thus, we review his testimony to determine whether the substance of that testimony established facts that would show “sudden passion” and “a fit of rage.” According to Appellant, T.J. became physical with him, throwing things at him and charging at him with a glass snow globe in her hand. Prior to that, she made sexual advances towards him while becoming verbally abusive. The state discounts the language used by T.J. by arguing that words alone are insufficient to establish sudden passion. While the state is generally correct, this is the point where the expert report and testimony of Dr. McPherson become essential to Appellant’s claims. It is Dr. McPherson’s report that links the decades of sexual abuse and sexual confusion to the import these words and actions had on Appellant’s behavior. For instance, Dr. McPherson’s report states that T.J. used the sexual abuse to “toy” with Appellant. Applied to the events leading up to the killing, T.J placed Appellant’s hand on her crotch, pushed her chest against him and questioned his love for her. Her actions in making sexual advances while questioning his love for her could be construed as “toying” with his emotions. Thus, what is important here are not just the words themselves but also the history of the abuse combined with the sexual advancements and the effect that combination had on Appellant’s emotional state. During the altercation, T.J. questioned Appellant’s sexuality by calling him a “faggot” and telling him he did not know how to be a man. Again, in order to understand the significance of this, Appellant cites to the report where Dr. McPherson opines that T.J. caused sexual confusion in Appellant by subjecting him to male sexual partners at a young age. In other words, Dr. McPherson links the decade of T.J.’s abuse to Appellant’s reaction to T.J.’s words, sexual advances, and physical outburst and explains how this combination could have triggered Appellant, causing him to react in the way that he did, resulting in T.J.’s death. During cross examination, the state responded to Appellant’s description of T.J.’s verbal abuse by asking, “[h]ave you heard of sticks and stones?” (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Appellant responded, “[m]a’am, she is hitting me. With all of her past history, my emotional state at the time --.” (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Before Appellant could finish his sentence, the trial court sustained an objection by the state. It is unclear why the trial court sustained the objection. However, from this limited excerpt it is clear Appellant tried to explain his emotions and why T.J.’s words and actions caused him to react in the manner he did, but he was not permitted to provide that testimony. As discussed at length in Nemeth, testimony of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant is relevant to demonstrate the “triggering event” of PTSD. The event need not rise to the level of threat of death or serious injury but can be “a threat to the physical integrity of self or others.” Id. at 212. The Court explained that this triggering event is relevant to behavior such as “abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control” and various forms of dissociation. *Id.* at 213. We note that in Dr. McPherson’s report she determined that Appellant’s coping mechanism involved a high level of emotional reactivity. The state also repeatedly confronted Appellant with the lack of corroboration of Appellant’s testimony that he was abused by T.J. For instance, the state commented: “[s]o what is [Appellant] going to do? He is going to attack the only person that can contradict his story, the woman he killed. He is going to blame her for his behavior. He is going to tell you through no corroboration that they were having an affair * * *.” (Trial Tr., pp. 778-779.) The prosecution said it was “convenient” that Appellant never filed a police report regarding his abuse nor had any witnesses to corroborate the abuse. (Trial Tr., p., 713.) Again, we note that Appellant’s corroborating witnesses in this regard were not permitted to testify. The state also questioned why none of the witnesses knew of the abuse, despite the fact that the state was aware of the conclusions in Dr. McPherson’s report and that Appellant was prevented from having other witnesses testify. The *Nemeth* Court emphasized that evidence of battered child syndrome is particularly relevant to dispel a juror’s misconception that if abuse had occurred, the victim would have told someone or filed a police report. The Court explained that “[i]t is the lack of corroborating evidence that makes expert testimony even more crucial in these cases. The defense needs expert testimony to refute the seemingly logical conclusion that serious abuse could not be taking place if no one outside the home was aware of it.” *Id.* at 209. In addressing this issue, the case relies on *State v. Gray*, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 26473, 2016-Ohio-5869. *Gray* involved a murder committed by a person who had allegedly suffered sexual abuse earlier in his life. Importantly, the appellant’s victim was not his abuser. The appellant attempted to claim that he killed the victim because he had been abused by someone else, that this abuse caused him to have a violent reaction sufficient to excuse his killing of the victim. The expert report and testimony that was offered concluded that “that the defendant's abnormal mental condition shows that the defendant did not have the specific mental state required for the crime, though he was aware that his action was wrong and was able to control it.” *Id.*, at ¶ 27. The Second District held that the evidence appellant offered: [Did] not fit the rationale given for the exceptions in battered-syndrome cases. Whatever problems [the defendant] has, they are not the result of abuse by [the victim]. Also, [the defendant] does not mention any common misconceptions that [the doctor’s] testimony would dispel. He argues only that her testimony would help the jury understand why the events of his childhood might explain his extreme response to the alleged threat posed by [the victim]. *Id.* at ¶ 32. In other words, the evidence did not show that the defendant suffered “from battered-woman syndrome or battered-child syndrome as a result of abuse at the hands of the ‘victim.’ ” *Id.* at ¶ 31. Instead, he attempted to rely on prior abuse by someone other than the victim to explain why he killed the victim. *Gray* does appear to be an example of a “diminished capacity” case, and as earlier discussed, this theory does not exist in Ohio as a defense. Thus, Gray is clearly distinguishable from the instant matter even though both cases involve sexual abuse. In summation, the admissibility of evidence concerning any kind of abuse is governed by Nemeth. Admission of the evidence in the instant matter was solely sought to explain the psychological effects of the long-term sexual abuse in order to justify and support voluntary manslaughter. The evidence was also relevant to rebut the state’s repeated insistence that Appellant could not corroborate his abuse and the inference that he was lying about the abuse. As the evidence is relevant, the issue becomes whether it is admissible under Evid.R. 702. Pursuant to Evid.R. 702, a witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply: (A) The witness' testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons; (B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony; (C) The witness' testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.* * * As addressed by the Nemeth Court, evidence of battered child syndrome is necessary to assist the jury where there is a lack of corroborating evidence “as a trier of fact is likely to believe that the abuse allegations are fabricated in response to the charges levied against the child-defendant.” *Id.* at 209. Additionally, the Court explained that the evidence assists in helping the jury to understand the effects of the abuse as “[p]rolonged exposure to abuse results in feelings of powerlessness, embarrassment, fear of reprisal, isolation, and low self-esteem.” *Id.* at 208. The same rationale applies to those charged as an adult. *Id.* at 209, citing *Koss, supra.* Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony fall squarely into this category. As to the second prong of Evid.R. 702, the record does not reflect that the state objected to or otherwise questioned Dr. McPherson’s qualifications. Hence, we may infer that the witness satisfied the second prong of the test. As to the third prong, the *Nemeth* Court held that “the behavioral and psychological effects of prolonged child abuse on the child have been generally accepted in the medical and psychiatric communities and therefore unquestionably meet the requisite level of reliability for admission as the subject of expert testimony.” *Id.* at 212. Thus, the evidence is based on scientific information. As to prejudice, the *Nemeth* Court set forth two reasons for their holding: “[b]ecause there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court’s exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant * * *.” *Id.* at 207. It appears axiomatic that a defendant will be prejudiced by the exclusion of otherwise relevant, partially exculpable evidence. To the extent that prejudice must be shown, this jury did not find Appellant guilty of the most serious offenses with which he was charged, aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. Based on the jury’s failure to find Appellant guilty of these two offenses, it can be inferred that jury believed Appellant’s testimony at least in part.

As the evidence was intended to demonstrate a history of child abuse that triggered Appellant’s sudden passion and fit of rage, he argues this evidence is admissible pursuant to Nemeth. The evidence was also necessary to respond to the state’s repeated commentary on his lack of corroboration regarding his allegations of sexual abuse. The state responds that Dr. McPherson did not diagnose Appellant with battered child syndrome, thus her report and the potential testimony of Appellant’s mother and sister are irrelevant. The state also argues that Appellant did not testify that he acted under a sudden passion or a fit of rage. Even so, the state points out that words are generally insufficient to support a voluntary manslaughter claim. There are four separate evidentiary issues within this assignment of error, including the admissibility of: (1) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving T.J., (2) evidence pertaining to sexual abuse involving a childhood acquaintance, (3) evidence of a head injury Appellant suffered as a child, and (4) testimony from Appellant’s mother and sister pertaining to the abuse inflicted by T.J. While each argument is related, a distinct analysis of each is required. Appellant was diagnosed with PTSD. According to Dr. McPherson’s report, her diagnosis was based on an interview with Appellant, psychological testing, ancillary information, and an interview with Appellant’s sister. Appellant’s sister spoke to Dr. McPherson about an incident where she observed Appellant and T.J. engaging in inappropriate behavior. The report detailed the alleged sexual abuse of Appellant by T.J. and was consistent with Appellant’s testimony; however, the report provided a more in-depth look at the abuse. The report also addressed abuse Appellant suffered from a childhood acquaintance and a head injury he suffered as a child. These latter two incidents are limited to a few lines in the report. According to the report, Appellant’s coping mechanism involves a high level of emotional reactivity due to the extent of his trauma. The report also noted that Appellant has an issue with male sexuality due to T.J. subjecting him to male partners at a young age. Dr. McPherson found that Appellant’s description of the abuse was consistent with her test results. Based on the testing, Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with major depressive disorder, PTSD as a result of multiple sexual abuse experiences, and substance abuse and dependance. Dr. McPherson opined that the abuse perpetrated by T.J. is considered extreme based on Appellant’s repeated victimization. Child Abuse - T.J. The leading case regarding child abuse that results in the killing of the abuser is Nemeth. In Nemeth, the defendant’s mother violently physically abused him for several years. Id. at 202. On the date of the incident, the defendant’s mother was abusive and, believing his life was in danger, he killed her. The defense sought to introduce a report diagnosing him with PTSD/battered child syndrome for purpose of establishing a self-defense claim and as a justification for a lesser included offense to murder. Id. at 204. At oral argument in the instant case, the state suggested that Nemeth is limited to cases involving violent abuse and does not apply to cases involving sexual abuse. Contrary to the state’s claim, there is no support for the argument that Nemeth is limited to violent abuse, alone. Nemeth clearly articulates a general rule that expert testimony is admissible if it is relevant. While it is true that Nemeth involved violent abuse, nothing within the opinion limits its application to that type of abuse. In fact, the oral arguments in Nemeth relied on a case involving sexual abuse and this is discussed in Nemeth. Nemeth, 82 Ohio St.3d at 207, 694 N.E.2d 1332 (1998), citing State v. Stowers, 81 Ohio St.3d 260, 690 N.E.2d 881 (1998); Nemeth at fn. 1, citing Stowers, supra. While Stowers did not involve the death of the abuser, it did involve the admissibility of expert testimony on the issue of whether a violently abused child fits the general characteristics observed in sexually abused children. Id. at 262. The Nemeth Court applied Stowers’ guiding principles and determined that “[g]eneral information on battered child syndrome would also tend to show that [the defendant’s] behavior was consistent with that of an abused child and would lend support to his testimony that he had been abused both generally and just prior to the killing.” Nemeth at 207, citing Stowers, at 262. If the Nemeth Court found it appropriate to rely on Stowers, then it stands to reason that Nemeth is applicable to sexual abuse cases where expert testimony is offered by the defense. Notably, Nemeth has been applied to several other cases involving sexual abuse. See State v. Butts, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 108381, 2020-Ohio-1498; State v. Slaven, 5th Dist. Delaware No. 12 CAA 08 0062, 2013-Ohio-3552; State v. Jennings, 10th Dist. Franklin 2001 WL 1045490 (Sept. 13, 2001). Although none of these cases involved the death of the abuser, their reliance on Nemeth furthers the proposition that this case is not limited to physically violent child abuse claims, but stands for the proposition that if expert testimony is relevant and satisfies Evid.R. 702, it is admissible. Significantly, the Nemeth Court specifically stated that: The defense in this case did not ask that battered child syndrome be recognized as a new defense or an independent justification for the killing of an abusive parent. The proffer made at trial was limited to expert testimony that would explain the psychological effects of long-term child abuse, and was proffered in support of a self-defense theory as well as a charge on voluntary manslaughter. As such, the issue before us is an evidentiary matter and is governed by the Ohio Rules of Evidence. Because there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court's exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant, we need not reach the constitutional issues addressed by the court of appeals. Id. at 206-207. We note that the state relies on State v. Hamad, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2017-T-0108, 2019-Ohio-2664, appeal not allowed, 157 Ohio St.3d 1466, 2019-Ohio-4419, 133 N.E.3d 537. However, Hamad is readily distinguishable from the instant case. In Hamad, the record demonstrated that “there [was] no history of physical abuse between the victims.” Id. at ¶ 98. The record also showed that “[u]ntil the assault and shooting took place on February 25, only verbal threats and harassing behavior had been exchanged” between the defendant and victim. Id. In the instant case, there was an attempt to present evidence of a lengthy history of sexual abuse that appears to span more than two decades. Hamad did not involve either violent physical or sexual abuse. Instead, it involved “an exchange of offensive communications” that led to a physical confrontation. Id. at ¶ 2. The state also argues that Nemeth does not apply because Dr. McPherson diagnosed Appellant with PTSD, not battered child syndrome. This argument ignores the plain language of Nemeth, which explained that battered child syndrome has many labels, including PTSD. The Nemeth Court noted that the psychological effects and behavioral symptoms have long been recognized by the medical and legal professions regardless of which term is used. *Id.* at 206. In the trial court’s decision to grant the state’s motion in this case, the court referenced *Nemeth* but relied on *State v. Fulmer*, 117 Ohio St.3d 319, 2008-Ohio-936, 883 N.E.2d 1052; *State v. Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982); and *State v. Jackson*, 32 Ohio St.2d 203, 291 N.E.2d 432 (1972). In *Fulmer*, the defendant produced expert testimony that he acted under the influence of an aspirin overdose at the time of the incident. The defense attempted to use the evidence to show that he was “metabolically deranged.” *Id.* at ¶ 64. The Court determined that the evidence was relevant to whether the defendant was capable of forming the requisite intent to commit the crime at issue. *Id.* As such, the Court determined the defense was the functional equivalent of a diminished capacity defense, which is not recognized within Ohio. *Id.* at ¶ 69. In *Wilcox*, the defendant attempted to introduce evidence to show that he was “borderline retarded, schizophrenic, dyslexic, and to be suffering from organic brain syndrome.” *Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d at 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982). The Court held that “a defendant may not offer expert psychiatric testimony, unrelated to the insanity defense, to show that the defendant lacked the mental capacity to form the specific mental state required for a particular crime or degree of crime.” *Id.* at 199. In *Jackson*, the defendant similarly attempted to introduce evidence that he was suffering from a mental disease or defect which so impaired his reason at the time of the criminal act that he did not act knowingly. *Id.* at 205-206. In a limited analysis, the Court explained that in order to attack intent based on capacity, a defendant must show that he was either too intoxicated to form intent (a state of unconsciousness) or have such “defect of reason as not to know the nature and quality of the illegal act or that it is wrong (insane).” *Id.* at 206. We note that *Fulmer* was decided after *Nemeth* but does not cite to *Nemeth*. This is because the two cases address wholly separate issues. *Fulmer*, along with *Jackson* and *Wilcox*, address evidence of an impaired mental state which is intended to show that the defendant did not act knowingly, whereas *Nemeth* addresses evidence of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant in order to support either a self-defense instruction or voluntary manslaughter charge. As the evidence in this case was sought in an attempt to show that the history of abuse caused Appellant to become enraged and act with sudden passion, and not to argue that he was so impaired he lacked the ability to understand the nature of his actions, *Nemeth* and not *Fulmer, Jackson*, and *Wilcox*, applies. In accordance with *Nemeth*, such evidence is admissible so long as it is relevant and meets the criteria of Evid.R. 702. *Id.* at 207. Pursuant to Evid.R. 401: “‘Relevant evidence’ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” The state contends that the evidence is irrelevant, relying on *State v. Sallie*, 81 Ohio St.3d 673, 693 N.E.2d 267 (1998). However, *Sallie* is also readily distinguishable from the instant matter. The issue before the *Sallie* Court was whether trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to argue that the defendant suffered from battered woman’s syndrome. At trial, however, the defendant did not claim self-defense. Rather, she claimed the shooting was an accident. As the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental, and not a conscious act of self-defense, the Court concluded that any evidence regarding battered woman’s syndrome was irrelevant. *Id.* at 676. The *Nemeth* Court held that evidence of child abuse is relevant to the determination of whether the accused “had acted with prior calculation and design as charged in the indictment, (2) had acted with purpose as required for the lesser included offense of murder, (3) had created the confrontation or initiated the confrontation or initiated the aggression, and (4) had an honest belief that he was in imminent danger.” *Id.* at 207. Relevant to the instant matter, the *Nemeth* Court also explained that Expert testimony on battered child syndrome would, in this case, tend to enhance the probability that [the defendant’s] account of the facts leading up to the killing was truthful and would lend credibility to his assertion that he was in a state of rage and dissociation at the time of the killing. A diagnosis of battered child syndrome and an explanation of its effects would therefore be relevant in determining whether the case warranted a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter. *Id.* at 207-208. At the outset, it is important to consider the *Nemeth* court’s explanation that “[t]he triggering event for posttraumatic stress disorder can be any traumatic event that involved ‘actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others’ and where the person’s response involved ‘intense fear, helplessness, or horror.” *Id.* at 212. The Court explained that these responses are triggered by an “interpersonal stressor” that can manifest itself in “fear and anxiety, abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control, reenacting or physiologically reexperiencing the abuse, avoidance (often in the form of hypervigilance), helplessness, somatic complaints, and various forms of dissociation.” *Id.* at 213. As in *Nemeth*, Appellant argues that Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony was relevant to lend credence to his account of the facts leading up to the killing and to provide credibility for his assertion that he was in a state of rage at the time of the incident, both of which are aspects of his voluntary manslaughter argument. He also contends that the evidence is admissible to rebut the state’s repeated comments that he could not corroborate his abuse claims, and to dispel any misconceptions the jurors may have had as to why he did not previously inform anyone of the abuse. We begin our review of Appellant’s voluntary manslaughter argument by noting that the trial court did instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. Thus, the trial court implicitly found that Appellant’s testimony, limited as it was, provided a sufficient basis to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction. However, contrary to the state’s contentions, we cannot limit our analysis of Appellant’s voluntary manslaughter argument to his testimony, alone. This is because the question before us is whether Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony would have made a voluntary manslaughter conviction more or less probable. Thus, in determining whether that evidence is relevant, we must also consider the extent of what Dr. McPherson’s report and potential testimony would have added to Appellant’s testimony. In beginning our review of Appellant’s testimony, we first address the state’s assertion that a defendant must specifically state legal “buzzwords” such as “sudden passion” and “fit of rage” within their testimony. This assertion is incorrect. Unlike attorneys, lay members of society tend to lack the legal knowledge and sophistication to articulate these terms. Even without using those specific terms, a defendant can sufficiently demonstrate the concepts by describing emotions, actions, or reactions that emulate this standard. Here, Appellant did not explicitly use the phrases “sudden passion” or “fit of rage” during his testimony. Thus, we review his testimony to determine whether the substance of that testimony established facts that would show “sudden passion” and “a fit of rage.” According to Appellant, T.J. became physical with him, throwing things at him and charging at him with a glass snow globe in her hand. Prior to that, she made sexual advances towards him while becoming verbally abusive. The state discounts the language used by T.J. by arguing that words alone are insufficient to establish sudden passion. While the state is generally correct, this is the point where the expert report and testimony of Dr. McPherson become essential to Appellant’s claims. It is Dr. McPherson’s report that links the decades of sexual abuse and sexual confusion to the import these words and actions had on Appellant’s behavior. For instance, Dr. McPherson’s report states that T.J. used the sexual abuse to “toy” with Appellant. Applied to the events leading up to the killing, T.J placed Appellant’s hand on her crotch, pushed her chest against him and questioned his love for her. Her actions in making sexual advances while questioning his love for her could be construed as “toying” with his emotions. Thus, what is important here are not just the words themselves but also the history of the abuse combined with the sexual advancements and the effect that combination had on Appellant’s emotional state. During the altercation, T.J. questioned Appellant’s sexuality by calling him a “faggot” and telling him he did not know how to be a man. Again, in order to understand the significance of this, Appellant cites to the report where Dr. McPherson opines that T.J. caused sexual confusion in Appellant by subjecting him to male sexual partners at a young age. In other words, Dr. McPherson links the decade of T.J.’s abuse to Appellant’s reaction to T.J.’s words, sexual advances, and physical outburst and explains how this combination could have triggered Appellant, causing him to react in the way that he did, resulting in T.J.’s death. During cross examination, the state responded to Appellant’s description of T.J.’s verbal abuse by asking, “[h]ave you heard of sticks and stones?” (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Appellant responded, “[m]a’am, she is hitting me. With all of her past history, my emotional state at the time --.” (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Before Appellant could finish his sentence, the trial court sustained an objection by the state. It is unclear why the trial court sustained the objection. However, from this limited excerpt it is clear Appellant tried to explain his emotions and why T.J.’s words and actions caused him to react in the manner he did, but he was not permitted to provide that testimony. As discussed at length in Nemeth, testimony of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant is relevant to demonstrate the “triggering event” of PTSD. The event need not rise to the level of threat of death or serious injury but can be “a threat to the physical integrity of self or others.” Id. at 212. The Court explained that this triggering event is relevant to behavior such as “abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control” and various forms of dissociation. *Id.* at 213. We note that in Dr. McPherson’s report she determined that Appellant’s coping mechanism involved a high level of emotional reactivity. The state also repeatedly confronted Appellant with the lack of corroboration of Appellant’s testimony that he was abused by T.J. For instance, the state commented: “[s]o what is [Appellant] going to do? He is going to attack the only person that can contradict his story, the woman he killed. He is going to blame her for his behavior. He is going to tell you through no corroboration that they were having an affair * * *.” (Trial Tr., pp. 778-779.) The prosecution said it was “convenient” that Appellant never filed a police report regarding his abuse nor had any witnesses to corroborate the abuse. (Trial Tr., p., 713.) Again, we note that Appellant’s corroborating witnesses in this regard were not permitted to testify. The state also questioned why none of the witnesses knew of the abuse, despite the fact that the state was aware of the conclusions in Dr. McPherson’s report and that Appellant was prevented from having other witnesses testify. The *Nemeth* Court emphasized that evidence of battered child syndrome is particularly relevant to dispel a juror’s misconception that if abuse had occurred, the victim would have told someone or filed a police report. The Court explained that “[i]t is the lack of corroborating evidence that makes expert testimony even more crucial in these cases. The defense needs expert testimony to refute the seemingly logical conclusion that serious abuse could not be taking place if no one outside the home was aware of it.” *Id.* at 209. In addressing this issue, the case relies on *State v. Gray*, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 26473, 2016-Ohio-5869. *Gray* involved a murder committed by a person who had allegedly suffered sexual abuse earlier in his life. Importantly, the appellant’s victim was not his abuser. The appellant attempted to claim that he killed the victim because he had been abused by someone else, that this abuse caused him to have a violent reaction sufficient to excuse his killing of the victim. The expert report and testimony that was offered concluded that “that the defendant's abnormal mental condition shows that the defendant did not have the specific mental state required for the crime, though he was aware that his action was wrong and was able to control it.” *Id.*, at ¶ 27. The Second District held that the evidence appellant offered: [Did] not fit the rationale given for the exceptions in battered-syndrome cases. Whatever problems [the defendant] has, they are not the result of abuse by [the victim]. Also, [the defendant] does not mention any common misconceptions that [the doctor’s] testimony would dispel. He argues only that her testimony would help the jury understand why the events of his childhood might explain his extreme response to the alleged threat posed by [the victim]. *Id.* at ¶ 32. In other words, the evidence did not show that the defendant suffered “from battered-woman syndrome or battered-child syndrome as a result of abuse at the hands of the ‘victim.’ ” *Id.* at ¶ 31. Instead, he attempted to rely on prior abuse by someone other than the victim to explain why he killed the victim. *Gray* does appear to be an example of a “diminished capacity” case, and as earlier discussed, this theory does not exist in Ohio as a defense. Thus, Gray is clearly distinguishable from the instant matter even though both cases involve sexual abuse. In summation, the admissibility of evidence concerning any kind of abuse is governed by Nemeth. Admission of the evidence in the instant matter was solely sought to explain the psychological effects of the long-term sexual abuse in order to justify and support voluntary manslaughter. The evidence was also relevant to rebut the state’s repeated insistence that Appellant could not corroborate his abuse and the inference that he was lying about the abuse. As the evidence is relevant, the issue becomes whether it is admissible under Evid.R. 702. Pursuant to Evid.R. 702, a witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply: (A) The witness' testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons; (B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony; (C) The witness' testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.* * * As addressed by the Nemeth Court, evidence of battered child syndrome is necessary to assist the jury where there is a lack of corroborating evidence “as a trier of fact is likely to believe that the abuse allegations are fabricated in response to the charges levied against the child-defendant.” *Id.* at 209. Additionally, the Court explained that the evidence assists in helping the jury to understand the effects of the abuse as “[p]rolonged exposure to abuse results in feelings of powerlessness, embarrassment, fear of reprisal, isolation, and low self-esteem.” *Id.* at 208. The same rationale applies to those charged as an adult. *Id.* at 209, citing *Koss, supra.* Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony fall squarely into this category. As to the second prong of Evid.R. 702, the record does not reflect that the state objected to or otherwise questioned Dr. McPherson’s qualifications. Hence, we may infer that the witness satisfied the second prong of the test. As to the third prong, the *Nemeth* Court held that “the behavioral and psychological effects of prolonged child abuse on the child have been generally accepted in the medical and psychiatric communities and therefore unquestionably meet the requisite level of reliability for admission as the subject of expert testimony.” *Id.* at 212. Thus, the evidence is based on scientific information. As to prejudice, the *Nemeth* Court set forth two reasons for their holding: “[b]ecause there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court’s exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant * * *.” *Id.* at 207. It appears axiomatic that a defendant will be prejudiced by the exclusion of otherwise relevant, partially exculpable evidence. To the extent that prejudice must be shown, this jury did not find Appellant guilty of the most serious offenses with which he was charged, aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. Based on the jury’s failure to find Appellant guilty of these two offenses, it can be inferred that jury believed Appellant’s testimony at least in part. Based on the jury’s reluctance to convict Appellant on the most serious offenses, the improperly excluded evidence could very well have resulted in a conviction on voluntary manslaughter instead of murder. Thus, this record reveals that Appellant was prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence.\"\n}\n```"}

In *Wilcox*, the defendant attempted to introduce evidence to show that he was “borderline retarded, schizophrenic, dyslexic, and to be suffering from organic brain syndrome.” *Wilcox*, 70 Ohio St.2d at 182, 436 N.E.2d 523 (1982). The Court held that “a defendant may not offer expert psychiatric testimony, unrelated to the insanity defense, to show that the defendant lacked the mental capacity to form the specific mental state required for a particular crime or degree of crime.” *Id.* at 199. In *Jackson*, the defendant similarly attempted to introduce evidence that he was suffering from a mental disease or defect which so impaired his reason at the time of the criminal act that he did not act knowingly. *Id.* at 205-206. In a limited analysis, the Court explained that in order to attack intent based on capacity, a defendant must show that he was either too intoxicated to form intent (a state of unconsciousness) or have such “defect of reason as not to know the nature and quality of the illegal act or that it is wrong (insane).” *Id.* at 206. We note that *Fulmer* was decided after *Nemeth* but does not cite to *Nemeth*. This is because the two cases address wholly separate issues. *Fulmer*, along with *Jackson* and *Wilcox*, address evidence of an impaired mental state which is intended to show that the defendant did not act knowingly, whereas *Nemeth* addresses evidence of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant in order to support either a self-defense instruction or voluntary manslaughter charge. As the evidence in this case was sought in an attempt to show that the history of abuse caused Appellant to become enraged and act with sudden passion, and not to argue that he was so impaired he lacked the ability to understand the nature of his actions, *Nemeth* and not *Fulmer, Jackson*, and *Wilcox*, applies. In accordance with *Nemeth*, such evidence is admissible so long as it is relevant and meets the criteria of Evid.R. 702. *Id.* at 207. Pursuant to Evid.R. 401: “‘Relevant evidence’ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” The state contends that the evidence is irrelevant, relying on *State v. Sallie*, 81 Ohio St.3d 673, 693 N.E.2d 267 (1998). However, *Sallie* is also readily distinguishable from the instant matter. The issue before the *Sallie* Court was whether trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to argue that the defendant suffered from battered woman’s syndrome. At trial, however, the defendant did not claim self-defense. Rather, she claimed the shooting was an accident. As the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental, and not a conscious act of self-defense, the Court concluded that any evidence regarding battered woman’s syndrome was irrelevant. *Id.* at 676. The *Nemeth* Court held that evidence of child abuse is relevant to the determination of whether the accused “had acted with prior calculation and design as charged in the indictment, (2) had acted with purpose as required for the lesser included offense of murder, (3) had created the confrontation or initiated the confrontation or initiated the aggression, and (4) had an honest belief that he was in imminent danger.” *Id.* at 207. Relevant to the instant matter, the *Nemeth* Court also explained that Expert testimony on battered child syndrome would, in this case, tend to enhance the probability that [the defendant’s] account of the facts leading up to the killing was truthful and would lend credibility to his assertion that he was in a state of rage and dissociation at the time of the killing. A diagnosis of battered child syndrome and an explanation of its effects would therefore be relevant in determining whether the case warranted a jury charge on voluntary manslaughter. *Id.* at 207-208. At the outset, it is important to consider the *Nemeth* court’s explanation that “[t]he triggering event for posttraumatic stress disorder can be any traumatic event that involved ‘actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others’ and where the person’s response involved ‘intense fear, helplessness, or horror.” *Id.* at 212. The Court explained that these responses are triggered by an “interpersonal stressor” that can manifest itself in “fear and anxiety, abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control, reenacting or physiologically reexperiencing the abuse, avoidance (often in the form of hypervigilance), helplessness, somatic complaints, and various forms of dissociation.” *Id.* at 213. As in *Nemeth*, Appellant argues that Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony was relevant to lend credence to his account of the facts leading up to the killing and to provide credibility for his assertion that he was in a state of rage at the time of the incident, both of which are aspects of his voluntary manslaughter argument. He also contends that the evidence is admissible to rebut the state’s repeated comments that he could not corroborate his abuse claims, and to dispel any misconceptions the jurors may have had as to why he did not previously inform anyone of the abuse. We begin our review of Appellant’s voluntary manslaughter argument by noting that the trial court did instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. Thus, the trial court implicitly found that Appellant’s testimony, limited as it was, provided a sufficient basis to warrant a voluntary manslaughter instruction. However, contrary to the state’s contentions, we cannot limit our analysis of Appellant’s voluntary manslaughter argument to his testimony, alone. This is because the question before us is whether Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony would have made a voluntary manslaughter conviction more or less probable. Thus, in determining whether that evidence is relevant, we must also consider the extent of what Dr. McPherson’s report and potential testimony would have added to Appellant’s testimony. In beginning our review of Appellant’s testimony, we first address the state’s assertion that a defendant must specifically state legal “buzzwords” such as “sudden passion” and “fit of rage” within their testimony. This assertion is incorrect. Unlike attorneys, lay members of society tend to lack the legal knowledge and sophistication to articulate these terms. Even without using those specific terms, a defendant can sufficiently demonstrate the concepts by describing emotions, actions, or reactions that emulate this standard. Here, Appellant did not explicitly use the phrases “sudden passion” or “fit of rage” during his testimony. Thus, we review his testimony to determine whether the substance of that testimony established facts that would show “sudden passion” and “a fit of rage.” According to Appellant, T.J. became physical with him, throwing things at him and charging at him with a glass snow globe in her hand. Prior to that, she made sexual advances towards him while becoming verbally abusive. The state discounts the language used by T.J. by arguing that words alone are insufficient to establish sudden passion. While the state is generally correct, this is the point where the expert report and testimony of Dr. McPherson become essential to Appellant’s claims. It is Dr. McPherson’s report that links the decades of sexual abuse and sexual confusion to the import these words and actions had on Appellant’s behavior. For instance, Dr. McPherson’s report states that T.J. used the sexual abuse to “toy” with Appellant. Applied to the events leading up to the killing, T.J placed Appellant’s hand on her crotch, pushed her chest against him and questioned his love for her. Her actions in making sexual advances while questioning his love for her could be construed as “toying” with his emotions. Thus, what is important here are not just the words themselves but also the history of the abuse combined with the sexual advancements and the effect that combination had on Appellant’s emotional state. During the altercation, T.J. questioned Appellant’s sexuality by calling him a “faggot” and telling him he did not know how to be a man. Again, in order to understand the significance of this, Appellant cites to the report where Dr. McPherson opines that T.J. caused sexual confusion in Appellant by subjecting him to male sexual partners at a young age. In other words, Dr. McPherson links the decade of T.J.’s abuse to Appellant’s reaction to T.J.’s words, sexual advances, and physical outburst and explains how this combination could have triggered Appellant, causing him to react in the way that he did, resulting in T.J.’s death. During cross examination, the state responded to Appellant’s description of T.J.’s verbal abuse by asking, “[h]ave you heard of sticks and stones?” (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Appellant responded, “[m]a’am, she is hitting me. With all of her past history, my emotional state at the time --.” (Trial Tr., p. 704.) Before Appellant could finish his sentence, the trial court sustained an objection by the state. It is unclear why the trial court sustained the objection. However, from this limited excerpt it is clear Appellant tried to explain his emotions and why T.J.’s words and actions caused him to react in the manner he did, but he was not permitted to provide that testimony. As discussed at length in Nemeth, testimony of an abusive relationship between the victim and defendant is relevant to demonstrate the “triggering event” of PTSD. The event need not rise to the level of threat of death or serious injury but can be “a threat to the physical integrity of self or others.” Id. at 212. The Court explained that this triggering event is relevant to behavior such as “abnormal expressions of aggression or impaired impulse control” and various forms of dissociation. *Id.* at 213. We note that in Dr. McPherson’s report she determined that Appellant’s coping mechanism involved a high level of emotional reactivity. The state also repeatedly confronted Appellant with the lack of corroboration of Appellant’s testimony that he was abused by T.J. For instance, the state commented: “[s]o what is [Appellant] going to do? He is going to attack the only person that can contradict his story, the woman he killed. He is going to blame her for his behavior. He is going to tell you through no corroboration that they were having an affair * * *.” (Trial Tr., pp. 778-779.) The prosecution said it was “convenient” that Appellant never filed a police report regarding his abuse nor had any witnesses to corroborate the abuse. (Trial Tr., p., 713.) Again, we note that Appellant’s corroborating witnesses in this regard were not permitted to testify. The state also questioned why none of the witnesses knew of the abuse, despite the fact that the state was aware of the conclusions in Dr. McPherson’s report and that Appellant was prevented from having other witnesses testify. The *Nemeth* Court emphasized that evidence of battered child syndrome is particularly relevant to dispel a juror’s misconception that if abuse had occurred, the victim would have told someone or filed a police report. The Court explained that “[i]t is the lack of corroborating evidence that makes expert testimony even more crucial in these cases. The defense needs expert testimony to refute the seemingly logical conclusion that serious abuse could not be taking place if no one outside the home was aware of it.” *Id.* at 209. In addressing this issue, the case relies on *State v. Gray*, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 26473, 2016-Ohio-5869. *Gray* involved a murder committed by a person who had allegedly suffered sexual abuse earlier in his life. Importantly, the appellant’s victim was not his abuser. The appellant attempted to claim that he killed the victim because he had been abused by someone else, that this abuse caused him to have a violent reaction sufficient to excuse his killing of the victim. The expert report and testimony that was offered concluded that “that the defendant's abnormal mental condition shows that the defendant did not have the specific mental state required for the crime, though he was aware that his action was wrong and was able to control it.” *Id.*, at ¶ 27. The Second District held that the evidence appellant offered: [Did] not fit the rationale given for the exceptions in battered-syndrome cases. Whatever problems [the defendant] has, they are not the result of abuse by [the victim]. Also, [the defendant] does not mention any common misconceptions that [the doctor’s] testimony would dispel. He argues only that her testimony would help the jury understand why the events of his childhood might explain his extreme response to the alleged threat posed by [the victim]. *Id.* at ¶ 32. In other words, the evidence did not show that the defendant suffered “from battered-woman syndrome or battered-child syndrome as a result of abuse at the hands of the ‘victim.’ ” *Id.* at ¶ 31. Instead, he attempted to rely on prior abuse by someone other than the victim to explain why he killed the victim. *Gray* does appear to be an example of a “diminished capacity” case, and as earlier discussed, this theory does not exist in Ohio as a defense. Thus, Gray is clearly distinguishable from the instant matter even though both cases involve sexual abuse. In summation, the admissibility of evidence concerning any kind of abuse is governed by Nemeth. Admission of the evidence in the instant matter was solely sought to explain the psychological effects of the long-term sexual abuse in order to justify and support voluntary manslaughter. The evidence was also relevant to rebut the state’s repeated insistence that Appellant could not corroborate his abuse and the inference that he was lying about the abuse. As the evidence is relevant, the issue becomes whether it is admissible under Evid.R. 702. Pursuant to Evid.R. 702, a witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply: (A) The witness' testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons; (B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony; (C) The witness' testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.* * * As addressed by the Nemeth Court, evidence of battered child syndrome is necessary to assist the jury where there is a lack of corroborating evidence “as a trier of fact is likely to believe that the abuse allegations are fabricated in response to the charges levied against the child-defendant.” *Id.* at 209. Additionally, the Court explained that the evidence assists in helping the jury to understand the effects of the abuse as “[p]rolonged exposure to abuse results in feelings of powerlessness, embarrassment, fear of reprisal, isolation, and low self-esteem.” *Id.* at 208. The same rationale applies to those charged as an adult. *Id.* at 209, citing *Koss, supra.* Dr. McPherson’s report and testimony fall squarely into this category. As to the second prong of Evid.R. 702, the record does not reflect that the state objected to or otherwise questioned Dr. McPherson’s qualifications. Hence, we may infer that the witness satisfied the second prong of the test. As to the third prong, the *Nemeth* Court held that “the behavioral and psychological effects of prolonged child abuse on the child have been generally accepted in the medical and psychiatric communities and therefore unquestionably meet the requisite level of reliability for admission as the subject of expert testimony.” *Id.* at 212. Thus, the evidence is based on scientific information. As to prejudice, the *Nemeth* Court set forth two reasons for their holding: “[b]ecause there was no basis for excluding the testimony under the Rules of Evidence, and because we find that the trial court’s exclusion of this testimony to be prejudicial to the defendant * * *.” *Id.* at 207. It appears axiomatic that a defendant will be prejudiced by the exclusion of otherwise relevant, partially exculpable evidence. To the extent that prejudice must be shown, this jury did not find Appellant guilty of the most serious offenses with which he was charged, aggravated murder and aggravated robbery. Based on the jury’s failure to find Appellant guilty of these two offenses, it can be inferred that jury believed Appellant’s testimony at least in part. Based on the jury’s reluctance to convict Appellant on the most serious offenses, the improperly excluded evidence could very well have resulted in a conviction on voluntary manslaughter instead of murder. Thus, this record reveals that Appellant was prejudiced by the exclusion of the evidence.\"\n}\n```"}

Seneca Nos. 13-12-26, 13-13-04, 2013-Ohio-4975, ¶ 25. ‘A person has ‘actual possession’ of an item if the item is within his immediate physical possession.’ State v. Watts, 3rd Dist.

Specifically, Kunkleman testified that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:20 a.m., he was dispatched to a report of a suspicious vehicle sitting in the parking lot of 234 North Main Street. (Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol. I at 63-64). Kunkleman pulled up behind the vehicle to run the plates, and noticed that an African-American male was sitting in the driver’s seat. (*Id.* at 66). The male, who was later identified as Appellant, was the sole individual in the vehicle. (*Id.*). As Kunkleman exited his vehicle, Appellant exited the vehicle in which he was sitting. (Id. at 67). Appellant then began walking towards Kunkleman, and refused to engage him in conversation. (Id.). Shortly thereafter, Appellant turned around and walked back to towards the vehicle. (Id.). Kunkleman followed Appellant back to the vehicle, and noticed the overwhelming smell of marijuana coming from the car. (Id. at 68). Appellant was observed leaning into the driver’s compartment and grabbing at something on the floorboard. (Id.). Appellant refused to comply with Kunkleman’s request to exit the vehicle, and as a result Kunkleman pulled him away from the vehicle for officer safety. (Id.). Hillard, who had arrived at the scene simultaneously with Kunkleman, looked inside the vehicle and found a paper bag with cocaine in it sticking out from under the driver’s seat. (Id. at 66, 71). Upon searching the center armrest, Kunkleman found a baggie that contained heroin inside it. (Id. at 71). Upon conducting a pat down of Appellant for officer safety, a large amount of money (over $5,000) was located on Appellant’s person. (Id. at 70).\\n\\n{¶52} This evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, could lead a rational trier of fact to find that Appellant had constructive possession of the drugs in the vehicle. Appellant was the only person in the vehicle at the time of the stop. Further, the drugs in the vehicle were located on the driver’s side floorboard and the center console, in the proximity of Appellant’s position as the driver. While proximity to drugs alone is insufficient to establish constructive possession, proximity to the object does constitute some evidence of constructive possession. State v. Rodgers, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-10-35, 2011-Ohio-3003, ¶ 30. Lastly, Appellant’s furtive movements in the area where the cocaine was located is indicative of knowledge and possession.\\n\\n{¶53} Given Appellant’s conduct and the attending facts, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2014 0118.\\n\\n*Analysis – Case Number CR 2015 0361*\\n\\n{¶54} Pertinent to this appeal, in case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant was found guilty in Count I of possession of drugs (cocaine), guilty in Count II of possession of drugs (heroin), and guilty in Count III of possession of drugs (marijuana), all in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which states:\\n\\n(A) No person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.\\n\\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2925.11(A).\\n\\n{¶55} In Count IV, Appellant was charged with illegal cultivation of marijuana, in violation of R.C. 2925.04(A), which states:\\n\\n(A) No person shall knowingly cultivate marihuana or knowingly manufacture or otherwise engage in any part of the production of a controlled substance.\\n\\nR.C. 2925.04(A).\\n\\nIn Count V, Appellant was charged with having weapons while under disability, in violation of R.C. 2923.13(A)(3), which states:\\n\\n(A) Unless relieved from disability under operation of law or legal process, no person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any firearm or dangerous ordnance, if any of the following apply:\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n(3) The person is under indictment for or has been convicted of any felony offense involving the illegal possession, use, sale, administration, distribution, or trafficking in any drug of abuse or has been adjudicated a delinquent child for the commission of an offense that, if committed by an adult, would have been a felony offense involving the illegal possession, use, sale, administration, distribution, or trafficking in any drug of abuse.\\n\\nR.C. 2923.13(A)(3).\\n\\nIn support of his sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge, Appellant argues that the State failed to provide evidence that linked Appellant with the contraband found at 1222 Catalpa Street. We find otherwise. Specifically, testimony at trial revealed that after Appellant was arrested, Appellant told law enforcement officials that: ‘I don’t live here. I’m just seeing a girl.’ (Trial, 08/02/2017 Tr., Vol. I, at 145). But, when law enforcement questioned Appellant about the ‘girl,’ Appellant wasn’t able to provide any information about her to law enforcement. (Id.).\\n\\nMoreover, after the search warrant was executed, authorities found a book bag in a bedroom closet that contained: a VISA gift card with Appellant’s name on it; a medical marijuana card with Appellant’s personal identifiers on it; a Huntington Bank VISA card with Appellant’s name on it; and Appellant’s social security card and birth certificate. (Id., Vol. II at 242). Also located within the residence were three handguns. (Id., Vol. I 187-88). Authorities failed to find any women’s or children’s clothing in the residence. (Id., Vol. II at 245). Contrary to Appellant’s argument on appeal, there was competent and credible evidence that Appellant was the sole occupant of 1222 Catalpa Street at the time of the arrest, the protective sweep, and when the search occurred in the residence. We find that Appellant’s theory of possession is inconsistent with the evidence.\\n\\n{¶59} After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes charged proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant’s first assignment of error in its entirety.\"\n}\n```"}

Seneca Nos. 13-12-26, 13-13-04, 2013-Ohio-4975, ¶ 25. ‘A person has ‘actual possession’ of an item if the item is within his immediate physical possession.’ State v. Watts, 3rd Dist.

Specifically, Kunkleman testified that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:20 a.m., he was dispatched to a report of a suspicious vehicle sitting in the parking lot of 234 North Main Street. (Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol. I at 63-64). Kunkleman pulled up behind the vehicle to run the plates, and noticed that an African-American male was sitting in the driver’s seat. (*Id.* at 66). The male, who was later identified as Appellant, was the sole individual in the vehicle. (*Id.*). As Kunkleman exited his vehicle, Appellant exited the vehicle in which he was sitting. (Id. at 67). Appellant then began walking towards Kunkleman, and refused to engage him in conversation. (Id.). Shortly thereafter, Appellant turned around and walked back to towards the vehicle. (Id.). Kunkleman followed Appellant back to the vehicle, and noticed the overwhelming smell of marijuana coming from the car. (Id. at 68). Appellant was observed leaning into the driver’s compartment and grabbing at something on the floorboard. (Id.). Appellant refused to comply with Kunkleman’s request to exit the vehicle, and as a result Kunkleman pulled him away from the vehicle for officer safety. (Id.). Hillard, who had arrived at the scene simultaneously with Kunkleman, looked inside the vehicle and found a paper bag with cocaine in it sticking out from under the driver’s seat. (Id. at 66, 71). Upon searching the center armrest, Kunkleman found a baggie that contained heroin inside it. (Id. at 71). Upon conducting a pat down of Appellant for officer safety, a large amount of money (over $5,000) was located on Appellant’s person. (Id. at 70).\\n\\n{¶52} This evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, could lead a rational trier of fact to find that Appellant had constructive possession of the drugs in the vehicle. Appellant was the only person in the vehicle at the time of the stop. Further, the drugs in the vehicle were located on the driver’s side floorboard and the center console, in the proximity of Appellant’s position as the driver. While proximity to drugs alone is insufficient to establish constructive possession, proximity to the object does constitute some evidence of constructive possession. State v. Rodgers, 3rd Dist.

The male, who was later identified as Appellant, was the sole individual in the vehicle. (*Id.*). As Kunkleman exited his vehicle, Appellant exited the vehicle in which he was sitting. (Id. at 67). Appellant then began walking towards Kunkleman, and refused to engage him in conversation. (Id.). Shortly thereafter, Appellant turned around and walked back to towards the vehicle. (Id.). Kunkleman followed Appellant back to the vehicle, and noticed the overwhelming smell of marijuana coming from the car. (Id. at 68). Appellant was observed leaning into the driver’s compartment and grabbing at something on the floorboard. (Id.). Appellant refused to comply with Kunkleman’s request to exit the vehicle, and as a result Kunkleman pulled him away from the vehicle for officer safety. (Id.). Hillard, who had arrived at the scene simultaneously with Kunkleman, looked inside the vehicle and found a paper bag with cocaine in it sticking out from under the driver’s seat. (Id. at 66, 71). Upon searching the center armrest, Kunkleman found a baggie that contained heroin inside it. (Id. at 71). Upon conducting a pat down of Appellant for officer safety, a large amount of money (over $5,000) was located on Appellant’s person. (Id. at 70).\\n\\n{¶52} This evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, could lead a rational trier of fact to find that Appellant had constructive possession of the drugs in the vehicle. Appellant was the only person in the vehicle at the time of the stop. Further, the drugs in the vehicle were located on the driver’s side floorboard and the center console, in the proximity of Appellant’s position as the driver. While proximity to drugs alone is insufficient to establish constructive possession, proximity to the object does constitute some evidence of constructive possession. State v. Rodgers, 3rd Dist. Hancock No. 5-10-35, 2011-Ohio-3003, ¶ 30. Lastly, Appellant’s furtive movements in the area where the cocaine was located is indicative of knowledge and possession.\\n\\n{¶53} Given Appellant’s conduct and the attending facts, we conclude that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2014 0118.\\n\\n*Analysis – Case Number CR 2015 0361*\\n\\n{¶54} Pertinent to this appeal, in case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant was found guilty in Count I of possession of drugs (cocaine), guilty in Count II of possession of drugs (heroin), and guilty in Count III of possession of drugs (marijuana), all in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), which states:\\n\\n(A) No person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.\\n\\n(Emphasis added).

We find otherwise. Specifically, testimony at trial revealed that after Appellant was arrested, Appellant told law enforcement officials that: ‘I don’t live here. I’m just seeing a girl.’ (Trial, 08/02/2017 Tr., Vol. I, at 145). But, when law enforcement questioned Appellant about the ‘girl,’ Appellant wasn’t able to provide any information about her to law enforcement. (Id.).\\n\\nMoreover, after the search warrant was executed, authorities found a book bag in a bedroom closet that contained: a VISA gift card with Appellant’s name on it; a medical marijuana card with Appellant’s personal identifiers on it; a Huntington Bank VISA card with Appellant’s name on it; and Appellant’s social security card and birth certificate. (Id., Vol. II at 242). Also located within the residence were three handguns. (Id., Vol. I 187-88). Authorities failed to find any women’s or children’s clothing in the residence. (Id., Vol. II at 245). Contrary to Appellant’s argument on appeal, there was competent and credible evidence that Appellant was the sole occupant of 1222 Catalpa Street at the time of the arrest, the protective sweep, and when the search occurred in the residence. We find that Appellant’s theory of possession is inconsistent with the evidence.\\n\\n{¶59} After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes charged proven beyond a reasonable doubt in case number CR 2015 0361.

See R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b). To prove rape in count three, the state had to prove that Svoboda, by force or threat of force, compelled A.S. to engage in sexual conduct.

We disagree. Under the doctrine of cumulative error, '[s]eparately harmless errors may violate a defendant's right to a fair trial when the errors are considered together.' State v. Harris, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19796, 2004-Ohio-3570, ¶ 40, citing State v. Madrigal, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 397, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000). 'In order to find cumulative error, we first must find that multiple errors were committed at trial.' Id. 'A conviction will be reversed when the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the numerous instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute cause for reversal.' State v. Powell, 132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, ¶ 223, citing State v. DeMarco, 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus. Voir Dire Appellant makes two arguments under this first assignment of error. In the first he argues the trial court improperly permitted the state to present factual elements of its case during voir dire over his counsel's objection. We disagree. Because the scope of voir dire lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, we review Appellant's argument for an abuse of discretion. State v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, ¶ 28. In order to find an abuse of discretion, we must determine the trial court's decision was unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). 'The scope of voir dire * * * varies depending on the circumstances of each case.' State v. Bedford, 39 Ohio St.3d 122, 129, 529 N.E.2d 913 (1988). A prosecutor has a right to give an overview of the facts of the case and of those involved in order to ascertain whether prospective jurors know anything about the offense. State v. Tyler, 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 32, 553 N.E.2d 576 (1990). While jurors must be impartial, they need not be completely ignorant of the facts and issues involved in a case to be qualified as jurors. State v. Gross, 97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, ¶ 38. 'The purpose of voir dire is not to establish how a juror will vote on the case to be tried; it is to discover whether any juror has a bias that would prevent him or her from individually weighing the facts of the case.' State v. Madison, 160 Ohio St.3d 232, 2020-Ohio-3735, 155 N.E.3d 867, ¶ 24. In support of his argument that the trial court erred in permitting the state to present factual evidence of its case during voir dire over his counsel's objection, Appellant directs us to pages 128-137 of the transcript. Within these pages the prosecutor asked the prospective jurors where they believed sexual assaults occurred and instances they could think of where there would be no evidence of a sexual assault. Transcript of Trial (T.) 128-130. One prospective juror answered there may not be physical evidence if there had been a passage of time. T. 130. The prosecutor responded '[t]hat is something that is called delayed reporting.' He then asked if any of the prospective jurors were familiar with the term. T.131. Counsel for Appellant objected. At a side bar counsel for Appellant argued the prosecutor was'starting to put into play facts not in evidence and we're trying to condition the jury on the case facts.' T. 132. In response the prosecutor pointed out he had not referred to any victims and that whether or not jurors could accept the idea that sexual assault cases can be proven without physical evidence and whether they were open to the idea of delayed reporting was central to whether a potential juror in this matter could fairly weigh the evidence. T. 131. The trial court overruled Appellants objection but cautioned the prosecutor: '* * *make sure you stay really narrow with regard to this line of questioning.' T. 133. The prosecutor continued his voir dire and counsel for Appellant raised no further objection. T. 133-137. Appellant argues that after the trial court overruled his objection, the prosecutor went on to explain the science behind delayed reporting and polled jurors on the same. But the record simply does not support Appellant's allegations. Rather, the record reflects the prosecutor asked if jurors would immediately discount the testimony of a child who did not report their abuse right away and further asked if jurors would be willing to listen to an expert explain why there may not be physical signs of trauma as a result of sexual assault. T. 134-137. Upon review of the record, we find the state's questioning of the venire was narrowly tailored to determine whether any potential jurors harbored any bias which would make them ill-suited to determine this particular matter. Based on the circumstances of this case, the trial court's decision to overrule Appellant's objection was not error. We therefore reject Appellant's arguments pertaining to voir dire. Hearsay Appellant next argues the trial court erred in permitting hearsay testimony from J.M. the mother of V.1 and V.2. We disagree. The admission or exclusion of evidence rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Sage, 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 180, 510 N.E.2d 343 (1987). As a general rule, all relevant evidence is admissible. Evid.R. 402; cf. Evid.R. 802. We therefore review this issue for an abuse of discretion. Hearsay is 'a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.' Evid.R. 801(C). Appellant directs us to pages 425 and 426 of the transcript wherein the state was conducting direct examination of J.M., mother of the victims. The relevant portion reads: [The State]: Going back to August of 2017, do you remember a conversation you had with your daughter [V.1]? [J.M]: Yes [The State]: * * * And what was that conversation about? [Counsel for Appellant] Objection; hearsay Your Honor. [The State]: Your Honor, it goes to - - - [The Court]: Overruled. Go Ahead. [The State]: What was that conversation about? [J.M.]: She said [Appellant] raped and molested her. [The State]: All right. Based on that conversation what did you do? [J.M.]: I called the sheriff's department. Appellant further directs our attention to page 428 of the transcript. At this point the state's direct examination of J.M. focused on the fact she is a recovering drug addict and that her drug abuse had impacted her ability to properly parent her children: [The State]: Taking drugs, did that have an impact on your ability to be a good mother? [J.M]: Yes it did. [The State]: did you place yourself in front of your children? [J.M]: Do I? Yes. [The State]: Did you then? [J.M.]: No. [The State]: * * * Did you put yourself - - your needs in front of your children's needs? [J.M.]: Oh, yes. [The State]: And do you remember a time when [V.1] talked to you about something that was going on with [Appellant]? [Counsel for Appellant]: Objection, Your Honor. It's hearsay. * * * The Court: Stop. [Counsel for Appellant]: There's no foundation. The Court: Overruled. [The State]: Do you remember a time when you were on drugs [V.1.] talking to you about something going on with defendant? [J.M.]: I know she did. I don't remember the details. [The State]: Okay. Do you remember the nature of what she told you was going on? [J.M]: I remember she used the word rape. [The State]: Okay. Did you report it? [J.M.]: No. [The State]: Did you believe her? [J.M.]: No. [The State]: When you were told this time, what did you do? [J.M.]: I contacted law enforcement. [The State]: And did you make arrangements for your girls to go to Children's Hospital? [J.M.]: I did. {¶ 24} T. 427-429. {¶ 25} Appellee argues this testimony was not hearsay because it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. We agree. The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that if a statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, it is not prohibited by the hearsay rule and will be admissible, subject to the standards governing relevancy and undue prejudice. State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 196, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 262-263, 473 N.E.2d 768 (1984). Thus \"'testimony which explains the actions of a witness to whom a statement was directed, such as to explain the witness' activities, is not hearsay.'\" Id., quoting Maurer at 262. Here, J.M.'s testimony in the first instance was limited to a single statement made by V.1 to explain why J.M. involved law enforcement. In the second instance J.M.'s testimony explained why she initially did nothing about the ongoing abuse. Each statement, therefore, was elicited to explain J.M's actions. In factually similar cases, such testimony was not hearsay. *State v. Hoseclaw*, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-12-31, 2013-Ohio-3486 ¶ 48 (\"The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the witness to testify concerning the victim’s statement that she was raped since it was offered not for its truth but to show why the witness reported the rape to the victim’s mother, which the mother, then, reported to law enforcement.\"). *State v. Dunn*, 9th Dist. No. 04CA008549, 2005-Ohio-1270, ¶ 17, *State v. Thomas*, 61 Ohio St.3d 223, 232, 400 N.E.2d 401 (1980) (\"It is well established that extrajudicial statements made by an out-of-court declarant are properly admissible to explain the actions of a witness to whom the statement was directed\"). Moreover, even if that were not true, J.M.’s testimony was cumulative to that of V.1 making its admission harmless error. T. 452-453, 458. '[t]he erroneous admission or exclusion of hearsay, cumulative to properly admitted testimony, constitutes harmless error.' *State v. Hogg*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 11AP-50, 2011-Ohio-6454, ¶ 46. Appellant’s complaints regarding both voir dire and the admission of hearsay evidence are without merit. Since we do not find multiple instances of harmless error, the doctrine of cumulative error is inapplicable. The first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

We disagree. Under the doctrine of cumulative error, '[s]eparately harmless errors may violate a defendant's right to a fair trial when the errors are considered together.' State v. Harris, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19796, 2004-Ohio-3570, ¶ 40, citing State v. Madrigal, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 397, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000). 'In order to find cumulative error, we first must find that multiple errors were committed at trial.' Id. 'A conviction will be reversed when the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the numerous instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute cause for reversal.' State v. Powell, 132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, ¶ 223, citing State v. DeMarco, 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus. Voir Dire Appellant makes two arguments under this first assignment of error. In the first he argues the trial court improperly permitted the state to present factual elements of its case during voir dire over his counsel's objection. We disagree. Because the scope of voir dire lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, we review Appellant's argument for an abuse of discretion. State v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, ¶ 28. In order to find an abuse of discretion, we must determine the trial court's decision was unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). 'The scope of voir dire * * * varies depending on the circumstances of each case.' State v. Bedford, 39 Ohio St.3d 122, 129, 529 N.E.2d 913 (1988). A prosecutor has a right to give an overview of the facts of the case and of those involved in order to ascertain whether prospective jurors know anything about the offense. State v. Tyler, 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 32, 553 N.E.2d 576 (1990). While jurors must be impartial, they need not be completely ignorant of the facts and issues involved in a case to be qualified as jurors. State v. Gross, 97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, ¶ 38. 'The purpose of voir dire is not to establish how a juror will vote on the case to be tried; it is to discover whether any juror has a bias that would prevent him or her from individually weighing the facts of the case.' State v. Madison, 160 Ohio St.3d 232, 2020-Ohio-3735, 155 N.E.3d 867, ¶ 24. In support of his argument that the trial court erred in permitting the state to present factual evidence of its case during voir dire over his counsel's objection, Appellant directs us to pages 128-137 of the transcript. Within these pages the prosecutor asked the prospective jurors where they believed sexual assaults occurred and instances they could think of where there would be no evidence of a sexual assault. Transcript of Trial (T.) 128-130. One prospective juror answered there may not be physical evidence if there had been a passage of time. T. 130. The prosecutor responded '[t]hat is something that is called delayed reporting.' He then asked if any of the prospective jurors were familiar with the term. T.131. Counsel for Appellant objected. At a side bar counsel for Appellant argued the prosecutor was'starting to put into play facts not in evidence and we're trying to condition the jury on the case facts.' T. 132. In response the prosecutor pointed out he had not referred to any victims and that whether or not jurors could accept the idea that sexual assault cases can be proven without physical evidence and whether they were open to the idea of delayed reporting was central to whether a potential juror in this matter could fairly weigh the evidence. T. 131. The trial court overruled Appellants objection but cautioned the prosecutor: '* * *make sure you stay really narrow with regard to this line of questioning.' T. 133. The prosecutor continued his voir dire and counsel for Appellant raised no further objection. T. 133-137. Appellant argues that after the trial court overruled his objection, the prosecutor went on to explain the science behind delayed reporting and polled jurors on the same. But the record simply does not support Appellant's allegations. Rather, the record reflects the prosecutor asked if jurors would immediately discount the testimony of a child who did not report their abuse right away and further asked if jurors would be willing to listen to an expert explain why there may not be physical signs of trauma as a result of sexual assault. T. 134-137. Upon review of the record, we find the state's questioning of the venire was narrowly tailored to determine whether any potential jurors harbored any bias which would make them ill-suited to determine this particular matter. Based on the circumstances of this case, the trial court's decision to overrule Appellant's objection was not error. We therefore reject Appellant's arguments pertaining to voir dire. Hearsay Appellant next argues the trial court erred in permitting hearsay testimony from J.M. the mother of V.1 and V.2. We disagree. The admission or exclusion of evidence rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Sage, 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 180, 510 N.E.2d 343 (1987). As a general rule, all relevant evidence is admissible. Evid.R. 402; cf. Evid.R. 802. We therefore review this issue for an abuse of discretion. Hearsay is 'a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.' Evid.R. 801(C). Appellant directs us to pages 425 and 426 of the transcript wherein the state was conducting direct examination of J.M., mother of the victims. The relevant portion reads: [The State]: Going back to August of 2017, do you remember a conversation you had with your daughter [V.1]?

Under his First Assignment of Error, Thomas contends his conviction for two counts of rape of a person under 13 years of age and four counts of gross sexual imposition of a person under 13 years of age was against the manifest weight of the evidence. In support of this claim, Thomas argues there was no physical evidence of the offenses and that his conviction was based solely on the testimony of T.K., who was not a credible witness. Thomas claims that T.K. was not a credible witness because she suffered from mental and emotional impairment; specifically, T.K. heard voices and took psychotropic medicine for daily functioning. We find no merit to Thomas’s argument. ‘A weight of the evidence argument challenges the believability of the evidence and asks which of the competing inferences suggested by the evidence is more believable or persuasive.’ (Citation omitted.) State v. Wilson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22581, 2009-Ohio-525, ¶ 12. When evaluating whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider witness credibility, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact ‘clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.’” State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), quoting State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983). A judgment should be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence ‘only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.’ (Citations omitted.) Martin at 175. The credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony are matters for the trier of fact to resolve. State v. Hammad, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26057, 2014-Ohio-3638, ¶ 13, citing State v. DeHass, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 231, 227 N.E.2d 212 (1967). Because the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses at trial, we must defer to the factfinder’s decisions whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses. State v. Lawson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4 (Aug. 22, 1997). ‘This court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact on the issue of witness credibility unless it is patently apparent that the trier of fact lost its way.’ State v. Bradley, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 97 CA 03, 1997 WL 691510, *4 (Oct. 24, 1997). In this case, Thomas does not dispute that T.K. sufficiently testified regarding each incident of sexual abuse for which he was convicted. Instead, Thomas claims the weight of the evidence did not support his conviction because there was no physical evidence of the abuse and because T.K.’s testimony lacked credibility due to her suffering from mental and emotional impairment. With regard to physical evidence, it is well established that physical evidence is not required to support a conviction for rape or gross sexual imposition against a manifest weight challenge. State v. West, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 06AP-11, 2006-Ohio-6259, ¶ 18; State v. Thomas, 2015-Ohio-5247, 54 N.E.3d 732, ¶ 31 (9th Dist.); State v. White, 3d Dist.

Accordingly, the fact that Thomas’s conviction was based solely on T.K.’s testimony and not any physical evidence did not render his conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. In addition, the fact that the jury chose to believe T.K.’s testimony despite her mental illness did not render Thomas’s conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. Simply stated, ‘the jury was free to believe, or disbelieve, any part of the witnesses’ testimony, and a conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence merely because the jury believed the prosecution’s testimony.’ (Citation omitted.) State v. Arega, 2012-Ohio-5774, 983 N.E.2d 863, ¶ 30 (10th Dist.). Here, the jury heard evidence concerning the mental and emotional issues for which T.K. was being medicated and chose to find T.K. credible despite those issues. With regard to hearing voices, T.K. specifically testified that the voices she heard did not tell her to say that Thomas abused her. T.K.’s medical providers, Dr. Vavul-Roediger and Melinda Kiser, as well as T.K.’s counselor, Danielle Baker, also testified that T.K. never indicated the voices she heard told her she was sexually abused by Thomas. Kiser, who diagnosed T.K. with severe major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, general anxiety disorder, and gender dysphoria also testified that T.K. was able to accurately convey things that have happened to her. Dr. Vavul-Roediger further testified that T.K. appeared to be in touch with reality when she examined T.K. following her disclosure of the sexual abuse. When considering the testimony of record, we do not find the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice by believing T.K.’s testimony regarding the sexual abuse, as the jury was in the best position to weigh T.K.’s credibility.\"\n}\n```"}

Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4 (Aug. 22, 1997). ‘This court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact on the issue of witness credibility unless it is patently apparent that the trier of fact lost its way.’ State v. Bradley, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 97 CA 03, 1997 WL 691510, *4 (Oct. 24, 1997). In this case, Thomas does not dispute that T.K. sufficiently testified regarding each incident of sexual abuse for which he was convicted. Instead, Thomas claims the weight of the evidence did not support his conviction because there was no physical evidence of the abuse and because T.K.’s testimony lacked credibility due to her suffering from mental and emotional impairment. With regard to physical evidence, it is well established that physical evidence is not required to support a conviction for rape or gross sexual imposition against a manifest weight challenge. State v. West, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 06AP-11, 2006-Ohio-6259, ¶ 18; State v. Thomas, 2015-Ohio-5247, 54 N.E.3d 732, ¶ 31 (9th Dist.); State v. White, 3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-16-21, 2017-Ohio-1488, ¶ 54; State v. Williams, 2017-Ohio-8898, 101 N.E.3d 547, ¶ 19 (1st Dist.). Accordingly, the fact that Thomas’s conviction was based solely on T.K.’s testimony and not any physical evidence did not render his conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. In addition, the fact that the jury chose to believe T.K.’s testimony despite her mental illness did not render Thomas’s conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. Simply stated, ‘the jury was free to believe, or disbelieve, any part of the witnesses’ testimony, and a conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence merely because the jury believed the prosecution’s testimony.’ (Citation omitted.) State v. Arega, 2012-Ohio-5774, 983 N.E.2d 863, ¶ 30 (10th Dist.). Here, the jury heard evidence concerning the mental and emotional issues for which T.K. was being medicated and chose to find T.K. credible despite those issues. With regard to hearing voices, T.K. specifically testified that the voices she heard did not tell her to say that Thomas abused her. T.K.’s medical providers, Dr. Vavul-Roediger and Melinda Kiser, as well as T.K.’s counselor, Danielle Baker, also testified that T.K. never indicated the voices she heard told her she was sexually abused by Thomas. Kiser, who diagnosed T.K. with severe major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, general anxiety disorder, and gender dysphoria also testified that T.K. was able to accurately convey things that have happened to her. Dr. Vavul-Roediger further testified that T.K. appeared to be in touch with reality when she examined T.K. following her disclosure of the sexual abuse. When considering the testimony of record, we do not find the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice by believing T.K.’s testimony regarding the sexual abuse, as the jury was in the best position to weigh T.K.’s credibility.\"\n}\n```"}

Although Sipple raised multiple arguments in his motion to suppress, on appeal he only argues that any statements made during the December 2016 incident were not relevant to his prosecution for unauthorized use, or that the probative value of such evidence was outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice. Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. An appellate court must accept the trial court's findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. 'Accepting these facts as true, the appellate court must then independently determine, without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.' Sipple argues any statements to Officer Stock during the December 2016 incident were not relevant to his prosecution for unauthorized use of a computer. Generally, relevant evidence is admissible, except where excluded by the federal or state constitutions, statute, or rule. Relevant evidence is 'evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.' Sipple was charged with unauthorized use of a computer, in violation of R.C. 2913.04. As relevant to this case, that statute prohibits knowingly gaining access to a computer or computer system without the consent of the owner of the computer or computer system. Officer Stock testified Sipple stated he deleted records from the slate room computer and was intoxicated when he did it. If true, this statement would constitute an admission of having accessed the slate room computer, which is a fact of consequence to determining whether Sipple committed the charged offense. Thus, evidence regarding Sipple's statements during the December 2016 incident was relevant to the present case. Sipple further argues that even if the statements were relevant, they should have been suppressed due to the risk of undue prejudice. Relevant evidence 'is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.' Sipple appears to argue there was a risk of undue prejudice because the statements were alleged to have been made while he was in a police cruiser. Exclusion of relevant evidence due to undue prejudice involves more than mere prejudice, because anything adverse to a party's case could be deemed prejudicial to that party. 'Unfair prejudice is that quality of evidence which might result in an improper basis for a jury decision. Consequently, if the evidence arouses the jury's emotional sympathies, evokes a sense of horror, or appeals to an instinct to punish, the evidence may be unfairly prejudicial.' A review of the trial transcript indicates Officer Stock did not testify on direct examination that Sipple's statements during the December 2016 incident occurred while Sipple was in a police cruiser. To the extent the jury became aware that this conversation occurred while Sipple was in a police cruiser, that fact was raised by Sipple's trial counsel in the course of cross-examining Officer Stock in impeaching his credibility based on the fact that no recording of the conversation from the cruiser's dash camera was preserved. Moreover, there was no testimony suggesting to the jury that Sipple was arrested or charged with any crime as a result of the December 2016 incident. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude this was the type of evidence that would arouse the jury's sympathies, evoke a sense of horror, or appeal to the jury's instinct to punish Sipple, and the trial court did not err by failing to exclude the evidence based on the risk of undue prejudice.\"\n}\n```"}

Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. Notice of plain error “is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus. The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the prosecutor’s remarks and comments were improper and if so, whether those remarks and comments prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused.

The trial court immediately stopped the questioning and instructed the jury to disregard that statement. ¶17 During the prosecutions closing arguments the prosecution recited the statute which made reference to the level of offense being a felony in the second degree. No objection was made at this point during closing arguments. ¶18 Appellant also argues that the prosecutor’s closing arguments contained allegations of other criminal misconduct not charged; Intimidation of attorney, victim or witness. During closing arguments the prosecution, summarizing testimony, noted Ludt, the confidential informant, was placed in jail right next to Appellant. The prosecution then asked the jury to use their common sense as to why Ludt changed his testimony, stating, “Ladies and gentlemen, use your reason and your common sense; it’s clear to see he made a deal with Jimmy Ludt.” Tr. II at 62. Upon review and with regard to the statements made in reference to Ludt changing his testimony, we find the State was merely asking the jury to evaluate the credibility of Ludt, consider all the testimony, and use their common sense. In the challenged references to the level of the offense, while the references to the level of the offense were improper, the judge properly instructed the jury to disregard during Detective Rajcan’s testimony. Appellant has not shown that the references made during closing arguments, while improper, deprived Appellant of a fair trial based on the entire record. Moreover, Appellant has not demonstrated, even assuming arguendo the prosecutors conduct did deprive Appellant of a fair trial, that “but for” these isolated statements, he would not have been convicted of the crimes.

We disagree. As Appellant did not lodge an objection to the error he currently raises, he has therefore waived all but plain error. An error not raised in the trial court must be plain error for an appellate court to reverse. State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978) at paragraph one of the syllabus; Crim.R. 52(B). To prevail under a plain error analysis, appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different but for the error. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. Notice of plain error “is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus. The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the prosecutor’s remarks and comments were improper and if so, whether those remarks and comments prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused. State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990), cert denied, 498 U.S. 1017, 111 S.Ct. 591, 112 L.Ed.2d 596 (1990). In reviewing allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, we must review the complained-of conduct in the context of the entire trial. Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986). Prosecutorial misconduct will not provide a basis for reversal unless the misconduct can be said to have deprived Appellant of a fair trial based on the entire record. Lott, supra, 51 Ohio St.3d at 166, 555 N.E.2d 293. A prosecutor’s remarks constitute misconduct if remarks were improper and if the remarks prejudicially affected an accused’s substantial rights. State v. Williams, 99 Ohio St.3d 439, 793 N.E.2d 446, 2003-Ohio-4164. Prosecutorial misconduct will not provide a basis for reversal unless the misconduct can be said to have deprived the Appellant of a fair trial based on the entire record. State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). The analysis does not include the culpability of the prosecutor, but the fairness of the trial. *State v. Gapen*, 104 Ohio St.3d 358, 819 N.E.2d 1047, 2004-Ohio-6548. The record must be viewed in its entirety to determine whether the allegedly improper remarks were prejudicial. *State v. Treesh* (2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 739 N.E.2d 749. ¶15 Appellant argues that statements made by the prosecutor during closing arguments and the testimony of Detective Rajcan referencing the level of offense were improper. ¶16 During Detective Rajcan’s testimony describing why it mattered if the drugs were sold in a bulk amount, he mentioned the level of offense as being a felony two. The trial court immediately stopped the questioning and instructed the jury to disregard that statement. ¶17 During the prosecutions closing arguments the prosecution recited the statute which made reference to the level of offense being a felony in the second degree. No objection was made at this point during closing arguments. ¶18 Appellant also argues that the prosecutor’s closing arguments contained allegations of other criminal misconduct not charged; Intimidation of attorney, victim or witness.

This testimony was elicited by the state in a series of questions regarding Vicario’s and Dowell’s relationship. The state reasoned that testimony of Vicario’s abusive behavior was necessary to show why Dowell would react or act as she did. Dowell then testified that Vicario told her the following day that he messed up and ‘shot those people.’ Matthews testified that she showed Vicario where to find the people from the fight at the convenience store. Then approximately ten minutes later, Vicario left Dowell’s home. (Tr. 410-412.)

We disagree. An appellate court reviewing a trial court’s decision on a motion for mistrial defers to the judgment of the trial court, as it is in the best position to determine whether circumstances warrant a mistrial. State v. Glover, 35 Ohio St.3d 18, 19 (1988). Accordingly, we review a trial court’s decision on a motion for mistrial for an abuse of discretion. Columbus v. Aleshire, 187 Ohio App.3d 660, 2010-Ohio-2773, ¶ 42 (10th Dist.), citing State v. Sage, 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 182 (1987). The term abuse of discretion implies that the court’s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157 (1980). An abuse of discretion involves views or actions 'that no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken.' State v. Hancock, 108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, ¶ 130, quoting State ex rel. Wilms v. Blake, 144 Ohio St. 619, 624 (1945). 'A mistrial should not be ordered in a criminal case merely because some error or irregularity has intervened, unless the substantial rights of the accused or the prosecution are adversely affected.' State v. Walburg, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-1087, 2011-Ohio-4762, ¶ 52, quoting State v. Reynolds, 49 Ohio App.3d 27, 33 (2d Dist.1988). Rather, a trial court should only declare a mistrial when 'the ends of justice so require and a fair trial is no longer possible.' State v. Franklin, 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 127 (1991). In determining whether a criminal defendant was deprived of a fair trial, an appellate court must determine whether, absent the error or irregularity, 'the jury would have found the [defendant] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.' Aleshire at ¶ 42, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 267 (1984). As noted above, in this case, counsel for appellant moved for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument. In the context of closing arguments, the test for prosecutorial misconduct is 'whether 'the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.''State v. Fudge, 10th Dist. No. 16AP-821, 2018-Ohio-601, ¶ 48, quoting State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 (1984). In determining whether allegedly improper remarks resulted in prejudice to the defendant, a reviewing court must consider '(1) the nature of the remarks, (2) whether an objection was made by counsel, (3) whether corrective instructions were given by the court, and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendant.' (Further quotations and citations omitted.) Id. at ¶ 47, quoting Aleshire at ¶ 42. Furthermore, because isolated instances of prosecutorial misconduct are deemed harmless, 'the closing argument must be viewed in its entirety to determine whether the defendant has been prejudiced.' Id. at ¶ 48, quoting State v. Muhleka, 2d Dist. No. 19827, 2004-Ohio-1822, at ¶ 85, quoting State v. Stevens, 2d Dist. No. 19572, 2003-Ohio-6249, ¶ 34. 'Prosecutors are entitled to considerable latitude in closing argument.' Fudge at ¶ 48, quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, citing State v. Ballew, 76 Ohio St.3d 244, 255 (1996). During closing argument, the prosecutor is free to comment on 'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.' (Further citations omitted.) Id., quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, citing State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165 (1990). The prosecutor is likewise free to'state his or her opinion if it is based on the evidence presented at trial.' State v. Diar, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, ¶ 213. Furthermore, where a defendant has failed 'to object to the prosecutor's alleged misconduct, he waives all but plain error.' Fudge at ¶ 49, quoting Wellston v. Horsley, 4th Dist. No. 05CA18, 2006-Ohio-4386, ¶ 22, citing Crim.R. 52; State v. Hartman, 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 294 (2001). Notice of plain error under Crim.R. 52(B) 'is to be taken with the utmost of caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.' Id., quoting Wellston at ¶ 22. Furthermore, 'plain error should not be invoked unless it can be said that, but for the error, the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise.' Id., quoting Wellston at ¶ 22. Moreover, where the trial court has instructed the jury the evidence did not include opening statements or closing arguments of counsel or any other statement made by counsel during trial, and that 'opening statements and closing arguments are designed to assist you but they are not evidence,' it is presumed that 'the jurors followed these instructions and that the verdict was not, therefore, based on the content of the closing arguments.' Fudge at ¶ 52, citing State v. Thompson, 3d Dist. No. 7-16-10, 2017-Ohio-792, ¶ 26, citing Pang v. Minch, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 187 (1990). In this case, as noted previously, after the jury had retired to commence deliberations, defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor's alleged misconduct during closing arguments. Defense counsel specifically averred: 'Your Honor, I try to be restrained during closing arguments, but particularly when counsel in rebuttal makes statements, it becomes even more difficult. But I would note my objection and even move for a mistrial based upon comments that were made on rebuttal. First of all, one comment was made to the jurors that they, too, should be outraged. And that was made in response to or during her explanation about the community standards. But that's an invitation for this jury to decide this case based upon emotion and not the facts or the law in this case, which specifically they are told not to do. Another objection I have is several times in her argument she stated that it doesn't matter that Hanna injected herself. Well, so she is asking the jury to again ignore the evidence. The jurors' responsibility is to consider all of the evidence and the fact that that particular comment or the other point of my presentation that it is not in the jury instructions is still relevant to their deliberations, both in terms of evaluating the evidence and specifically in weighing whether or not the death was the proximate cause of my client's conduct versus that of Hanna's conduct. So for those reasons, we make our objections and we would make our motion.' (Tr. at 451-52.) After listening to arguments from both the prosecutor and defense counsel, the trial court denied the motion for a mistrial, stating: 'I instructed the jury prior to taking evidence and during my instructions that closing statements of counsel are not evidence and should not be considered by them as evidence. I will deny your motion for a mistrial. I will note your objection.' (Tr. at 453.) A review of the record reveals that during rebuttal closing arguments, the prosecutor stated to the jury, '[d]isturbing photographs, I hope they are disturbing to you. They should be disturbing to you. They should be disturbing and y'all should be outraged.' (Tr. at 436.) Defense counsel did not object to the foregoing remarks at the time they were made. The prosecutor also stated to the jury, '[t]he Judge has given you all of the law on these jury instructions. Right? That is the law that you've got to follow. And not one place in here will you find if Hanna Geiger, the victim, injected herself or because she wanted the drugs, that that means he is not culpable. You won't find that in here.' (Tr. at 439.) Defense counsel lodged a general objection to the foregoing statement, but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 439.) The prosecutor continued rebuttal closing arguments and informed the jury, '[a]gain, I never once said that she didn't inject herself. And you know, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day it doesn't matter if she injected it, smoked it, ate it. He still provided that cocaine to her.' (Tr. at 443.) Defense counsel made no objection to the foregoing remarks at the time the prosecutor made them. The prosecutor also stated to the jury, '[y]ou are here to judge the facts and determine whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, Andrew Nichols -- not Hanna Geiger. She's not on trial here. She is the victim in this case.' (Tr. at 444.) Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor's use of the word 'victim,' but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 444.) Continuing rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor informed the jury, '[y]ou have to decide this case. You follow the law, and it is did we prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt. I submit to you we did. And now he just wants to blame the victim, Hanna.' (Tr. at 446.) Defense counsel again objected to the use of the word 'victim' by the prosecutor, but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 446-47.) Upon consideration, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant appellant's motion for mistrial premised on the foregoing remarks made by the prosecutor during rebuttal closing argument. First, regarding appellant's contention that the prosecutor improperly invited the jury to decide the case based on emotion rather than the facts of the case or the applicable law by stating to the jurors that they should be 'outraged' by what they saw in the photographs presented at trial, we reiterate that defense counsel made no objection to this remark at the time it was made. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error on this point. Fudge at ¶ 49. Furthermore, we find no improper conduct on the part of the prosecutor in commenting that the jurors should be outraged in viewing the photographs of Hanna's body. This is so, because 'outrage' is an element of the offense of gross abuse of a corpse,7 one of the counts with which appellant had been charged. When this comment is viewed in context with the indictment, the jury instructions, and the prosecutor's earlier closing argument on this point (Tr. at 409-11), it is apparent that the comment was meant to reference the element of outrage included in the offense. (Tr. at 409-11.) As the prosecutor had to prove this element, it was not improper to urge the jury that they should be outraged by the photographs they viewed because the photographs were direct evidence of the treatment of Hanna Geiger's body by appellant. Put another way, this remark by the prosecutor was an entirely fair one because it was based on 'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.' (Further citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48, quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, quoting Lott at 165. The jurors would have understood the prosecutor's comment in this context and they would not have taken the prosecutor's comment to be an invitation to abandon their responsibility to decide the case based on the law and the facts and instead improperly decide the case based on emotion. There was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in urging the jurors to be outraged by the photographs of Hanna's body, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. Next, we turn to appellant's complaint that the prosecutor improperly used the word 'victim' to describe Hanna Geiger three times during rebuttal closing argument. As set forth above, defense counsel lodged an objection each time the prosecutor referred to Hanna Geiger as a victim, and the trial court overruled each objection. In support of appellant's argument that the prosecutor's use of the term 'victim' during closing argument substantially affected the jurors' impartiality in evaluating the evidence to the prejudice of appellant, he cites to State v. Almedom, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-852, 2016-Ohio-1553, in which this court determined, sua sponte, that defense counsel in that case had been ineffective by failing to object to repeated references made by the trial judge to the child witnesses as 'victims.' We find Almedom readily distinguishable from the instant matter. First and foremost, in Almedom, the offending references to the witnesses as 'victims' were made by the trial judge, not the prosecutor. While a trial judge must remain detached and neutral in any matter before the court, the prosecutor is not constrained by any such obligation of neutrality. State v. Harper, 10th Dist. No. 01-AP-201, 2001-Ohio-8875. Secondly, in Almedom, the improper references were made throughout the entire trial. Here, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a 'victim' were made only during rebuttal closing argument. As discussed above, during closing argument, the prosecutor is free to comment on 'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.' (Internal quotations and citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48. In our view, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a 'victim' entailed fair comment on what the evidence had shown and were not improper. Thus, there was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in referring to Hanna Geiger as a victim, and there was no error on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. Finally, we address appellant's contention that, in referencing the court's instructions to the jury, the prosecutor improperly asked the jury to disregard evidence by stating it did not matter that Hanna Geiger injected herself with the cocaine for purposes of determining whether appellant was culpable in Hanna's death. We reiterate that defense counsel made no objection to this remark at the time it was made. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error on this issue. *Fudge* at ¶ 49. Furthermore, we do not agree that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by asserting that for purposes of determining appellant’s culpability in Hanna Geiger’s death, whether Hanna injected the narcotics herself was of no import. Instead, we find the prosecutor was appropriately arguing the legal insignificance of this evidence as it pertained to the jury’s consideration of the involuntary manslaughter charge. This is so because pursuant to the court’s instructions, appellant was culpable in Hanna’s death if the jury found that appellant provided Hanna with the cocaine. Put another way, the fact that Hanna injected herself would not negate appellant’s culpability. Indeed, the prosecutor conceded that Hanna injected herself in explaining why this fact did not negate appellant’s culpability or provide a legal defense to the charge of involuntary manslaughter. (Tr. at 439, 443.) In short, Hanna’s act of self-injection 'would not change the basic fact that the victim took the drugs furnished by [the defendant] and died as a result.' *State v. Price*, 8th Dist. No. 107096, 2019-Ohio-1642, ¶ 89. The prosecutor did not improperly tell the jury that it did not matter if Hanna injected herself, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. Moreover, in considering all of appellants’ assertions of alleged prosecutorial misconduct during rebuttal closing argument, we observe the trial court instructed the jury 'the evidence does not include the indictment or opening statements or closing arguments of counsel. The opening statements and closing arguments of counsel are designed to assist you. They are not evidence.' (Jury Instr. at 2.) Thus, we presume that the jurors followed these instructions and the verdict was not based on the content of the closing arguments. *Fudge* at ¶ 52, citing at ¶ 26, citing *Pang* at 187. In short, appellant has failed to establish any prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments which resulted in appellant being deprived of a fair trial. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s motion for mistrial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct, and appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

State v. Glover, 35 Ohio St.3d 18, 19 (1988). Accordingly, we review a trial court’s decision on a motion for mistrial for an abuse of discretion. Columbus v.

The term abuse of discretion implies that the court’s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157 (1980). An abuse of discretion involves views or actions 'that no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken.' State v. Hancock, 108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, ¶ 130, quoting State ex rel. Wilms v. Blake, 144 Ohio St. 619, 624 (1945). 'A mistrial should not be ordered in a criminal case merely because some error or irregularity has intervened, unless the substantial rights of the accused or the prosecution are adversely affected.' State v. Walburg, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-1087, 2011-Ohio-4762, ¶ 52, quoting State v. Reynolds, 49 Ohio App.3d 27, 33 (2d Dist.1988). Rather, a trial court should only declare a mistrial when 'the ends of justice so require and a fair trial is no longer possible.' State v. Franklin, 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 127 (1991). In determining whether a criminal defendant was deprived of a fair trial, an appellate court must determine whether, absent the error or irregularity, 'the jury would have found the [defendant] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.' Aleshire at ¶ 42, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 267 (1984). As noted above, in this case, counsel for appellant moved for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument. In the context of closing arguments, the test for prosecutorial misconduct is 'whether 'the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.''State v. Fudge, 10th Dist. No. 16AP-821, 2018-Ohio-601, ¶ 48, quoting State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 (1984). In determining whether allegedly improper remarks resulted in prejudice to the defendant, a reviewing court must consider '(1) the nature of the remarks, (2) whether an objection was made by counsel, (3) whether corrective instructions were given by the court, and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendant.' (Further quotations and citations omitted.) Id. at ¶ 47, quoting Aleshire at ¶ 42. Furthermore, because isolated instances of prosecutorial misconduct are deemed harmless, 'the closing argument must be viewed in its entirety to determine whether the defendant has been prejudiced.' Id. at ¶ 48, quoting State v. Muhleka, 2d Dist. No. 19827, 2004-Ohio-1822, at ¶ 85, quoting State v. Stevens, 2d Dist. No. 19572, 2003-Ohio-6249, ¶ 34. 'Prosecutors are entitled to considerable latitude in closing argument.' Fudge at ¶ 48, quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, citing State v. Ballew, 76 Ohio St.3d 244, 255 (1996). During closing argument, the prosecutor is free to comment on 'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.' (Further citations omitted.) Id., quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, citing State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165 (1990). The prosecutor is likewise free to'state his or her opinion if it is based on the evidence presented at trial.' State v. Diar, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, ¶ 213. Furthermore, where a defendant has failed 'to object to the prosecutor's alleged misconduct, he waives all but plain error.' Fudge at ¶ 49, quoting Wellston v. Horsley, 4th Dist. No. 05CA18, 2006-Ohio-4386, ¶ 22, citing Crim.R. 52; State v. Hartman, 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 294 (2001).

Id., quoting Wellston at ¶ 22. Furthermore, 'plain error should not be invoked unless it can be said that, but for the error, the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise.' Id., quoting Wellston at ¶ 22. Moreover, where the trial court has instructed the jury the evidence did not include opening statements or closing arguments of counsel or any other statement made by counsel during trial, and that 'opening statements and closing arguments are designed to assist you but they are not evidence,' it is presumed that 'the jurors followed these instructions and that the verdict was not, therefore, based on the content of the closing arguments.'

In this case, as noted previously, after the jury had retired to commence deliberations, defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor's alleged misconduct during closing arguments. Defense counsel specifically averred: 'Your Honor, I try to be restrained during closing arguments, but particularly when counsel in rebuttal makes statements, it becomes even more difficult. But I would note my objection and even move for a mistrial based upon comments that were made on rebuttal. First of all, one comment was made to the jurors that they, too, should be outraged. And that was made in response to or during her explanation about the community standards. But that's an invitation for this jury to decide this case based upon emotion and not the facts or the law in this case, which specifically they are told not to do. Another objection I have is several times in her argument she stated that it doesn't matter that Hanna injected herself. Well, so she is asking the jury to again ignore the evidence. The jurors' responsibility is to consider all of the evidence and the fact that that particular comment or the other point of my presentation that it is not in the jury instructions is still relevant to their deliberations, both in terms of evaluating the evidence and specifically in weighing whether or not the death was the proximate cause of my client's conduct versus that of Hanna's conduct.

But I would note my objection and even move for a mistrial based upon comments that were made on rebuttal. First of all, one comment was made to the jurors that they, too, should be outraged. And that was made in response to or during her explanation about the community standards. But that's an invitation for this jury to decide this case based upon emotion and not the facts or the law in this case, which specifically they are told not to do. Another objection I have is several times in her argument she stated that it doesn't matter that Hanna injected herself. Well, so she is asking the jury to again ignore the evidence. The jurors' responsibility is to consider all of the evidence and the fact that that particular comment or the other point of my presentation that it is not in the jury instructions is still relevant to their deliberations, both in terms of evaluating the evidence and specifically in weighing whether or not the death was the proximate cause of my client's conduct versus that of Hanna's conduct. So for those reasons, we make our objections and we would make our motion.' (Tr. at 451-52.) After listening to arguments from both the prosecutor and defense counsel, the trial court denied the motion for a mistrial, stating: 'I instructed the jury prior to taking evidence and during my instructions that closing statements of counsel are not evidence and should not be considered by them as evidence. I will deny your motion for a mistrial. I will note your objection.' (Tr. at 453.) A review of the record reveals that during rebuttal closing arguments, the prosecutor stated to the jury, '[d]isturbing photographs, I hope they are disturbing to you. They should be disturbing to you. They should be disturbing and y'all should be outraged.' (Tr. at 436.) Defense counsel did not object to the foregoing remarks at the time they were made. The prosecutor also stated to the jury, '[t]he Judge has given you all of the law on these jury instructions. Right? That is the law that you've got to follow. And not one place in here will you find if Hanna Geiger, the victim, injected herself or because she wanted the drugs, that that means he is not culpable. You won't find that in here.' (Tr. at 439.) Defense counsel lodged a general objection to the foregoing statement, but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 439.) The prosecutor continued rebuttal closing arguments and informed the jury, '[a]gain, I never once said that she didn't inject herself. And you know, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day it doesn't matter if she injected it, smoked it, ate it. He still provided that cocaine to her.' (Tr. at 443.) Defense counsel made no objection to the foregoing remarks at the time the prosecutor made them. The prosecutor also stated to the jury, '[y]ou are here to judge the facts and determine whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, Andrew Nichols -- not Hanna Geiger. She's not on trial here. She is the victim in this case.' (Tr. at 444.) Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor's use of the word 'victim,' but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 444.) Continuing rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor informed the jury, '[y]ou have to decide this case. You follow the law, and it is did we prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt. I submit to you we did. And now he just wants to blame the victim, Hanna.' (Tr. at 446.) Defense counsel again objected to the use of the word 'victim' by the prosecutor, but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 446-47.) Upon consideration, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant appellant's motion for mistrial premised on the foregoing remarks made by the prosecutor during rebuttal closing argument. First, regarding appellant's contention that the prosecutor improperly invited the jury to decide the case based on emotion rather than the facts of the case or the applicable law by stating to the jurors that they should be 'outraged' by what they saw in the photographs presented at trial, we reiterate that defense counsel made no objection to this remark at the time it was made. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error on this point. Fudge at ¶ 49. Furthermore, we find no improper conduct on the part of the prosecutor in commenting that the jurors should be outraged in viewing the photographs of Hanna's body. This is so, because 'outrage' is an element of the offense of gross abuse of a corpse,7 one of the counts with which appellant had been charged. When this comment is viewed in context with the indictment, the jury instructions, and the prosecutor's earlier closing argument on this point (Tr. at 409-11), it is apparent that the comment was meant to reference the element of outrage included in the offense. (Tr. at 409-11.) As the prosecutor had to prove this element, it was not improper to urge the jury that they should be outraged by the photographs they viewed because the photographs were direct evidence of the treatment of Hanna Geiger's body by appellant. Put another way, this remark by the prosecutor was an entirely fair one because it was based on 'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.' (Further citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48, quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, quoting Lott at 165. The jurors would have understood the prosecutor's comment in this context and they would not have taken the prosecutor's comment to be an invitation to abandon their responsibility to decide the case based on the law and the facts and instead improperly decide the case based on emotion. There was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in urging the jurors to be outraged by the photographs of Hanna's body, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. Next, we turn to appellant's complaint that the prosecutor improperly used the word 'victim' to describe Hanna Geiger three times during rebuttal closing argument. As set forth above, defense counsel lodged an objection each time the prosecutor referred to Hanna Geiger as a victim, and the trial court overruled each objection. In support of appellant's argument that the prosecutor's use of the term 'victim' during closing argument substantially affected the jurors' impartiality in evaluating the evidence to the prejudice of appellant, he cites to State v. Almedom, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-852, 2016-Ohio-1553, in which this court determined, sua sponte, that defense counsel in that case had been ineffective by failing to object to repeated references made by the trial judge to the child witnesses as 'victims.' We find Almedom readily distinguishable from the instant matter. First and foremost, in Almedom, the offending references to the witnesses as 'victims' were made by the trial judge, not the prosecutor. While a trial judge must remain detached and neutral in any matter before the court, the prosecutor is not constrained by any such obligation of neutrality. State v. Harper, 10th Dist. No. 01-AP-201, 2001-Ohio-8875. Secondly, in Almedom, the improper references were made throughout the entire trial. Here, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a 'victim' were made only during rebuttal closing argument. As discussed above, during closing argument, the prosecutor is free to comment on 'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.' (Internal quotations and citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48. In our view, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a 'victim' entailed fair comment on what the evidence had shown and were not improper. Thus, there was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in referring to Hanna Geiger as a victim, and there was no error on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. Finally, we address appellant's contention that, in referencing the court's instructions to the jury, the prosecutor improperly asked the jury to disregard evidence by stating it did not matter that Hanna Geiger injected herself with the cocaine for purposes of determining whether appellant was culpable in Hanna's death. We reiterate that defense counsel made no objection to this remark at the time it was made. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error on this issue. *Fudge* at ¶ 49. Furthermore, we do not agree that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by asserting that for purposes of determining appellant’s culpability in Hanna Geiger’s death, whether Hanna injected the narcotics herself was of no import. Instead, we find the prosecutor was appropriately arguing the legal insignificance of this evidence as it pertained to the jury’s consideration of the involuntary manslaughter charge. This is so because pursuant to the court’s instructions, appellant was culpable in Hanna’s death if the jury found that appellant provided Hanna with the cocaine. Put another way, the fact that Hanna injected herself would not negate appellant’s culpability. Indeed, the prosecutor conceded that Hanna injected herself in explaining why this fact did not negate appellant’s culpability or provide a legal defense to the charge of involuntary manslaughter. (Tr. at 439, 443.) In short, Hanna’s act of self-injection 'would not change the basic fact that the victim took the drugs furnished by [the defendant] and died as a result.' *State v. Price*, 8th Dist. No. 107096, 2019-Ohio-1642, ¶ 89. The prosecutor did not improperly tell the jury that it did not matter if Hanna injected herself, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis. Moreover, in considering all of appellants’ assertions of alleged prosecutorial misconduct during rebuttal closing argument, we observe the trial court instructed the jury 'the evidence does not include the indictment or opening statements or closing arguments of counsel. The opening statements and closing arguments of counsel are designed to assist you. They are not evidence.' (Jury Instr. at 2.) Thus, we presume that the jurors followed these instructions and the verdict was not based on the content of the closing arguments. *Fudge* at ¶ 52, citing at ¶ 26, citing *Pang* at 187. In short, appellant has failed to establish any prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments which resulted in appellant being deprived of a fair trial. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s motion for mistrial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct, and appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

[Lynch’s] rights to due process and a fair trial were violated when the trial court denied his motion to dismiss for pre-indictment delay and then denied his motion to reconsider that ruling.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"In his first assignment of error, Lynch argues that the trial court erred by denying his motions to dismiss the indictment based on preindictment delay. The statute of limitations for a criminal offense is a defendant’s primary protection against overly stale criminal charges. However, in some circumstances, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides limited protection against preindictment delay. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that an unjustifiable delay between the commission of an offense and a defendant’s indictment therefor, which results in actual prejudice to the defendant, is a violation of the right to due process of law. The Ohio Supreme Court recently reaffirmed a two-part, burden-shifting test to determine whether preindictment delay constitutes a due process violation. First, the burden is on the defendant to present evidence of actual prejudice; once a defendant does so, the burden then shifts to the state to produce evidence of a justifiable reason for the delay. A determination of actual prejudice involves a delicate judgment and a case-by-case consideration of the particular circumstances. The trial court indicated that it reviewed the case law set forth in Jones I, State v. Jones, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101258, 2017-Ohio-176 (“Jones II”), Luck, 15 Ohio St.3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097, and Whiting, 84 Ohio St.3d 215, 217, 702 N.E.2d 1199. In denying defense counsel’s motion to reconsider, the trial court found the facts of this case to be distinguishable from Jones II. The trial court concluded, ‘I’m not convinced that actual prejudice has occurred from the delay. Even if we get to, you know, the point of actual prejudice in this case. In looking at it when the burden shifts to the State to show that it was not unjustifiable, you know, based on the facts here, I do find that a delay was justifiable anyway.’ (Tr. 596-597.) In reviewing a trial court’s decision on a motion to dismiss for preindictment delay, this court applies a de novo standard of review to the legal issues, but we afford great deference to the trial court’s findings of fact. After reviewing the record, we find that Lynch fails to demonstrate actual prejudice. Although Lynch offered an explanation of what purportedly exculpatory testimony S.P. would have offered, the unavailable testimony must be balanced against the evidence at the time of the indictment to determine whether Lynch would suffer actual prejudice. As noted above, the DNA evidence available at the time of the indictment revealed that Lynch could not be excluded as the source of semen on the vaginal swab from M.H.’s rape kit. We cannot say that S.P.’s testimony that the allegations against Lynch could not be true would minimize or eliminate the impact of the DNA evidence and bolster the defense. Furthermore, Lynch fails to demonstrate actual prejudice by speculating that he could have asserted an alibi based on S.P.’s testimony that he was in bed with her at the time M.H. alleged that he raped her. Although S.P. was not available to testify at trial, Lynch acknowledges that ‘[w]e know much of what [S.P.] would have testified to from her statements as they appear in [M.H.’s] medical record from the hospital at the time they took the rape kit.’ Appellant’s brief at 4. Regarding S.P.’s unavailable testimony about M.H.’s motive for fabricating the allegations, the record reflects that Lynch was available to testify, and did, in fact, testify about any motives M.H. may have had for fabricating the allegations. Lynch testified that S.P.’s children did not care for him, did not want him in the home, and wanted S.P. to be with their father rather than Lynch. Accordingly, S.P.’s testimony on this point would have been cumulative to Lynch’s testimony. Lynch’s claim of prejudice regarding the loss of CCDCFS records or notes is speculative at best. He presumes that the CCDCFS investigators took notes during the interviews of M.H. and Lynch, and retained these notes in the case file. As noted above, M.H. recanted her allegations against Lynch approximately two weeks after the May 26, 1994 incident. Lynch asserts that the missing CCDCFS records ‘would provide a concrete explanation of why there was no basis for the prosecution.’ Appellant’s reply brief at 5. Lynch presumes that the CCDCFS records or notes contained a ‘concrete explanation’ — other than the fact that M.H. recanted — as to why the allegations were found to be unsubstantiated. Lynch’s claim of prejudice regarding the loss of chain of custody information is also speculative. There is no evidence that the information regarding the storage conditions at the Fourth District or how the rape kit was transported to the main property room was initially preserved but subsequently lost as a result of the delay. The missing information may be evidence of an incomplete chain of custody; however, this defense would have existed regardless of the passage of time. See Jones II, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101258, 2017-Ohio-176, at ¶ 9. Furthermore, several witnesses — BCI forensic scientist Andrea Dennis, Cleveland Police Officer Alex Parente, BCI forensic scientist Marissa Keeley, Cleveland Police Detective Michael Moctezuma, and Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office Investigator Timothy Clark — were available to testify regarding the rape kit’s collection, sealing, storage, and transportation. Assuming, arguendo, that Lynch sufficiently demonstrated actual prejudice, we find that the trial court properly determined that the delay in prosecution was justified. Lynch argues that the state’s delay in bringing the charges against him was not justifiable because M.H. identified Lynch as her rapist both to S.P. and the police, and the police and prosecution allowed the rape kit to sit untested for 18 years. We disagree. The record reflects that the delay was a result of M.H. recanting her rape allegation approximately two weeks after reporting the allegation to her mother and the police in May 1994. Although a rape kit was conducted at the time of the incident, DNA evidence was not discovered until 2014 when the rape kit was tested by BCI. The DNA evidence establishing that Lynch could not be excluded as a contributor to the DNA profile from M.H.’s rape kit was ‘new evidence’ that justified the delayed indictment. Based on the foregoing analysis, Lynch’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Lynch argues that the state’s delay in bringing the charges against him was not justifiable because M.H. identified Lynch as her rapist both to S.P. and the police, and the police and prosecution allowed the rape kit to sit untested for 18 years. We disagree. The record reflects that the delay was a result of M.H. recanting her rape allegation approximately two weeks after reporting the allegation to her mother and the police in May 1994. Although a rape kit was conducted at the time of the incident, DNA evidence was not discovered until 2014 when the rape kit was tested by BCI. The DNA evidence establishing that Lynch could not be excluded as a contributor to the DNA profile from M.H.’s rape kit was ‘new evidence’ that justified the delayed indictment. Based on the foregoing analysis, Lynch’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Because there was no manifest necessity for the trial court to grant a mistrial, the constitutional protection against being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense required that the charges against [Lynch] be dismissed.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"In his first assignment of error, Lynch argues that the trial court erred by denying his motions to dismiss the indictment based on preindictment delay. The statute of limitations for a criminal offense is a defendant’s primary protection against overly stale criminal charges. However, in some circumstances, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides limited protection against preindictment delay. The Ohio Supreme Court has held that an unjustifiable delay between the commission of an offense and a defendant’s indictment therefor, which results in actual prejudice to the defendant, is a violation of the right to due process of law. The Ohio Supreme Court recently reaffirmed a two-part, burden-shifting test to determine whether preindictment delay constitutes a due process violation. First, the burden is on the defendant to present evidence of actual prejudice; once a defendant does so, the burden then shifts to the state to produce evidence of a justifiable reason for the delay. A determination of actual prejudice involves a delicate judgment and a case-by-case consideration of the particular circumstances. The trial court indicated that it reviewed the case law set forth in Jones I, State v. Jones, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101258, 2017-Ohio-176 (“Jones II”), Luck, 15 Ohio St.3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097, and Whiting, 84 Ohio St.3d 215, 217, 702 N.E.2d 1199. In denying defense counsel’s motion to reconsider, the trial court found the facts of this case to be distinguishable from Jones II. The trial court concluded, ‘I’m not convinced that actual prejudice has occurred from the delay. Even if we get to, you know, the point of actual prejudice in this case. In looking at it when the burden shifts to the State to show that it was not unjustifiable, you know, based on the facts here, I do find that a delay was justifiable anyway.’ (Tr. 596-597.) In reviewing a trial court’s decision on a motion to dismiss for preindictment delay, this court applies a de novo standard of review to the legal issues, but we afford great deference to the trial court’s findings of fact. After reviewing the record, we find that Lynch fails to demonstrate actual prejudice. Although Lynch offered an explanation of what purportedly exculpatory testimony S.P. would have offered, the unavailable testimony must be balanced against the evidence at the time of the indictment to determine whether Lynch would suffer actual prejudice. As noted above, the DNA evidence available at the time of the indictment revealed that Lynch could not be excluded as the source of semen on the vaginal swab from M.H.’s rape kit. We cannot say that S.P.’s testimony that the allegations against Lynch could not be true would minimize or eliminate the impact of the DNA evidence and bolster the defense. Furthermore, Lynch fails to demonstrate actual prejudice by speculating that he could have asserted an alibi based on S.P.’s testimony that he was in bed with her at the time M.H. alleged that he raped her. Although S.P. was not available to testify at trial, Lynch acknowledges that ‘[w]e know much of what [S.P.] would have testified to from her statements as they appear in [M.H.’s] medical record from the hospital at the time they took the rape kit.’ Appellant’s brief at 4. Regarding S.P.’s unavailable testimony about M.H.’s motive for fabricating the allegations, the record reflects that Lynch was available to testify, and did, in fact, testify about any motives M.H. may have had for fabricating the allegations. Lynch testified that S.P.’s children did not care for him, did not want him in the home, and wanted S.P. to be with their father rather than Lynch. Accordingly, S.P.’s testimony on this point would have been cumulative to Lynch’s testimony. Lynch’s claim of prejudice regarding the loss of CCDCFS records or notes is speculative at best. He presumes that the CCDCFS investigators took notes during the interviews of M.H. and Lynch, and retained these notes in the case file. As noted above, M.H. recanted her allegations against Lynch approximately two weeks after the May 26, 1994 incident. Lynch asserts that the missing CCDCFS records ‘would provide a concrete explanation of why there was no basis for the prosecution.’ Appellant’s reply brief at 5. Lynch presumes that the CCDCFS records or notes contained a ‘concrete explanation’ — other than the fact that M.H. recanted — as to why the allegations were found to be unsubstantiated. Lynch’s claim of prejudice regarding the loss of chain of custody information is also speculative. There is no evidence that the information regarding the storage conditions at the Fourth District or how the rape kit was transported to the main property room was initially preserved but subsequently lost as a result of the delay. The missing information may be evidence of an incomplete chain of custody; however, this defense would have existed regardless of the passage of time. See Jones II, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101258, 2017-Ohio-176, at ¶ 9. Furthermore, several witnesses — BCI forensic scientist Andrea Dennis, Cleveland Police Officer Alex Parente, BCI forensic scientist Marissa Keeley, Cleveland Police Detective Michael Moctezuma, and Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office Investigator Timothy Clark — were available to testify regarding the rape kit’s collection, sealing, storage, and transportation.

The DNA evidence establishing that Lynch could not be excluded as a contributor to the DNA profile from M.H.’s rape kit was ‘new evidence’ that justified the delayed indictment.

The first witness was Dilbag, who had moved to New York. The second witness was Lovell, whom detectives were unable to find. The trial court found that both witnesses were unavailable, despite reasonable efforts having been made to secure their appearances. As a result, the trial court allowed the testimony of Dilbag and Lovell from the first trial to be read to the jury in the second trial. In his first assignment of error, Jones argues that the trial court abused its discretion by finding that the witnesses were unavailable. With regard to Dilbag, Jones argues that the state did not show that it had used reasonable efforts because it failed to issue an out-of-state subpoena pursuant to R.C. 2939.26. This argument was not raised below. Since Jones failed to raise this argument below, he has waived all but plain error. To establish plain error pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B), Jones must show “(1) that an error occurred, (2) that the error was obvious, and (3) that the error affected the outcome of the trial.” There was nothing in Dilbag's interaction with law enforcement up until the eve of trial that would have put the state on notice that use of the statute's procedure would have been required. Detective Shawn Cox from the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office testified that he had told Dilbag that he would need to testify at the second trial, and Dilbag indicated that he would do so if he could. He had told the detective that he would need to be compensated for the lost time at work, information Cox said he passed on to the prosecutor. Cox said that he was not able to serve a subpoena on Dilbag because his department could not pay to send him to New York City. While Cox had been in relatively consistent contact with Dilbag since the first trial, the communications dropped off about one week before the second trial was to begin. Calls to Dilbag the week before the trial went straight to voicemail. Cox said that, at that point, Dilbag was “refusing to, in my opinion, come back and refusing to even take my calls at this point.” In light of the fact that Cox did not have reason to suspect that Dilbag would not be cooperative until days before the trial started, the state need not have resorted to the procedures outlined in R.C. 2939.26 to satisfy the requirement that it had used reasonable efforts to secure Dilbag’s appearance. Therefore, it was not plain error for the trial court not to have sua sponte considered the state’s failure to utilize the procedure. On the issue of Lovell’s unavailability, Jones argues that the state’s failure to issue a subpoena to her mother’s house was the reason that the state’s efforts were not reasonable. But there is no indication that this would have been effective. Cox testified that Lovell had been evicted from her apartment and was believed to be homeless. Cox had attempted to contact Lovell through social media and three different cell phone numbers without success. Cox stayed in contact with Lovell’s mother, who did not know where she was and was unable to contact her. Lovell’s mother had hoped to find her by attending a court hearing that Lovell had scheduled in an unrelated matter, but Lovell did not appear at that hearing. There is no indication in the record that issuing a subpoena to Lovell at her mother’s address would have been effective in securing her appearance. The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found her to be unavailable and allowed the state to read her prior testimony to the jury.\"\n}\n```"}

Cox said that, at that point, Dilbag was “refusing to, in my opinion, come back and refusing to even take my calls at this point.” In light of the fact that Cox did not have reason to suspect that Dilbag would not be cooperative until days before the trial started, the state need not have resorted to the procedures outlined in R.C. 2939.26 to satisfy the requirement that it had used reasonable efforts to secure Dilbag’s appearance.

Cox had attempted to contact Lovell through social media and three different cell phone numbers without success. Cox stayed in contact with Lovell’s mother, who did not know where she was and was unable to contact her. Lovell’s mother had hoped to find her by attending a court hearing that Lovell had scheduled in an unrelated matter, but Lovell did not appear at that hearing.

During her opening statement, the state’s attorney told the jury that police came to A.W.’s home the morning that she reported her daughter’s rape, and while they were there, encountered Moore. The state’s attorney told the jury that ‘Chief Meister asked if [Moore] had—would like to come down to the police department,’ but ‘[Moore] refused, as is his right to do.’ Defense counsel objected. He argued that Moore had ‘a right to counsel and the fact that he didn’t want to be interviewed by a police officer * * * is wildly inadmissible.’ He insisted that this was ‘major error.’ The state’s attorney offered to have the comment stricken. Instead, the court addressed the jury and told them that it was Moore’s right not to give a statement and to disregard any remark about Moore’s decision not to give a statement to the police. It instructed the jury that ‘nothing can be inferred from the fact that defendant chose not to give a statement to the police at that time.’ Moore moved for a mistrial, which the court denied. The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that ‘[u]se of a defendant’s pre-arrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt violates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.’ State v. Leach, 102 Ohio St.3d 135, 2004-Ohio-2147, 807 N.E.2d 335. We, therefore, agree with Moore that the state improperly commented on his refusal to accompany Chief Meister to the police station.

In the context of examining whether prejudice has resulted from the state’s comment about the defendant’s assertion of his right to silence, courts consider factors such as ‘the extent of the comments, whether an inference of guilt from silence was stressed to the jury, and the extent of other evidence suggesting the defendant’s guilt.’ State v.

Defense counsel objected and the trial court offered a limiting instruction. While the appellate court found the prosecutor’s remark to be improper, it found no prejudicial error because the evidence against the defendant was strong, ‘the trial court immediately ordered the jury to disregard the statement, and the issue was not revisited.’ Id. at ¶ 21.

Here, while the state should not have commented on Moore’s refusal to go to the station, the remark was isolated and was followed by an acknowledgment by the state that Moore had the right to refuse to go to the station at that point.

Lorain No. 99CA007451, 2001 WL 39604, *2-3 (Jan. 17, 2001) (finding no prejudice where prosecutor’s improper comment about defendant’s silence ‘was discrete in nature, led to an immediately sustained objection, was retracted by an apology by the prosecutor, and was not repeated.’). Here, while the state should not have commented on Moore’s refusal to go to the station, the remark was isolated and was followed by an acknowledgment by the state that Moore had the right to refuse to go to the station at that point. The trial court immediately issued a curative instruction, admonishing the jury to disregard the statement. ‘A jury is presumed to follow instructions of the court and to obey curative instructions.’ State v. McAlphine, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 79216, 2002 WL 120529, *7 (Jan. 24, 2002), citing State v. Loza, 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 79, 641 N.E.2d 1082 (1984). Moreover, the comment was never revisited and the evidence against Moore was strong and included testimony from the victim and her mother, medical records and testimony from the SANE nurse who observed injury consistent with the victim’s account, and corroborating DNA evidence.

He claims that the state’s comments suggested to the jury that this demonstrated his guilt. During her opening statement, the state’s attorney told the jury that police came to A.W.’s home the morning that she reported her daughter’s rape, and while they were there, encountered Moore. The state’s attorney told the jury that ‘Chief Meister asked if [Moore] had—would like to come down to the police department,’ but ‘[Moore] refused, as is his right to do.’ Defense counsel objected. He argued that Moore had ‘a right to counsel and the fact that he didn’t want to be interviewed by a police officer * * * is wildly inadmissible.’ He insisted that this was ‘major error.’ The state’s attorney offered to have the comment stricken. Instead, the court addressed the jury and told them that it was Moore’s right not to give a statement and to disregard any remark about Moore’s decision not to give a statement to the police. It instructed the jury that ‘nothing can be inferred from the fact that defendant chose not to give a statement to the police at that time.’ Moore moved for a mistrial, which the court denied. The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that ‘[u]se of a defendant’s pre-arrest silence as substantive evidence of guilt violates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.’ State v. Leach, 102 Ohio St.3d 135, 2004-Ohio-2147, 807 N.E.2d 335. We, therefore, agree with Moore that the state improperly commented on his refusal to accompany Chief Meister to the police station. See State v. Shea, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. B-840720, 1985 WL 8938, *3 (July 17, 1985) (‘Where * * * the state interjects the defendant’s prearrest silence into the case in its opening statement, it does so in error.’). But ‘violations of a defendant’s constitutional right against self-incrimination are subject to a harmless error review.’ State v. Castle, 2017-Ohio-942, 86 N.E.3d 813, ¶ 22 (7th Dist.). Error is harmless under Crim.R. 52(A) if it does not affect substantial rights. ‘In most cases, in order to be viewed as ‘affecting substantial rights,’ the error must have been prejudicial.’ (Internal citations and quotations omitted.) State v. Harris, 142 Ohio St.3d 211, 2015-Ohio-166, 28 N.E.3d 1256, ¶ 36. An error will be deemed ‘prejudicial’ if there is a reasonable probability that it affected the outcome of the judicial proceedings. State v. Taylor, 2017-Ohio-4395, 93 N.E.3d 1, ¶ 15 (4th Dist.). In the context of examining whether prejudice has resulted from the state’s comment about the defendant’s assertion of his right to silence, courts consider factors such as ‘the extent of the comments, whether an inference of guilt from silence was stressed to the jury, and the extent of other evidence suggesting the defendant’s guilt.’ State v. Contreras, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 89728, 2008-Ohio-1413, ¶ 34. In State v. Ramey, 5th Dist. Delaware No. 12 CAC 03 0034, 2013-Ohio-665, the Fifth District considered whether similar remarks constituted prejudicial error. There, the state told the jury during opening statement that ‘[t]hey attempted to talk to [the defendant] again, she declined any further interviews with them and so—.’ Id. at ¶ 12. Defense counsel objected and the trial court offered a limiting instruction. While the appellate court found the prosecutor’s remark to be improper, it found no prejudicial error because the evidence against the defendant was strong, ‘the trial court immediately ordered the jury to disregard the statement, and the issue was not revisited.’ Id. at ¶ 21. See also State v. Smith, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 99CA007451, 2001 WL 39604, *2-3 (Jan. 17, 2001) (finding no prejudice where prosecutor’s improper comment about defendant’s silence ‘was discrete in nature, led to an immediately sustained objection, was retracted by an apology by the prosecutor, and was not repeated.’).

Martin argues that the one-person arrest-scene show-up in which Rickman, Cannon, and Johnson identified him was impermissibly suggestive. Martin challenges as suggestive the fact that he was the only suspect presented at the show-up, he was in handcuffs in the back seat of a police cruiser, and the police failed to resort to less suggestive means like a more traditional lineup. He further contends that the identifications were unreliable under the totality of the circumstances. He maintains that none of witnesses' observations satisfy the factors set forth in Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972). Assuming without deciding that the show-up procedure employed by the police was suggestive, we cannot conclude the trial court erred by failing to suppress the three witnesses' identifications where the totality of the circumstances and all five of the Biggers factors supported the trial court's finding that the witnesses' identifications of Martin were sufficiently reliable. All three witnesses had a good opportunity to view Martin during the commission of the crimes; they provided consistent and thorough descriptions of him to the police and to the 911 operator; they were certain of the identification at the time; and they identified Martin within 30 minutes after the crime while their memories were still fresh. Martin also argues that the state failed to comply with R.C. 2933.83(B) which requires any law enforcement agency that conducts a live lineup to adopt specific procedures for conducting the lineup. R.C. 2933.83(A)(7) defines a 'live lineup' as an 'identification procedure in which a group of persons, including the suspected perpetrator of an offense and other persons not suspected of the offense, is displayed to an eyewitness for the purpose of determining whether the eyewitness identifies the suspect as the perpetrator of the offense.' The one-person show-up identification utilized by the police in this case does not satisfy the statutory definition of a live lineup. Thus, R.C. 2933.83 does not apply. We hold that the trial court properly denied Martin’s motion to suppress. Therefore, we overrule the first assignment of error.\"\n}\n```"}

Appellant argues that trying the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material count with the other counts would prejudice his defense against the remaining charges of rape, kidnapping, etc. Appellant cites *State v. Slaven*, 191 Ohio App.3d 340, 2010-Ohio-6400 (court erred in joining sexual assault of two different children because evidence in one case would not be admissible in the other) and *State v. Clements*, 98 Ohio App.3d 797, 649 N.E.2d 912 (2nd Dist. 1994 (error for court to join unrelated charges of burglary and robbery in the same trial) in support of his argument. In response, the State argues that Ohio law favors joinder of offenses that are of the same or similar character citing *State v. Hariston*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 06CA3081, 2007-Ohio-3880. The State argues that the offense of illegal use of nudity-oriented material involving a minor is similar in character to sex offenses committed against A.C. because both involve child victims and criminal sexual behavior. The State also submits that the evidence was admissible as ‘other acts evidence.’ However, as the State recognizes, other acts evidence cannot be used to show that the defendant acted in conformity with his character, but may be admitted to show a defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act. Although not made clear in its brief, the State appears to imply that Appellant’s possession of nudity-oriented materials was evidence of a plan to commit the rape offenses against A.C. The trial court denied Appellant’s motion to sever count two, and Appellant did not renew his motion at the close of the State’s case or at the close of all the evidence. Therefore, we review this assignment of error under a plain error analysis. Crim.R. 8(A) provides that: ‘[t]wo or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment, * * * in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar character * * *.’ ‘Courts broadly construe the phrase ‘of the same or similar character’ so that joinder of similar offenses is generally the rule, not the exception.’ *State v. Parham*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 16AP-826, 2019-Ohio-358, 121 N.E.3d 412, ¶ 24, citing *State v. Kennedy*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-120337, 2013-Ohio-4221, 998 N.E.2d 1189, ¶ 26, *State v. Bennie*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-020497, 2004-Ohio-1264, 2004 WL 535277, ¶ 17. ‘The law favors joining multiple criminal offenses in a single trial.’ *State v. Franklin*, 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 122, 580 N.E.2d 1 (1991), citing Crim.R. 8(A), *State v. Lott*, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). ‘This is because joint trials ‘conserve state funds, diminish inconvenience to witnesses and public authorities, and avoid delays in bringing those accused of crime to trial.’’ State v. Gordon, 152 Ohio St.3d 528, 532, 2018-Ohio-259, 98 N.E.3d 251, ¶ 18, quoting Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 134, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). However, Crim.R. 14 states: ‘If it appears that a defendant * * * is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses * * * for trial together, the court shall order an election or separate trial of counts * * * or provide such other relief as justice requires.’ Therefore, ‘a trial court should order separate trials pursuant to Crim.R. 14 if it appears the defendant is prejudiced by the joinder.’ Gordon, 152 Ohio St.3d 528, 533, 2018-Ohio-259, 98 N.E.3d 251, ¶ 20. A defendant claiming that a trial court erred in not severing charges ‘has the burden of affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced; he must furnish the trial court with sufficient information so that it [could] weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial * * *.’ State v. Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981), at the syllabus. ‘[C]laims of prejudice are less persuasive where the evidence is “amply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together.” State v. Sapp, 105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, The State has two methods it may use to negate any claims of prejudice caused by joinder: (1) it may argue that it could have introduced evidence of the separate count under the “other acts” portion of Evid.R. 404(B) as recognized in State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293, or (2) show that the evidence of each crime joined at trial is simple and direct as was recognized in Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 344, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981), State v. Miller, 105 Ohio App.3d 679, 691-692, 664 N.E.2d 1309 (4th Dist. 1995). ‘‘[W]hen simple and direct evidence exists, an accused is not prejudiced by joinder regardless of the nonadmissibility of evidence of these crimes as ‘other acts’ under Evid.R. 404(B).’’ Id. at 691, quoting Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d at 297. In Appellant’s one-page brief filed in the trial court, he alleged that ‘trying the two charges together would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury by portraying him in an unfavorable light.’ And in his appellate brief, Appellant alleges that the child pornography has no relevancy to the sexual assault allegations regarding A.C. He also alleges that the evidence supporting the child pornography was ‘speculative and weak.’ We find that Appellant did not satisfy his affirmative burden in the trial court showing that his rights were prejudiced because he didn’t furnish the trial court with ‘sufficient information so that it [could] weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial.’ In his appeal, Appellant submits there is no relevancy between the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material and the sexual assault charges (rape, kidnapping). However, nowhere does he argue how trying all the charges together will result in prejudice. We also find that the cases Appellant cites (Slaven - court erred in joining sexual assault of two different children because evidence in one case would not be admissible in the other, and Clements - error for court to join unrelated charges of burglary and robbery in the same trial) are not particularly persuasive to the particular facts of this case. Accordingly, we find that Appellant has failed his burden of ‘affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced’ in the trial court or on appeal, so there is no plain error. Even assuming arguendo that trying count two with the remaining charges did result in prejudice, because there is evidence ‘amply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together,’ Appellant’s claim of prejudice from trying the sexual assault claims with the illegal use of nudity-oriented material is less persuasive. _Sapp_, 105 Ohio St.3d at ¶ 73. We also find that the evidence in this case supporting both the illegal use of nudity-oriented material and the sexual assault charges against A.C. is ‘simple and direct’ and therefore trying them together was not reversible error. _See State v. Craig_, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2016-L-113, 2017-Ohio-8939, ¶ 29-31. In _Craig_, the defendant was charged with numerous criminal counts, including rape of his daughter and pandering obscenity involving a minor for possessing ‘749 photographs/videos of child pornography, with many of pictures featuring girls appearing to be the same age [as the victim].’ _Id._ at ¶ 10. The defendant in _Craig_ appealed the trial court’s denial of his motion to sever the pandering obscenity involving a minor charge from the rape charge, alleging it denied him a fair trial. _Id._ at ¶ 22. While the court found that the images from the pandering charge were not admissible in regard to the rape charge under Evid.R. 404(B), it went on to find that ‘[g]iven the nature of the basic elements of the eleven counts, the provocable evidence necessary to prove those counts is simple and direct.’ _Id._ at ¶ 30. The court of appeals found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to sever. Similar to Craig, Appellant was convicted of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material based images of naked juveniles, some engaging in sex acts, that were recovered from Appellant’s PS3, and his rape conviction was based on physical evidence of injury to A.C.’s genital area together with her testimony identifying Appellant as the perpetrator. We find the evidence of both charges was ‘simple and direct.’ Therefore, even assuming arguendo that trying both charges together could have resulted in prejudice, the simple and direct evidence supporting both charges dictates the trial court’s refusal to sever the charges is not plain error. State v. Miller, 105 Ohio App.3d 679, 690-692, 664 N.E.2d 1309 (4th Dist. 1995) (Simple and direct evidence negates any prejudice). For all the aforementioned reasons, under these facts, we find no plain error because the trial court’s refusal to sever count two did not affect Appellant’s substantial rights so as to create a manifest miscarriage of justice. Therefore, we overrule Appellant’s first assignment or error.\"\n}\n```"}

In _Craig_, the defendant was charged with numerous criminal counts, including rape of his daughter and pandering obscenity involving a minor for possessing ‘749 photographs/videos of child pornography, with many of pictures featuring girls appearing to be the same age [as the victim].’ _Id._ at ¶ 10. The defendant in _Craig_ appealed the trial court’s denial of his motion to sever the pandering obscenity involving a minor charge from the rape charge, alleging it denied him a fair trial. _Id._ at ¶ 22. While the court found that the images from the pandering charge were not admissible in regard to the rape charge under Evid.R. 404(B), it went on to find that ‘[g]iven the nature of the basic elements of the eleven counts, the provocable evidence necessary to prove those counts is simple and direct.’ _Id._ at ¶ 30. The court of appeals found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to sever. Similar to Craig, Appellant was convicted of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material based images of naked juveniles, some engaging in sex acts, that were recovered from Appellant’s PS3, and his rape conviction was based on physical evidence of injury to A.C.’s genital area together with her testimony identifying Appellant as the perpetrator. We find the evidence of both charges was ‘simple and direct.’ Therefore, even assuming arguendo that trying both charges together could have resulted in prejudice, the simple and direct evidence supporting both charges dictates the trial court’s refusal to sever the charges is not plain error. State v. Miller, 105 Ohio App.3d 679, 690-692, 664 N.E.2d 1309 (4th Dist. 1995) (Simple and direct evidence negates any prejudice). For all the aforementioned reasons, under these facts, we find no plain error because the trial court’s refusal to sever count two did not affect Appellant’s substantial rights so as to create a manifest miscarriage of justice. Therefore, we overrule Appellant’s first assignment or error.\"\n}\n```"}

Appellant argues that trying the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material count with the other counts would prejudice his defense against the remaining charges of rape, kidnapping, etc. Appellant cites *State v. Slaven*, 191 Ohio App.3d 340, 2010-Ohio-6400 (court erred in joining sexual assault of two different children because evidence in one case would not be admissible in the other) and *State v. Clements*, 98 Ohio App.3d 797, 649 N.E.2d 912 (2nd Dist. 1994 (error for court to join unrelated charges of burglary and robbery in the same trial) in support of his argument. In response, the State argues that Ohio law favors joinder of offenses that are of the same or similar character citing *State v. Hariston*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 06CA3081, 2007-Ohio-3880. The State argues that the offense of illegal use of nudity-oriented material involving a minor is similar in character to sex offenses committed against A.C. because both involve child victims and criminal sexual behavior. The State also submits that the evidence was admissible as ‘other acts evidence.’ However, as the State recognizes, other acts evidence cannot be used to show that the defendant acted in conformity with his character, but may be admitted to show a defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act. Although not made clear in its brief, the State appears to imply that Appellant’s possession of nudity-oriented materials was evidence of a plan to commit the rape offenses against A.C. The trial court denied Appellant’s motion to sever count two, and Appellant did not renew his motion at the close of the State’s case or at the close of all the evidence. Therefore, we review this assignment of error under a plain error analysis. Crim.R. 8(A) provides that: ‘[t]wo or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment, * * * in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar character * * *.’ ‘Courts broadly construe the phrase ‘of the same or similar character’ so that joinder of similar offenses is generally the rule, not the exception.’ *State v.

Bennie*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-020497, 2004-Ohio-1264, 2004 WL 535277, ¶ 17. ‘The law favors joining multiple criminal offenses in a single trial.’ *State v. Franklin*, 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 122, 580 N.E.2d 1 (1991), citing Crim.R. 8(A), *State v. Lott*, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). ‘This is because joint trials ‘conserve state funds, diminish inconvenience to witnesses and public authorities, and avoid delays in bringing those accused of crime to trial.’’ State v. Gordon, 152 Ohio St.3d 528, 532, 2018-Ohio-259, 98 N.E.3d 251, ¶ 18, quoting Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 134, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). However, Crim.R. 14 states: ‘If it appears that a defendant * * * is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses * * * for trial together, the court shall order an election or separate trial of counts * * * or provide such other relief as justice requires.’ Therefore, ‘a trial court should order separate trials pursuant to Crim.R. 14 if it appears the defendant is prejudiced by the joinder.’ Gordon, 152 Ohio St.3d 528, 533, 2018-Ohio-259, 98 N.E.3d 251, ¶ 20. A defendant claiming that a trial court erred in not severing charges ‘has the burden of affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced; he must furnish the trial court with sufficient information so that it [could] weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial * * *.’ State v. Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981), at the syllabus. ‘[C]laims of prejudice are less persuasive where the evidence is “amply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together.” State v. Sapp, 105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, The State has two methods it may use to negate any claims of prejudice caused by joinder: (1) it may argue that it could have introduced evidence of the separate count under the “other acts” portion of Evid.R. 404(B) as recognized in State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293, or (2) show that the evidence of each crime joined at trial is simple and direct as was recognized in Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 344, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981), State v. Miller, 105 Ohio App.3d 679, 691-692, 664 N.E.2d 1309 (4th Dist. 1995). ‘‘[W]hen simple and direct evidence exists, an accused is not prejudiced by joinder regardless of the nonadmissibility of evidence of these crimes as ‘other acts’ under Evid.R. 404(B).’’ Id. at 691, quoting Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d at 297. In Appellant’s one-page brief filed in the trial court, he alleged that ‘trying the two charges together would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury by portraying him in an unfavorable light.’ And in his appellate brief, Appellant alleges that the child pornography has no relevancy to the sexual assault allegations regarding A.C. He also alleges that the evidence supporting the child pornography was ‘speculative and weak.’ We find that Appellant did not satisfy his affirmative burden in the trial court showing that his rights were prejudiced because he didn’t furnish the trial court with ‘sufficient information so that it [could] weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial.’ In his appeal, Appellant submits there is no relevancy between the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material and the sexual assault charges (rape, kidnapping). However, nowhere does he argue how trying all the charges together will result in prejudice. We also find that the cases Appellant cites (Slaven - court erred in joining sexual assault of two different children because evidence in one case would not be admissible in the other, and Clements - error for court to join unrelated charges of burglary and robbery in the same trial) are not particularly persuasive to the particular facts of this case. Accordingly, we find that Appellant has failed his burden of ‘affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced’ in the trial court or on appeal, so there is no plain error. Even assuming arguendo that trying count two with the remaining charges did result in prejudice, because there is evidence ‘amply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together,’ Appellant’s claim of prejudice from trying the sexual assault claims with the illegal use of nudity-oriented material is less persuasive. _Sapp_, 105 Ohio St.3d at ¶ 73.

In _Craig_, the defendant was charged with numerous criminal counts, including rape of his daughter and pandering obscenity involving a minor for possessing ‘749 photographs/videos of child pornography, with many of pictures featuring girls appearing to be the same age [as the victim].’ _Id._ at ¶ 10. The defendant in _Craig_ appealed the trial court’s denial of his motion to sever the pandering obscenity involving a minor charge from the rape charge, alleging it denied him a fair trial. _Id._ at ¶ 22. While the court found that the images from the pandering charge were not admissible in regard to the rape charge under Evid.R. 404(B), it went on to find that ‘[g]iven the nature of the basic elements of the eleven counts, the provocable evidence necessary to prove those counts is simple and direct.’ _Id._ at ¶ 30. The court of appeals found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to sever. Similar to Craig, Appellant was convicted of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material based images of naked juveniles, some engaging in sex acts, that were recovered from Appellant’s PS3, and his rape conviction was based on physical evidence of injury to A.C.’s genital area together with her testimony identifying Appellant as the perpetrator. We find the evidence of both charges was ‘simple and direct.’ Therefore, even assuming arguendo that trying both charges together could have resulted in prejudice, the simple and direct evidence supporting both charges dictates the trial court’s refusal to sever the charges is not plain error. State v. Miller, 105 Ohio App.3d 679, 690-692, 664 N.E.2d 1309 (4th Dist. 1995) (Simple and direct evidence negates any prejudice). For all the aforementioned reasons, under these facts, we find no plain error because the trial court’s refusal to sever count two did not affect Appellant’s substantial rights so as to create a manifest miscarriage of justice. Therefore, we overrule Appellant’s first assignment or error.\"\n}\n```"}

Appellant argues that trying the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material count with the other counts would prejudice his defense against the remaining charges of rape, kidnapping, etc. Appellant cites *State v. Slaven*, 191 Ohio App.3d 340, 2010-Ohio-6400 (court erred in joining sexual assault of two different children because evidence in one case would not be admissible in the other) and *State v. Clements*, 98 Ohio App.3d 797, 649 N.E.2d 912 (2nd Dist. 1994 (error for court to join unrelated charges of burglary and robbery in the same trial) in support of his argument. In response, the State argues that Ohio law favors joinder of offenses that are of the same or similar character citing *State v. Hariston*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 06CA3081, 2007-Ohio-3880. The State argues that the offense of illegal use of nudity-oriented material involving a minor is similar in character to sex offenses committed against A.C. because both involve child victims and criminal sexual behavior. The State also submits that the evidence was admissible as ‘other acts evidence.’ However, as the State recognizes, other acts evidence cannot be used to show that the defendant acted in conformity with his character, but may be admitted to show a defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act. Although not made clear in its brief, the State appears to imply that Appellant’s possession of nudity-oriented materials was evidence of a plan to commit the rape offenses against A.C. The trial court denied Appellant’s motion to sever count two, and Appellant did not renew his motion at the close of the State’s case or at the close of all the evidence. Therefore, we review this assignment of error under a plain error analysis. Crim.R. 8(A) provides that: ‘[t]wo or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment, * * * in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged * * * are of the same or similar character * * *.’ ‘Courts broadly construe the phrase ‘of the same or similar character’ so that joinder of similar offenses is generally the rule, not the exception.’ *State v. Parham*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 16AP-826, 2019-Ohio-358, 121 N.E.3d 412, ¶ 24, citing *State v. Kennedy*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-120337, 2013-Ohio-4221, 998 N.E.2d 1189, ¶ 26, *State v. Bennie*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-020497, 2004-Ohio-1264, 2004 WL 535277, ¶ 17. ‘The law favors joining multiple criminal offenses in a single trial.’ *State v. Franklin*, 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 122, 580 N.E.2d 1 (1991), citing Crim.R. 8(A), *State v. Lott*, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). ‘This is because joint trials ‘conserve state funds, diminish inconvenience to witnesses and public authorities, and avoid delays in bringing those accused of crime to trial.’’ State v. Gordon, 152 Ohio St.3d 528, 532, 2018-Ohio-259, 98 N.E.3d 251, ¶ 18, quoting Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 134, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). However, Crim.R. 14 states: ‘If it appears that a defendant * * * is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses * * * for trial together, the court shall order an election or separate trial of counts * * * or provide such other relief as justice requires.’ Therefore, ‘a trial court should order separate trials pursuant to Crim.R. 14 if it appears the defendant is prejudiced by the joinder.’ Gordon, 152 Ohio St.3d 528, 533, 2018-Ohio-259, 98 N.E.3d 251, ¶ 20. A defendant claiming that a trial court erred in not severing charges ‘has the burden of affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced; he must furnish the trial court with sufficient information so that it [could] weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial * * *.’ State v. Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981), at the syllabus. ‘[C]laims of prejudice are less persuasive where the evidence is “amply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together.” State v. Sapp, 105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, The State has two methods it may use to negate any claims of prejudice caused by joinder: (1) it may argue that it could have introduced evidence of the separate count under the “other acts” portion of Evid.R. 404(B) as recognized in State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293, or (2) show that the evidence of each crime joined at trial is simple and direct as was recognized in Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 344, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981), State v. Miller, 105 Ohio App.3d 679, 691-692, 664 N.E.2d 1309 (4th Dist. 1995). ‘‘[W]hen simple and direct evidence exists, an accused is not prejudiced by joinder regardless of the nonadmissibility of evidence of these crimes as ‘other acts’ under Evid.R. 404(B).’’ Id. at 691, quoting Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d at 297. In Appellant’s one-page brief filed in the trial court, he alleged that ‘trying the two charges together would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury by portraying him in an unfavorable light.’ And in his appellate brief, Appellant alleges that the child pornography has no relevancy to the sexual assault allegations regarding A.C. He also alleges that the evidence supporting the child pornography was ‘speculative and weak.’ We find that Appellant did not satisfy his affirmative burden in the trial court showing that his rights were prejudiced because he didn’t furnish the trial court with ‘sufficient information so that it [could] weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial.’ In his appeal, Appellant submits there is no relevancy between the illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material and the sexual assault charges (rape, kidnapping). However, nowhere does he argue how trying all the charges together will result in prejudice. We also find that the cases Appellant cites (Slaven - court erred in joining sexual assault of two different children because evidence in one case would not be admissible in the other, and Clements - error for court to join unrelated charges of burglary and robbery in the same trial) are not particularly persuasive to the particular facts of this case. Accordingly, we find that Appellant has failed his burden of ‘affirmatively showing that his rights were prejudiced’ in the trial court or on appeal, so there is no plain error. Even assuming arguendo that trying count two with the remaining charges did result in prejudice, because there is evidence ‘amply sufficient to sustain each verdict, whether or not the indictments were tried together,’ Appellant’s claim of prejudice from trying the sexual assault claims with the illegal use of nudity-oriented material is less persuasive. _Sapp_, 105 Ohio St.3d at ¶ 73.

State v. Morris, 132 Ohio St.3d 337, 2012-Ohio-2407, syllabus. 'Appeals of such decisions are considered by an appellate court under an abuse-of-discretion standard of review.' Id. 'Abuse of discretion' has been described as including a ruling that lacks a'sound reasoning process.' Id. at ¶ 14, quoting AAAA Ents., Inc. v. River Place Community Urban Redevelopment Corp., 50 Ohio St.3d 157, 161 (1990). See also State v. Brady, 119 Ohio St.3d 375, 2008-Ohio-4493, ¶ 23. Appellant notes his trial counsel did not object to the physical abuse evidence and, thus, waived all but plain error. State v. Hanna, 95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, ¶ 84; Crim.R. 52(B). 'Generally, extrinsic acts may not be used to prove the inference that the accused acted in conformity with his other acts or that he has a propensity to act in such a manner.' State v. Smith, 49 Ohio St.3d 137, 140 (1990). However, Evid.R. 404(B) permits other-acts evidence for other purposes, including but not limited to the purposes identified in the rule. Id. See also Morris at ¶ 13. The rule provides that '[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.' Evid.R. 404(B). See also R.C. 2945.59. 'Another consideration permitting the admission of certain other-acts evidence is whether the other acts 'form part of the immediate background of the alleged act which forms the foundation of the crime charged in the indictment' and are 'inextricably related' to the crime.' Morris at ¶ 13, quoting State v. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 73 (1975). Thus, '[e]vidence of other crimes may be presented when' those crimes tend 'logically to prove any element of the crime charged.' State v. Horsley, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-350, 2006-Ohio-1208, ¶ 24. To determine the admissibility of the other-acts evidence, a court must first 'consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.' State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, ¶ 20, citing Evid.R. 401. Second, a court must 'consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in conformity therewith or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B).' Id. Finally, the court must 'consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.' *Id.*, citing Evid.R. 403. A number of the rape charges at issue charged appellant pursuant to R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), which provides that '[n]o person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.' 'Force' is defined as 'any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.' R.C. 2901.01(A)(1). To prove the force element of a sexual offense, the state must establish force beyond that force inherent in the crime itself. *State v. Griffith*, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-1042, 2006-Ohio-6983, ¶ 17, citing *State v. Dye*, 82 Ohio St.3d 323 (1998). However, the 'force and violence necessary to commit the crime of rape depends upon the age, size and strength of the parties and their relation to each other.' *State v. Eskridge*, 38 Ohio St.3d 56 (1988), paragraph one of the syllabus. In cases involving parents or stepparents sexually abusing their children, the force''need not be overt or physically brutal, but can be subtle and psychological. As long as it can be shown that the rape victim's will was overcome by fear or duress, the forcible element of rape can be established.''*Id.* at 58-59, quoting *State v. Fowler*, 27 Ohio App.3d 149, 154 (8th Dist.1985). *See also Griffith* at ¶ 17; *Dye* at 326. *Compare State v. Schaim*, 65 Ohio St.3d 51 (1992), paragraph one of the syllabus. Thus, evidence of a defendant's prior acts of violence may demonstrate why a victim's will was overcome by their fear of the defendant, and thereby establish the force element of a rape charge. *See State v. Williamson*, 8th Dist. No. 80982, 2002-Ohio-6503, ¶ 23 (noting the 'evidence of the physical violence that occurred in the household [was] relevant to and probative of the method of control used by defendant to rape and sexually abuse the victim'); *State v. Jordan*, 2d Dist. No. 26163, 2016-Ohio-603, ¶ 21 (holding that the 'other-acts evidence' of the defendant's violent acts was'relevant to the element of force'); *State v. Scott*, 5th Dist. No. 11CA80, 2012-Ohio-3482, ¶ 28-29 (noting the evidence indicating that the defendant killed the victim's baby sister 'was offered to show the victim's state of mind; * * * and why she was in fear of [defendant],' and thus was not 'improper propensity evidence, but instead tend[ed] to show an element of the crime [of rape], force'). N.F. explained he did not want to engage in the sexual acts with appellant, but stated he 'never questioned what' appellant told him to do, because if he questioned appellant that'results to physical violence or physical abuse.' (Tr. Vol. II 108.) Thus, the physical abuse evidence demonstrated N.F.'s will was overcome by his fear of appellant, and explained why N.F. did not resist appellant's demands for sexual activity. Additionally, during N.F.'s testimony, the court provided the jury with the following limiting instruction: Let me just advise you that I have permitted testimony on the direct examination of this witness dealing with alleged prior bad acts on behalf of the [appellant] in this case. I did not admit that evidence to show that [appellant], if he did commit a bad act before, he acted in conformance with that action with respect to [N.F.] and the matters that you are to decide, the sexual-related offenses. But I have permitted that to be introduced for the purpose of showing [N.F.'s] state of mind and whether he was fearful of [appellant]. So you can only consider it for that purpose and that purpose only. (Tr. Vol. II at 69-70.) We presume the jury followed the court's instruction. State v. Jones, 135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, ¶ 194. Appellant argues the trial court's failure to reiterate the limiting instruction when other witnesses testified to the physical abuse, or to reiterate the instruction in the final jury instructions, amounts to plain error. Although 'the failure to give any limiting instruction constitutes plain error,' here the trial court did provide the jury with a limiting instruction the first time the other-acts evidence was presented. State v. Shaw, 2d Dist. No. 21880, 2008-Ohio-1317, ¶ 13, quoting State v. Tisdale, 2d Dist.

The evidence of physical abuse was relevant to a fact of consequence, as it established the force element of the rape charges. Williams at ¶ 20. The evidence was not presented to prove appellant acted in conformity therewith, and the court instructed the jury the evidence was not to be used for that purpose. Id. The probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, and any danger of unfair prejudice was reduced by the court's limiting instruction. Id. at ¶ 24. Appellant further argues that, even if N.F.'s testimony of the physical abuse was admissible, the additional evidence from L.A., C.A.W., and children services caseworkers regarding the physical abuse deprived him of a fair trial. However, appellant testified N.F. had lied about all of the sexual abuse allegations. The testimony from the other witnesses corroborated N.F.'s testimony regarding the physical abuse and, thus, served to bolster N.F.'s credibility. Evidence which impeaches or bolsters witness credibility 'is of consequence to the action because it might determine whether the jury believes a particular witness.' State v. Moore, 40 Ohio St.3d 63, 65 (1988). Moreover, appellant admitted his methods of disciplining N.F. constituted physical abuse. In closing, defense counsel relied on the fact that appellant 'freely told' the jury that 'his methods of disciplining [N.F.] were not good,' to bolster appellant's credibility. (Tr. Vol. V at 94.) The defense also argued the years of physical abuse, coupled with appellant cutting N.F. off financially, provided N.F. with the motivation to fabricate the sexual abuse allegations against appellant. (See Tr. Vol. V at 94-95.) To the extent that some of the physical abuse evidence may have been unnecessarily cumulative, the admission of such evidence amounts to harmless error. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect one. State v. Williams, 38 Ohio St.3d 346, 349 (1988). 'The harmless-error doctrine recognizes the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant's guilt or innocence,' and thus focuses 'on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.' Id. An error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt when the remaining evidence, standing alone, constitutes overwhelming proof of defendant's guilt. Id. See also State v. Tucker, 10th Dist. No. 00AP-670, 2002-Ohio-3274, ¶ 44; Morris at ¶ 32; Crim.R. 52(A). The evidence of the crimes for which the jury returned guilty verdicts was considerable. In addition to N.F.'s detailed description of each sexual act, L.A. testified to the sexual activity that occurred between herself, N.F., and appellant, and C.A.W. provided circumstantial evidence that sexual activity occurred between appellant, L.A., and N.F. Accordingly, as the record contains overwhelming evidence of appellant's guilt on the sex crimes, any error in the admission of physical abuse evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n}\n```"}

See also Morris at ¶ 13. The rule provides that '[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.

Morris at ¶ 13, quoting State v. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 73 (1975). Thus, '[e]vidence of other crimes may be presented when' those crimes tend 'logically to prove any element of the crime charged.' State v. Horsley, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-350, 2006-Ohio-1208, ¶ 24. To determine the admissibility of the other-acts evidence, a court must first 'consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.' State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, ¶ 20, citing Evid.R. 401. Second, a court must 'consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in conformity therewith or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B).' Id. Finally, the court must 'consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.' *Id.*, citing Evid.R. 403. A number of the rape charges at issue charged appellant pursuant to R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), which provides that '[n]o person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.' 'Force' is defined as 'any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.' R.C. 2901.01(A)(1). To prove the force element of a sexual offense, the state must establish force beyond that force inherent in the crime itself. *State v. Griffith*, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-1042, 2006-Ohio-6983, ¶ 17, citing *State v. Dye*, 82 Ohio St.3d 323 (1998). However, the 'force and violence necessary to commit the crime of rape depends upon the age, size and strength of the parties and their relation to each other.' *State v. Eskridge*, 38 Ohio St.3d 56 (1988), paragraph one of the syllabus. In cases involving parents or stepparents sexually abusing their children, the force''need not be overt or physically brutal, but can be subtle and psychological. As long as it can be shown that the rape victim's will was overcome by fear or duress, the forcible element of rape can be established.''*Id.* at 58-59, quoting *State v. Fowler*, 27 Ohio App.3d 149, 154 (8th Dist.1985). *See also Griffith* at ¶ 17; *Dye* at 326. *Compare State v. Schaim*, 65 Ohio St.3d 51 (1992), paragraph one of the syllabus. Thus, evidence of a defendant's prior acts of violence may demonstrate why a victim's will was overcome by their fear of the defendant, and thereby establish the force element of a rape charge. *See State v. Williamson*, 8th Dist. No. 80982, 2002-Ohio-6503, ¶ 23 (noting the 'evidence of the physical violence that occurred in the household [was] relevant to and probative of the method of control used by defendant to rape and sexually abuse the victim'); *State v. Jordan*, 2d Dist. No. 26163, 2016-Ohio-603, ¶ 21 (holding that the 'other-acts evidence' of the defendant's violent acts was'relevant to the element of force'); *State v. Scott*, 5th Dist. No. 11CA80, 2012-Ohio-3482, ¶ 28-29 (noting the evidence indicating that the defendant killed the victim's baby sister 'was offered to show the victim's state of mind; * * * and why she was in fear of [defendant],' and thus was not 'improper propensity evidence, but instead tend[ed] to show an element of the crime [of rape], force'). N.F. explained he did not want to engage in the sexual acts with appellant, but stated he 'never questioned what' appellant told him to do, because if he questioned appellant that'results to physical violence or physical abuse.' (Tr. Vol. II 108.) Thus, the physical abuse evidence demonstrated N.F.'s will was overcome by his fear of appellant, and explained why N.F. did not resist appellant's demands for sexual activity. Additionally, during N.F.'s testimony, the court provided the jury with the following limiting instruction: Let me just advise you that I have permitted testimony on the direct examination of this witness dealing with alleged prior bad acts on behalf of the [appellant] in this case. I did not admit that evidence to show that [appellant], if he did commit a bad act before, he acted in conformance with that action with respect to [N.F.] and the matters that you are to decide, the sexual-related offenses. But I have permitted that to be introduced for the purpose of showing [N.F.'s] state of mind and whether he was fearful of [appellant]. So you can only consider it for that purpose and that purpose only. (Tr. Vol. II at 69-70.) We presume the jury followed the court's instruction. State v. Jones, 135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, ¶ 194. Appellant argues the trial court's failure to reiterate the limiting instruction when other witnesses testified to the physical abuse, or to reiterate the instruction in the final jury instructions, amounts to plain error. Although 'the failure to give any limiting instruction constitutes plain error,' here the trial court did provide the jury with a limiting instruction the first time the other-acts evidence was presented. State v. Shaw, 2d Dist. No. 21880, 2008-Ohio-1317, ¶ 13, quoting State v. Tisdale, 2d Dist.

Jordan*, 2d Dist. No. 26163, 2016-Ohio-603, ¶ 21 (holding that the 'other-acts evidence' of the defendant's violent acts was'relevant to the element of force'); *State v. Scott*, 5th Dist. No. 11CA80, 2012-Ohio-3482, ¶ 28-29 (noting the evidence indicating that the defendant killed the victim's baby sister 'was offered to show the victim's state of mind; * * * and why she was in fear of [defendant],' and thus was not 'improper propensity evidence, but instead tend[ed] to show an element of the crime [of rape], force'). N.F. explained he did not want to engage in the sexual acts with appellant, but stated he 'never questioned what' appellant told him to do, because if he questioned appellant that'results to physical violence or physical abuse.' (Tr. Vol. II 108.) Thus, the physical abuse evidence demonstrated N.F.'s will was overcome by his fear of appellant, and explained why N.F. did not resist appellant's demands for sexual activity. Additionally, during N.F.'s testimony, the court provided the jury with the following limiting instruction: Let me just advise you that I have permitted testimony on the direct examination of this witness dealing with alleged prior bad acts on behalf of the [appellant] in this case. I did not admit that evidence to show that [appellant], if he did commit a bad act before, he acted in conformance with that action with respect to [N.F.] and the matters that you are to decide, the sexual-related offenses. But I have permitted that to be introduced for the purpose of showing [N.F.'s] state of mind and whether he was fearful of [appellant]. So you can only consider it for that purpose and that purpose only. (Tr. Vol. II at 69-70.) We presume the jury followed the court's instruction. State v. Jones, 135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, ¶ 194. Appellant argues the trial court's failure to reiterate the limiting instruction when other witnesses testified to the physical abuse, or to reiterate the instruction in the final jury instructions, amounts to plain error. Although 'the failure to give any limiting instruction constitutes plain error,' here the trial court did provide the jury with a limiting instruction the first time the other-acts evidence was presented. State v. Shaw, 2d Dist. No. 21880, 2008-Ohio-1317, ¶ 13, quoting State v. Tisdale, 2d Dist. No. 19346, 2003-Ohio-4209, ¶ 47 (noting that''[t]he limiting instruction should be given at the time the \"other acts\" evidence is received' \"). Accordingly, we do not find plain error. The evidence of physical abuse was relevant to a fact of consequence, as it established the force element of the rape charges. Williams at ¶ 20. The evidence was not presented to prove appellant acted in conformity therewith, and the court instructed the jury the evidence was not to be used for that purpose. Id. The probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, and any danger of unfair prejudice was reduced by the court's limiting instruction. Id. at ¶ 24. Appellant further argues that, even if N.F.'s testimony of the physical abuse was admissible, the additional evidence from L.A., C.A.W., and children services caseworkers regarding the physical abuse deprived him of a fair trial. However, appellant testified N.F. had lied about all of the sexual abuse allegations. The testimony from the other witnesses corroborated N.F.'s testimony regarding the physical abuse and, thus, served to bolster N.F.'s credibility. Evidence which impeaches or bolsters witness credibility 'is of consequence to the action because it might determine whether the jury believes a particular witness.' State v. Moore, 40 Ohio St.3d 63, 65 (1988). Moreover, appellant admitted his methods of disciplining N.F. constituted physical abuse. In closing, defense counsel relied on the fact that appellant 'freely told' the jury that 'his methods of disciplining [N.F.] were not good,' to bolster appellant's credibility. (Tr. Vol. V at 94.) The defense also argued the years of physical abuse, coupled with appellant cutting N.F. off financially, provided N.F. with the motivation to fabricate the sexual abuse allegations against appellant. (See Tr. Vol. V at 94-95.) To the extent that some of the physical abuse evidence may have been unnecessarily cumulative, the admission of such evidence amounts to harmless error. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect one. State v. Williams, 38 Ohio St.3d 346, 349 (1988). 'The harmless-error doctrine recognizes the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant's guilt or innocence,' and thus focuses 'on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.' Id. An error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt when the remaining evidence, standing alone, constitutes overwhelming proof of defendant's guilt. Id. See also State v. Tucker, 10th Dist. No. 00AP-670, 2002-Ohio-3274, ¶ 44; Morris at ¶ 32; Crim.R. 52(A). The evidence of the crimes for which the jury returned guilty verdicts was considerable. In addition to N.F.'s detailed description of each sexual act, L.A. testified to the sexual activity that occurred between herself, N.F., and appellant, and C.A.W. provided circumstantial evidence that sexual activity occurred between appellant, L.A., and N.F. Accordingly, as the record contains overwhelming evidence of appellant's guilt on the sex crimes, any error in the admission of physical abuse evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n}\n```"}

But this begs two questions—the materiality of the evidence and state action.\\n\\n‘Evidence is constitutionally material when it possesses ‘an exculpatory value that was apparent before the evidence was destroyed, and [is] of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable evidence by other reasonably available means.’ ’ State v.

If the evidence in question is only potentially useful, however, a defendant cannot show a due-process violation without first demonstrating bad faith on the state’s behalf. State v. Rice, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-160668, C-160669 and C-160670, 2017-Ohio-9114, ¶ 13. The defendant bears the burden to show the exculpatory nature of the evidence. *State v. Benson*, 152 Ohio App.3d 495, 2003-Ohio-1944, 788 N.E.2d 693, ¶11 (1st Dist.).\\n\\nWith this standard in mind, Mr. Fornshell cannot satisfy his burden of demonstrating that the full video footage from the Madeira Half Price Books was materially exculpatory. The parties do not dispute that the incident occurred in the self-help section of the store, and that no video camera captured that portion of the store. Several witnesses, however, vouched for the likelihood of children in the store at the time of the incident. One Half Price Books employee testified that children were in the store. The victim, Ms. Velez, echoed the point, confirming that there were ‘absolutely’ people under the age of 18 in the store at the time of the incident, and that she ‘probably’ encountered children between the incident and her walk to report it. The store manager testified that it is possible to see through the shelves in the self-help area from other sections of the store, including the children’s section, to which it is adjacent. She also testified that the incident occurred on one of their biggest sale days of the year, and that they sell ‘lots’ of toys (attracting children and their parents alike). The manager personally viewed all of the surveillance video between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. the evening of the incident and identified several distinct, potential minors in the store at or just before the time Mr. Fornshell entered the store.\\n\\nMr. Fornshell nevertheless posits that the full store footage could have isolated minors entering and exiting while he was in the store. But in view of the litany of evidence above (and in light of our statutory analysis below), we do not believe that this would exculpate Mr. Fornshell. The jury was shown footage of likely minors entering the Madeira store before Mr. Fornshell arrived—consistent with the store manager’s testimony. This evidence undercuts his contention that the full video footage would have been exculpatory. Admittedly, it can often be difficult to establish that evidence that no longer exists is exculpatory, but based on the other available evidence in the record here, we cannot conclude that Mr. Fornshell can make such a showing.\\n\\nWith the evidence only potentially useful, this obligates Mr. Fornshell to establish bad faith on the state’s part to succeed with a due-process claim. But this case involves a third-party (not acting on behalf of the state) disposing of evidence, rendering it more difficult for Mr. Fornshell to connect the destruction of evidence to bad faith on the part of the state.\\n\\nOhio law generally recognizes that the state need not gather evidence on the defendant’s behalf (but when it does, that is a different story):\\n\\nAlthough we agree that is not proper for a law enforcement agency to suppress evidence, we also conclude that it is not the agency’s obligation to engage in affirmation action in gathering evidence which an accused might feel necessary to his defense. The accused must protect his own interests. It is only when overzealous officials deny that opportunity can it be said that he is deprived of due process by state action.\\n\\nCity of Kettering v. Baker, 42 Ohio St.2d 351, 354-355, 328 N.E.2d 805 (1975).\\n\\n‘[I]t is not the responsibility of the state to obtain evidence that the defendant can obtain on his own.’ ’ State v. Dinardo, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2013-L-108, 2015-Ohio-1062, ¶ 11.\\n\\nMr. Fornshell made a demand upon the prosecuting attorney for videos at the scene and around the time of the arrest, but we cannot construe such a request to encompass evidence beyond the state’s control. Mr. Fornshell did not subpoena the Madeira Half Price Books, nor has he pointed to any authority for the proposition that the *Brady* doctrine would require the state to secure evidence not in its possession from third parties. Without state action, the panoply of constitutional protections generally does not apply. *Bouquett v. St. Elizabeth Corp.*, 43 Ohio St.3d 50, 53, 538 N.E.2d 113 (1989) (appellee required to show state action to ‘warrant the constitutional protection of due process’).\\n\\nWhile we can imagine finding bad faith in a scenario where the state prevented a defendant from securing evidence from a third-party, that is not the case here, and Mr. Fornshell has failed to offer proof otherwise of bad faith. Detective Vogel testified that he promptly asked Half Price books for all pertinent footage; that he requested ‘the entire video,’ but was told this was nearly impossible. Because the clips that he received substantiated the victim’s claims, he did not persist for the entire video footage. Mr. Fornshell argues that this nonchalance rises to the level of bad faith. But ‘[b]ad faith implies something more than bad judgment or negligence,’ and we do not see anything more serious on the record before us. *See State v. Acosta*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos.

Baker, 42 Ohio St.2d 351, 354-355, 328 N.E.2d 805 (1975).\\n\\n‘[I]t is not the responsibility of the state to obtain evidence that the defendant can obtain on his own.’ ’ State v. Dinardo, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2013-L-108, 2015-Ohio-1062, ¶ 11.\\n\\nMr. Fornshell made a demand upon the prosecuting attorney for videos at the scene and around the time of the arrest, but we cannot construe such a request to encompass evidence beyond the state’s control. Mr. Fornshell did not subpoena the Madeira Half Price Books, nor has he pointed to any authority for the proposition that the *Brady* doctrine would require the state to secure evidence not in its possession from third parties. Without state action, the panoply of constitutional protections generally does not apply. *Bouquett v. St. Elizabeth Corp.*, 43 Ohio St.3d 50, 53, 538 N.E.2d 113 (1989) (appellee required to show state action to ‘warrant the constitutional protection of due process’).\\n\\nWhile we can imagine finding bad faith in a scenario where the state prevented a defendant from securing evidence from a third-party, that is not the case here, and Mr. Fornshell has failed to offer proof otherwise of bad faith. Detective Vogel testified that he promptly asked Half Price books for all pertinent footage; that he requested ‘the entire video,’ but was told this was nearly impossible. Because the clips that he received substantiated the victim’s claims, he did not persist for the entire video footage. Mr. Fornshell argues that this nonchalance rises to the level of bad faith. But ‘[b]ad faith implies something more than bad judgment or negligence,’ and we do not see anything more serious on the record before us. *See State v. Acosta*, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-020767, C-020768, C-020769, C-020770 and C-020771, 2003-Ohio-6503, ¶9.\\n\\nWithout a showing that the evidence at issue was materially exculpatory or that the state acted in bad faith, (let alone a showing of state action), we overrule Mr. Fornshell’s first assignment of error.\"\n}\n```"}

Manifest Weight and Sufficiency of Evidence", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Miller argues in his first two assignments of error that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence and were not supported by sufficient evidence. When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a criminal conviction, an appellate court examines the evidence to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would support a conviction. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. A manifest weight of the evidence challenge examines the 'inclination of the greater amount of credible evidence, offered at a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.' To determine whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the reviewing court must look at the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether in resolving the conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. Questions regarding witness credibility and weight of the evidence are primarily matters for the trier of fact to decide since the trier of fact is in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given the evidence. The question upon review is whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed. Therefore, an appellate court will overturn a conviction due to the manifest weight of the evidence only in extraordinary circumstances when the evidence presented at trial weighs heavily in favor of acquittal. Miller was convicted of inducing panic in violation of R.C. 2917.31(A)(3)(c), which prohibits one from causing serious public inconvenience or alarm by committing an offense with reckless disregard of the likelihood that its commission will cause serious public inconvenience or alarm. If economic harm results from inducing panic and the amount is more than $7,500 but less than $150,000, the charge is a felony of the fourth degree. Miller was also convicted of endangering children in violation of R.C. 2919.22(A), which prohibits a parent of a child under the age of 21 from creating 'a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support.' After reviewing the record, we find that Miller's convictions were supported by sufficient evidence and were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. At trial, the state presented testimony from law enforcement officers that the community suffered serious inconvenience and alarm. Law enforcement officers cordoned off a large area surrounding the house and instructed neighbors not to leave their houses for over eight hours. The road leading to the house was closed and vehicular traffic, including school busses, had to be rerouted to avoid the area. The firearm specification was also supported by evidence that Sara told the police dispatcher that Miller had the firearm 'on him' at the time of the offense. Miller further admitted to police that he had control of the firearm both before and after the standoff began, and the record is undisputed that officers located the loaded firearm after Miller finally left the house. The evidence also established that the rental house incurred damage due to the standoff and the use of tear gas to flush out Miller. This damage exceeded $11,000.1 Because of Miller’s actions that resulted in damage to the house, the landlord was unable to rent the house for several months, incurring thousands of dollars in lost compensation. The county was also forced to expend funds for law enforcement and emergency personnel who responded to the call. The total amount of damage exceeded the necessary $7,500 threshold. While Miller claims that this damage did not occur to the alleged victims, Sara or their daughter, the statute defining economic harm does not require such a limited application. According to R.C. 2917.39(E)(1), economic harm means any of the following, (a) All direct, incidental, and consequential pecuniary harm suffered by a victim as a result of criminal conduct. 'Economic harm' as described in this division includes, but is not limited to, all of the following: (i) All wages, salaries, or other compensation lost as a result of the criminal conduct; (ii) The cost of all wages, salaries, or other compensation paid to employees for time those employees are prevented from working as a result of the criminal conduct; (iii) The overhead costs incurred for the time that a business is shut down as a result of the criminal conduct; (iv) The loss of value to tangible or intangible property that was damaged as a result of the criminal conduct. (b) All costs incurred by the state or any political subdivision as a result of, or in making any response to, the criminal conduct that constituted the violation of this section or section 2917.32 of the Revised Code, including, but not limited to, all costs so incurred by any law enforcement officers, firefighters, rescue personnel, or emergency medical services personnel of the state or the political subdivision. Thus, the statute provides for economic harm to 'a victim' rather than any one specific victim of the underlying criminal act that results in damage to property. As a result of Miller's conduct, the rental house incurred damage, regardless of the fact that it was owned by someone other than Sara or her daughter. The record also demonstrates that Miller's conviction for child endangerment was supported by the manifest weight and sufficiency of evidence. Miller argues that his child was not harmed on the day of the incident and that she was never in substantial risk of harm. We disagree. The state presented evidence that at the time of the incident, the child was present in the house as events began and continued to unfold. These events included methamphetamine possession and use, as well as periods of intense arguing between Sara and Miller. The child was also present when Sara told the dispatcher that Miller had the firearm 'on him.' When Sara and the child ran from the house, the child was wearing her pajamas, but no coat, on a morning with temperatures in the 40-degree range. The record is undisputed that Sara held the child as she exited the house upon the police's arrival and the child was subjected to the dangerous circumstances as police began their standoff with an armed Miller. The jury was in the best position to weigh the evidence regarding what risk the circumstances posed the child's health and safety, and we do not find that the jury clearly lost its way or created a manifest miscarriage of justice in finding that Miller's conduct constituted child endangering.

Defense counsel asked the court to note a continuing objection to the evidence, and the court said it would. The decision was a preliminary ruling before the actual presentation of the evidence during the trial testimony where it could be adjudged in context upon proper objection. The preliminary issue presented in a motion in limine must be renewed at trial when the evidence is actually presented or the argument made therein is waived for purposes of appeal. State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 202-203, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996). On appeal, Appellant claims the court improperly allowed the state to present other acts evidence to demonstrate his propensity for assaulting his wife and to show he acted in conformity with his character. He says the state used the evidence to paint a picture that it was only a matter of time before he killed his wife. He contests the following testimony on other acts. Appellant’s sister-in-law was asked about the relationship between Appellant and the victim. She said it was sometimes loving but they would argue and fight, answering in the affirmative when asked if the relationship ever got physical. There was no objection entered. If a timely objection was lacking, then the appellant must not only show an error occurred and the error was obvious, but he must also show it affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St.3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 93 (finding error in admitting other acts evidence but refusing to find plain error as the error did not affect the outcome of trial), citing State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002). The general, non-specific testimony of Appellant’s sister-in-law would not have affected Appellant’s substantial rights under the circumstances of this case. The real focus is on the other acts testimony of the victim’s sister, the victim’s child, and on statements Appellant made to the detective. The victim’s sister testified she first realized Appellant was abusive when she looked out her door and saw the victim “fly across the street, like her body.” She did not see the actual physical motion by which Appellant caused this to occur, but she yelled at him not to put his hands on her sister and he apologized. Another time, she intervened when Appellant was “dragging [the victim] up and down the street.” In the past, she observed the victim with injuries such as a broken nose, teeth, and fingers. Over objection, the victim’s sister testified: the victim told her Appellant caused these injuries; the victim told the hospital staff she was injured in a fall; and the staff said the victim’s body could not take much more. The victim’s child testified: she asked Appellant if he would stop hitting her mother months before the victim’s death; he said he would; and the situation got worse. She stated she witnessed Appellant’s prior acts of punching, hitting, throwing, and kicking the victim; she associated the behavior as occurring after Appellant drank liquor. The child said he would threaten the victim by stating: “I’m gonna hurt you if you don’t stop talking.” The child mentioned calling her step-brother on the night at issue because “his mom went through it, so obviously I think he would know what to do” (not necessarily referring to Appellant). There were no objections during these portions of the child’s testimony. The detective testified he asked Appellant about past violence in the relationship. Over objection, the detective said Appellant “initially downplayed it, but ultimately admitted to having some physical altercations” with the victim in the past. Appellant said one such altercation resulted in “a cut over her eye” which occurred when he “grabbed her and she slipped and fell and hit her eye”; Appellant also acknowledged the victim “has lied for him in the past when they have gone to the hospital.” “Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” Evid.R. 404(B). “Thus, while evidence showing the defendant’s character or propensity to commit crimes or acts is forbidden, evidence of other acts is admissible when the evidence is probative of a separate, nonpropensity-based issue. State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, ¶ 22. In general, evidence is relevant if it tends “to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination * * * more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Evid.R. 401. *See also Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 24; Evid.R. 402 (“Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.”). The relevancy determination in this context asks “whether the evidence is relevant to the particular purpose for which it is offered” which must be one other than character or propensity. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 26. Evid.R. 404(B) contains a “nonexhaustive list of the permissible nonpropensity purposes for which other-acts evidence may be introduced.” *Id.* at ¶ 26. “The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a'material' issue that is actually in dispute between the parties.” *Id.* at ¶ 27. Also, evidence of similar acts “is relevant only if the jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *Id.* at ¶ 28. If the evidence is not presented for character and has a permissible purpose under Evid.R. 404(B), then the trial court uses its discretion to determine whether the probative value “is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.” *Id.* at ¶ 29-30, citing Evid.R. 403(A). The probative value and the unfairness of any prejudice can depend on the degree to which the fact is truly in dispute and whether it can be shown with alternative evidence. *Id.* at ¶ 31-32. First, we address Appellant’s claim there was no “substantial proof” he committed the other acts. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. He notes the testimony was not corroborated with a police report or hospital record. “It is not essential to the admissibility of evidence regarding prior incidents that such incidents were either reported to police officials by the victim or resulted in a conviction.” *State v. Jones*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 95 C.A. 98 (June 26, 1998) (admitting testimony on an incident where the defendant held his former wife hostage with a rifle ten years prior to the prosecution for the death of his current wife where the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental while they were fighting over a gun), citing *State v. Armstrong*, 74 Ohio App.3d 732, 600 N.E.2d 690 (2d Dist.1991). Here, the “jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. The jury could evaluate the credibility of the victim’s sister and the victim’s child who claimed to have witnessed certain acts. Moreover, the detective testified as to Appellant’s own admissions about: prior physical arguments, the victim lying for him at the hospital in the past, and a specific incident where the victim ended up with a head wound and Appellant claimed she slipped and fell during a fight. Second, we address Appellant’s argument that other acts evidence cannot be admitted for a use permitted by Evid.R. 404(B) unless the defendant specifically introduced evidence at trial on a defense related to a permissible use of other acts evidence. Appellant points out the non-propensity purpose for admitting the other acts evidence must relate to a material issue “actually in dispute.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 27. He complains the prosecution introduced the defendant’s statement (that the victim was injured due to an accidental fall) and used this to assert a permissible use under Evid.R. 404(B) without waiting to see if he would be opening the door to the issue. As the trial court ruled at the motion in limine hearing, the permissible uses of other acts evidence in Evid.R. 404(B) do not only apply when a defendant takes the stand or presents witnesses. See generally State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 20, 22, 30 (where the defendant told the police the child fell down the stairs and presented no guilt phase witnesses, the Court upheld the decision to admit evidence on prior incidents of injury to the child which the defendant had reported were a result of his falling while holding the child). We note a defendant often does not present witnesses because the state’s witnesses have the information relevant to defending the case, defendants rarely testify, and there is no formal notice a defendant must file disclosing every defense theory to the state. Also, the mere decision to forgo a lengthy opening statement does not bar the state from establishing there is an issue surrounding a permissible use of other acts evidence. The defendant’s own pretrial statements can be used by the state to show the lack of mistake or accident is a material issue in the case. See id. Here, Appellant repeatedly claimed the victim was injured at home as a result of an accident where she fell in a bedroom while running (from him after a night of physical violence as captured on video and subsequently witnessed by the victim’s twelve-year-old child). The state’s first two witnesses (Appellant’s brother and sister-in-law) testified to Appellant’s claim at the scene while the victim was lying on the floor dying. After summoning them and instead of calling 911, Appellant told them the victim was injured when she slipped and fell while running into a bedroom (to pack and leave the house). Appellant also told this story to the police when he was interviewed on the day the victim was hospitalized, and the detective testified to Appellant’s claim. Appellant also suggested to the detective he may have elbowed the victim in the face by mistake while putting her in “a bearhug.” And, Appellant told the victim’s sister he did not put his hands on the victim. Moreover, defense counsel asked the victim’s child whether her mother got aggressive when she drank alcohol, eliciting a statement that the victim would sometimes hit Appellant (but only if he hit her first). Defense counsel cross-examined the neurosurgeon on whether the brain trauma could have resulted from a fall, whether a seizure could cause damage to the brain, and whether the bouncing of a head on the floor during a seizure could cause problems. (Tr. 432). He also asked the forensic pathologist whether the trauma to the victim’s brain could have occurred from just one impact. (Tr. 472). In closing arguments, defense counsel mentioned the testimony stating the victim appeared to be having a seizure. He also said the testimony showed the victim’s injuries could have been sustained “by one fall” while noting she did not appear seriously injured after the punches that were witnessed. (Tr. 580-581). Counsel also urged there was no evidence showing Appellant had intent to purposely cause the death of his wife. (Tr. 581). Appellant next suggests the evidence was not material to the absence of mistake or accident exception. The state urges the absence of mistake or accident as to the cause of the victim’s death and his purpose (intent) were material issues actually in dispute. The state points out to negate a defendant's claim of mistake or accident, the prosecution can use similar incidents to show the act in dispute was not inadvertent, accidental, involuntary, or lacking in guilty knowledge. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. It is argued the case at bar implicates both categories discussed by Hartman in explaining the two main ways a defendant raises a claim of accident: (1) a statement disputing whether a criminal act occurred at all or (2) a statement disputing the act was committed with criminal intent. Id. at ¶ 52-53. These examples do not require the past incidents to be close in time to the current incident. This court has applied Ohio Supreme Court precedent allowing evidence of prior acts of domestic violence to show motive, intent, and absence of mistake or accident when the defendant later kills the victim. State v. Ash, 2018-Ohio-1139, 108 N.E.3d 1115, ¶ 67 (7th Dist.) (even an incident temporally removed from the incident in question can be admitted under an exception to show the tumultuous and strained relationship), citing State v. Nields, 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 10, 22, 752 N.E.2d 859 (2001). See also Jones, 7th Dist. No. 95 C.A. 98 (admissible other acts testimony on an incident with former wife ten years before the defendant’s current wife was allegedly accidentally shot) In a death penalty case, the defendant said his child fell down the basement steps. The Supreme Court upheld the admission of testimony about two prior hospital visits where the defendant claimed the child was injured when the defendant fell while holding the child. State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 16-17, 109-111. “Such evidence was particularly relevant because it showed that [the defendant’s] claim that [the child] died during an accidental fall was probably untrue. Based on this evidence, the panel could reasonably infer that [the defendant] acted purposefully in killing [the child].” Id. at ¶ 114. Here, the similar incidents involved the same victim. Appellant claimed no criminal act caused the victim’s death as she died after slipping and falling. See Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. He also claimed some prior physical injuries that night were mistakenly or accidentally inflicted and certain blows to the victim’s head did not cause her death or were not struck with purpose to cause her death. See id. at ¶ 53. Furthermore, when apologizing to the victim’s child soon after the death, he generally claimed he “didn’t mean to do it.” Notably, Hunter involved the defendant’s claim the victim died after suffering an accident by falling; the defendant’s story as to how the child died did not involve a claim he accidentally injured the child. Similarly, the first qualifying example in Hartman involved a defendant’s claim that something caused the victim’s death naturally rather than a claim he accidentally caused it. This concept is on point as to Appellant’s story of the victim’s death (the victim fell when she was running away from him to pack clothes and leave him), and this story was similar to the story Appellant told the detective about the victim’s past head injury (she received a cut above her eye during their fight when he grabbed her and she fell). It also supports the testimony of the victim’s sister confirming Appellant’s statement to the detective that the victim previously lied to cover for him by saying she fell. The contested testimony was not presented as character or propensity evidence but was relevant to an exception to the other acts exclusion which was in material dispute. Next, Appellant contends “the probative value [of the other acts evidence] is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury” and was required to be excluded under Evid.R. 403(A). There was no indication the evidence would cause confusion or mislead the jury. The state points out the evidence was highly probative to show the victim’s various injuries were not caused by a mistake or accident and the death was caused with specific intent. It was reasonable to find “under the circumstances, the detailed facts of the charged and uncharged offenses strongly suggest that an innocent explanation is implausible.” Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 58 (to determine whether other acts evidence is genuinely probative of the intent of the accused to commit the charged crime, rather than merely the accused’s propensity to commit similar crimes). This probative value must be outweighed by not just prejudice but by “unfair prejudice,” and this outweighing must be substantial. Evid.R. 403(A). “All state's evidence is meant to be prejudicial.” State v. Rupp, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05 MA 166, 2007-Ohio-1561, ¶ 67, citing State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302. Unfair prejudice is not evidenced by the harm caused to the defense by admissible evidence which had a high probative value but involves an invitation to rule based on invalid grounds. State v. Lang, 129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, ¶ 89. “Because fairness is subjective, the determination of whether evidence is unfairly prejudicial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will be overturned only if the discretion is abused.” State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302, ¶ 25. The decision was within the trial court’s discretion. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St. 3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700, __ N.E.3d __, ¶ 72. Notably, the jury heard strong evidence of Appellant’s violence toward the victim on the night her demise began: the video showed Appellant striking the victim’s head with his fist at least twice and causing her head to hit the truck, and later, the victim’s child heard the victim begging Appellant to stop while banging emanated from their location in the basement and then witnessed him punch the victim in the face. Furthermore, as the trial court concluded, prejudice was lessened by the jury instruction. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521 at ¶ 24 (This evidence is not unduly prejudicial, because the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence could not be considered to show [the defendant] had acted in conformity with a character trait. This instruction lessened the prejudicial effect). At the end of trial, the court instructed the jury: “Evidence was received about the commission of other acts other than the offenses with which the defendant is charged in this trial. That evidence was received only for the limited purpose. It was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he acted in accordance with that character. If you find that the evidence of other acts is true and that the defendant committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves the absence of mistake.” (Tr. 615-616). We presume the jury followed the limiting instruction stating the other acts evidence was not offered to prove the defendant’s character. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521 at ¶ 23. Appellant argues this instruction should have been tailored to a particular count. He states if the other acts evidence was admissible, then the jury should have been instructed they could only use it for the murder count. He claims he never said the assault at the bar was a mistake or an accident. However, when discussing the blood in his truck, he indicated to the detective he may have accidentally hit the victim with an elbow. He also commented he had her in a “bearhug” outside of the bar merely to get her back in the truck, which impliedly suggested he may have accidentally hurt her in the process, such as when he caused her head to hit the truck’s door frame. Evidence that he bodily threw her in the past would be material to whether this incident was an accident. Furthermore, his repeated slip and fall claims could allow the prosecution to conclude he was suggesting the victim’s main injuries were caused by her alleged fall. In any event, at the motion in limine hearing, the court asked defense counsel to draft the limiting instruction. (Tr. 198). And, there was no objection to the limiting instruction when the court gave the final jury instructions. “On appeal, a party may not assign as error the giving or the failure to give any instructions unless the party objects before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating specifically the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.” Crim.R. 30(A). Finally, an “improper evidentiary admission under Evid.R. 404(B) may be deemed harmless error on review when, after the tainted evidence is removed, the remaining evidence is overwhelming.” State v. Tench, 156 Ohio St.3d 85, 2018-Ohio-5205, 123 N.E.3d 955 ¶ 177 (finding harmless error in capital case, where the state presented other acts evidence including evidence the defendant was a suspect in a prior robbery), quoting State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 32. Without any consideration of other acts evidence, the evidence of the offenses was overwhelming, including the independent incidents of felonious assault and the two types of murder. As to the element of purpose for the count one murder, the evidence is further discussed in the next assignment of error. In any event, the state properly introduced other acts against the same victim to show the death was caused with specific intent and not due to mistake or accident. This assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Defense counsel asked the court to note a continuing objection to the evidence, and the court said it would. The decision was a preliminary ruling before the actual presentation of the evidence during the trial testimony where it could be adjudged in context upon proper objection. The preliminary issue presented in a motion in limine must be renewed at trial when the evidence is actually presented or the argument made therein is waived for purposes of appeal. State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 202-203, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996). On appeal, Appellant claims the court improperly allowed the state to present other acts evidence to demonstrate his propensity for assaulting his wife and to show he acted in conformity with his character. He says the state used the evidence to paint a picture that it was only a matter of time before he killed his wife. He contests the following testimony on other acts. Appellant’s sister-in-law was asked about the relationship between Appellant and the victim. She said it was sometimes loving but they would argue and fight, answering in the affirmative when asked if the relationship ever got physical. There was no objection entered. If a timely objection was lacking, then the appellant must not only show an error occurred and the error was obvious, but he must also show it affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St.3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 93 (finding error in admitting other acts evidence but refusing to find plain error as the error did not affect the outcome of trial), citing State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002). The general, non-specific testimony of Appellant’s sister-in-law would not have affected Appellant’s substantial rights under the circumstances of this case. The real focus is on the other acts testimony of the victim’s sister, the victim’s child, and on statements Appellant made to the detective. The victim’s sister testified she first realized Appellant was abusive when she looked out her door and saw the victim “fly across the street, like her body.” She did not see the actual physical motion by which Appellant caused this to occur, but she yelled at him not to put his hands on her sister and he apologized. Another time, she intervened when Appellant was “dragging [the victim] up and down the street.” In the past, she observed the victim with injuries such as a broken nose, teeth, and fingers. Over objection, the victim’s sister testified: the victim told her Appellant caused these injuries; the victim told the hospital staff she was injured in a fall; and the staff said the victim’s body could not take much more. The victim’s child testified: she asked Appellant if he would stop hitting her mother months before the victim’s death; he said he would; and the situation got worse. She stated she witnessed Appellant’s prior acts of punching, hitting, throwing, and kicking the victim; she associated the behavior as occurring after Appellant drank liquor. The child said he would threaten the victim by stating: “I’m gonna hurt you if you don’t stop talking.” The child mentioned calling her step-brother on the night at issue because “his mom went through it, so obviously I think he would know what to do” (not necessarily referring to Appellant). There were no objections during these portions of the child’s testimony. The detective testified he asked Appellant about past violence in the relationship. Over objection, the detective said Appellant “initially downplayed it, but ultimately admitted to having some physical altercations” with the victim in the past. Appellant said one such altercation resulted in “a cut over her eye” which occurred when he “grabbed her and she slipped and fell and hit her eye”; Appellant also acknowledged the victim “has lied for him in the past when they have gone to the hospital.” “Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” Evid.R. 404(B). “Thus, while evidence showing the defendant’s character or propensity to commit crimes or acts is forbidden, evidence of other acts is admissible when the evidence is probative of a separate, nonpropensity-based issue. State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, ¶ 22. In general, evidence is relevant if it tends “to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination * * * more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Evid.R. 401. *See also Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 24; Evid.R. 402 (“Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.”). The relevancy determination in this context asks “whether the evidence is relevant to the particular purpose for which it is offered” which must be one other than character or propensity. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 26. Evid.R. 404(B) contains a “nonexhaustive list of the permissible nonpropensity purposes for which other-acts evidence may be introduced.” *Id.* at ¶ 26. “The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a'material' issue that is actually in dispute between the parties.” *Id.* at ¶ 27. Also, evidence of similar acts “is relevant only if the jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *Id.* at ¶ 28. If the evidence is not presented for character and has a permissible purpose under Evid.R. 404(B), then the trial court uses its discretion to determine whether the probative value “is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.” *Id.* at ¶ 29-30, citing Evid.R. 403(A). The probative value and the unfairness of any prejudice can depend on the degree to which the fact is truly in dispute and whether it can be shown with alternative evidence. *Id.* at ¶ 31-32. First, we address Appellant’s claim there was no “substantial proof” he committed the other acts. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. He notes the testimony was not corroborated with a police report or hospital record. “It is not essential to the admissibility of evidence regarding prior incidents that such incidents were either reported to police officials by the victim or resulted in a conviction.” *State v. Jones*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 95 C.A. 98 (June 26, 1998) (admitting testimony on an incident where the defendant held his former wife hostage with a rifle ten years prior to the prosecution for the death of his current wife where the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental while they were fighting over a gun), citing *State v. Armstrong*, 74 Ohio App.3d 732, 600 N.E.2d 690 (2d Dist.1991). Here, the “jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. The jury could evaluate the credibility of the victim’s sister and the victim’s child who claimed to have witnessed certain acts. Moreover, the detective testified as to Appellant’s own admissions about: prior physical arguments, the victim lying for him at the hospital in the past, and a specific incident where the victim ended up with a head wound and Appellant claimed she slipped and fell during a fight. Second, we address Appellant’s argument that other acts evidence cannot be admitted for a use permitted by Evid.R. 404(B) unless the defendant specifically introduced evidence at trial on a defense related to a permissible use of other acts evidence. Appellant points out the non-propensity purpose for admitting the other acts evidence must relate to a material issue “actually in dispute.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 27. He complains the prosecution introduced the defendant’s statement (that the victim was injured due to an accidental fall) and used this to assert a permissible use under Evid.R. 404(B) without waiting to see if he would be opening the door to the issue. As the trial court ruled at the motion in limine hearing, the permissible uses of other acts evidence in Evid.R. 404(B) do not only apply when a defendant takes the stand or presents witnesses. See generally State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 20, 22, 30 (where the defendant told the police the child fell down the stairs and presented no guilt phase witnesses, the Court upheld the decision to admit evidence on prior incidents of injury to the child which the defendant had reported were a result of his falling while holding the child). We note a defendant often does not present witnesses because the state’s witnesses have the information relevant to defending the case, defendants rarely testify, and there is no formal notice a defendant must file disclosing every defense theory to the state. Also, the mere decision to forgo a lengthy opening statement does not bar the state from establishing there is an issue surrounding a permissible use of other acts evidence. The defendant’s own pretrial statements can be used by the state to show the lack of mistake or accident is a material issue in the case. See id. Here, Appellant repeatedly claimed the victim was injured at home as a result of an accident where she fell in a bedroom while running (from him after a night of physical violence as captured on video and subsequently witnessed by the victim’s twelve-year-old child). The state’s first two witnesses (Appellant’s brother and sister-in-law) testified to Appellant’s claim at the scene while the victim was lying on the floor dying. After summoning them and instead of calling 911, Appellant told them the victim was injured when she slipped and fell while running into a bedroom (to pack and leave the house). Appellant also told this story to the police when he was interviewed on the day the victim was hospitalized, and the detective testified to Appellant’s claim. Appellant also suggested to the detective he may have elbowed the victim in the face by mistake while putting her in “a bearhug.” And, Appellant told the victim’s sister he did not put his hands on the victim. Moreover, defense counsel asked the victim’s child whether her mother got aggressive when she drank alcohol, eliciting a statement that the victim would sometimes hit Appellant (but only if he hit her first). Defense counsel cross-examined the neurosurgeon on whether the brain trauma could have resulted from a fall, whether a seizure could cause damage to the brain, and whether the bouncing of a head on the floor during a seizure could cause problems. (Tr. 432). He also asked the forensic pathologist whether the trauma to the victim’s brain could have occurred from just one impact. (Tr. 472). In closing arguments, defense counsel mentioned the testimony stating the victim appeared to be having a seizure. He also said the testimony showed the victim’s injuries could have been sustained “by one fall” while noting she did not appear seriously injured after the punches that were witnessed. (Tr. 580-581). Counsel also urged there was no evidence showing Appellant had intent to purposely cause the death of his wife. (Tr. 581). Appellant next suggests the evidence was not material to the absence of mistake or accident exception. The state urges the absence of mistake or accident as to the cause of the victim’s death and his purpose (intent) were material issues actually in dispute. The state points out to negate a defendant's claim of mistake or accident, the prosecution can use similar incidents to show the act in dispute was not inadvertent, accidental, involuntary, or lacking in guilty knowledge. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. It is argued the case at bar implicates both categories discussed by Hartman in explaining the two main ways a defendant raises a claim of accident: (1) a statement disputing whether a criminal act occurred at all or (2) a statement disputing the act was committed with criminal intent. Id. at ¶ 52-53. These examples do not require the past incidents to be close in time to the current incident. This court has applied Ohio Supreme Court precedent allowing evidence of prior acts of domestic violence to show motive, intent, and absence of mistake or accident when the defendant later kills the victim.

No. 95 C.A. 98 (admissible other acts testimony on an incident with former wife ten years before the defendant’s current wife was allegedly accidentally shot) In a death penalty case, the defendant said his child fell down the basement steps. The Supreme Court upheld the admission of testimony about two prior hospital visits where the defendant claimed the child was injured when the defendant fell while holding the child. State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 16-17, 109-111. “Such evidence was particularly relevant because it showed that [the defendant’s] claim that [the child] died during an accidental fall was probably untrue.

Appellant claimed no criminal act caused the victim’s death as she died after slipping and falling. See Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52.

On appeal, Appellant claims the court improperly allowed the state to present other acts evidence to demonstrate his propensity for assaulting his wife and to show he acted in conformity with his character. He says the state used the evidence to paint a picture that it was only a matter of time before he killed his wife. He contests the following testimony on other acts. Appellant’s sister-in-law was asked about the relationship between Appellant and the victim. She said it was sometimes loving but they would argue and fight, answering in the affirmative when asked if the relationship ever got physical. There was no objection entered. If a timely objection was lacking, then the appellant must not only show an error occurred and the error was obvious, but he must also show it affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St.3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 93 (finding error in admitting other acts evidence but refusing to find plain error as the error did not affect the outcome of trial), citing State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002). The general, non-specific testimony of Appellant’s sister-in-law would not have affected Appellant’s substantial rights under the circumstances of this case. The real focus is on the other acts testimony of the victim’s sister, the victim’s child, and on statements Appellant made to the detective. The victim’s sister testified she first realized Appellant was abusive when she looked out her door and saw the victim “fly across the street, like her body.” She did not see the actual physical motion by which Appellant caused this to occur, but she yelled at him not to put his hands on her sister and he apologized. Another time, she intervened when Appellant was “dragging [the victim] up and down the street.” In the past, she observed the victim with injuries such as a broken nose, teeth, and fingers. Over objection, the victim’s sister testified: the victim told her Appellant caused these injuries; the victim told the hospital staff she was injured in a fall; and the staff said the victim’s body could not take much more. The victim’s child testified: she asked Appellant if he would stop hitting her mother months before the victim’s death; he said he would; and the situation got worse. She stated she witnessed Appellant’s prior acts of punching, hitting, throwing, and kicking the victim; she associated the behavior as occurring after Appellant drank liquor. The child said he would threaten the victim by stating: “I’m gonna hurt you if you don’t stop talking.” The child mentioned calling her step-brother on the night at issue because “his mom went through it, so obviously I think he would know what to do” (not necessarily referring to Appellant). There were no objections during these portions of the child’s testimony. The detective testified he asked Appellant about past violence in the relationship. Over objection, the detective said Appellant “initially downplayed it, but ultimately admitted to having some physical altercations” with the victim in the past. Appellant said one such altercation resulted in “a cut over her eye” which occurred when he “grabbed her and she slipped and fell and hit her eye”; Appellant also acknowledged the victim “has lied for him in the past when they have gone to the hospital.” “Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” Evid.R. 404(B). “Thus, while evidence showing the defendant’s character or propensity to commit crimes or acts is forbidden, evidence of other acts is admissible when the evidence is probative of a separate, nonpropensity-based issue. State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, ¶ 22. In general, evidence is relevant if it tends “to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination * * * more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Evid.R. 401. *See also Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 24; Evid.R. 402 (“Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.”). The relevancy determination in this context asks “whether the evidence is relevant to the particular purpose for which it is offered” which must be one other than character or propensity. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 26. Evid.R. 404(B) contains a “nonexhaustive list of the permissible nonpropensity purposes for which other-acts evidence may be introduced.” *Id.* at ¶ 26. “The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a'material' issue that is actually in dispute between the parties.” *Id.* at ¶ 27. Also, evidence of similar acts “is relevant only if the jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *Id.* at ¶ 28. If the evidence is not presented for character and has a permissible purpose under Evid.R. 404(B), then the trial court uses its discretion to determine whether the probative value “is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.” *Id.* at ¶ 29-30, citing Evid.R. 403(A). The probative value and the unfairness of any prejudice can depend on the degree to which the fact is truly in dispute and whether it can be shown with alternative evidence. *Id.* at ¶ 31-32. First, we address Appellant’s claim there was no “substantial proof” he committed the other acts. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. He notes the testimony was not corroborated with a police report or hospital record. “It is not essential to the admissibility of evidence regarding prior incidents that such incidents were either reported to police officials by the victim or resulted in a conviction.” *State v. Jones*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 95 C.A. 98 (June 26, 1998) (admitting testimony on an incident where the defendant held his former wife hostage with a rifle ten years prior to the prosecution for the death of his current wife where the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental while they were fighting over a gun), citing *State v. Armstrong*, 74 Ohio App.3d 732, 600 N.E.2d 690 (2d Dist.1991). Here, the “jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. The jury could evaluate the credibility of the victim’s sister and the victim’s child who claimed to have witnessed certain acts. Moreover, the detective testified as to Appellant’s own admissions about: prior physical arguments, the victim lying for him at the hospital in the past, and a specific incident where the victim ended up with a head wound and Appellant claimed she slipped and fell during a fight. Second, we address Appellant’s argument that other acts evidence cannot be admitted for a use permitted by Evid.R. 404(B) unless the defendant specifically introduced evidence at trial on a defense related to a permissible use of other acts evidence. Appellant points out the non-propensity purpose for admitting the other acts evidence must relate to a material issue “actually in dispute.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 27. He complains the prosecution introduced the defendant’s statement (that the victim was injured due to an accidental fall) and used this to assert a permissible use under Evid.R. 404(B) without waiting to see if he would be opening the door to the issue. As the trial court ruled at the motion in limine hearing, the permissible uses of other acts evidence in Evid.R. 404(B) do not only apply when a defendant takes the stand or presents witnesses. See generally State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 20, 22, 30 (where the defendant told the police the child fell down the stairs and presented no guilt phase witnesses, the Court upheld the decision to admit evidence on prior incidents of injury to the child which the defendant had reported were a result of his falling while holding the child). We note a defendant often does not present witnesses because the state’s witnesses have the information relevant to defending the case, defendants rarely testify, and there is no formal notice a defendant must file disclosing every defense theory to the state. Also, the mere decision to forgo a lengthy opening statement does not bar the state from establishing there is an issue surrounding a permissible use of other acts evidence. The defendant’s own pretrial statements can be used by the state to show the lack of mistake or accident is a material issue in the case. See id. Here, Appellant repeatedly claimed the victim was injured at home as a result of an accident where she fell in a bedroom while running (from him after a night of physical violence as captured on video and subsequently witnessed by the victim’s twelve-year-old child). The state’s first two witnesses (Appellant’s brother and sister-in-law) testified to Appellant’s claim at the scene while the victim was lying on the floor dying. After summoning them and instead of calling 911, Appellant told them the victim was injured when she slipped and fell while running into a bedroom (to pack and leave the house). Appellant also told this story to the police when he was interviewed on the day the victim was hospitalized, and the detective testified to Appellant’s claim. Appellant also suggested to the detective he may have elbowed the victim in the face by mistake while putting her in “a bearhug.” And, Appellant told the victim’s sister he did not put his hands on the victim. Moreover, defense counsel asked the victim’s child whether her mother got aggressive when she drank alcohol, eliciting a statement that the victim would sometimes hit Appellant (but only if he hit her first). Defense counsel cross-examined the neurosurgeon on whether the brain trauma could have resulted from a fall, whether a seizure could cause damage to the brain, and whether the bouncing of a head on the floor during a seizure could cause problems. (Tr. 432). He also asked the forensic pathologist whether the trauma to the victim’s brain could have occurred from just one impact. (Tr. 472). In closing arguments, defense counsel mentioned the testimony stating the victim appeared to be having a seizure. He also said the testimony showed the victim’s injuries could have been sustained “by one fall” while noting she did not appear seriously injured after the punches that were witnessed. (Tr. 580-581). Counsel also urged there was no evidence showing Appellant had intent to purposely cause the death of his wife. (Tr. 581). Appellant next suggests the evidence was not material to the absence of mistake or accident exception. The state urges the absence of mistake or accident as to the cause of the victim’s death and his purpose (intent) were material issues actually in dispute. The state points out to negate a defendant's claim of mistake or accident, the prosecution can use similar incidents to show the act in dispute was not inadvertent, accidental, involuntary, or lacking in guilty knowledge. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. It is argued the case at bar implicates both categories discussed by Hartman in explaining the two main ways a defendant raises a claim of accident: (1) a statement disputing whether a criminal act occurred at all or (2) a statement disputing the act was committed with criminal intent. Id. at ¶ 52-53. These examples do not require the past incidents to be close in time to the current incident. This court has applied Ohio Supreme Court precedent allowing evidence of prior acts of domestic violence to show motive, intent, and absence of mistake or accident when the defendant later kills the victim. State v. Ash, 2018-Ohio-1139, 108 N.E.3d 1115, ¶ 67 (7th Dist.) (even an incident temporally removed from the incident in question can be admitted under an exception to show the tumultuous and strained relationship), citing State v. Nields, 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 10, 22, 752 N.E.2d 859 (2001). See also Jones, 7th Dist. No. 95 C.A. 98 (admissible other acts testimony on an incident with former wife ten years before the defendant’s current wife was allegedly accidentally shot) In a death penalty case, the defendant said his child fell down the basement steps. The Supreme Court upheld the admission of testimony about two prior hospital visits where the defendant claimed the child was injured when the defendant fell while holding the child. State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 16-17, 109-111. “Such evidence was particularly relevant because it showed that [the defendant’s] claim that [the child] died during an accidental fall was probably untrue. Based on this evidence, the panel could reasonably infer that [the defendant] acted purposefully in killing [the child].” Id. at ¶ 114. Here, the similar incidents involved the same victim. Appellant claimed no criminal act caused the victim’s death as she died after slipping and falling. See Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. He also claimed some prior physical injuries that night were mistakenly or accidentally inflicted and certain blows to the victim’s head did not cause her death or were not struck with purpose to cause her death. See id. at ¶ 53. Furthermore, when apologizing to the victim’s child soon after the death, he generally claimed he “didn’t mean to do it.” Notably, Hunter involved the defendant’s claim the victim died after suffering an accident by falling; the defendant’s story as to how the child died did not involve a claim he accidentally injured the child. Similarly, the first qualifying example in Hartman involved a defendant’s claim that something caused the victim’s death naturally rather than a claim he accidentally caused it. This concept is on point as to Appellant’s story of the victim’s death (the victim fell when she was running away from him to pack clothes and leave him), and this story was similar to the story Appellant told the detective about the victim’s past head injury (she received a cut above her eye during their fight when he grabbed her and she fell). It also supports the testimony of the victim’s sister confirming Appellant’s statement to the detective that the victim previously lied to cover for him by saying she fell. The contested testimony was not presented as character or propensity evidence but was relevant to an exception to the other acts exclusion which was in material dispute. Next, Appellant contends “the probative value [of the other acts evidence] is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury” and was required to be excluded under Evid.R. 403(A). There was no indication the evidence would cause confusion or mislead the jury. The state points out the evidence was highly probative to show the victim’s various injuries were not caused by a mistake or accident and the death was caused with specific intent. It was reasonable to find “under the circumstances, the detailed facts of the charged and uncharged offenses strongly suggest that an innocent explanation is implausible.” Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 58 (to determine whether other acts evidence is genuinely probative of the intent of the accused to commit the charged crime, rather than merely the accused’s propensity to commit similar crimes). This probative value must be outweighed by not just prejudice but by “unfair prejudice,” and this outweighing must be substantial. Evid.R. 403(A). “All state's evidence is meant to be prejudicial.” State v. Rupp, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05 MA 166, 2007-Ohio-1561, ¶ 67, citing State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302. Unfair prejudice is not evidenced by the harm caused to the defense by admissible evidence which had a high probative value but involves an invitation to rule based on invalid grounds. State v. Lang, 129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, ¶ 89. “Because fairness is subjective, the determination of whether evidence is unfairly prejudicial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will be overturned only if the discretion is abused.” State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302, ¶ 25. The decision was within the trial court’s discretion. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St. 3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700, __ N.E.3d __, ¶ 72. Notably, the jury heard strong evidence of Appellant’s violence toward the victim on the night her demise began: the video showed Appellant striking the victim’s head with his fist at least twice and causing her head to hit the truck, and later, the victim’s child heard the victim begging Appellant to stop while banging emanated from their location in the basement and then witnessed him punch the victim in the face. Furthermore, as the trial court concluded, prejudice was lessened by the jury instruction. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521 at ¶ 24 (This evidence is not unduly prejudicial, because the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence could not be considered to show [the defendant] had acted in conformity with a character trait. This instruction lessened the prejudicial effect). At the end of trial, the court instructed the jury: “Evidence was received about the commission of other acts other than the offenses with which the defendant is charged in this trial. That evidence was received only for the limited purpose. It was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he acted in accordance with that character. If you find that the evidence of other acts is true and that the defendant committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves the absence of mistake.” (Tr. 615-616). We presume the jury followed the limiting instruction stating the other acts evidence was not offered to prove the defendant’s character. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521 at ¶ 23. Appellant argues this instruction should have been tailored to a particular count. He states if the other acts evidence was admissible, then the jury should have been instructed they could only use it for the murder count. He claims he never said the assault at the bar was a mistake or an accident. However, when discussing the blood in his truck, he indicated to the detective he may have accidentally hit the victim with an elbow. He also commented he had her in a “bearhug” outside of the bar merely to get her back in the truck, which impliedly suggested he may have accidentally hurt her in the process, such as when he caused her head to hit the truck’s door frame. Evidence that he bodily threw her in the past would be material to whether this incident was an accident. Furthermore, his repeated slip and fall claims could allow the prosecution to conclude he was suggesting the victim’s main injuries were caused by her alleged fall. In any event, at the motion in limine hearing, the court asked defense counsel to draft the limiting instruction. (Tr. 198). And, there was no objection to the limiting instruction when the court gave the final jury instructions. “On appeal, a party may not assign as error the giving or the failure to give any instructions unless the party objects before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating specifically the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.” Crim.R. 30(A). Finally, an “improper evidentiary admission under Evid.R. 404(B) may be deemed harmless error on review when, after the tainted evidence is removed, the remaining evidence is overwhelming.” State v. Tench, 156 Ohio St.3d 85, 2018-Ohio-5205, 123 N.E.3d 955 ¶ 177 (finding harmless error in capital case, where the state presented other acts evidence including evidence the defendant was a suspect in a prior robbery), quoting State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 32. Without any consideration of other acts evidence, the evidence of the offenses was overwhelming, including the independent incidents of felonious assault and the two types of murder. As to the element of purpose for the count one murder, the evidence is further discussed in the next assignment of error. In any event, the state properly introduced other acts against the same victim to show the death was caused with specific intent and not due to mistake or accident. This assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

The decision was a preliminary ruling before the actual presentation of the evidence during the trial testimony where it could be adjudged in context upon proper objection. The preliminary issue presented in a motion in limine must be renewed at trial when the evidence is actually presented or the argument made therein is waived for purposes of appeal. State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 202-203, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996).

The child said he would threaten the victim by stating: “I’m gonna hurt you if you don’t stop talking.” The child mentioned calling her step-brother on the night at issue because “his mom went through it, so obviously I think he would know what to do” (not necessarily referring to Appellant). There were no objections during these portions of the child’s testimony. The detective testified he asked Appellant about past violence in the relationship.

He notes the testimony was not corroborated with a police report or hospital record. “It is not essential to the admissibility of evidence regarding prior incidents that such incidents were either reported to police officials by the victim or resulted in a conviction.” *State v.

Moreover, the detective testified as to Appellant’s own admissions about: prior physical arguments, the victim lying for him at the hospital in the past, and a specific incident where the victim ended up with a head wound and Appellant claimed she slipped and fell during a fight. Second, we address Appellant’s argument that other acts evidence cannot be admitted for a use permitted by Evid.R. 404(B) unless the defendant specifically introduced evidence at trial on a defense related to a permissible use of other acts evidence. Appellant points out the non-propensity purpose for admitting the other acts evidence must relate to a material issue “actually in dispute.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 27.

As the trial court ruled at the motion in limine hearing, the permissible uses of other acts evidence in Evid.R. 404(B) do not only apply when a defendant takes the stand or presents witnesses. See generally State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 20, 22, 30 (where the defendant told the police the child fell down the stairs and presented no guilt phase witnesses, the Court upheld the decision to admit evidence on prior incidents of injury to the child which the defendant had reported were a result of his falling while holding the child). We note a defendant often does not present witnesses because the state’s witnesses have the information relevant to defending the case, defendants rarely testify, and there is no formal notice a defendant must file disclosing every defense theory to the state. Also, the mere decision to forgo a lengthy opening statement does not bar the state from establishing there is an issue surrounding a permissible use of other acts evidence. The defendant’s own pretrial statements can be used by the state to show the lack of mistake or accident is a material issue in the case. See id.

He also said the testimony showed the victim’s injuries could have been sustained “by one fall” while noting she did not appear seriously injured after the punches that were witnessed. (Tr. 580-581). Counsel also urged there was no evidence showing Appellant had intent to purposely cause the death of his wife. (Tr. 581). Appellant next suggests the evidence was not material to the absence of mistake or accident exception. The state urges the absence of mistake or accident as to the cause of the victim’s death and his purpose (intent) were material issues actually in dispute. The state points out to negate a defendant's claim of mistake or accident, the prosecution can use similar incidents to show the act in dispute was not inadvertent, accidental, involuntary, or lacking in guilty knowledge. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. It is argued the case at bar implicates both categories discussed by Hartman in explaining the two main ways a defendant raises a claim of accident: (1) a statement disputing whether a criminal act occurred at all or (2) a statement disputing the act was committed with criminal intent. Id. at ¶ 52-53. These examples do not require the past incidents to be close in time to the current incident. This court has applied Ohio Supreme Court precedent allowing evidence of prior acts of domestic violence to show motive, intent, and absence of mistake or accident when the defendant later kills the victim. State v. Ash, 2018-Ohio-1139, 108 N.E.3d 1115, ¶ 67 (7th Dist.) (even an incident temporally removed from the incident in question can be admitted under an exception to show the tumultuous and strained relationship), citing State v. Nields, 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 10, 22, 752 N.E.2d 859 (2001). See also Jones, 7th Dist. No. 95 C.A. 98 (admissible other acts testimony on an incident with former wife ten years before the defendant’s current wife was allegedly accidentally shot) In a death penalty case, the defendant said his child fell down the basement steps. The Supreme Court upheld the admission of testimony about two prior hospital visits where the defendant claimed the child was injured when the defendant fell while holding the child. State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 16-17, 109-111. “Such evidence was particularly relevant because it showed that [the defendant’s] claim that [the child] died during an accidental fall was probably untrue. Based on this evidence, the panel could reasonably infer that [the defendant] acted purposefully in killing [the child].” Id. at ¶ 114. Here, the similar incidents involved the same victim. Appellant claimed no criminal act caused the victim’s death as she died after slipping and falling. See Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. He also claimed some prior physical injuries that night were mistakenly or accidentally inflicted and certain blows to the victim’s head did not cause her death or were not struck with purpose to cause her death. See id. at ¶ 53. Furthermore, when apologizing to the victim’s child soon after the death, he generally claimed he “didn’t mean to do it.” Notably, Hunter involved the defendant’s claim the victim died after suffering an accident by falling; the defendant’s story as to how the child died did not involve a claim he accidentally injured the child. Similarly, the first qualifying example in Hartman involved a defendant’s claim that something caused the victim’s death naturally rather than a claim he accidentally caused it. This concept is on point as to Appellant’s story of the victim’s death (the victim fell when she was running away from him to pack clothes and leave him), and this story was similar to the story Appellant told the detective about the victim’s past head injury (she received a cut above her eye during their fight when he grabbed her and she fell). It also supports the testimony of the victim’s sister confirming Appellant’s statement to the detective that the victim previously lied to cover for him by saying she fell. The contested testimony was not presented as character or propensity evidence but was relevant to an exception to the other acts exclusion which was in material dispute. Next, Appellant contends “the probative value [of the other acts evidence] is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury” and was required to be excluded under Evid.R. 403(A). There was no indication the evidence would cause confusion or mislead the jury. The state points out the evidence was highly probative to show the victim’s various injuries were not caused by a mistake or accident and the death was caused with specific intent. It was reasonable to find “under the circumstances, the detailed facts of the charged and uncharged offenses strongly suggest that an innocent explanation is implausible.” Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 58 (to determine whether other acts evidence is genuinely probative of the intent of the accused to commit the charged crime, rather than merely the accused’s propensity to commit similar crimes). This probative value must be outweighed by not just prejudice but by “unfair prejudice,” and this outweighing must be substantial. Evid.R. 403(A). “All state's evidence is meant to be prejudicial.” State v. Rupp, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05 MA 166, 2007-Ohio-1561, ¶ 67, citing State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302. Unfair prejudice is not evidenced by the harm caused to the defense by admissible evidence which had a high probative value but involves an invitation to rule based on invalid grounds. State v. Lang, 129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, ¶ 89. “Because fairness is subjective, the determination of whether evidence is unfairly prejudicial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will be overturned only if the discretion is abused.” State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302, ¶ 25. The decision was within the trial court’s discretion. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St. 3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700, __ N.E.3d __, ¶ 72. Notably, the jury heard strong evidence of Appellant’s violence toward the victim on the night her demise began: the video showed Appellant striking the victim’s head with his fist at least twice and causing her head to hit the truck, and later, the victim’s child heard the victim begging Appellant to stop while banging emanated from their location in the basement and then witnessed him punch the victim in the face. Furthermore, as the trial court concluded, prejudice was lessened by the jury instruction. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521 at ¶ 24 (This evidence is not unduly prejudicial, because the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence could not be considered to show [the defendant] had acted in conformity with a character trait. This instruction lessened the prejudicial effect). At the end of trial, the court instructed the jury: “Evidence was received about the commission of other acts other than the offenses with which the defendant is charged in this trial. That evidence was received only for the limited purpose. It was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he acted in accordance with that character. If you find that the evidence of other acts is true and that the defendant committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves the absence of mistake.” (Tr. 615-616). We presume the jury followed the limiting instruction stating the other acts evidence was not offered to prove the defendant’s character. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521 at ¶ 23. Appellant argues this instruction should have been tailored to a particular count. He states if the other acts evidence was admissible, then the jury should have been instructed they could only use it for the murder count. He claims he never said the assault at the bar was a mistake or an accident. However, when discussing the blood in his truck, he indicated to the detective he may have accidentally hit the victim with an elbow. He also commented he had her in a “bearhug” outside of the bar merely to get her back in the truck, which impliedly suggested he may have accidentally hurt her in the process, such as when he caused her head to hit the truck’s door frame. Evidence that he bodily threw her in the past would be material to whether this incident was an accident. Furthermore, his repeated slip and fall claims could allow the prosecution to conclude he was suggesting the victim’s main injuries were caused by her alleged fall. In any event, at the motion in limine hearing, the court asked defense counsel to draft the limiting instruction. (Tr. 198). And, there was no objection to the limiting instruction when the court gave the final jury instructions. “On appeal, a party may not assign as error the giving or the failure to give any instructions unless the party objects before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating specifically the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.” Crim.R. 30(A). Finally, an “improper evidentiary admission under Evid.R. 404(B) may be deemed harmless error on review when, after the tainted evidence is removed, the remaining evidence is overwhelming.” State v. Tench, 156 Ohio St.3d 85, 2018-Ohio-5205, 123 N.E.3d 955 ¶ 177 (finding harmless error in capital case, where the state presented other acts evidence including evidence the defendant was a suspect in a prior robbery), quoting State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 32. Without any consideration of other acts evidence, the evidence of the offenses was overwhelming, including the independent incidents of felonious assault and the two types of murder. As to the element of purpose for the count one murder, the evidence is further discussed in the next assignment of error. In any event, the state properly introduced other acts against the same victim to show the death was caused with specific intent and not due to mistake or accident. This assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Defense counsel asked the court to note a continuing objection to the evidence, and the court said it would. The decision was a preliminary ruling before the actual presentation of the evidence during the trial testimony where it could be adjudged in context upon proper objection. The preliminary issue presented in a motion in limine must be renewed at trial when the evidence is actually presented or the argument made therein is waived for purposes of appeal. State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 202-203, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996). On appeal, Appellant claims the court improperly allowed the state to present other acts evidence to demonstrate his propensity for assaulting his wife and to show he acted in conformity with his character. He says the state used the evidence to paint a picture that it was only a matter of time before he killed his wife. He contests the following testimony on other acts. Appellant’s sister-in-law was asked about the relationship between Appellant and the victim. She said it was sometimes loving but they would argue and fight, answering in the affirmative when asked if the relationship ever got physical. There was no objection entered. If a timely objection was lacking, then the appellant must not only show an error occurred and the error was obvious, but he must also show it affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St.3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 93 (finding error in admitting other acts evidence but refusing to find plain error as the error did not affect the outcome of trial), citing State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002). The general, non-specific testimony of Appellant’s sister-in-law would not have affected Appellant’s substantial rights under the circumstances of this case. The real focus is on the other acts testimony of the victim’s sister, the victim’s child, and on statements Appellant made to the detective. The victim’s sister testified she first realized Appellant was abusive when she looked out her door and saw the victim “fly across the street, like her body.” She did not see the actual physical motion by which Appellant caused this to occur, but she yelled at him not to put his hands on her sister and he apologized. Another time, she intervened when Appellant was “dragging [the victim] up and down the street.” In the past, she observed the victim with injuries such as a broken nose, teeth, and fingers. Over objection, the victim’s sister testified: the victim told her Appellant caused these injuries; the victim told the hospital staff she was injured in a fall; and the staff said the victim’s body could not take much more. The victim’s child testified: she asked Appellant if he would stop hitting her mother months before the victim’s death; he said he would; and the situation got worse. She stated she witnessed Appellant’s prior acts of punching, hitting, throwing, and kicking the victim; she associated the behavior as occurring after Appellant drank liquor. The child said he would threaten the victim by stating: “I’m gonna hurt you if you don’t stop talking.” The child mentioned calling her step-brother on the night at issue because “his mom went through it, so obviously I think he would know what to do” (not necessarily referring to Appellant). There were no objections during these portions of the child’s testimony. The detective testified he asked Appellant about past violence in the relationship. Over objection, the detective said Appellant “initially downplayed it, but ultimately admitted to having some physical altercations” with the victim in the past. Appellant said one such altercation resulted in “a cut over her eye” which occurred when he “grabbed her and she slipped and fell and hit her eye”; Appellant also acknowledged the victim “has lied for him in the past when they have gone to the hospital.” “Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” Evid.R. 404(B). “Thus, while evidence showing the defendant’s character or propensity to commit crimes or acts is forbidden, evidence of other acts is admissible when the evidence is probative of a separate, nonpropensity-based issue. State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, ¶ 22. In general, evidence is relevant if it tends “to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination * * * more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Evid.R. 401. *See also Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 24; Evid.R. 402 (“Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.”). The relevancy determination in this context asks “whether the evidence is relevant to the particular purpose for which it is offered” which must be one other than character or propensity. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 26. Evid.R. 404(B) contains a “nonexhaustive list of the permissible nonpropensity purposes for which other-acts evidence may be introduced.” *Id.* at ¶ 26. “The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a'material' issue that is actually in dispute between the parties.” *Id.* at ¶ 27. Also, evidence of similar acts “is relevant only if the jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *Id.* at ¶ 28. If the evidence is not presented for character and has a permissible purpose under Evid.R. 404(B), then the trial court uses its discretion to determine whether the probative value “is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.” *Id.* at ¶ 29-30, citing Evid.R. 403(A). The probative value and the unfairness of any prejudice can depend on the degree to which the fact is truly in dispute and whether it can be shown with alternative evidence. *Id.* at ¶ 31-32. First, we address Appellant’s claim there was no “substantial proof” he committed the other acts. *Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. He notes the testimony was not corroborated with a police report or hospital record. “It is not essential to the admissibility of evidence regarding prior incidents that such incidents were either reported to police officials by the victim or resulted in a conviction.” *State v. Jones*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 95 C.A. 98 (June 26, 1998) (admitting testimony on an incident where the defendant held his former wife hostage with a rifle ten years prior to the prosecution for the death of his current wife where the defendant claimed the shooting was accidental while they were fighting over a gun), citing *State v. Armstrong*, 74 Ohio App.3d 732, 600 N.E.2d 690 (2d Dist.1991). Here, the “jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 28. The jury could evaluate the credibility of the victim’s sister and the victim’s child who claimed to have witnessed certain acts. Moreover, the detective testified as to Appellant’s own admissions about: prior physical arguments, the victim lying for him at the hospital in the past, and a specific incident where the victim ended up with a head wound and Appellant claimed she slipped and fell during a fight. Second, we address Appellant’s argument that other acts evidence cannot be admitted for a use permitted by Evid.R. 404(B) unless the defendant specifically introduced evidence at trial on a defense related to a permissible use of other acts evidence. Appellant points out the non-propensity purpose for admitting the other acts evidence must relate to a material issue “actually in dispute.” *See Hartman*, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 27. He complains the prosecution introduced the defendant’s statement (that the victim was injured due to an accidental fall) and used this to assert a permissible use under Evid.R. 404(B) without waiting to see if he would be opening the door to the issue. As the trial court ruled at the motion in limine hearing, the permissible uses of other acts evidence in Evid.R. 404(B) do not only apply when a defendant takes the stand or presents witnesses. See generally State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 20, 22, 30 (where the defendant told the police the child fell down the stairs and presented no guilt phase witnesses, the Court upheld the decision to admit evidence on prior incidents of injury to the child which the defendant had reported were a result of his falling while holding the child). We note a defendant often does not present witnesses because the state’s witnesses have the information relevant to defending the case, defendants rarely testify, and there is no formal notice a defendant must file disclosing every defense theory to the state. Also, the mere decision to forgo a lengthy opening statement does not bar the state from establishing there is an issue surrounding a permissible use of other acts evidence. The defendant’s own pretrial statements can be used by the state to show the lack of mistake or accident is a material issue in the case. See id. Here, Appellant repeatedly claimed the victim was injured at home as a result of an accident where she fell in a bedroom while running (from him after a night of physical violence as captured on video and subsequently witnessed by the victim’s twelve-year-old child). The state’s first two witnesses (Appellant’s brother and sister-in-law) testified to Appellant’s claim at the scene while the victim was lying on the floor dying. After summoning them and instead of calling 911, Appellant told them the victim was injured when she slipped and fell while running into a bedroom (to pack and leave the house). Appellant also told this story to the police when he was interviewed on the day the victim was hospitalized, and the detective testified to Appellant’s claim. Appellant also suggested to the detective he may have elbowed the victim in the face by mistake while putting her in “a bearhug.” And, Appellant told the victim’s sister he did not put his hands on the victim. Moreover, defense counsel asked the victim’s child whether her mother got aggressive when she drank alcohol, eliciting a statement that the victim would sometimes hit Appellant (but only if he hit her first). Defense counsel cross-examined the neurosurgeon on whether the brain trauma could have resulted from a fall, whether a seizure could cause damage to the brain, and whether the bouncing of a head on the floor during a seizure could cause problems. (Tr. 432). He also asked the forensic pathologist whether the trauma to the victim’s brain could have occurred from just one impact. (Tr. 472). In closing arguments, defense counsel mentioned the testimony stating the victim appeared to be having a seizure. He also said the testimony showed the victim’s injuries could have been sustained “by one fall” while noting she did not appear seriously injured after the punches that were witnessed. (Tr. 580-581). Counsel also urged there was no evidence showing Appellant had intent to purposely cause the death of his wife. (Tr. 581). Appellant next suggests the evidence was not material to the absence of mistake or accident exception. The state urges the absence of mistake or accident as to the cause of the victim’s death and his purpose (intent) were material issues actually in dispute. The state points out to negate a defendant's claim of mistake or accident, the prosecution can use similar incidents to show the act in dispute was not inadvertent, accidental, involuntary, or lacking in guilty knowledge. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214 at ¶ 52. It is argued the case at bar implicates both categories discussed by Hartman in explaining the two main ways a defendant raises a claim of accident: (1) a statement disputing whether a criminal act occurred at all or (2) a statement disputing the act was committed with criminal intent. Id. at ¶ 52-53. These examples do not require the past incidents to be close in time to the current incident. This court has applied Ohio Supreme Court precedent allowing evidence of prior acts of domestic violence to show motive, intent, and absence of mistake or accident when the defendant later kills the victim.

No. 95 C.A. 98 (admissible other acts testimony on an incident with former wife ten years before the defendant’s current wife was allegedly accidentally shot) In a death penalty case, the defendant said his child fell down the basement steps. The Supreme Court upheld the admission of testimony about two prior hospital visits where the defendant claimed the child was injured when the defendant fell while holding the child. State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 16-17, 109-111. “Such evidence was particularly relevant because it showed that [the defendant’s] claim that [the child] died during an accidental fall was probably untrue.

{"index": "378-Patton", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "Insufficient evidence to support the convictions and the convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"In his first and second assignments of error, which he argues together, Patton contends that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence. 'In a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.' State v. Ham, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170043, 2017-Ohio-9189, ¶ 19, citing State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. Patton was convicted of two counts of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A), which prohibits 'purposely caus[ing] the death of another * * *.' At trial, the state argued that Patton was guilty of purposeful murder under the theory of complicity. R.C. 2923.03(A)(2) defines the offense of complicity, in relevant part, as follows: No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense, shall do any of the following: (2) Aid or abet another in committing the offense. 'To support a conviction for complicity by aiding and abetting, pursuant to R.C. 2923.03(A)(2), the evidence must show that the defendant supported, assisted, encouraged, cooperated with, advised, or incited the principal in the commission of the crime, and that the defendant shared the criminal intent of the principal.' State v. Johnson, 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 754 N.E.2d 796 (2001), syllabus. 'The mere presence of an accused at the scene of a crime is not sufficient to prove, in and of itself, that the accused was an aider and abettor.' Id. at 243, quoting State v. Widner, 69 Ohio St.2d 267, 269, 431 N.E. 1025 (1982). R.C. 2923.03(A) specifies that a person is only guilty of complicity when he acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense. The aider and abettor must share the criminal intent of the principal. Id. at syllabus. Thus, Patton is guilty of complicity to commit murder only if he purposefully aided or abetted in the murders of Anderson and Davis. 'A defendant’s participation in criminal intent may be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the crime.' In re J.C., 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180493, 2019-Ohio-4027, ¶ 15, appeal not allowed, 157 Ohio St.3d 1565, 2020-Ohio-313, 138 N.E.3d 1167, ¶ 15. Aiding and abetting may be shown by both direct and circumstantial evidence, and participation may be inferred from presence, companionship, and conduct before and after the offense is committed. Johnson at 245. In this case, it is undisputed that Searcy murdered Anderson and Davis. Patton contends that the state presented no evidence that Patton had the same purposeful intent to shoot and kill the victims as Searcy. The state argues that the evidence that Patton started the fight, Wells’s testimony that Patton threatened to shoot while continuously touching his side, and Hicks’s testimony that Patton gave his gun to Searcy immediately before starting the altercation is sufficient evidence to infer his intent from the surrounding circumstances. When this evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the state, it is clear that any rational juror could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Patton’s conduct of threatening the group while grabbing his side, giving Searcy his gun, then immediately running and punching Anderson could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that Patton acted purposely to aid and abet Searcy in the murders of Anderson and Davis. 'Even though supported by sufficient evidence, a conviction may still be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.' State v. McCombs, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 15AP-245, 2015-Ohio-3848, ¶ 3, citing State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). 'While sufficiency of the evidence is a test of adequacy regarding whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the verdict as a matter of law, the criminal manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard addresses the evidence’s effect of inducing belief.' State v. Cassell, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 08AP-1093, 2010-Ohio-1881, ¶ 38. When considering a challenge to the weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. Thompkins at 387. 'When reversing a conviction on the basis that it was against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court sits as a ‘thirteenth juror,’ and disagrees with the factfinder’s resolution of the conflicting testimony.' State v. Tucker, 9th Dist. Medina No. 06CA0035-M, 2006-Ohio-6914, ¶ 5. Reversing a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence should be reserved for only the most '‘exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.’' State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983), paragraph three of the syllabus. Patton argues that the testimony of both Wells and Hicks was inconsistent with the statements given to the police on the night of the incident. At trial, both witnesses testified to a more detailed account of the events than they initially gave the police. Patton further argues that no physical evidence connected him to the crimes. Both Wells and Hicks were extensively cross-examined about the additional details. Wells explained that when she spoke with the police, she was in tears and under immense stress. She remembered more details after she spoke with the police. Hicks initially told the police that he saw an exchange between Patton and Searcy that he believed was a gun. At trial, Hicks testified he saw the gun being exchanged, although he could not identify the gun. With respect to the lack of physical evidence, the gun was never recovered and no fingerprints could be obtained from the shell casings. However, the state is not required to present physical evidence or recover a weapon to satisfy its burden. See State v. English, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180697, 2020-Ohio-4682, ¶ 29. Next, Patton basically contends that the jurors should not have believed the testimony of Wells and Hicks. Generally, issues of witness credibility are for the trier of fact to resolve. See State v. Issa, 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 67, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001). The trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses and is particularly competent to determine 'whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses.' State v. Glover, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C- 180572, 2019-Ohio-5211, ¶ 30. We cannot conclude that the factfinder lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"\n}\n```"}

Patton was convicted of two counts of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A), which prohibits 'purposely caus[ing] the death of another * * *.' At trial, the state argued that Patton was guilty of purposeful murder under the theory of complicity. R.C. 2923.03(A)(2) defines the offense of complicity, in relevant part, as follows: No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense, shall do any of the following: (2) Aid or abet another in committing the offense. 'To support a conviction for complicity by aiding and abetting, pursuant to R.C. 2923.03(A)(2), the evidence must show that the defendant supported, assisted, encouraged, cooperated with, advised, or incited the principal in the commission of the crime, and that the defendant shared the criminal intent of the principal.' State v. Johnson, 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 754 N.E.2d 796 (2001), syllabus. 'The mere presence of an accused at the scene of a crime is not sufficient to prove, in and of itself, that the accused was an aider and abettor.' Id. at 243, quoting State v. Widner, 69 Ohio St.2d 267, 269, 431 N.E. 1025 (1982). R.C. 2923.03(A) specifies that a person is only guilty of complicity when he acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense. The aider and abettor must share the criminal intent of the principal. Id. at syllabus. Thus, Patton is guilty of complicity to commit murder only if he purposefully aided or abetted in the murders of Anderson and Davis. 'A defendant’s participation in criminal intent may be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the crime.' In re J.C., 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180493, 2019-Ohio-4027, ¶ 15, appeal not allowed, 157 Ohio St.3d 1565, 2020-Ohio-313, 138 N.E.3d 1167, ¶ 15. Aiding and abetting may be shown by both direct and circumstantial evidence, and participation may be inferred from presence, companionship, and conduct before and after the offense is committed. Johnson at 245. In this case, it is undisputed that Searcy murdered Anderson and Davis. Patton contends that the state presented no evidence that Patton had the same purposeful intent to shoot and kill the victims as Searcy. The state argues that the evidence that Patton started the fight, Wells’s testimony that Patton threatened to shoot while continuously touching his side, and Hicks’s testimony that Patton gave his gun to Searcy immediately before starting the altercation is sufficient evidence to infer his intent from the surrounding circumstances. When this evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the state, it is clear that any rational juror could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Patton’s conduct of threatening the group while grabbing his side, giving Searcy his gun, then immediately running and punching Anderson could lead a reasonable jury to conclude that Patton acted purposely to aid and abet Searcy in the murders of Anderson and Davis. 'Even though supported by sufficient evidence, a conviction may still be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.' State v. McCombs, 10th Dist.

'While sufficiency of the evidence is a test of adequacy regarding whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the verdict as a matter of law, the criminal manifest-weight-of-the-evidence standard addresses the evidence’s effect of inducing belief.' State v. Cassell, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 08AP-1093, 2010-Ohio-1881, ¶ 38. When considering a challenge to the weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. Thompkins at 387. 'When reversing a conviction on the basis that it was against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court sits as a ‘thirteenth juror,’ and disagrees with the factfinder’s resolution of the conflicting testimony.' State v. Tucker, 9th Dist. Medina No. 06CA0035-M, 2006-Ohio-6914, ¶ 5. Reversing a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence should be reserved for only the most '‘exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.’' State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983), paragraph three of the syllabus. Patton argues that the testimony of both Wells and Hicks was inconsistent with the statements given to the police on the night of the incident. At trial, both witnesses testified to a more detailed account of the events than they initially gave the police. Patton further argues that no physical evidence connected him to the crimes. Both Wells and Hicks were extensively cross-examined about the additional details. Wells explained that when she spoke with the police, she was in tears and under immense stress. She remembered more details after she spoke with the police. Hicks initially told the police that he saw an exchange between Patton and Searcy that he believed was a gun. At trial, Hicks testified he saw the gun being exchanged, although he could not identify the gun. With respect to the lack of physical evidence, the gun was never recovered and no fingerprints could be obtained from the shell casings. However, the state is not required to present physical evidence or recover a weapon to satisfy its burden. See State v. English, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180697, 2020-Ohio-4682, ¶ 29. Next, Patton basically contends that the jurors should not have believed the testimony of Wells and Hicks. Generally, issues of witness credibility are for the trier of fact to resolve. See State v. Issa, 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 67, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001). The trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses and is particularly competent to determine 'whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses.' State v. Glover, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C- 180572, 2019-Ohio-5211, ¶ 30. We cannot conclude that the factfinder lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"\n}\n```"}

Lawson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4 (Aug. 22, 1997). This court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact on the issue of witness credibility unless it is patently apparent that the trier of fact lost its way in arriving at its verdict. State v. Bradley, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 97-CA-03, 1997 WL 691510, *4 (Oct. 24, 1997). R.C. 2925.03(A)(2), the drug trafficking statute, provides, in relevant part: (A) No person shall knowingly do any of the following: * * * (2) Prepare for shipment, ship, transport, deliver, prepare for distribution, or distribute a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog, when the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the controlled substance or a controlled substance analog is intended for sale or resale by the offender or another person. The drug possession statute that Phifer was found guilty of violating provides that ‘[n]o person shall knowingly obtain, possess, or use a controlled substance or a controlled substance analog.’ R.C. 2925.11(A). Methamphetamine is a controlled substance. See R.C. 2925.11(II). For purposes of drug offenses, ‘‘possess’ or ‘possession’ means having control over a thing or substance, but may not be inferred solely from mere access to the thing or substance through ownership or occupation of the premises upon which the thing or substance is found.’ R.C. 2925.01(K). ‘A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person's conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist.’ R.C. 2901.22(B). Here, Phifer argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he knowingly sold or offered to sell methamphetamine or that he knowingly possessed methamphetamine. However, Detective Nawman testified that while he and Detective Snyder were conducting surveillance of Phifer’s residence, he observed two individuals arrive in a blue vehicle, whereupon Phifer exited the residence, walked to the vehicle, and spoke to the individuals. Phifer then walked around to the passenger side of the vehicle and placed his hands inside the passenger side window. Detective Nawman testified that he did not see drugs being exchanged, but he did observe one of the individuals give money to Phifer. Based upon his experience as a narcotics detective and law enforcement officer for many years, Detective Nawman believed that he had just witnessed the sale of illegal drugs. Detective Nawman testified that, a short time later, he observed another individual exit a nearby residence, walk over to Phifer’s residence, enter Phifer’s residence, and then exit approximately one or two minutes later. Detective Nawman testified that the incidents he observed while surveilling Phifer’s residence were consistent with the illegal sale of narcotics. APA Starkey and the other APA officers then arrived at Phifer’s residence and went inside without the detectives; Starkey testified that she encountered several individuals, including Phifer and a young child, inside the residence. Starkey testified that she and the other APA officers observed an open black duffel bag on a recliner in the front room that contained a baggie containing a white substance; the substance was later identified as crack cocaine. Starkey also testified that she and the APA officers discovered another baggie containing a white substance and pills underneath a black sofa in the front room; this substance was later identified as over 15 grams of methamphetamine, over five times the bulk limit. Starkey testified that she and the other APA officers also found a ‘burner’ cellphone under the cushions of the sofa, a baggie containing marijuana, and various other drug paraphernalia during their search of the house. After placing all of the contraband and paraphernalia in a pile in the front room of Phifer’s residence, the APA officers contacted the detectives and asked for their assistance. They told the detectives where they had found the various items. As previously stated, the detectives then obtained a search warrant for the burner cellphone and the rest of the residence. Upon searching the contents of the cellphone, the detectives found evidence that indicated drug trafficking in the following text messages/conversations: 1) Incoming Text: ‘Can you bring me a 10 at all?’ 2) Incoming Text: ‘This Vinz?’ Reply: ‘Yea.’ 3) Incoming Text: ‘You got a gram?’ Reply: ‘Yea.’ 4) Incoming Text: Will you bring it down?’ Reply: ‘Got u [sic].’ One reply sent from the cellphone, ostensibly from Phifer, also mentioned payment for drugs using cellphone cash applications such as Venmo and Paypal. As previously stated, Detectives Snyder and Nawman testified that they believed ‘Vinz’ was a nickname for Phifer, whose first name is ‘Venzer,’ which supported an inference that the cellphone belonged to Phifer, who used it for drug transactions. Both detectives also testified that they were unaware of any other individuals in the illegal drug trade in Springfield, Ohio, with the nickname ‘Vinz.’ Hagans, Phifer’s girlfriend, testified on his behalf at trial. While Hagans testified that the burner cellphone belonged to Browning, she also testified that Phifer slept and kept his belongings on the sofa under which the cellphone and baggie of methamphetamine were found. Hagans also testified and that it was Browning, not Phifer, that the detectives observed conducting a drug transaction with the individuals in the blue vehicle in front of the residence. Phifer argues that the evidence adduced by the State was insufficient to convict him because it was entirely circumstantial. We have held, however, that a defendant may be convicted based on direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or both. State v. Donley, 2017-Ohio-562, 85 N.E.3d 324, ¶ 178 (2d Dist.). Circumstantial evidence has the same probative value as direct evidence. State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 272, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), citing State v. Nicely, 39 Ohio St.3d 147, 529 N.E.2d 1236 (1988); State v. Bennett, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24576, 2012-Ohio-194, ¶ 11. In fact, in some cases, ‘circumstantial evidence may be more certain, satisfying, and persuasive than direct evidence.’ State v. Jackson, 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 38, 565 N.E.2d 549 (1991). ‘‘A conviction based on purely circumstantial evidence is no less sound than a conviction based on direct evidence.’’ State v. Pounds, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22469, 2008-Ohio-5384, ¶ 38, quoting State v. Howland, 12th Dist. Fayette No. 2006-08-035, 2008-Ohio-521, ¶ 32. ‘As long as the evidence would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, circumstantial evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction.’ State v. Whitehead, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28334, 2019-Ohio-5141, ¶ 31, citing McKnight, 107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, ¶ 75. In this case, the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the State, established that Phifer knowingly possessed and trafficked in bulk amounts of methamphetamine. Accordingly, we find that the jury’s findings of guilty on the charged offenses were supported by sufficient evidence. Furthermore, having reviewed the record, we find no merit in Phifer’s manifest-weight challenge. It is well-settled that evaluating witness credibility is primarily for the trier of fact. State v. Benton, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2010-CA-27, 2012-Ohio-4080, ¶ 7. Here, the jury reasonably credited the testimony provided by the State’s witnesses, applied that evidence and all reasonable inferences to the elements of the offense, and found Phifer guilty. Additionally, the jury was free to discredit Hagans’s testimony that the burner cellphone belonged to Browning, not Phifer, and that it was Browning, not Phifer, that the detectives observed conducting a drug transaction with the individuals in the blue vehicle in front of the residence. Having reviewed the entire record, we cannot find that the evidence weighed heavily against conviction or that a manifest miscarriage of justice occurred.\"\n}\n```"}

As previously stated, Detectives Snyder and Nawman testified that they believed ‘Vinz’ was a nickname for Phifer, whose first name is ‘Venzer,’ which supported an inference that the cellphone belonged to Phifer, who used it for drug transactions. Both detectives also testified that they were unaware of any other individuals in the illegal drug trade in Springfield, Ohio, with the nickname ‘Vinz.’ Hagans, Phifer’s girlfriend, testified on his behalf at trial. While Hagans testified that the burner cellphone belonged to Browning, she also testified that Phifer slept and kept his belongings on the sofa under which the cellphone and baggie of methamphetamine were found. Hagans also testified and that it was Browning, not Phifer, that the detectives observed conducting a drug transaction with the individuals in the blue vehicle in front of the residence. Phifer argues that the evidence adduced by the State was insufficient to convict him because it was entirely circumstantial. We have held, however, that a defendant may be convicted based on direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or both. State v. Donley, 2017-Ohio-562, 85 N.E.3d 324, ¶ 178 (2d Dist.). Circumstantial evidence has the same probative value as direct evidence. State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 272, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), citing State v. Nicely, 39 Ohio St.3d 147, 529 N.E.2d 1236 (1988); State v. Bennett, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24576, 2012-Ohio-194, ¶ 11. In fact, in some cases, ‘circumstantial evidence may be more certain, satisfying, and persuasive than direct evidence.’ State v. Jackson, 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 38, 565 N.E.2d 549 (1991). ‘‘A conviction based on purely circumstantial evidence is no less sound than a conviction based on direct evidence.’’ State v. Pounds, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22469, 2008-Ohio-5384, ¶ 38, quoting State v. Howland, 12th Dist. Fayette No. 2006-08-035, 2008-Ohio-521, ¶ 32. ‘As long as the evidence would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, circumstantial evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction.’ State v. Whitehead, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 28334, 2019-Ohio-5141, ¶ 31, citing McKnight, 107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, ¶ 75. In this case, the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the State, established that Phifer knowingly possessed and trafficked in bulk amounts of methamphetamine. Accordingly, we find that the jury’s findings of guilty on the charged offenses were supported by sufficient evidence. Furthermore, having reviewed the record, we find no merit in Phifer’s manifest-weight challenge. It is well-settled that evaluating witness credibility is primarily for the trier of fact. State v. Benton, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2010-CA-27, 2012-Ohio-4080, ¶ 7. Here, the jury reasonably credited the testimony provided by the State’s witnesses, applied that evidence and all reasonable inferences to the elements of the offense, and found Phifer guilty. Additionally, the jury was free to discredit Hagans’s testimony that the burner cellphone belonged to Browning, not Phifer, and that it was Browning, not Phifer, that the detectives observed conducting a drug transaction with the individuals in the blue vehicle in front of the residence. Having reviewed the entire record, we cannot find that the evidence weighed heavily against conviction or that a manifest miscarriage of justice occurred.\"\n}\n```"}

Thomas maintains that the testimony regarding prior conduct lacked corroboration, and was factually and temporally unrelated to the conduct on trial. Evidence of other acts or crimes is not admissible to prove “a defendant’s character as to criminal propensity.” State v. Clinton, 153 Ohio St.3d 422, 2017-Ohio-9423, 108 N.E.3d 1, ¶ 96, citing Evid.R. 404(B). Such evidence, however, is “admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” Evid.R. 404(B); see also R.C. 2945.59 (permitting other acts evidence to demonstrate motive or intent, mistake or accident, or a scheme, plan, or system in committing the offense at issue). “The language of Evid.R. 404(B) indicates that the list of purposes for which evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admitted is not an exhaustive listing.” State v. Morris, 132 Ohio St.3d 337, 2012-Ohio-2407, 972 N.E.2d 528, ¶ 18. In considering the admissibility of 404(B) evidence, a court must consider whether the evidence is relevant, whether it is offered for a legitimate purpose, and whether the probative value substantially outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice. State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, ¶ 20. We review a decision to permit 404(B) evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. Morris at ¶ 19. To find an abuse of discretion, we must find more than an error of law or judgment, and that the admission of other-acts evidence was “unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.” Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983). At trial, the court precluded some of the intended other-acts testimony as unrelated to the crimes charged, but permitted testimony regarding Thomas’s prior acts of domestic violence against R.I. At trial, R.I. and others testified regarding past incidents of physical abuse and injury, including a burn to R.I.’s hand with a hot knife, a head injury resulting from a strike with a pistol butt, and a black eye. R.I. also testified that Thomas choked her on numerous occasions, sometimes until she lost consciousness, with her attempts to resist only prolonging the abuse. On the date at issue, R.I. testified that she did not want to have sex with Thomas, but knew that he would stay and persist until she gave in, and she wanted the abuse to end and for Thomas to leave. This testimony was relevant, because it provided context for the rape and tended to explain R.I.’s lack of resistance by demonstrating Thomas’s use of physical abuse, past and present, to force her compliance. “It is a well-known rule that, while consent negatives rape, where a woman is affected by terror or is in fear of great bodily injury and harm, brought into being by an accused, who has placed his victim within his power and control, intercourse under such circumstances without consent is rape, even though the victim might have used greater physical resistance or cried out, when it is shown that her will was overcome by the fear or duress.” State v. Rupp, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05MA166, 2007-Ohio-1561, ¶ 26, quoting State v. Martin, 77 Ohio App.553, 554, 68 N.E.2d 807 (9th Dist.1946). Based on this relevance, the trial court correctly permitted this evidence for a legitimate purpose, and not merely to impugn Thomas’s character. The other-acts evidence admitted by the trial court, furthermore, did not pertain to incidents so remote in time and circumstance to render that testimony irrelevant to the intended purpose. “While other acts evidence may be admissible, its probative value becomes attenuated as the distance in time and the nature of the act become more remote.” State v. Moran, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-11-042, 2013-Ohio-724, ¶ 18. In this case, the evidence pertained to similar conduct toward R.I. during the course of their relationship, and therefore was neither remote nor attenuated. Finally, the other-acts evidence was not unduly prejudicial. All evidence that tended to prove the state’s case was prejudicial to Thomas, but exclusion was only required for evidence that was unfairly prejudicial. State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302, ¶ 23. “Unfair prejudice is that quality of evidence which might result in an improper basis for a jury decision.” Crotts at ¶ 24. Therefore, if the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of other-acts evidence, the trial court should have ruled that evidence inadmissible. Williams, 2012-Ohio-5695, ¶ 24. Here, Thomas argues that evidence of prior conduct was unduly prejudicial, without addressing either the relevance of this evidence or the purpose for which the state proffered the evidence. The trial court gave limiting instructions to the jury following testimony, and again at the close of the state’s case in chief as follows: Now that [other-acts] evidence was received for a very limited purpose, it was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the [Thomas] in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character. If you find that the evidence of other wrongs is true and that [Thomas] committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves that [R.I.’s] will was overcome by fear and may explain her lack of resistance to the sexual assault. Therefore, evidence that may or may not be relevant regarding the element of force, that’s an essential element of the charge of Rape that you will have further instructions on when we get to that point in the trial. So that evidence can not be considered by you for any other purpose. Thomas dismisses the trial court’s limiting instruction as ineffective, with no argument or authority offered in support of this conclusion. Contrary to Thomas’s position, the trial court properly gave a limiting instruction, and “[i]t is presumed that the jury followed the instructions of the court.” State v. Williams, 73 Ohio St.3d 153, 159, 652 N.E.2d 821 (1995), citing State v. Murphy, 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 584, 605 N.E.2d 884 (1992). Considering the record, the trial court properly considered the relevance of proffered evidence, as well as the purpose for which the state sought to introduce that evidence, and weighed the probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice. In admitting some of that evidence, the trial court also cautioned the jury regarding the limited purpose for which they might consider that evidence. Therefore, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence of prior acts, pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), and Thomas’s first assignment of error is not well-taken.\"\n}\n```"}

All evidence that tended to prove the state’s case was prejudicial to Thomas, but exclusion was only required for evidence that was unfairly prejudicial. State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302, ¶ 23. “Unfair prejudice is that quality of evidence which might result in an improper basis for a jury decision.” Crotts at ¶ 24. Therefore, if the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of other-acts evidence, the trial court should have ruled that evidence inadmissible. Williams, 2012-Ohio-5695, ¶ 24. Here, Thomas argues that evidence of prior conduct was unduly prejudicial, without addressing either the relevance of this evidence or the purpose for which the state proffered the evidence. The trial court gave limiting instructions to the jury following testimony, and again at the close of the state’s case in chief as follows: Now that [other-acts] evidence was received for a very limited purpose, it was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the [Thomas] in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character. If you find that the evidence of other wrongs is true and that [Thomas] committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves that [R.I.’s] will was overcome by fear and may explain her lack of resistance to the sexual assault. Therefore, evidence that may or may not be relevant regarding the element of force, that’s an essential element of the charge of Rape that you will have further instructions on when we get to that point in the trial. So that evidence can not be considered by you for any other purpose. Thomas dismisses the trial court’s limiting instruction as ineffective, with no argument or authority offered in support of this conclusion. Contrary to Thomas’s position, the trial court properly gave a limiting instruction, and “[i]t is presumed that the jury followed the instructions of the court.” State v. Williams, 73 Ohio St.3d 153, 159, 652 N.E.2d 821 (1995), citing State v. Murphy, 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 584, 605 N.E.2d 884 (1992). Considering the record, the trial court properly considered the relevance of proffered evidence, as well as the purpose for which the state sought to introduce that evidence, and weighed the probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice. In admitting some of that evidence, the trial court also cautioned the jury regarding the limited purpose for which they might consider that evidence. Therefore, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence of prior acts, pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), and Thomas’s first assignment of error is not well-taken.\"\n}\n```"}

Pursuant to Crim.R. 44(A) and (C), a defendant, 'after being fully advised of his right to assigned counsel, [may] knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive * * * his right to counsel. * * * Waiver of counsel shall be in open court and the advice and waiver shall be recorded as provided in Rule 22. In addition, in serious offense cases the waiver shall be in writing.' However, 'courts are to indulge in every reasonable presumption against the waiver of * * * the right to be represented by counsel.' State v. Dyer, 117 Ohio App.3d 92, 95, 689 N.E.2d 1034 (2d Dist.1996). For a waiver of counsel to be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, it'must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter.' Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948). In the case at hand, Suells made it clear to the court throughout these proceedings that, although he knew he was not a lawyer, he wanted to represent himself and he wanted a trial. The court — in painstaking detail at times — made it clear to Suells that, although defending himself was his right, 'I can only give you my most strongest [sic] opinion on how foolish that would be.' At his court proceeding on June 21, 2018, Suells reiterated that he wanted to represent himself. At that time, he was being represented by his second court-appointed attorney, and the court asked him, 'Are you still on board with Mr. Schlachet representing you?' Suells replied, 'No, I want to be my own lawyer.' The court reviewed the written waiver of counsel with Suells at this proceeding. The court and defense counsel also discussed the sexually violent predator specifications that Suells was charged with and how convictions of these specifications result in life imprisonment. Suells’s attorney at the time gave him a copy of the Ohio Revised Code, the Ohio Jury instruction, and case annotations on sexually violent predator specifications. The court also reviewed the alternative of a plea bargain with Suells, although Suells told the court that a 'plea bargain is out of the question * * *.' The court nonetheless informed Suells of this option, stating that he was facing 'a very lengthy prison sentence,' and a plea bargain would likely result in 'lesser prison time.' The court held another hearing on the record on July 26, 2018, at which Suells was represented by his third attorney. Suells continued to maintain that he wanted to represent himself, although he had not yet sign the written waiver of counsel. Another hearing was held on August 2, 2018, to 'formalize for the record' Suells’s intent to waive his right to counsel and proceed pro se. The court reviewed the written waiver with Suells again. The court asked Suells if he had any questions about what constitutional rights he was giving up. Suells replied, 'No, I do not.' The court reviewed Suells’s indictment, including each charge, the degree of each felony, and each specification. The court particularly focused on the sexually violent predator specifications, each of which included a 'life tail' of imprisonment with the court making 'a determination as to the eligibility of parole. It could be ten, 20, 30, 40 years to life at this point in time.' The court, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney explained to Suells that the sexually violent predator specifications would have to run consecutively, but the prison sentences for convictions of other offenses could be run consecutively or concurrently, at the court’s discretion. The court explained that some of the counts, particularly kidnapping, could merge for sentencing, but that other counts, particularly having a weapon while under disability, would not merge for sentencing. The court also talked about the three-year sentence for the firearm specifications running consecutive and prior to the underlying sentences, using the following example: 'Let’s just assume for the sake of argument that he’s found guilty on Count 1 alone as it was indicted. So am I to understand that it would be a — the sentence would be 13 to life?' The state and defense attorney agreed that this was correct. The court explained the sexual motivation specification and how, if Suells was found guilty of this, it would require sexual offender'reporting' upon his potential release from prison. The court continued to explain the charges and sentencing to Suells: 'Counts 1, 3, and 6 are all counts of rape and they are all punishable by a potential term of incarceration of ten to life, but with the three-year firearm specification, you have to serve three years prior to and consecutive to the imposition of that ten to life sentence which would effectively be 13 to life.' The court then explained the details about the kidnapping charges in Counts 2, 4, and 7; the weapons charges in Counts 5 and 10; and the aggravated burglary charges in Counts 8 and 9. The court concluded that Suells was facing a maximum stated sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility after 92 years. The court explained that, if Suells represented himself at trial, he was entitled to have'standby' or advisory counsel, but that Ohio law prohibited hybrid representation. The court inquired into whether Suells was aware of the 'facts and evidence that the State intends to introduce at trial' and made sure that Suells had received the state’s discovery materials. The court also reviewed with Suells the 'beyond a reasonable doubt' burden of proof under which the state must present its case against him. The court next reviewed with Suells the 'potential legal defenses' that he may raise on his behalf, and the court instructed Suells that it was his burden to raise these defenses should they apply. The court detailed the following: failure to produce evidence; impeachment testimony; motions to suppress (both evidence and statements); state and federal constitutional violations; motions in limine; affirmative defenses, including self-defense, alibi, and speedy trial; motions to dismiss; and suppression of evidence. The court also reviewed with Suells that he would be responsible, just as an attorney would be, for complying with the rules of evidence and criminal procedure. The court accepted the written waiver of counsel that Suells signed and reminded him that his trial was set for August 13, 2018. At Suells’s request, the court authorized funds for a defense investigator and, to the extent of its authority, made 'the appropriate advisement' that Suells could use the jail’s law library to prepare for his case. In reviewing waivers of counsel at the trial-court level, this court has held the following: 'Although there is no prescribed colloquy in which the trial court and a pro se defendant must engage before a defendant may waive his right to counsel, the court must ensure that the defendant is voluntarily electing to proceed pro se and that the defendant is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waiving the right to counsel. Given the presumption against waiving a constitutional right, the trial court must ensure the defendant is aware of 'the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation' and that he is making the decision with his 'eyes open.' (Citation omitted.) State v. Buchanon, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 80098, 2003-Ohio-6851, ¶ 16. See also State v. Gibson, 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 378, 345 N.E.2d 399 (1976) (holding the following regarding waiver of counsel: 'And while, in retrospection we may question the wisdom of such a decision, as indeed the defendant has, we are satisfied that it was validly made. The trial court conducted a complete inquiry which did comport with the accepted standards of laying a foundation to accept a waiver of counsel and the defendant knowingly and intelligently exercised his rights'). In the instant case, the court held multiple hearings regarding Suells’s request to represent himself at trial. The court appointed a series of three defense attorneys and urged Suells, repeatedly, to allow one of these attorneys to represent him, cautioning Suells of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. For example, the court stated the following to Suells: 'I know I shared this with you last time, you wouldn’t be your own dentist, pull your own tooth. You wouldn’t be your own surgeon to take care of a health issue. You go to the expert to do that for you. So while you may think that you and only you would be in the best position to represent yourself, again, all I can do — and I think I have the obligation to suggest to you in the strongest way possible that that’s a terrible idea; but if that’s what you choose to do, I can’t stop you from doing it.' Upon review, we find that Suells unambiguously asserted his right to self-representation. The record shows that Suells was literate, competent, and acting under his own free will. The court complied with its duty to inform Suells about, and inquire into Suells’s understanding of, the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses, the potential penalties, and the possible defenses. Suells has failed to show that his waiver of counsel was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made. Accordingly, the court did not err in granting Suells’s request to represent himself at trial, and his first assigned error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

At that time, he was being represented by his second court-appointed attorney, and the court asked him, 'Are you still on board with Mr. Schlachet representing you?' Suells replied, 'No, I want to be my own lawyer.' The court reviewed the written waiver of counsel with Suells at this proceeding. The court and defense counsel also discussed the sexually violent predator specifications that Suells was charged with and how convictions of these specifications result in life imprisonment. Suells’s attorney at the time gave him a copy of the Ohio Revised Code, the Ohio Jury instruction, and case annotations on sexually violent predator specifications. The court also reviewed the alternative of a plea bargain with Suells, although Suells told the court that a 'plea bargain is out of the question * * *.' The court nonetheless informed Suells of this option, stating that he was facing 'a very lengthy prison sentence,' and a plea bargain would likely result in 'lesser prison time.' The court held another hearing on the record on July 26, 2018, at which Suells was represented by his third attorney. Suells continued to maintain that he wanted to represent himself, although he had not yet sign the written waiver of counsel. Another hearing was held on August 2, 2018, to 'formalize for the record' Suells’s intent to waive his right to counsel and proceed pro se. The court reviewed the written waiver with Suells again. The court asked Suells if he had any questions about what constitutional rights he was giving up. Suells replied, 'No, I do not.' The court reviewed Suells’s indictment, including each charge, the degree of each felony, and each specification. The court particularly focused on the sexually violent predator specifications, each of which included a 'life tail' of imprisonment with the court making 'a determination as to the eligibility of parole. It could be ten, 20, 30, 40 years to life at this point in time.' The court, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney explained to Suells that the sexually violent predator specifications would have to run consecutively, but the prison sentences for convictions of other offenses could be run consecutively or concurrently, at the court’s discretion. The court explained that some of the counts, particularly kidnapping, could merge for sentencing, but that other counts, particularly having a weapon while under disability, would not merge for sentencing. The court also talked about the three-year sentence for the firearm specifications running consecutive and prior to the underlying sentences, using the following example: 'Let’s just assume for the sake of argument that he’s found guilty on Count 1 alone as it was indicted. So am I to understand that it would be a — the sentence would be 13 to life?' The state and defense attorney agreed that this was correct. The court explained the sexual motivation specification and how, if Suells was found guilty of this, it would require sexual offender'reporting' upon his potential release from prison. The court continued to explain the charges and sentencing to Suells: 'Counts 1, 3, and 6 are all counts of rape and they are all punishable by a potential term of incarceration of ten to life, but with the three-year firearm specification, you have to serve three years prior to and consecutive to the imposition of that ten to life sentence which would effectively be 13 to life.' The court then explained the details about the kidnapping charges in Counts 2, 4, and 7; the weapons charges in Counts 5 and 10; and the aggravated burglary charges in Counts 8 and 9. The court concluded that Suells was facing a maximum stated sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility after 92 years. The court explained that, if Suells represented himself at trial, he was entitled to have'standby' or advisory counsel, but that Ohio law prohibited hybrid representation. The court inquired into whether Suells was aware of the 'facts and evidence that the State intends to introduce at trial' and made sure that Suells had received the state’s discovery materials. The court also reviewed with Suells the 'beyond a reasonable doubt' burden of proof under which the state must present its case against him. The court next reviewed with Suells the 'potential legal defenses' that he may raise on his behalf, and the court instructed Suells that it was his burden to raise these defenses should they apply. The court detailed the following: failure to produce evidence; impeachment testimony; motions to suppress (both evidence and statements); state and federal constitutional violations; motions in limine; affirmative defenses, including self-defense, alibi, and speedy trial; motions to dismiss; and suppression of evidence. The court also reviewed with Suells that he would be responsible, just as an attorney would be, for complying with the rules of evidence and criminal procedure. The court accepted the written waiver of counsel that Suells signed and reminded him that his trial was set for August 13, 2018. At Suells’s request, the court authorized funds for a defense investigator and, to the extent of its authority, made 'the appropriate advisement' that Suells could use the jail’s law library to prepare for his case. In reviewing waivers of counsel at the trial-court level, this court has held the following: 'Although there is no prescribed colloquy in which the trial court and a pro se defendant must engage before a defendant may waive his right to counsel, the court must ensure that the defendant is voluntarily electing to proceed pro se and that the defendant is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waiving the right to counsel. Given the presumption against waiving a constitutional right, the trial court must ensure the defendant is aware of 'the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation' and that he is making the decision with his 'eyes open.' (Citation omitted.) State v. Buchanon, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 80098, 2003-Ohio-6851, ¶ 16. See also State v. Gibson, 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 378, 345 N.E.2d 399 (1976) (holding the following regarding waiver of counsel: 'And while, in retrospection we may question the wisdom of such a decision, as indeed the defendant has, we are satisfied that it was validly made. The trial court conducted a complete inquiry which did comport with the accepted standards of laying a foundation to accept a waiver of counsel and the defendant knowingly and intelligently exercised his rights'). In the instant case, the court held multiple hearings regarding Suells’s request to represent himself at trial. The court appointed a series of three defense attorneys and urged Suells, repeatedly, to allow one of these attorneys to represent him, cautioning Suells of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. For example, the court stated the following to Suells: 'I know I shared this with you last time, you wouldn’t be your own dentist, pull your own tooth. You wouldn’t be your own surgeon to take care of a health issue. You go to the expert to do that for you. So while you may think that you and only you would be in the best position to represent yourself, again, all I can do — and I think I have the obligation to suggest to you in the strongest way possible that that’s a terrible idea; but if that’s what you choose to do, I can’t stop you from doing it.' Upon review, we find that Suells unambiguously asserted his right to self-representation. The record shows that Suells was literate, competent, and acting under his own free will. The court complied with its duty to inform Suells about, and inquire into Suells’s understanding of, the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses, the potential penalties, and the possible defenses. Suells has failed to show that his waiver of counsel was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made. Accordingly, the court did not err in granting Suells’s request to represent himself at trial, and his first assigned error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Pursuant to Crim.R. 44(A) and (C), a defendant, 'after being fully advised of his right to assigned counsel, [may] knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive * * * his right to counsel. * * * Waiver of counsel shall be in open court and the advice and waiver shall be recorded as provided in Rule 22.

For a waiver of counsel to be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, it'must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter.'
