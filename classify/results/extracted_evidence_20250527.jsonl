Pursuant to Crim.R. 44(A) and (C), a defendant, 'after being fully advised of his right to assigned counsel, [may] knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive * * * his right to counsel. * * * Waiver of counsel shall be in open court and the advice and waiver shall be recorded as provided in Rule 22. In addition, in serious offense cases the waiver shall be in writing.' However, 'courts are to indulge in every reasonable presumption against the waiver of * * * the right to be represented by counsel.' State v. Dyer, 117 Ohio App.3d 92, 95, 689 N.E.2d 1034 (2d Dist.1996). For a waiver of counsel to be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, it'must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter.' Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948). In the case at hand, Suells made it clear to the court throughout these proceedings that, although he knew he was not a lawyer, he wanted to represent himself and he wanted a trial. The court — in painstaking detail at times — made it clear to Suells that, although defending himself was his right, 'I can only give you my most strongest [sic] opinion on how foolish that would be.' At his court proceeding on June 21, 2018, Suells reiterated that he wanted to represent himself. At that time, he was being represented by his second court-appointed attorney, and the court asked him, 'Are you still on board with Mr. Schlachet representing you?' Suells replied, 'No, I want to be my own lawyer.' The court reviewed the written waiver of counsel with Suells at this proceeding. The court and defense counsel also discussed the sexually violent predator specifications that Suells was charged with and how convictions of these specifications result in life imprisonment. Suells’s attorney at the time gave him a copy of the Ohio Revised Code, the Ohio Jury instruction, and case annotations on sexually violent predator specifications. The court also reviewed the alternative of a plea bargain with Suells, although Suells told the court that a 'plea bargain is out of the question * * *.' The court nonetheless informed Suells of this option, stating that he was facing 'a very lengthy prison sentence,' and a plea bargain would likely result in 'lesser prison time.' The court held another hearing on the record on July 26, 2018, at which Suells was represented by his third attorney. Suells continued to maintain that he wanted to represent himself, although he had not yet sign the written waiver of counsel. Another hearing was held on August 2, 2018, to 'formalize for the record' Suells’s intent to waive his right to counsel and proceed pro se. The court reviewed the written waiver with Suells again. The court asked Suells if he had any questions about what constitutional rights he was giving up. Suells replied, 'No, I do not.' The court reviewed Suells’s indictment, including each charge, the degree of each felony, and each specification. The court particularly focused on the sexually violent predator specifications, each of which included a 'life tail' of imprisonment with the court making 'a determination as to the eligibility of parole. It could be ten, 20, 30, 40 years to life at this point in time.' The court, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney explained to Suells that the sexually violent predator specifications would have to run consecutively, but the prison sentences for convictions of other offenses could be run consecutively or concurrently, at the court’s discretion. The court explained that some of the counts, particularly kidnapping, could merge for sentencing, but that other counts, particularly having a weapon while under disability, would not merge for sentencing. The court also talked about the three-year sentence for the firearm specifications running consecutive and prior to the underlying sentences, using the following example: 'Let’s just assume for the sake of argument that he’s found guilty on Count 1 alone as it was indicted. So am I to understand that it would be a — the sentence would be 13 to life?' The state and defense attorney agreed that this was correct. The court explained the sexual motivation specification and how, if Suells was found guilty of this, it would require sexual offender'reporting' upon his potential release from prison. The court continued to explain the charges and sentencing to Suells: 'Counts 1, 3, and 6 are all counts of rape and they are all punishable by a potential term of incarceration of ten to life, but with the three-year firearm specification, you have to serve three years prior to and consecutive to the imposition of that ten to life sentence which would effectively be 13 to life.' The court then explained the details about the kidnapping charges in Counts 2, 4, and 7; the weapons charges in Counts 5 and 10; and the aggravated burglary charges in Counts 8 and 9. The court concluded that Suells was facing a maximum stated sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility after 92 years. The court explained that, if Suells represented himself at trial, he was entitled to have'standby' or advisory counsel, but that Ohio law prohibited hybrid representation. The court inquired into whether Suells was aware of the 'facts and evidence that the State intends to introduce at trial' and made sure that Suells had received the state’s discovery materials. The court also reviewed with Suells the 'beyond a reasonable doubt' burden of proof under which the state must present its case against him. The court next reviewed with Suells the 'potential legal defenses' that he may raise on his behalf, and the court instructed Suells that it was his burden to raise these defenses should they apply. The court detailed the following: failure to produce evidence; impeachment testimony; motions to suppress (both evidence and statements); state and federal constitutional violations; motions in limine; affirmative defenses, including self-defense, alibi, and speedy trial; motions to dismiss; and suppression of evidence. The court also reviewed with Suells that he would be responsible, just as an attorney would be, for complying with the rules of evidence and criminal procedure. The court accepted the written waiver of counsel that Suells signed and reminded him that his trial was set for August 13, 2018. At Suells’s request, the court authorized funds for a defense investigator and, to the extent of its authority, made 'the appropriate advisement' that Suells could use the jail’s law library to prepare for his case. In reviewing waivers of counsel at the trial-court level, this court has held the following: 'Although there is no prescribed colloquy in which the trial court and a pro se defendant must engage before a defendant may waive his right to counsel, the court must ensure that the defendant is voluntarily electing to proceed pro se and that the defendant is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waiving the right to counsel. Given the presumption against waiving a constitutional right, the trial court must ensure the defendant is aware of 'the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation' and that he is making the decision with his 'eyes open.' (Citation omitted.) State v. Buchanon, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 80098, 2003-Ohio-6851, ¶ 16. See also State v. Gibson, 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 378, 345 N.E.2d 399 (1976) (holding the following regarding waiver of counsel: 'And while, in retrospection we may question the wisdom of such a decision, as indeed the defendant has, we are satisfied that it was validly made. The trial court conducted a complete inquiry which did comport with the accepted standards of laying a foundation to accept a waiver of counsel and the defendant knowingly and intelligently exercised his rights'). In the instant case, the court held multiple hearings regarding Suells’s request to represent himself at trial. The court appointed a series of three defense attorneys and urged Suells, repeatedly, to allow one of these attorneys to represent him, cautioning Suells of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. For example, the court stated the following to Suells: 'I know I shared this with you last time, you wouldn’t be your own dentist, pull your own tooth. You wouldn’t be your own surgeon to take care of a health issue. You go to the expert to do that for you. So while you may think that you and only you would be in the best position to represent yourself, again, all I can do — and I think I have the obligation to suggest to you in the strongest way possible that that’s a terrible idea; but if that’s what you choose to do, I can’t stop you from doing it.' Upon review, we find that Suells unambiguously asserted his right to self-representation. The record shows that Suells was literate, competent, and acting under his own free will. The court complied with its duty to inform Suells about, and inquire into Suells’s understanding of, the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses, the potential penalties, and the possible defenses. Suells has failed to show that his waiver of counsel was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made. Accordingly, the court did not err in granting Suells’s request to represent himself at trial, and his first assigned error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

In State v.

The court is not bound to exclude such material at trial although it may do so at its option.’ Reversible error exists only where the exercise of such authority by the trial court constitutes an abuse of discretion. *Parson*, at 445, 453 N.E.2d 689; *State v.

The same tripartite test applies for determining whether a trial court has abused its discretion in admitting other evidence that was not properly disclosed under Crim.R. 16. *State v. Scudder*, 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 269, 21994-Ohio-298, 643 N.E.2d 524(1994).\\n\\nAn abuse of discretion can be found where the reasons given by the court for its action are clearly untenable, legally incorrect, or amount to a denial of justice, or where the judgment reaches an end or purpose not justified by reason and the evidence. *Tennant v.

When a trial court fails to rule upon a motion, it is presumed the trial court overruled such motion. *State ex rel. The V Companies v.

Tuscarawas No. 97AP090058, 1999 WL 174925 (Mar. 18, 1999). In light of this presumption, we find Shanklin’s motion was overruled by the trial court.\\n\\nIn his Motion to Dismiss filed in the trial court on March 30, 2018, Shanklin alleged that trial was scheduled to begin on April 4, 2018. He further noted that the state had provided additional discovery on: March 19, 2018 of the 9-1-1 recordings made on June 22, 2017; on March 20, 2018 two CD’s of video evidence collected in June 2017; on March 27, 2018 a CD of coroner photos and a CD of the video interviews of Tullis White, Ronald Shanklin, Norman Randolph, Eric Thomsen, Courtney Burns and Anthony Brewton [See, Docket No. 64]; on March 28, 2018 the BCI lab reports concerning the Sig Sauer [See, Docket Number 65]; and on March 30, 2018 jail call records.

See, Motion to Dismiss, filed March 30, 2018 [Docket Number 68].\\n\\n{¶46} The state provides no explanation for the delay in providing this evidence to the defense, in some cases less than one week before trial, when at least some of the evidence had been collected at or near the time of the crime in June 2017.\\n\\n{¶47} Nothing in the record affirmatively shows that the discovery violations here were willful, as opposed to unintentional. It does not appear from the record before us, and Shanklin does not elucidate how foreknowledge of any of the evidence would have benefited his defense. It does not appear, and Shanklin does not specifically argue any prejudice ensuing from the late disclosure. In State v. Darmond, the Ohio Supreme Court noted,\\n\\nAlthough we are not mandating a specific procedural course of conduct in this case, we note that rather than dismissing the case with prejudice, the trial court could have continued the case to allow further inquiry into the details regarding the other packages. See Lakewood, 32 Ohio St.3d at 5, 511 N.E.2d 1138 (a continuance should be ordered if it is feasible and would allow for an opportunity to minimize any surprise or prejudice caused by the discovery violation). This was a bench trial, and the defendants were out on bond. Clearly, a continuance to clear up the facts of the discovery violation would have been a feasible alternative.\\n\\n135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, 986 N.E.2d 971, ¶40.\\n\\n{¶48} Although this was a jury trial and Shanklin was incarcerated at the time, a short continuance to allow the defense time to review the discovery would not have been unreasonable; however, Shanklin never requested a continuance. ‘Instead he asked for the most stringent option—total exclusion of the testimony. In the absence of a motion for a continuance, * * * the trial court properly concluded that defense counsel was prepared to go forward at that time. * * *’ Edwards, supra, 49 Ohio St.3d at 43, 3 O.O.3d at 24–25, 358 N.E.2d at 1060.” State v. Finnerty, 45 Ohio St.3d 104, 108, 543 N.E.2d 1233(1989).\\n\\n{¶49} Contrary to Shanklin’s contentions, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling his motion to dismiss.\\n\\n{¶50} Accordingly, Shanklin’s First Assignment of Error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

APPELLANT WAS DENIED HIS SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL DUE TO COUNSEL’S FAILURE TO ADDRESS HIS MENTAL HEALTH/ COMPETENCY ISSUES.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"In his First Assignment of Error, Shanklin argues that the trial court erred by overruling his motion to dismiss based upon the state’s discovery violations. Specifically, Shanklin contends, ‘Mr. Shanklin filed a Motion to Dismiss on March 30, 2018, based on the State’s numerous discovery violations pursuant to Crim.R. 16. (Appendix, hereinafter, 'App.' F). The underlying theme is that the State provided the discovery piecemeal to the defense and the defense was concerned that they were not getting all of the evidence.’ (Appellant’s Brief at 15).\\n\\nSTANDARD OF APPELLATE REVIEW.\\n\\nCrim.R. 16(E)(3) vests in the trial court the discretion to determine the appropriate response for failure of a party to disclose material subject to a valid discovery request. In State v. Parson, 6 Ohio St.3d 442, 445, 453 N.E.2d 689, 691(1983), the Court observed that, under such circumstances, ‘the trial court is vested with a certain amount of discretion in determining the sanction to be imposed for a party’s nondisclosure of discoverable material. The court is not bound to exclude such material at trial although it may do so at its option.’ Reversible error exists only where the exercise of such authority by the trial court constitutes an abuse of discretion. *Parson*, at 445, 453 N.E.2d 689; *State v. Apanovitch*, 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 26, 514 N.E.2d 394, 402(1987).\\n\\nIn *Parson*, a tripartite test was set forth to determine whether a trial court abused its discretion in admitting undisclosed discoverable evidence. The syllabus to *Parson* provides as follows:\\n\\nWhere, in a criminal trial, the prosecution fails to comply with Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(a)(ii) by informing the accused of an oral statement made by a co-defendant to a law enforcement officer, and the record does not demonstrate (1) that the prosecution’s failure to disclose was a willful violation of Crim.R. 16, (2) that foreknowledge of the statement would have benefited the accused in the preparation of his defense, or (3) that the accused was prejudiced by admission of the statement, the trial court does not abuse its discretion under Crim.R. 16(E)(3) by permitting such evidence to be admitted. *See, also, State v. Heinish* (1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 231, 553 N.E.2d 1026.\\n\\n*See also, State v. Wiles*, 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 79, 571 N.E.2d 97(1991). The same tripartite test applies for determining whether a trial court has abused its discretion in admitting other evidence that was not properly disclosed under Crim.R. 16. *State v. Scudder*, 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 269, 21994-Ohio-298, 643 N.E.2d 524(1994).\\n\\nAn abuse of discretion can be found where the reasons given by the court for its action are clearly untenable, legally incorrect, or amount to a denial of justice, or where the judgment reaches an end or purpose not justified by reason and the evidence. *Tennant v. Gallick*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26827, 2014-Ohio-477, ¶35; *In re Guardianship of S.H.*, 9th Dist. Medina No. 13CA0066–M, 2013–Ohio–4380, ¶ 9; *State v. Firouzmandi*, 5th Dist. Licking No.2006–CA–41, 2006–Ohio–5823, ¶54.\\n\\n**ISSUE FOR APPEAL**\\n\\n*Whether the trial court abused its discretion by overruling Shanklin’s motion to dismiss.*\\n\\nAs the state correctly notes, the trial court never ruled on Shanklin’s motion. When a trial court fails to rule upon a motion, it is presumed the trial court overruled such motion. *State ex rel. The V Companies v. Marshall*, 81 Ohio St.3d 467, 469, 692 N.E.2d 198(1998); *Newman v. Al Castrucci Ford Sales, Inc.*, 54 Ohio App.3d 166, 561 N.E.2d 1001(1988), par. 4 of the syllabus; *State v. Pincheck*, 5th Dist.
