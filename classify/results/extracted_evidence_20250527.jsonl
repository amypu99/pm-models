{"index": "132-Pennington", "allegation_num": "allegation_5", "allegation": "Cumulative Error", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"In his first assignment of error, Pennington argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. To prevail on an ineffective-assistance claim, an appellant must demonstrate that: (1) counsel’s performance was deficient, and (2) counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); *State v. Bradley*, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 141-142, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).\\n\\nIn reviewing defense counsel’s performance, we must remain highly deferential. *Strickland* at 689. We must “recognize that counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.” *Id.* at 690.\\n\\nAn appellant’s demonstration that counsel’s performance was deficient does not warrant the reversal of a conviction if counsel’s error had no effect on the judgment. *Id.* at 691; *Bradley* at 142. The appellant must affirmatively demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s deficient performance, the result of the trial would have been different. *Strickland* at 693-694; *Bradley* at 143.\\n\\n{¶34} **A. Failure to hire a forensic pathology expert.** Pennington first asserts that defense counsel’s performance was deficient because counsel failed to request funds for or hire a forensic pathology expert to contradict the opinion of the state’s forensic pathology expert, Dr. Stephens.\\n\\n{¶35} Generally, the decision whether to call any witness “falls within the rubric of trial strategy and will not be second-guessed by a reviewing court.” *State v. Treesh*, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 490, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001). A decision by defense counsel not to call an expert witness and instead rely on cross-examination of the state’s expert is generally a matter of trial strategy and does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Hunter*, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 66; *State v. Mundt*, 115 Ohio St.3d 22, 2007-Ohio-4836, 873 N.E.2d 828, ¶ 118; *State v. McHenry*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170671, 2018-Ohio-3383, ¶ 25.\\n\\n{¶36} Here, trial counsel conducted a thorough and rigorous cross-examination of the state’s expert, attacking her opinion that the manner of death was homicide, and leading her to concede that there was a chance, albeit slim, that the victim had shot herself. We conclude that defense counsel’s decision not to hire or call a forensic pathology expert fell “within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.” *See State v. Thompson*, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, 23 N.E.3d 1096, ¶ 244, quoting *Strickland*, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.\\n\\n{¶37} Pennington directs us to *Hinton v. Alabama*, 571 U.S. 263, 274-275, 134 S.Ct. 1081, 188 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014), where the United States Supreme Court held that trial counsel had rendered deficient performance by employing an expert he knew to be inadequate because he failed to understand the resources that state law made available to him. However, *Hinton* involved a postconviction proceeding where the defendant produced evidence outside the trial record, including the affidavits of three experts who had reached different conclusions than the state’s experts. See id. at 270.\\n\\n{¶38} In this case, on the other hand, Pennington cannot establish prejudice based on the record before us. Resolving this issue in Pennington’s favor would be purely speculative. See State v. Madrigal, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 390, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000). Nothing in the record indicates that testimony from another forensic pathologist would have been favorable to Pennington and would have altered the outcome of the trial. See id. at 390-391; Mundt at ¶ 118; State v. Jeffries, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170182, 2018-Ohio-2160, ¶ 78-79. “Establishing that would require proof outside the record, such as affidavits demonstrating the probable testimony. Such a claim is not appropriately considered on a direct appeal.” Madrigal at 391. Therefore, even assuming that counsel’s failure to obtain a forensic pathology expert was deficient, Pennington has failed to demonstrate any resulting prejudice.\\n\\n{¶39} B. Failure to discover that the handgun model was defective. Pennington also argues that counsel should have discovered that the model of handgun that caused Herald’s injuries, a Taurus PT111 Millennium, was defective and had been the subject of a Florida class-action lawsuit that alleged defects with the handgun’s firing. He asserts that information regarding the defects in the Taurus handguns was “widely publicized,” citing a court order that approved a class-action settlement in the Florida case. See Carter v. Forjas Taurus S.A., S.D.Fla. No. 1:13-CV-24583-PAS, 2016 WL 3982489 (July 22, 2016). He acknowledges, however, that the court order in the Florida case was not made part of the record in this case. As we have stated, we are unable to determine on appeal whether ineffective assistance of counsel occurred where the allegations of ineffectiveness are based on facts not appearing in the record. See State v. Cooperrider, 4 Ohio St.3d 226, 228, 448 C. Failure to subpoena the victim’s mother. Pennington contends that defense counsel should have subpoenaed Herald’s mother to testify at trial because she had made statements that caused the police to investigate the possibility that Herald had previously attempted suicide.\\n\\nWe will not second-guess counsel’s decision not to call any witness because that is a matter squarely within the ambit of trial strategy. See Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d at 490, 739 N.E.2d 749. It is possible that defense counsel interviewed Herald’s mother and decided that her testimony would not be favorable to Pennington. Moreover, although Pennington claims that testimony by Herald’s mother may have been favorable to his defense, there is nothing in the record to support that assertion. Therefore, we cannot say that Pennington was prejudiced by counsel’s decision not to call Herald’s mother as a witness. And we note that defense counsel was able to get into evidence the officer’s testimony about a possible prior suicide attempt.\\n\\nD. Failure to advise a pretrial guilty plea to the weapons-under-disability count. Finally, Pennington contends that trial counsel should have advised him to enter a guilty plea to the weapons charge prior to trial to prevent the state from introducing into evidence the shotgun, shotgun shells, and certain ammunition that was not compatible with the shotgun or with the handgun that caused Herald’s injuries. He claims that the evidence was relevant only to the weapons charge and would not have been admissible at trial if he had entered the plea beforehand.\\n\\nPennington has not demonstrated that counsel’s performance was deficient, or that but for counsel’s deficient performance, the result of the bench trial would have been different.\"\n}\n```"}

{"index": "137-Richey", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED DEFENDANT-APPELLANT'S CRIMINAL RULE 29 MOTION FOR ACQUITTAL.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"In his first assignment of error, appellant asserts the trial court erred in denying his motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29. A motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29 attacks the sufficiency of the evidence. Therefore, in reviewing whether the trial court erred in denying a motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29, we apply the same standard used to review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Sufficiency of the evidence is a legal standard that tests whether the evidence is adequate to sustain a verdict as a matter of law. In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must determine 'whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.' Where the evidence, 'if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,' it is sufficient to sustain a conviction. 'The testimony of a single witness, if believed by the finder of fact, is sufficient to support a criminal conviction.' With regard to the firearm specifications attached to each charge except for the charge of having weapons while under disability, appellant argues the state did not present sufficient evidence to support the specifications because 'the police did not find a firearm on [appellant] or anywhere in the house where he was living [and] [n]o gun was admitted into evidence.' J.H. testified appellant pointed his gun at and shot Flannery. Carroll testified appellant stated he was 'about to shoot' Flannery; immediately after, Carroll heard a bang. Based on this testimony, there was sufficient evidence to support the firearm specifications. Appellant contends the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to convict him of kidnapping, aggravated robbery, aggravated murder, murder, and having weapons while under disability. With the exception of the firearm specifications, as previously discussed, appellant does not provide separate arguments, with citation to either the record or caselaw, in support of his contention that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence. Instead, appellant makes a consolidated argument challenging the witnesses' credibility. Specifically, appellant argues there were no independent eyewitnesses who identified him as the shooter, there was no physical evidence at the crime scene tying him to the incident, and '[t]he only evidence that links [appellant] to these crimes is the testimony of his alleged co-defendants, who each got significant deals from the state by testifying.' Thus, although appellant frames his assignment of error in terms of sufficiency of the evidence, appellant's contentions actually address the manifest weight of the evidence. Therefore, appellant's arguments regarding the credibility of the witnesses are more appropriately considered in our analysis of his second assignment of error. Nevertheless, we examine whether appellant's convictions for kidnapping, aggravated robbery, aggravated murder, murder, and having weapons while under disability were supported by sufficient evidence. Pursuant to R.C. 2905.01, a person is guilty of kidnapping if the person 'by force, threat, or deception * * * remove[d] another from the place where the other person is found or restrain[ed] the liberty of the other person' for the purpose of 'facilitat[ed] the commission of any felony.' Here, J.H. testified appellant restrained Flannery's liberty by pointing a gun at him and ordering him to move to the backyard. Carroll also testified appellant ordered Flannery to move to the backyard. Based on the testimony at trial, we find appellant's conviction for kidnapping was supported by sufficient evidence. Pursuant to R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), a person is guilty of aggravated robbery if the person 'in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense [had] a deadly weapon on or about the offender's person or under the offender's control and either display[ed] the weapon, brandish[ed] it, indicate[d] that the offender possesse[d] it, or use[d] it.' Pursuant to R.C. 2913.01(K)(1), 'theft offense' includes a violation of R.C. 2913.02, namely theft. R.C. 2913.02 provides that a person is guilty of theft when the person 'with purpose to deprive the owner of property or services, * * * knowingly obtain[ed] or exert[ed] control over either the property or services * * * [w]ithout the consent of the owner or person authorized to give consent.' 'Deadly weapon' is defined in R.C. 2923.11 as 'any instrument, device, or thing capable of inflicting death, and designed or specially adapted for use as a weapon, or possessed, carried, or used as a weapon.' Here, J.H. testified appellant pointed a gun at Flannery and demanded Flannery step off the porch. Carroll testified he and appellant planned to rob a pizza delivery driver. According to Carroll, appellant told Flannery, 'You know what time it is,' which, according to Carroll, meant this was a robbery. Carroll testified he took money from Flannery, while J.H. took the pizzas. Based on the testimony at trial, we find appellant's conviction for aggravated robbery was supported by sufficient evidence. R.C. 2903.01 provides in pertinent part that a person is guilty of murder if that person 'purposely cause[d] the death of another *** while committing or attempting to commit, or while fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit, kidnapping [or] aggravated robbery.' Pursuant to R.C. 2903.02, a person is guilty of murder if the person 'purposely cause[d] the death of another.' J.H. testified he witnessed appellant shoot Flannery after holding him at gunpoint. Carroll testified appellant told him, 'Watch out, Cuz. I'm about to shoot him.' Carroll moved out of the way and then heard a bang. This testimony, when considered in conjunction with the testimony relating to kidnapping and aggravated robbery, was sufficient to support appellant's conviction for aggravated murder and murder. R.C. 2923.13 provides, in pertinent part, that unless relieved from disability, 'no person shall knowingly acquire, have, carry, or use any firearm or dangerous ordnance, if *** [t]he person *** has been convicted of any felony offense of violence or has been adjudicated a delinquent child for the commission of an offense that, if committed by an adult, would have been a felony offense of violence.' Here, appellant stipulated to his prior record for purposes of the charge of having weapons while under disability. Based on this stipulation combined with the evidence presented at trial, we find sufficient evidence supported appellant’s conviction for having weapons while under disability. Therefore, having found the state presented sufficient evidence to support appellant’s convictions, we overrule appellant’s first assignment of error.\"\n}\n```"}

A motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29 attacks the sufficiency of the evidence. Therefore, in reviewing whether the trial court erred in denying a motion for acquittal under Crim.R. 29, we apply the same standard used to review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Sufficiency of the evidence is a legal standard that tests whether the evidence is adequate to sustain a verdict as a matter of law. In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must determine 'whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.' Where the evidence, 'if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,' it is sufficient to sustain a conviction. 'The testimony of a single witness, if believed by the finder of fact, is sufficient to support a criminal conviction.' With regard to the firearm specifications attached to each charge except for the charge of having weapons while under disability, appellant argues the state did not present sufficient evidence to support the specifications because 'the police did not find a firearm on [appellant] or anywhere in the house where he was living [and] [n]o gun was admitted into evidence.' J.H. testified appellant pointed his gun at and shot Flannery. Carroll testified appellant stated he was 'about to shoot' Flannery; immediately after, Carroll heard a bang. Based on this testimony, there was sufficient evidence to support the firearm specifications. Appellant contends the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to convict him of kidnapping, aggravated robbery, aggravated murder, murder, and having weapons while under disability. With the exception of the firearm specifications, as previously discussed, appellant does not provide separate arguments, with citation to either the record or caselaw, in support of his contention that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence. Instead, appellant makes a consolidated argument challenging the witnesses' credibility. Specifically, appellant argues there were no independent eyewitnesses who identified him as the shooter, there was no physical evidence at the crime scene tying him to the incident, and '[t]he only evidence that links [appellant] to these crimes is the testimony of his alleged co-defendants, who each got significant deals from the state by testifying.' Thus, although appellant frames his assignment of error in terms of sufficiency of the evidence, appellant's contentions actually address the manifest weight of the evidence. Therefore, appellant's arguments regarding the credibility of the witnesses are more appropriately considered in our analysis of his second assignment of error. Nevertheless, we examine whether appellant's convictions for kidnapping, aggravated robbery, aggravated murder, murder, and having weapons while under disability were supported by sufficient evidence. Pursuant to R.C. 2905.01, a person is guilty of kidnapping if the person 'by force, threat, or deception * * * remove[d] another from the place where the other person is found or restrain[ed] the liberty of the other person' for the purpose of 'facilitat[ed] the commission of any felony.' Here, J.H. testified appellant restrained Flannery's liberty by pointing a gun at him and ordering him to move to the backyard. Carroll also testified appellant ordered Flannery to move to the backyard. Based on the testimony at trial, we find appellant's conviction for kidnapping was supported by sufficient evidence. Pursuant to R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), a person is guilty of aggravated robbery if the person 'in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense [had] a deadly weapon on or about the offender's person or under the offender's control and either display[ed] the weapon, brandish[ed] it, indicate[d] that the offender possesse[d] it, or use[d] it.'

Appellant argues dismissal was a proper sanction under Crim.R.16 for the state’s alleged failure to disclose material evidence favorable to her defense in violation of her constitutional rights identified in Brady v. Maryland. We disagree. In Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.E.2d 215 (1963), the U.S. Supreme Court stated “the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material to either guilt or punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” Evidence subject to disclosure under Brady is that which is both favorable and material to the defense. For purposes of the disclosure requirement, evidence is only considered material “if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A ‘reasonable probability’ is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. This standard of materiality applies regardless of whether the evidence is specifically, generally or not at all requested by the defense.” State v. Johnston, 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 529 N.E.2d 898 (1988), citing United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.E.2d 481 (1985). “The mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish ‘materiality’ in the constitutional sense.” State v. Jackson, 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 33, 565 N.E.2d 549 (1991), citing United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 109-110, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.E.2d 342 (1976). Under these guidelines, we shall first address whether the accusations against the warden were material to appellant’s defense and therefore subject to disclosure by the state. Appellant argues the state improperly withheld material evidence that the warden charging her with cruelty to animals was, himself, previously accused of cruelty to animals. Appellant argues these allegations are material to her defense as they impact the warden’s credibility as a witness. She further argues the state’s failure to disclose this information deprived her of a fair trial. The record with regard to these allegations consists of appellant’s pretrial oral motion to dismiss and the state’s response. In support of her motion, appellant argued she received information regarding the allegations against the warden through a public records request to the Ohio Department of Agriculture which were not disclosed by the state prior to her trial. The state acknowledged having been recently made aware of an investigation into the party making the prior allegations against the warden but noted the actual claims of animal abuse were referred to the Ohio Attorney General to avoid a conflict in investigating a fellow county official. The state further noted that the Ohio Attorney General’s investigation resulted in no charges being filed against the warden and that the allegations were more than three years old at the time of appellant’s trial. Appellant countered that even an allegation of animal cruelty was sufficient to warrant disclosure as the information went to the warden’s credibility as one of the state’s two witnesses. The trial court denied appellant’s motion to dismiss based on the representations of the parties and the matter proceeded to trial. Our review of the record reveals nothing to support appellant’s argument that the allegations against the warden were material and therefore subject to disclosure. Allegations of animal cruelty against the warden from three years prior to appellant’s trial do not attach to his credibility as a witness. “Under Evid.R. 608(B), the ability of trial counsel to discredit a witness through cross-examination concerning particular conduct of a witness is not absolute; it is limited in its exercise to the court’s sound discretion in determining if the inquiry will lead to particular instances of conduct which are clearly probative of untruthfulness.” State v. Whites Landing Fisheries, LLC, 2017-Ohio-7537, 96 N.E.3d 1236, ¶ 48 (6th Dist.), citing State v. Williams, 1 Ohio App.3d 156, 158, 440 N.E.2d 65 (10th Dist.1981). In White Landing Fisheries, we affirmed the trial court’s order barring attempted impeachment of the state’s witness using allegations of past criminal behavior since those allegations, for which no criminal charges were filed, were not clearly probative of the witnesses’ untruthfulness. Id. at ¶ 52-53. We reach the same conclusion here and find no connection between the warden having been merely accused of animal cruelty and his ability to testify truthfully. Additionally, at trial the warden testified that the basis for the charges against appellant was the information he received from the veterinarian. Therefore, any issue regarding his credibility is unlikely to have resulted in a different outcome as the factual basis for the verdict was established by the veterinarian. Accordingly, we find the allegations against the warden were not subject to disclosure by the state as they do not constitute favorable material evidence as described in Brady. There is no reasonable probability that had a jury heard the warden was previously accused of animal cruelty it would have reached a different result. This lack of probability renders the allegations against the dog warden immaterial to appellant’s defense and her assignment of error fails. Appellant’s assignment of error fails for an additional reason. Indeed, her own motion to dismiss reveals her inability to succeed in supporting a Brady violation. In her motion to dismiss, she acknowledged her receipt of the allegations prior to trial. Notably, appellant does not argue that additional information was suppressed by the prosecution, but merely that the information in her possession at trial was not disclosed in response to her discovery request. As a result, the information which she complains was not disclosed was in fact available for her use when cross-examining the warden. We note that in addressing an alleged Brady violation, “[w]here *** the evidence is revealed in time for the defense to use it effectively at or before trial, no constitutional violation has occurred.” State v. Barzacchini, 96 Ohio App.3d 440, 454, 645 N.E.2d 137 (6th Dist.1994), citing United States v. Presser, 844 F.2d 1275 (6th Cir.1988). Here, appellant was aware of the allegations against the warden on the day of trial. She intended to use the animal cruelty allegations to impeach his credibility as a witness. In denying her motion to dismiss, the trial court neither ruled on the admissibility of the allegations nor limited appellant’s ability to use the allegations on cross-examination. Therefore, she had all allegedly suppressed information in her possession at the time of trial and could have attempted to use it during cross-examination of the warden. Nevertheless, appellant failed to question the warden regarding the prior allegations at trial. Having this information available for effective use at trial precludes the finding of a *Brady* violation.\"\n}\n```"}

Newell has not shown that his visit to the crime scene was material evidence, that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had defense counsel known of the crime scene visit prior to trial. The court also found that the state’s failure to disclose the existence of a DNA swab did not violate Newell’s right to a fair trial. Newell’s DNA standard was initially sent to BCI but was returned to the East Cleveland Police Department. BCI requested the standard again, but the police did not send the swab to BCI a second time for testing or comparison. While the mix-up is concerning, Newell has not shown that the failure to disclose the existence of the DNA swab was a willful violation of Crim.R. 16. Moreover, Newell has not shown that this untested DNA was material to a finding of guilt and or a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had the existence of the DNA standard been disclosed. Nelson-Rausch testified that even if she had received Newell’s DNA standard, it would not have changed any of her conclusions regarding the evidence because none of the bullet casings recovered from the crime scene had DNA that was suitable for comparison. In addition, although there was DNA recovered from the firearm taken from Woods’s house, the firearm was ruled out as the murder weapon. In other words, there was no DNA recovered from the scene to compare to Newell’s DNA. Therefore, we do not find that Newell’s right to a fair trial was violated by the failure to disclose the existence of his DNA standard to defense counsel.

He contends that the other acts evidence deprived him of his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial. The state filed a notice of intent to use other acts evidence in which it asserted that it intended to introduce evidence at trial related to appellant’s relationship with Judith Spang and his 1989 conviction in Lucas County for arson. The state represented that it intended to use other acts evidence to show appellant’s motive and a clear modus operandi in which he burns down the residence of women with whom he is romantically involved. In response to the state’s notice of intent, defense counsel filed a motion in limine to exclude any evidence relating to appellant’s other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts. Therein, defense counsel argued that the evidence would be irrelevant to the charges at issue in this case, and that the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial and deny appellant his rights to due process and a fair trial. The trial court held a hearing on defense counsel’s motion in limine on December 12, 2016. The state argued that an exception to Evid.R. 404(B) applied, in that the other acts evidence was admissible to establish identity through a modus operandi. The state asserted that appellant and Judith were dating and that their relationship quickly deteriorated. The state further alleged that Judith discovered that appellant was using her credit card without her permission which caused her to break up with him. Defense counsel argued that the other acts evidence was not necessary to prove identity and that the state could establish identity by other means, such as scientific evidence, evidence related to credit card transactions, and cell phone records. Defense counsel contended that the other acts evidence was far more prejudicial than probative and that the prejudice could not be cured by a limiting instruction. Finally, defense counsel opined that the state was attempting to circumvent appellant’s Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify at trial. After considering the parties’ arguments, the trial court ruled that it would allow the state to introduce other acts evidence over defense counsel’s objection. The record reflects that the state introduced other acts evidence at trial through the testimony of Judith’s son, Jason Spang, and Rosemary Grubbs. The state also presented other acts testimony through Grubbs regarding her romantic relationship with appellant and appellant’s conduct after they broke up. Specifically, Grubbs testified that after she ended the relationship, appellant sent her nasty emails, verbally abused her, and sent a letter to Grubbs’s employer. Grubbs also testified about an incident during which appellant acted belligerently towards an employee at Best Buy, which made her uneasy. In its notice of intent to use other acts evidence, the state did not indicate that it intended to use other acts evidence involving Grubbs. Appellant argues that the trial court erred by admitting Grubbs’s testimony because the testimony had no relevance to the case. Specifically, appellant contends that Grubbs did not know the victim, and that the state used her testimony to depict appellant as an aggressive, belligerent person. Appellant’s brief at 28. Appellant argues that Grubbs’s testimony about the email appellant sent her and his conduct at Best Buy was irrelevant and inadmissible under Evid.R. 404(B) pursuant to the three-part test in Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278. The state, on the other hand, argues that the other acts evidence involving Grubbs was relevant to establishing appellant’s motive and intent — appellant targeted older women and when the relationships ended, he sought revenge. After reviewing the record, and applying the three-part Williams test to the facts of this case, we find no basis upon which to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the other acts evidence involving the emails that appellant sent to Grubbs. Grubbs’s testimony regarding the emails that appellant sent her is not only relevant to establishing the identity of the perpetrator of the murder and arson offenses, it was imperative to the state’s case. Grubbs’s testimony about the emails appellant sent her confirmed that the accounts used to access the banking websites on the victim’s computer after her death belonged to appellant. As noted above, the forensic examination of the victim’s computer revealed that the banking websites were accessed by a “foxsheline” account. (Tr. 1531.) Furthermore, Eric Devlin, who conducted the forensic examination, testified that he was able to rebuild approximately 1,500 web-based emails for “foxsheline” email accounts through the email providers yahoo and hotmail. Devlin explained, “I found personal [emails] that were composed to a Rosemary Grubbs by — it was under the foxsheline [email] account and it was signed by [appellant], as well.” (Tr. 1524.) Grubbs testified that appellant referred to himself in emails as “Fox.” (Tr. 1290.) Accordingly, the trial court did not err in admitting this other acts evidence. On the other hand, the other acts evidence involving Grubbs that pertained to her relationship with appellant and his conduct following their break-up is arguably irrelevant to appellant’s involvement in the murder and arson involving Bewley. Furthermore, although other acts evidence may be admitted for the legitimate purpose of showing motive, we cannot say that Grubbs’s testimony regarding appellant’s conduct after their relationship ended was relevant to appellant’s motive for killing the victim and setting her body on fire. The state asserts that appellant’s motive was “to target older women for financial support and then burn down their residence in revenge when the relationship begins to dissolve.” Appellee’s brief at 18-19. The other acts evidence involving Grubbs pertained to appellant’s conduct after she ended their romantic relationship — there was no evidence that Grubbs was supporting appellant financially, nor that he resorted to arson as a means of revenge for the break-up. Nevertheless, we cannot say that the error in the admission of Grubbs’s testimony, if any, was such that it affected appellant’s substantial rights and that there exists a reasonable probability that but for the admission of her testimony, the outcome at trial would have been different. See Parma v. Odolecki, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104160, 2017-Ohio-2979, ¶ 64-65.

The state filed a notice of intent to use other acts evidence in which it asserted that it intended to introduce evidence at trial related to appellant’s relationship with Judith Spang and his 1989 conviction in Lucas County for arson. The state represented that it intended to use other acts evidence to show appellant’s motive and a clear modus operandi in which he burns down the residence of women with whom he is romantically involved. In response to the state’s notice of intent, defense counsel filed a motion in limine to exclude any evidence relating to appellant’s other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts. Therein, defense counsel argued that the evidence would be irrelevant to the charges at issue in this case, and that the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial and deny appellant his rights to due process and a fair trial. The trial court held a hearing on defense counsel’s motion in limine on December 12, 2016. The state argued that an exception to Evid.R. 404(B) applied, in that the other acts evidence was admissible to establish identity through a modus operandi. The state asserted that appellant and Judith were dating and that their relationship quickly deteriorated. The state further alleged that Judith discovered that appellant was using her credit card without her permission which caused her to break up with him. Defense counsel argued that the other acts evidence was not necessary to prove identity and that the state could establish identity by other means, such as scientific evidence, evidence related to credit card transactions, and cell phone records. Defense counsel contended that the other acts evidence was far more prejudicial than probative and that the prejudice could not be cured by a limiting instruction. Finally, defense counsel opined that the state was attempting to circumvent appellant’s Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify at trial. After considering the parties’ arguments, the trial court ruled that it would allow the state to introduce other acts evidence over defense counsel’s objection. The record reflects that the state introduced other acts evidence at trial through the testimony of Judith’s son, Jason Spang, and Rosemary Grubbs. The state also presented other acts testimony through Grubbs regarding her romantic relationship with appellant and appellant’s conduct after they broke up. Specifically, Grubbs testified that after she ended the relationship, appellant sent her nasty emails, verbally abused her, and sent a letter to Grubbs’s employer. Grubbs also testified about an incident during which appellant acted belligerently towards an employee at Best Buy, which made her uneasy. In its notice of intent to use other acts evidence, the state did not indicate that it intended to use other acts evidence involving Grubbs. Appellant argues that the trial court erred by admitting Grubbs’s testimony because the testimony had no relevance to the case. Specifically, appellant contends that Grubbs did not know the victim, and that the state used her testimony to depict appellant as an aggressive, belligerent person. Appellant’s brief at 28. Appellant argues that Grubbs’s testimony about the email appellant sent her and his conduct at Best Buy was irrelevant and inadmissible under Evid.R. 404(B) pursuant to the three-part test in Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278.

After reviewing the record, and applying the three-part Williams test to the facts of this case, we find no basis upon which to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the other acts evidence involving the emails that appellant sent to Grubbs. Grubbs’s testimony regarding the emails that appellant sent her is not only relevant to establishing the identity of the perpetrator of the murder and arson offenses, it was imperative to the state’s case. Grubbs’s testimony about the emails appellant sent her confirmed that the accounts used to access the banking websites on the victim’s computer after her death belonged to appellant. As noted above, the forensic examination of the victim’s computer revealed that the banking websites were accessed by a “foxsheline” account. (Tr. 1531.)

He contends that when law enforcement requested the search warrant it withheld facts in order to obtain the warrant. For instance, he claims the issuing judge was not informed that Padgett had not had a romantic relationship with Appellant for over a year when the controlled purchase was arranged. Likewise, he contends the court was not informed Padgett allegedly had no contact with Appellant for over a year prior to the controlled buys. He asserts the court was not told of the statements law enforcement personnel told Padgett to use to get Appellant to sell her the drugs; the statements were to use his love for her and that she could convince him to take this risk that was so significant. Appellant argues the withholding of all this information indicates the search warrant was not based on probable cause.\\n\\nThe Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that, ‘no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.’ The Fourth Amendment, however, does not contain any ‘provision expressly precluding the use of evidence obtained in violation of its commands.’ United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 906, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (1984). Rather, the exclusionary rule was judicially created to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights. State v. Hoffman, 141 Ohio St.3d 428, 2014–Ohio–4795, 25 N.E.3d 993, ¶ 24, quoting United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 348, 94 S.Ct. 613 (1974). Consequently, evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment may be suppressed pursuant to the exclusionary rule.\\n\\nPursuant to Ohio Crim.R. 41, a request for a search warrant must be accompanied by a sworn affidavit ‘establishing the grounds for issuing the warrant.’ Crim.R. 41(C)(1). A search warrant will be issued if the judge finds, based on the information in the affidavit, ‘probable cause for the search exists.’ Crim.R. 41(C)(2).\\n\\nIn determining the sufficiency of probable cause in an affidavit submitted in support of a search warrant, the duty of the judge or magistrate issuing the warrant is to simply ‘make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him [or her], including the ‘veracity’ and ‘basis of knowledge’ of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.’ State v. George, 45 Ohio St.3d 325, 554 N.E.2d 640 (1989), paragraph one of the syllabus, quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238–239, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (1983). The issuing judge or magistrate is confined to the averments contained in the affidavit supporting the issuance of the search warrant. State v. Swift, 12th Dist.

Id. See also Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. at 238-239. In making this determination, the reviewing courts must examine the totality of the circumstances. State v. Jones, 143 Ohio St.3d 266, 2015-Ohio-483, 37 N.E.3d 123, ¶ 13.

That affidavit solely relied on the two controlled drug transactions and does not reference any statements Padgett made to the officers. It also does not indicate the officer told her what statements she should say to Appellant to get him to sell her drugs. The affidavit does not indicate Padgett's previous contact with Appellant or their prior relationship. It does not state if she previously obtained drugs from Appellant prior to the controlled buys.\\n\\nDuring the suppression hearing, counsel for Appellant asked Officer Starkey if he knew if Padgett obtained drugs from Appellant during the year prior to the controlled buys. 1/11/18 Suppression Tr. 41-42. He stated he did not know. 1/11/18 Suppression Tr. 41-42. Officer Starkey was also questioned about and confirmed that he told Padgett it was important for her to get Appellant to talk about giving her drugs during the controlled buys. 1/11/18 Suppression Tr. 42-43. The recorded controlled buys and Padgett's interview with law enforcement were played for the court.\\n\\nIn overruling the motion to suppress, the trial court explained the controlled buys were important and provided sufficient probable cause for the search warrant: ‘Reliable information obtained from credible informants suffices to establish probable cause. There must be a substantial basis however, for believing the source of the hearsay to be credible, and that there is a factual basis for the information furnished.’\\n\\nNow, the officers – the officer, singular, who prepared the Affidavit, and the reviewing county court judge who issued the arrest warrant based upon that Affidavit, were not relying merely upon hearsay of the confidential informant. This is not a situation where a confidential informant tells a police officer X, Y and Z, and the police officers uses X, Y and Z in his or her Affidavit to support an arrest, search or whatever. This is a police officer preparing an Affidavit and the reviewing court, county court judge, issuing the arrest warrant after his own investigation, with verified and controlled telephone conversations and buys.\\n\\nIf you look at the Affidavit, it uses the word ‘controlled’, I believe, four times. That’s upon which the officer relied. That’s upon which the county court judge relied. There were numerous safeguards in place to make certain; it almost made it irrelevant whether the confidential informant was reliable or dependable upon what he or she – she in this case – had told the officers. Safeguards, multiple ones, as indicated were in place.\\n\\nBased upon the totality of the circumstances, the motion to suppress evidence in this case is respectfully, very respectfully, overruled, but nevertheless overruled.\\n\\n1/11/18 Suppression Tr. 59-60.\\n\\nThis reasoning is logical and indicates the trial court had a substantial basis for concluding probable cause existed based on the information contained within the four corners of the affidavit. The fact that the affidavit did not state whether Padgett bought drugs or had any physical contact with Appellant for a year prior to the controlled buys is inconsequential. The controlled buys occurred; Appellant sold or gave her drugs without a prescription during these transactions. This was sufficient probable cause for the search warrant.\\n\\nFurthermore, law enforcement telling Padgett what to say and to use her relationship with Appellant to have him sell her drugs is typical in a controlled drug transaction. Confidential informants are used for controlled buys because drug dealers typically do not sell drugs to a person they do not know for fear it is an undercover police officer. See State v. Altman, 7th Dist. No. 12 CO 42, 2013-Ohio-5883, ¶ 4-6; State v. Persohn, 7th Dist. No. 11 CO 37, 2012-Ohio-6091, ¶ 26 (testimony from the officer explaining why confidential informants are used). Using a previous relationship to obtain drugs from a known distributor and law enforcement indicating what needs to be said or seen in the video recording for purposes of building a case are how controlled buys occur.\\n\\nAppellant’s arguments about the timing of the controlled buys and law enforcement telling Padgett to use her relationship to get Appellant to take the ‘significant risk’ to sell her drugs may support his affirmative defense of entrapment, but it does not negate the fact that the controlled buys occurred. Those controlled buys provided sufficient probable cause for the search warrant. Accordingly, this assignment of error is meritless.\"\n}\n```"}

The affidavit does not indicate Padgett's previous contact with Appellant or their prior relationship. It does not state if she previously obtained drugs from Appellant prior to the controlled buys.\\n\\nDuring the suppression hearing, counsel for Appellant asked Officer Starkey if he knew if Padgett obtained drugs from Appellant during the year prior to the controlled buys. 1/11/18 Suppression Tr. 41-42. He stated he did not know. 1/11/18 Suppression Tr. 41-42. Officer Starkey was also questioned about and confirmed that he told Padgett it was important for her to get Appellant to talk about giving her drugs during the controlled buys. 1/11/18 Suppression Tr. 42-43. The recorded controlled buys and Padgett's interview with law enforcement were played for the court.\\n\\nIn overruling the motion to suppress, the trial court explained the controlled buys were important and provided sufficient probable cause for the search warrant: ‘Reliable information obtained from credible informants suffices to establish probable cause. There must be a substantial basis however, for believing the source of the hearsay to be credible, and that there is a factual basis for the information furnished.’\\n\\nNow, the officers – the officer, singular, who prepared the Affidavit, and the reviewing county court judge who issued the arrest warrant based upon that Affidavit, were not relying merely upon hearsay of the confidential informant. This is not a situation where a confidential informant tells a police officer X, Y and Z, and the police officers uses X, Y and Z in his or her Affidavit to support an arrest, search or whatever. This is a police officer preparing an Affidavit and the reviewing court, county court judge, issuing the arrest warrant after his own investigation, with verified and controlled telephone conversations and buys.\\n\\nIf you look at the Affidavit, it uses the word ‘controlled’, I believe, four times. That’s upon which the officer relied. That’s upon which the county court judge relied. There were numerous safeguards in place to make certain; it almost made it irrelevant whether the confidential informant was reliable or dependable upon what he or she – she in this case – had told the officers. Safeguards, multiple ones, as indicated were in place.\\n\\nBased upon the totality of the circumstances, the motion to suppress evidence in this case is respectfully, very respectfully, overruled, but nevertheless overruled.\\n\\n1/11/18 Suppression Tr. 59-60.\\n\\nThis reasoning is logical and indicates the trial court had a substantial basis for concluding probable cause existed based on the information contained within the four corners of the affidavit. The fact that the affidavit did not state whether Padgett bought drugs or had any physical contact with Appellant for a year prior to the controlled buys is inconsequential. The controlled buys occurred; Appellant sold or gave her drugs without a prescription during these transactions. This was sufficient probable cause for the search warrant.\\n\\nFurthermore, law enforcement telling Padgett what to say and to use her relationship with Appellant to have him sell her drugs is typical in a controlled drug transaction. Confidential informants are used for controlled buys because drug dealers typically do not sell drugs to a person they do not know for fear it is an undercover police officer. See State v. Altman, 7th Dist. No. 12 CO 42, 2013-Ohio-5883, ¶ 4-6; State v. Persohn, 7th Dist. No. 11 CO 37, 2012-Ohio-6091, ¶ 26 (testimony from the officer explaining why confidential informants are used). Using a previous relationship to obtain drugs from a known distributor and law enforcement indicating what needs to be said or seen in the video recording for purposes of building a case are how controlled buys occur.\\n\\nAppellant’s arguments about the timing of the controlled buys and law enforcement telling Padgett to use her relationship to get Appellant to take the ‘significant risk’ to sell her drugs may support his affirmative defense of entrapment, but it does not negate the fact that the controlled buys occurred. Those controlled buys provided sufficient probable cause for the search warrant. Accordingly, this assignment of error is meritless.\"\n}\n```"}

In his 'as-applied' challenge to R.C. 2953.23(A), Conway argues as follows: As applied to Petitioner's case, the statute ignores the complex and evolving body of equitable principles established by judicial decisions. For example, the evidentiary documents presented in support of Conway's petition might not establish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable fact-finder would have found Conway guilty of the capital murder or sentenced him to death. However, the documents clearly establish a substantial violation of Conway's rights as to render his conviction and sentence void and/or voidable under the United States Constitution. R.C. 2953.21(A)(1). Thus, under the federal standard of review, unencumbered by any need to show that no jury would have convicted him, Conway would be entitled to have his successive post-conviction petition 'entertained.' (Appellant's Brief at 12.) Conway appears to be arguing that the gate-keeping provision of R.C. 2953.23(A)(1), and, in particular, the prong under subsection (b), acts as an insuperable bar to his ability to obtain postconviction relief under R.C. 2953.21(A)(1), which entitles a petitioner to relief where 'there was such a denial or infringement of the person's rights as to render the judgment void or voidable under the Ohio Constitution or the Constitution of the United States.' R.C. 2953.21(A)(1)(a). Conway believes that 'documents clearly establish' such denial. (Appellant's Brief at 12.) However, Conway allows that the same evidence might not satisfy the standard under R.C. 2953.23(A)(1)(b) for successive petitions, which requires him to'show[] by clear and convincing evidence that, but for constitutional error at trial, no reasonable factfinder would have found' him guilty.

Here, however, the question is merely academic. As explained below, Conway has not identified a substantial violation of his rights based on any of the evidence produced by the discovery proceedings in federal court.

Under his assignment of error, Smith claims the trial court erred in overruling his motions for a new trial. Specifically, Smith contends his motions should have been granted because the State failed to disclose the recorded conversation between Detective Mason and Plummer. According to Smith, the State’s failure to disclose the audio recording constituted a violation of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Brady, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, because the recording contained information that was both material and exculpatory. We disagree. Standard of Review Generally, ‘[a] reviewing court will not disturb a trial court’s decision granting or denying a Crim.R. 33 motion for new trial absent an abuse of discretion.’ (Citation omitted.) State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, ¶ 82. However, the Supreme Court of Ohio has indicated that a trial court’s ruling on a motion for new trial claiming a Brady violation should be reviewed using ‘a due process analysis rather than an abuse of discretion test because the issue on review concern[s] [the defendant’s] due process right to a fair trial, namely the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to [the defendant].’ State v. Johnston, 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 60, 529 N.E.2d 898 (1988). Accord State v. Oldaker, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 16CA3, 2017-Ohio-1201, ¶ 19; State v. Webb, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2014-01-013, 2014-Ohio-2894, ¶ 16; State v. Keith, 192 Ohio App.3d 231, 2011-Ohio-407, 948 N.E.2d 976, ¶ 41 (3d Dist.); State v. Hoffman, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2001-L-022, 2002-Ohio-6576, ¶ 19. Based on this precedent, we review de novo a trial court’s ruling on a motion for new trial alleging a Brady violation, as the relevant inquiry is whether due process was violated by the prosecutor’s failure to disclose evidence. State v. Moore, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-08-43, 2009-Ohio-2106, ¶ 19; State v. Glover, 2016-Ohio-2833, 64 N.E.3d 442, ¶ 35 (8th Dist.); United States v. Bullock, 130 Fed.Appx. 706, 722 (6th Cir.2005), citing United States v. Phillip, 948 F.2d 241, 250 (6th Cir.1991) (‘[t]he standard of review for the materiality of a purported Brady violation is de novo because it presents a mixed question of law and fact’). Brady Analysis Pursuant to the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Brady, ‘the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.’ Brady, 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Therefore, in order to establish a due process violation under Brady, the defendant must demonstrate that: ‘(1) the prosecution failed to disclose evidence upon request; (2) the evidence was favorable to the defendant; and (3) the evidence was material.’ State v. Goney, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2017-CA-43, 2018-Ohio-2115, ¶ 66; Moore v. Illinois, 408 U.S. 786, 794-795, 92 S.Ct. 2562, 33 L.Ed.2d 706 (1972). Because exculpatory and impeachment evidence are favorable to the defendant, both types of evidence may be the subject of a *Brady* violation, so long as the evidence is material. *United States v. Bagley*, 473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). ‘Evidence is considered material ‘if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.’ ’ State v. Royster, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26378, 2015-Ohio-625, ¶ 16, quoting *Bagley* at 682. A ‘reasonable probability’ is ‘a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.’ *Bagley* at 682. ‘As a rule, undisclosed evidence is not material simply because it may have helped the defendant to prepare for trial.’ State v. Brown, 115 Ohio St.3d 55, 2007-Ohio-4837, 873 N.E.2d 858, ¶ 49. ‘The United States Supreme Court has rejected a standard of materiality that focuses ‘on the impact of the undisclosed evidence on the defendant’s ability to prepare for trial, rather than the materiality of the evidence to the issue of guilt or innocence.’ ’ *Id.*, quoting *United States v. Agurs*, 427 U.S. 97, 112-113, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), fn. 20. Furthermore, no *Brady* violation occurs when the undisclosed evidence is cumulative to evidence already known by the defense at the time of trial. *See State v. Cook*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-950090, 1995 WL 763671, *3 (Dec. 29, 1995). There is also no *Brady* violation ‘if the evidence that was allegedly withheld is merely cumulative to evidence presented at trial.’ (Citations omitted.) *State v. Bonilla*, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2008 CA 68, 2009-Ohio-4784, ¶ 26. In this case, there is no dispute that the recording of the conversation between Detective Mason and Plummer was not disclosed by the State until after Smith’s trial concluded. However, after reviewing the recording in question, this court finds that a majority of the information on the recording was cumulative to information already known by Smith prior to trial. This is because a majority of the information on the recording was also contained in the summary report prepared by Detective Mason and in Plummer's written statement, both of which were disclosed to Smith during discovery. Nevertheless, there was some information on the recording that was not contained in either Detective Mason's report or Plummer's written statement. Upon review, this court finds that such information was not favorable to Smith and/or not material. The information in question was as follows: - Plummer's former boyfriend, Ferguson, told her that Smith's ‘thing’ was choking people and that Smith had even choked Ferguson before. - Plummer believed that Smith was doing drugs not only because Plummer had money missing (which was indicated in Mason's report and Plummer's written statement), but also because Smith was acting funny, being secretive, and going into other rooms of her apartment and staying there for long periods of time. Plummer also indicated that a friend saw Smith ‘get something.’ - Plummer's eyes were yellow with blood in them after Smith choked her. - Plummer was on a respirator in the hospital due to breathing problems. - Smith wanted to kiss Plummer and tried to have sex with Plummer, but they were never naked around each other and Plummer never wanted that kind of relationship with Smith. - Plummer had drug problems in the past. - Ferguson had been Smith's friend for 35 years. - Plummer had a protection order against Ferguson. - Despite having a protection order against Ferguson, Plummer contacted Ferguson and told him about Smith choking her, which upset Ferguson. - Ferguson told Plummer that he had gotten on Smith's Facebook page ‘and wrote a bunch of stuff,’ which scared Plummer because it alerted Smith to the fact that she had called the police. - Ferguson had not been ‘hanging around’ Smith. Plummer’s statements concerning Smith’s suspected drug use and Ferguson’s report of Smith’s tendency to choke others were clearly unfavorable to Smith in that they lend credibility to Plummer’s version of events and did nothing more than weaken Smith’s credibility. Plummer’s statement regarding her yellow, bloodshot eyes was also unfavorable to Smith because it was consistent with the photographs of Plummer’s injuries which were disclosed to Smith during discovery. Likewise, Plummer’s statement that she was on a respirator due to breathing problems was unfavorable to Smith because it contradicted Smith’s claim that Plummer wanted to be choked (and ultimately deprived of air) for sexual gratification. Instead, Plummer’s claimed breathing problem and need for a respirator supported her assertion that the choking incident was not consensual. Plummer’s statements indicating that she never kissed Smith, was never nude around Smith, and never wanted a sexual relationship with Smith were consistent with her trial testimony and were clearly unfavorable to Smith's consensual sexual encounter defense. Specifically, these statements supported Plummer's claim that she never had sex with Smith, a claim that was present in Detective Mason's summary report. Despite this, Smith argues that Plummer could be heard hesitating on the recording when Detective Mason asked her whether she had a sexual relationship with Smith. Smith argues that said hesitation was favorable evidence that could have been used to attack Plummer's credibility. After reviewing the portion of the recording in question, this court finds that Plummer merely said the word 'um' and briefly paused before answering Detective Mason's question. Contrary to Smith's claim otherwise, nothing in the nature or timing of Plummer's response would make one question its veracity. The remainder of the non-cumulative information on the recording concerned Plummer's prior drug problem and her former boyfriend, Ferguson. The fact that Plummer had a prior drug problem would have been inadmissible at trial because it was extrinsic to the felonious assault and was not clearly probative of Plummer's truthfulness or untruthfulness. See Evid.R. 608(B). Because Plummer's prior drug problem was inadmissible, it would not have affected the outcome of trial, and thus did not constitute material evidence. Finally, the information regarding Plummer's former boyfriend, Ferguson, was also immaterial evidence, as it had nothing to do with the felonious assault in question and would not have impacted the jury's guilty verdict. We further note that Plummer's written statement referred to Ferguson by name, and thus put the defense on notice of Ferguson’s relationship to the parties. The defense, therefore, was free to locate and question Ferguson prior to trial. Smith nevertheless argues that the information on the audio recording was favorable and material because it could have been used to impeach Detective Mason’s and Plummer’s trial testimony. This claim fails for multiple reasons. With regard to Plummer, the only information on the audio recording that was inconsistent with Plummer’s trial testimony was a statement that Plummer made to Mason indicating that she told Smith several times to stop choking her. During trial, Plummer testified that she was unable to tell Smith to stop choking her because she was gasping for air. Plummer’s inconsistent statement in the audio recording, however, was included in Detective Mason’s supplemental report. Therefore, Smith was aware of the inconsistency prior to trial and could have impeached Plummer using the detective’s report. As for Detective Mason, the only inconsistency in Mason’s trial testimony and the audio recording was unfavorable to Smith. Specifically, Mason testified and wrote in his report that Plummer told him she and Smith kissed each other one time in the past. That statement, however, was not supported by the audio recording, as Plummer merely told Mason that Smith ‘wanted to kiss [her] and stuff.’ During the recorded conversation, Plummer never stated that she and Smith had kissed. This information did not favor Smith in any way, but instead supported Plummer’s claim that she and Smith were just friends. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find that the State’s inadvertent failure to disclose the recorded conversation between Detective Mason and Plummer constituted a Brady violation, as the information on the audio recording was cumulative to information already known by the defense prior to trial and/or did not constitute favorable, material evidence that would have affected the outcome of trial.\"\n}\n```"}

The state also identified Gail Jenkins, Tierra Edwards, and Antoine Edwards on its witness list.

The state nevertheless contends that Buehner could have made the public records request within the 120-day period prescribed by Crim.R. 33(B), and that Buehner has offered no explanation as to why he waited almost 12 years after his conviction to request this information. We think the explanation is obvious; the state informed Buehner’s trial counsel that no exculpatory statements from Anderson or any of the identified witnesses existed at the time of trial. Buehner would have had no reason to believe that a request for exculpatory evidence made within 120 days after the verdict would produce a different result from the very same request made prior to trial, particularly since the state was required to produce the requested evidence before trial under Crim.R. 16. Exculpatory evidence is evidence that would tend to exculpate a defendant of guilt or reduce a defendant’s penalty. Anderson told police that the shooter and the other two individuals in the truck were black whereas Buehner is white. If believed, Anderson’s statement suggests that someone other than Buehner murdered Saunders. Additionally, Gail Jenkins told police that although the driver of the truck was white, the other two passengers were black, including the middle passenger.

Therefore, at the very least, Anderson and Jenkins’s statements constituted exculpatory evidence that should have been produced in pretrial discovery. The state asserts there was no evidence that the prosecutor had Anderson’s, Jenkins’s, or any other undisclosed statements in its possession prior to trial. Indeed, the prosecutor stated on the record on the first day of trial that he was cognizant of defense counsel’s requests for exculpatory evidence and of the state’s continuing duty to provide exculpatory information to the defense, but that ‘there was nothing to give them.’ The record indicates that the state provided full discovery responses to Buehner’s requests based on the evidence in the state’s possession, and that the undisclosed witness statements remained in the possession of the Cleveland Police Department.

The jury also apparently concluded Appellant was at fault in creating the violent situation between Rhodes and himself. The testimony set forth above demonstrates that Rhodes was standing and watching the television mounted on the wall. Though Rhodes was not blocking it, Appellant chose to stand and approach him at the television. Rhodes testified Appellant turned the television off. Appellant testified Rhodes changed the channel. While the parties’ testimony contrasted on that point, this back and forth exchange over the television channel sparked the remaining events. More importantly, the jury viewed the video showing the physical altercation. The trial transcript, however, reflects that the video was played during Rhodes’, Mary Perry’s, and Appellant’s testimonies. Perry’s testimony authenticated the video. Appellant briefly objected to the relevance of showing the video during Perry’s testimony, but the objection was overruled. At the close of the State’s case in chief, the video disk was ‘stipulated into evidence by the parties’ and admitted without objection. When portions of the appellate record are not supplied to the court or unavailable for review, we presume the regularity of the trial court proceedings. The jury apparently concluded Appellant was the physical aggressor. And, even assuming Rhodes’ was verbally aggressive, using racial epithets 45 minutes before the disagreement at the television set, the jury was instructed that no matter how provocative, use of force is not justified. The jury was in the better position to ascertain the credibility of the witnesses and to weigh their testimonies accordingly, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the jury.

While the parties’ testimony contrasted on that point, this back and forth exchange over the television channel sparked the remaining events. More importantly, the jury viewed the video showing the physical altercation. The trial transcript, however, reflects that the video was played during Rhodes’, Mary Perry’s, and Appellant’s testimonies. Perry’s testimony authenticated the video. Appellant briefly objected to the relevance of showing the video during Perry’s testimony, but the objection was overruled. At the close of the State’s case in chief, the video disk was ‘stipulated into evidence by the parties’ and admitted without objection. When portions of the appellate record are not supplied to the court or unavailable for review, we presume the regularity of the trial court proceedings. The jury apparently concluded Appellant was the physical aggressor. And, even assuming Rhodes’ was verbally aggressive, using racial epithets 45 minutes before the disagreement at the television set, the jury was instructed that no matter how provocative, use of force is not justified. The jury was in the better position to ascertain the credibility of the witnesses and to weigh their testimonies accordingly, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the jury. We find the evidence supports the jury’s implicit finding that Appellant’s self-defense claim was not plausible. For the foregoing reasons, we find Appellant’s conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. We hereby overrule the first assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\"\n}\n```"}

Austin further argues that the state’s failure to provide him with the surveillance video amounted to a *Brady* violation that caused him to “wrongfully accept a plea agreement,” resulting in a manifest injustice. As explained above, the state concedes that the trial court erred in denying Austin’s motion, but for a different reason. The state, relying on State v. Moon, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101930, 2015-Ohio-1648, argues the trial court was without jurisdiction to rule on Austin’s motion while his direct appeal was pending before this court. In Moon, this court found that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea because the trial court ruled on his motion during the pendency of his direct appeal, which involved his guilty plea. Moon at ¶ 7. As a result, the trial court’s ruling on the motion was a nullity. Id., citing State v. Lauharn, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2011 CA 10, 2012-Ohio-1572, ¶ 9-10. This court has explained “[w]hen a notice of appeal is filed, the trial court loses jurisdiction except to take action in aid of the appeal.” State v. Drake, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105908, 2017-Ohio-7328, ¶ 2, citing State ex rel. Special Prosecutors v. Judges, Court of Common Pleas, 55 Ohio St.2d 94, 97, 378 N.E.2d 162 (1978). The trial court retains jurisdiction over issues “‘not inconsistent with the appellate court’s jurisdiction to reverse, modify, or affirm the judgment from which an appeal is taken’ — what is characterized as acts ‘not in conflict’ with appellate jurisdiction.” Id., quoting Yee v. Erie Cty. Sheriff’s Dept., 51 Ohio St.3d 43, 44, 553 N.E.2d 1354 (1990). In Drake, we explained that an exception to the rule in Special Prosecutors exists for collateral attacks to a judgment of conviction. Id. at _ 3. Specifically, “R.C. 2953.21(D) states: ‘the court shall consider a petition that is timely filed under division (A)(2) of this section even if a direct appeal of the judgment is pending.’” Id., quoting R.C. 2953.21(D). “However, ‘R.C. 2953.21 and 2953.23 do not govern a Crim.R. 32.1 postsentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea.’” Id., quoting State v. Bush, 96 Ohio St.3d 235, 2002-Ohio-3993, 773 N.E.2d 522, syllabus. “Given that a postsentence Crim.R. 32.1 motion is not collateral[,] but is filed in the underlying criminal case and * * * targets the withdrawal of a plea, it is not a ‘collateral challenge to the validity of a conviction or sentence.’” Bush at ¶ 13, quoting State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 1999-Ohio-102, 714 N.E.2d 905. In the instant case, Austin plainly styled his motion as a motion to withdraw a guilty plea under Crim.R. 32.1. The trial court ruled on this motion while Austin’s direct appeal concerning his guilty plea was pending before this court. As a result, the trial court was without jurisdiction to rule on this motion. Drake at _ 4; Moon at _ 7. Therefore, the trial court’s denial of the motion was a nullity. Id., citing Lauharn at _ 13. On remand, the trial court is to vacate its denial of Austin’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea and hold the motion in abeyance until Austin’s direct appeal is decided, at which time it may proceed to rule on the motion.

In his first assignment, Goney contends that the trial court erred when it imposed a definite prison term for the RVOs. Specifically, Goney argues that pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b), the jury, not the trial court, was required to find that Goney attempted to cause, threatened to cause, or actually caused serious physical harm before the trial court could impose sentence for the RVO specifications. R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b) states in pertinent part: (b) The court shall impose on an offender the longest prison term authorized or required for the offense and shall impose on the offender an additional definite prison term of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten years if all of the following criteria are met: (i) The offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the Revised Code that the offender is a repeat violent offender. (ii) The offender within the preceding twenty years has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more offenses described in division (CC)(1) of section 2929.01 of the Revised Code * * * (iii) The offense or offenses of which the offender currently is convicted * * * (is) any felony of the second degree that is an offense of violence and the trier of fact finds that the offense involved an attempt to cause or a threat to cause serious physical harm to a person or resulted in serious physical harm to a person. Based upon the language in R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), Goney argues that the jury, not the trial court, was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he attempted to cause or threatened to cause serious physical harm, or that his actions resulted in serious physical harm. Each crime for which Goney was convicted required him to be found guilty of inflicting, attempting to inflict, or threatening to inflict only physical harm, not serious physical harm. Goney was ultimately convicted of Count I, robbery (R.C. 2911.02(A)(2)), Count III, kidnapping (R.C. 2905.01(A)(2)), and Count IV, abduction (R.C. 2905.01(A)(2)). As previously stated, the trial court merged Count IV into Count III. The trial court sentenced Goney to a mandatory eight years in prison for robbery. Upon finding Goney to be a repeat violent offender, the trial court imposed an additional two years in prison to be served consecutively to his eight-year robbery sentence. With respect to his sentence for kidnapping, the trial court sentenced Goney to a mandatory eight years in prison. Again, finding Goney to be a repeat violent offender, the trial court imposed an additional two years in prison to be served consecutively to his eight-year kidnapping sentence. The trial court then ordered that Goney’s sentences for Counts I and III be served consecutively to one another, for an aggregate sentence of twenty years in prison. R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) states in pertinent part: (A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following: (2) Inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on another[.] R.C. 2905.01(A)(2) states in pertinent part: (A) No person, by force, threat, or deception, * * *, shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, for any of the following purposes: (2) To facilitate the commission of any felony or flight thereafter[.] Initially, we note that we agree with the Eleventh District Court of Appeals in State v. Payne, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2004-L-118, 2005-Ohio-7043, in which the court held that in order to be constitutionally permissible under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), “any fact, other than a prior conviction, must be determined by a jury or admitted by the appellant.” (Emphasis sic.) Id. at ¶ 114. Thus, any fact other than a prior conviction that is found by a jury or admitted by the defendant complies with Apprendi, regardless of whether it relates to a prior or current conviction. State v. Wilson, __ N.E.3d __, 2018-Ohio-902, ¶ 90 (11th Dist.). It is undisputed that in the instant case, Goney did not admit to any allegations that he attempted to cause or threatened serious physical harm, or that his actions resulted in serious physical harm with respect to any of the offenses for which he was convicted. Accordingly, under Apprendi, Goney was entitled to have a jury decide whether he should be designated as a repeat violent offender. See State v. Bishop, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014-CA-190, 2015-Ohio-3023, ¶ 19–21. Nevertheless, as the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), “nothing prevents a defendant from waiving his Apprendi rights [to a jury determination of every element of the charge]. *** Even a defendant who stands trial may consent to judicial fact-finding as to sentence enhancements, which may well be in his interest if relevant evidence would prejudice him at trial.” Id. at 310. While the Sixth Amendment generally prohibits judicial fact-finding, there is an “exception for prior criminal convictions and the defendant's consent to judicial fact-finding.” State v. Hunter, 123 Ohio St.3d 164, 2009-Ohio-4147, 915 N.E.2d 292, ¶ 30, citing State v. Foster, 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, ¶ 7. Prior to trial, Goney filed a motion in limine in which he noted that pursuant to R.C. 2941.149(B), “[t]he court shall determine the issue of whether an offender is a repeat violent offender.” Therefore, according to Goney's liminal motion, “[t]he issue of whether the Defendant is a repeat violent offender is a question for the court, not the jury.” Accordingly, Goney requested that the trial court determine whether he should be designated as a RVO. The trial court granted Goney’s motion in limine at a hearing where Goney was present. Thus, Goney consented to judicial fact-finding regarding his designation as a repeat violent offender. That is not the end of our analysis, however. In the instant case, although the trial court was asked to determine if Goney was guilty of the RVO specifications, the trial court was still required to make all of the appropriate findings based upon the evidence before enhancing Goney’s sentence as an RVO. The trial court was only permitted to enhance Goney’s sentence relative to the RVO specifications if, as trier of fact, the trial court found appellant's actions threatened, attempted, or resulted in “serious physical harm” to the victim. See State v. Brown, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 10AP-836 and 10AP-845, 2011-Ohio-3159, ¶ 23, fn. 2 (holding the trial court properly enhanced the defendant's sentence for second-degree felony robbery only because the indictment for the attached RVO specification alleged “serious physical harm” and the jury instructions for the robbery count included a finding of “serious physical harm”); State v. Davis, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 152, 2009-Ohio-5079, ¶ 36 (holding that, although the defendant may have in fact threatened to cause serious physical harm to the robbery victims, only the trier of fact was permitted to make such a finding for purposes of penalty enhancement). Initially, we note that nowhere in Goney’s indictment did the State allege that he attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm,” or that his actions resulted in “serious physical harm” with respect to any of the offenses for which he was convicted. Moreover, the jury instructions contain no mention of “serious physical harm.” Most importantly, the trial court did not make a finding that Goney attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm” against the complaining witness, Melissa Wright, before finding him guilty of the RVO specifications, and the trial record contains no threat of serious physical harm. In fact, at the sentencing hearing held on July 10, 2017, the trial court stated the following: The Court: As recorded in the Court’s repeat violent offender entry, the Court found the Defendant to be a repeat violent offender, and pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b) finds the following: The Defendant is convicted of a R.C. 2941.149 specification that the Defendant is a repeat violent offender. The offense the Defendant is currently convicted of is a second degree felony that is an offense of violence, and the trier of fact finds that the offense involved an attempt or a threat to cause physical harm to a person or result in serious physical harm to a person. (Emphasis added.) Here, we find that the trial court made the proper findings with respect to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(i) and (ii). Specifically, the trial court found that Goney was “convicted of a specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the Revised Code that the offender is a repeat violent offender,” and he “within the preceding twenty years has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more offenses described in division (CC)(1) of section 2929.01 of the Revised Code * * *.” Id. However, with respect to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), the record establishes that the trial court failed to find that Goney attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm” against a person before finding him guilty of the RVO specifications. Rather, as noted above, the trial court found “that the offense involved an attempt or a threat to cause physical harm to a person.” (Emphasis added.) Simply put, “physical harm” and “serious physical harm” represent two distinct legal standards and cannot be used interchangeably. Therefore, pursuant to the clear language in R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), the trial court failed to make the proper findings. Furthermore, although the trial court ostensibly found “that the offense involved * * * serious physical harm to a person,” there is no evidence in the record to support such a finding, with regard to Wright based on the evidence surrounding the robbery of the Fairborn Circle K. Thus, because the trial court failed to make the proper findings pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), it erred when it found Goney guilty of the RVO specifications.\"\n}\n```"}

New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), “any fact, other than a prior conviction, must be determined by a jury or admitted by the appellant.” (Emphasis sic.) Id. at ¶ 114. Thus, any fact other than a prior conviction that is found by a jury or admitted by the defendant complies with Apprendi, regardless of whether it relates to a prior or current conviction. State v. Wilson, __ N.E.3d __, 2018-Ohio-902, ¶ 90 (11th Dist.). It is undisputed that in the instant case, Goney did not admit to any allegations that he attempted to cause or threatened serious physical harm, or that his actions resulted in serious physical harm with respect to any of the offenses for which he was convicted. Accordingly, under Apprendi, Goney was entitled to have a jury decide whether he should be designated as a repeat violent offender. See State v. Bishop, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014-CA-190, 2015-Ohio-3023, ¶ 19–21. Nevertheless, as the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), “nothing prevents a defendant from waiving his Apprendi rights [to a jury determination of every element of the charge]. *** Even a defendant who stands trial may consent to judicial fact-finding as to sentence enhancements, which may well be in his interest if relevant evidence would prejudice him at trial.” Id. at 310. While the Sixth Amendment generally prohibits judicial fact-finding, there is an “exception for prior criminal convictions and the defendant's consent to judicial fact-finding.” State v. Hunter, 123 Ohio St.3d 164, 2009-Ohio-4147, 915 N.E.2d 292, ¶ 30, citing State v. Foster, 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, ¶ 7. Prior to trial, Goney filed a motion in limine in which he noted that pursuant to R.C. 2941.149(B), “[t]he court shall determine the issue of whether an offender is a repeat violent offender.” Therefore, according to Goney's liminal motion, “[t]he issue of whether the Defendant is a repeat violent offender is a question for the court, not the jury.” Accordingly, Goney requested that the trial court determine whether he should be designated as a RVO. The trial court granted Goney’s motion in limine at a hearing where Goney was present. Thus, Goney consented to judicial fact-finding regarding his designation as a repeat violent offender. That is not the end of our analysis, however. In the instant case, although the trial court was asked to determine if Goney was guilty of the RVO specifications, the trial court was still required to make all of the appropriate findings based upon the evidence before enhancing Goney’s sentence as an RVO. The trial court was only permitted to enhance Goney’s sentence relative to the RVO specifications if, as trier of fact, the trial court found appellant's actions threatened, attempted, or resulted in “serious physical harm” to the victim. See State v. Brown, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 10AP-836 and 10AP-845, 2011-Ohio-3159, ¶ 23, fn. 2 (holding the trial court properly enhanced the defendant's sentence for second-degree felony robbery only because the indictment for the attached RVO specification alleged “serious physical harm” and the jury instructions for the robbery count included a finding of “serious physical harm”); State v. Davis, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 152, 2009-Ohio-5079, ¶ 36 (holding that, although the defendant may have in fact threatened to cause serious physical harm to the robbery victims, only the trier of fact was permitted to make such a finding for purposes of penalty enhancement). Initially, we note that nowhere in Goney’s indictment did the State allege that he attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm,” or that his actions resulted in “serious physical harm” with respect to any of the offenses for which he was convicted. Moreover, the jury instructions contain no mention of “serious physical harm.” Most importantly, the trial court did not make a finding that Goney attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm” against the complaining witness, Melissa Wright, before finding him guilty of the RVO specifications, and the trial record contains no threat of serious physical harm. In fact, at the sentencing hearing held on July 10, 2017, the trial court stated the following: The Court: As recorded in the Court’s repeat violent offender entry, the Court found the Defendant to be a repeat violent offender, and pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b) finds the following: The Defendant is convicted of a R.C. 2941.149 specification that the Defendant is a repeat violent offender. The offense the Defendant is currently convicted of is a second degree felony that is an offense of violence, and the trier of fact finds that the offense involved an attempt or a threat to cause physical harm to a person or result in serious physical harm to a person. (Emphasis added.) Here, we find that the trial court made the proper findings with respect to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(i) and (ii). Specifically, the trial court found that Goney was “convicted of a specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the Revised Code that the offender is a repeat violent offender,” and he “within the preceding twenty years has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more offenses described in division (CC)(1) of section 2929.01 of the Revised Code * * *.” Id. However, with respect to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), the record establishes that the trial court failed to find that Goney attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm” against a person before finding him guilty of the RVO specifications. Rather, as noted above, the trial court found “that the offense involved an attempt or a threat to cause physical harm to a person.” (Emphasis added.) Simply put, “physical harm” and “serious physical harm” represent two distinct legal standards and cannot be used interchangeably. Therefore, pursuant to the clear language in R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), the trial court failed to make the proper findings. Furthermore, although the trial court ostensibly found “that the offense involved * * * serious physical harm to a person,” there is no evidence in the record to support such a finding, with regard to Wright based on the evidence surrounding the robbery of the Fairborn Circle K. Thus, because the trial court failed to make the proper findings pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), it erred when it found Goney guilty of the RVO specifications.\"\n}\n```"}

In his first assignment, Goney contends that the trial court erred when it imposed a definite prison term for the RVOs. Specifically, Goney argues that pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b), the jury, not the trial court, was required to find that Goney attempted to cause, threatened to cause, or actually caused serious physical harm before the trial court could impose sentence for the RVO specifications. R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b) states in pertinent part: (b) The court shall impose on an offender the longest prison term authorized or required for the offense and shall impose on the offender an additional definite prison term of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten years if all of the following criteria are met: (i) The offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the Revised Code that the offender is a repeat violent offender. (ii) The offender within the preceding twenty years has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more offenses described in division (CC)(1) of section 2929.01 of the Revised Code * * * (iii) The offense or offenses of which the offender currently is convicted * * * (is) any felony of the second degree that is an offense of violence and the trier of fact finds that the offense involved an attempt to cause or a threat to cause serious physical harm to a person or resulted in serious physical harm to a person. Based upon the language in R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), Goney argues that the jury, not the trial court, was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he attempted to cause or threatened to cause serious physical harm, or that his actions resulted in serious physical harm. Each crime for which Goney was convicted required him to be found guilty of inflicting, attempting to inflict, or threatening to inflict only physical harm, not serious physical harm. Goney was ultimately convicted of Count I, robbery (R.C. 2911.02(A)(2)), Count III, kidnapping (R.C. 2905.01(A)(2)), and Count IV, abduction (R.C. 2905.01(A)(2)). As previously stated, the trial court merged Count IV into Count III. The trial court sentenced Goney to a mandatory eight years in prison for robbery. Upon finding Goney to be a repeat violent offender, the trial court imposed an additional two years in prison to be served consecutively to his eight-year robbery sentence. With respect to his sentence for kidnapping, the trial court sentenced Goney to a mandatory eight years in prison. Again, finding Goney to be a repeat violent offender, the trial court imposed an additional two years in prison to be served consecutively to his eight-year kidnapping sentence. The trial court then ordered that Goney’s sentences for Counts I and III be served consecutively to one another, for an aggregate sentence of twenty years in prison. R.C. 2911.02(A)(2) states in pertinent part: (A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following: (2) Inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on another[.] R.C. 2905.01(A)(2) states in pertinent part: (A) No person, by force, threat, or deception, * * *, shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, for any of the following purposes: (2) To facilitate the commission of any felony or flight thereafter[.] Initially, we note that we agree with the Eleventh District Court of Appeals in State v.

Evid.R. 404(B) provides that ‘[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.’ R.C. 2945.59 contains a similar provision. The evidence, even though offered for an admissible purpose, must be excluded ‘if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.’ Evid.R. 403(A). Prior to trial, the state filed a notice that it intended, pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), to use evidence of Barrow’s involvement in and conviction for another kidnapping. At trial, the state sought to introduce this evidence through testimony by Sergeant Howard Grant. Just prior to Grant’s testimony, defense counsel asked for a sidebar conference. He requested that the trial court provide a limiting instruction. The trial court stated that it would give a limiting instruction that the state was offering the testimony to show modus operandi and identity, to show that Barrow’s actions were purposeful, and that Barrow’s involvement was not part of a scheme with George. Grant then testified that he became aware that police were investigating an ongoing kidnapping and were concerned for the victim’s safety. He informed Detective Hilbert, the investigating officer, that six to seven months earlier he had investigated two kidnappings that were similar to the one Detective Hilbert was investigating. At that point, the trial court, at the state's request, gave the jury the following limiting instruction: ‘Evidence is about to be received about the commission of crimes or other acts other than the offense with which the defendant, Mr. Barrow, is charged in this trial. That evidence is being received only for a limited purpose. It is not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character. If you find that the evidence of other crimes or acts is true and that the defendant, Mr. Barrow, committed them you may consider that evidence only for the purposes of deciding whether it proves the defendant’s motive, intent, or purpose, preparation or plan to commit the offenses charged in this trial and also the identity of Mr. Barrow as well as the fact that he was not part of a plan or scheme involving -- with Mr. George.’ Sergeant Grant testified that in 2013 and 2014, he had investigated two kidnappings two weeks apart where an individual had been kidnapped and held for a large ransom. Barrow's counsel then asked to approach the bench. Defense counsel objected, arguing that Barrow had been investigated for two kidnapping incidents, but charged for only one of them. The court stated that the limiting instruction sufficiently covered these acts as well as any conviction, that the assistant prosecuting attorney would clarify that Barrow had been charged in connection with only one investigation, and that the defense counsel would have the opportunity to clarify that on cross-examination. Following the sidebar conference, Sergeant Grant testified that he had been investigating two kidnappings where the kidnapped individuals had relatives who were known participants in the drug trade and carried large sums of money. The kidnappers would make phone contact with the victim, lure the victim to a location, throw the victim into a van, and then drive to another location to bind the victim. The kidnappers would then contact the victim's family, threatening to kill the victim or his or her family members if they did not pay the ransom. Sergeant Grant testified that Barrow had been a suspect in both kidnapping investigations. He had been charged in connection with one of these kidnappings and he had pleaded guilty to kidnapping. Here, evidence of the first police investigation of Barrow and his prior kidnapping conviction was relevant and was admitted for proper purposes under Evid.R. 404(B). Barrow's defense at trial was that he did not lure George into his van and hold him for ransom, but that George had solicited Barrow to stage his own kidnapping to extort money from his family. Thus, Barrow placed his motive, plan, and intent at issue in the trial. Sergeant Grant's testimony was admissible to prove Barrow's motive and intent when he lured George into the van and held him for ransom. See State v. Johnson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23508, 2011-Ohio-1133, ¶ 55. Evidence that Barrow had engaged in an identical kidnapping scheme six to seven months earlier tended to disprove Barrow's assertion that the kidnapping was a ruse. Thus, the trial court did not err by admitting the evidence. While Barrow claims that the trial court's limiting instruction to the jury was not effective to correct any prejudice stemming from Sergeant Grant's testimony, he points to no specific instance of prejudice.

It is not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character. If you find that the evidence of other crimes or acts is true and that the defendant, Mr. Barrow, committed them you may consider that evidence only for the purposes of deciding whether it proves the defendant’s motive, intent, or purpose, preparation or plan to commit the offenses charged in this trial and also the identity of Mr. Barrow as well as the fact that he was not part of a plan or scheme involving -- with Mr. George.’ Sergeant Grant testified that in 2013 and 2014, he had investigated two kidnappings two weeks apart where an individual had been kidnapped and held for a large ransom. Barrow's counsel then asked to approach the bench. Defense counsel objected, arguing that Barrow had been investigated for two kidnapping incidents, but charged for only one of them. The court stated that the limiting instruction sufficiently covered these acts as well as any conviction, that the assistant prosecuting attorney would clarify that Barrow had been charged in connection with only one investigation, and that the defense counsel would have the opportunity to clarify that on cross-examination. Following the sidebar conference, Sergeant Grant testified that he had been investigating two kidnappings where the kidnapped individuals had relatives who were known participants in the drug trade and carried large sums of money. The kidnappers would make phone contact with the victim, lure the victim to a location, throw the victim into a van, and then drive to another location to bind the victim. The kidnappers would then contact the victim's family, threatening to kill the victim or his or her family members if they did not pay the ransom. Sergeant Grant testified that Barrow had been a suspect in both kidnapping investigations. He had been charged in connection with one of these kidnappings and he had pleaded guilty to kidnapping. Here, evidence of the first police investigation of Barrow and his prior kidnapping conviction was relevant and was admitted for proper purposes under Evid.R. 404(B). Barrow's defense at trial was that he did not lure George into his van and hold him for ransom, but that George had solicited Barrow to stage his own kidnapping to extort money from his family. Thus, Barrow placed his motive, plan, and intent at issue in the trial. Sergeant Grant's testimony was admissible to prove Barrow's motive and intent when he lured George into the van and held him for ransom. See State v. Johnson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23508, 2011-Ohio-1133, ¶ 55. Evidence that Barrow had engaged in an identical kidnapping scheme six to seven months earlier tended to disprove Barrow's assertion that the kidnapping was a ruse. Thus, the trial court did not err by admitting the evidence. While Barrow claims that the trial court's limiting instruction to the jury was not effective to correct any prejudice stemming from Sergeant Grant's testimony, he points to no specific instance of prejudice. The jury is presumed to follow the instructions, including curative instructions, given to it by the trial court judge. *State v. Loza*, 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 75, 641 N.E.2d 1082 (1994). The trial court, erred, however, in permitting Sergeant Grant to testify about the second kidnapping investigation where Barrow had been a suspect, but had not been charged with a crime. But error, if any, was harmless on this record. The state’s evidence against Barrow was overwhelming. We, therefore, overrule the first assignment of error.\"\n}\n```"}

Specifically, McGuire argues that if the position of Mac’s body appeared in the video to be even slightly altered from how it was described by Officer Williams, the state’s entire theory of the case would have been disrupted. This assertion is without merit. Applying the *Brady* analysis laid out above, McGuire’s claim here fails. Courts have consistently rejected *Brady* claims that are too speculative, requiring defendants to substantiate claims that the evidence in question was favorable and material. *See State v. Hancock*, 108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, 840 N.E.2d 1032, *State v. Hanna*, 95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, *State v. Hughes*, 8th Dist.

Not only is McGuire’s assertion that the body camera evidence might have supported a claim of self-defense speculative, it also ignores other evidence in the record that would refute such a theory — specifically, the location of the bullet wounds and the path of the bullets through Mac’s body. The bullets entered Mac’s body through the back of his thighs and pelvis and traveled up and across his body, with one bullet reaching his liver and another piercing his lung. The medical examiner explained in his testimony that this was consistent with the victim laying down in the vehicle with his legs up in a defensive posture. Such a position is also consistent with the eyewitness testimony of Sultan Muhammad. Finally, McGuire made statements to the police from the time of his arrest and through trial that he did not possess a gun and was not at the crime scene when Mac was shot. Therefore, even if body camera evidence existed that supported a self-defense theory of the case, McGuire is unable to show how he was prejudiced by this alleged Brady violation.\"\n}\n```"}

Blanton Jr.", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "DEFENDANT-APPELLANT’S CONVICTION FOR FELONIOUS ASSAULT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.", "discussion": "```json\n{\n  \"discussion\": \"Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for felonious assault. Appellant argues his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to prove he acted either as a principal offender or as a collective participant, given the video evidence and testimony regarding the timing of Lunsford’s being ‘sucker punched’ by one of the other inmates. The court finds the evidence sufficient to support the conviction, as the testimony and video footage demonstrate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. The court also finds that Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds the facts and circumstances indicate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Appellant is responsible for the natural and foreseeable consequences that follow in the ordinary course of events unfolding as a result of Appellant’s actions as instigator of the June 18, 2016 altercation. Furthermore, the facts and circumstances demonstrate Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds an earlier decision in our district, State v. Johnson, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 13CA3580, 2014-Ohio-4443, involving an altercation in a prison, to be instructive. There, Johnson claimed that despite the fact that he hit his victim in the face, the evidence was clear that the injuries to his victim’s shoulder and head were not from Johnson’s punch, but from a fall to the ground or possibly from the unrest that ensued after prison guards intervened in the prison fight. Johnson argued that the evidence failed to demonstrate that he knowingly caused serious physical harm to his victim, Officer Meier. Johnson pointed out while he may have knowingly caused physical harm to the officer in starting the incident by punching him in the head, it was the officer who escalated the incident by attempting to throw Johnson to the floor. The appellate court reasoned, however: ‘it is a fundamental principle that a person is presumed to intend the natural, reasonable and probable consequences of his voluntary acts.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 18, quoting State v. Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006–Ohio–791, 842 N.E.2d 966, ¶ 143. (Internal citations omitted.) ‘[T]he jury, unable to enter the mind of another, is required to consider common-sense, causal probabilities in considering whether the defendant acted ‘knowingly.’’ State v. Kelly, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2010–P–0049, 2012–Ohio–523, ¶ 23. We observed it was ‘unquestioned’ that Johnson set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to the officer. Furthermore, the jury could have reasonably inferred from those punches themselves that Johnson had caused serious physical harm to Meier resulting in his closed-head injury and recurring, debilitating headaches. Id. at 19.3 (Emphasis added.) We reasoned: ‘More importantly, Johnson could have reasonably foreseen that his unprovoked inmate attack on a prison guard would result in the guard he assaulted and other guards following prison protocol by attempting to restrain him by taking him down to the ground. Meier's injuries were consequently reasonably foreseeable to Johnson and they would not have occurred if Johnson had not started the altercation by punching Meier.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 21. ‘For the causation element, we noted the following in Smith at ¶ 24–26: Courts generally treat the issue of legal causation in the criminal context similarly to that in tort cases because the situations are closely analogous. See, generally, LaFave Substantive Criminal Law (2003), 2nd Ed., Section 6.4(c). When dealing with claims of intervening causation, the proper analysis starts with a determination of whether the intervening act was a mere coincidence or alternatively, a response to the accused's prior conduct. Id. at 6.4(f). * * * An intervening act is a response to the prior acts of the defendant where it involves reaction to the condition created by the defendant.* * * [T]he law will impose a less exacting standard of legal causation where the intervening cause is a response rather than a coincidence. A coincidence will break the chain of legal causation if it was unforeseeable.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 26. Even if Meier's actions constituted intervening acts, they were a reasonable, foreseeable response to the repeated punches by Johnson to his head rather than a mere coincidence. Because Meier's actions in attempting to restrain and neutralize Johnson were neither abnormal nor unforeseeable, they did not break the chain of causation so as to relieve Johnson from criminal liability for felonious assault related to the serious physical injuries incurred by Meier. *Id.* at 22. We held at ¶ 23, ‘Although Meier's injuries may not have been the “immediate or most obvious result” of Johnson's initial punches to Meier's head, they were the “natural and foreseeable consequences” of the actions that followed “in the ordinary course of events.” Therefore, we held after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. “The uncontroverted evidence was sufficient for the jury to determine that Johnson knowingly caused serious physical harm to Meier during his prison attack.” *Id.* at 24. Likewise, we hold that after viewing the evidence in light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Given the testimony that Appellant was the instigator, and “egged on” the fighting, it is unquestioned that Appellant, like Johnson, set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Like Johnson, Appellant could have reasonably foreseen that his creating the violent environment in the days leading up to the 18th and insisting that the men fight on the 18th, would result in the other inmates punching and kicking Lunsford. The other inmates’ actions constituted reasonable and foreseeable responses to Appellant’s initial actions in instigating the right. Another instructive case is In re Miller, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2000-A-0014, 2002-Ohio-3360. Here, Miller, a juvenile convicted of felonious assault at a party, stressed the fact that the testimony establishes several other people were kicking the victim in the head before he became involved in the fight. The appellate court noted it was impossible to sort out which blow to the victim’s head caused what amount of damage and observed at ¶31: ‘[As to the persons kicking the victim] Those actions caused serious physical harm. Assuming, for purposes of this point, that they did, a party cannot then jump on top of the victim bargaining only for a “regular” assault by hitting the victim in a manner that may not, under normal circumstances, cause serious physical harm. If, in fact, appellant did not enter the melee until the victim had already suffered serious physical harm, his actions are all the more inculpatory. Harm heaped on top of serious physical harm must itself be considered serious physical harm even if under different circumstances it may not have risen to that level. It is impossible to sort out which blow to the victim's head caused what amount of damage. Those that assaulted him all contributed jointly in the harm the victim suffered.’ Here, Appellant’s argument assumes that the only serious physical harm Lunsford suffered was a ‘possible concussion’ after the sucker punch which rendered him, via eyewitness and admittedly not expert opinion, unconscious. We disagree. The surveillance footage demonstrates Lunsford was obviously weakened and had fallen down when Blanton administered repeated blows to Lunsford’s head. Mefford described Lunsford’s injuries as follows: Q: After seeing Mr. Blanton, Mr. McKee and Mr. Michaels strike Gary did Gary have any injuries? A: Yes, Ma’am. * * * A: I seen blood coming out of [Gary’s] nose and stuff and several lacerations around his face and head area. Lunsford was the taken to the Adams County Hospital. At trial, he identified State’s exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, photographs of his injuries which depicted two black eyes; bruising of his eyes, ear, neck, stomach, and back; a busted lip; and a gash on his head. Dr. Richard Durbin, the emergency room doctor who treated Lunsford at Adams County Regional Medical Center on June 21, 2016, testified Lunsford had ‘obvious’ injuries to his face, and gave a history of being ‘knocked unconscious.’ Based on the subjective history, Dr. Durbin ordered a CT scan of the head and x-rays of the left elbow and chest. He testified there were no fractures seen. On cross-examination, Dr. Durbin testified Appellant was discharged in ‘fair’ condition back to the jail with a diagnosis of soft tissue injuries to the head, face, left lateral chest wall and left elbow. He was advised to follow up with the physician at the jail. On redirect, Dr. Durbin testified he ‘believed’ that Lunsford sustained a concussion. Even if Appellant was not responsible for the blow which may or may not have rendered Lunsford unconscious and caused a ‘possible concussion,’ we find sufficient evidence that Appellant caused serious physical harm. In State v. Adams, 2016-Ohio-7772, 84 N.E.3d 1155, (4th Dist.), we observed: ‘The degree of harm that rises to the level of ‘serious’ physical harm is not an exact science, particularly when the definition includes such terms as ‘substantial,’ ‘temporary,’ ‘acute,’ and ‘prolonged.’ ’ Id. at 26, quoting State v.

Appellant argues his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to prove he acted either as a principal offender or as a collective participant, given the video evidence and testimony regarding the timing of Lunsford’s being ‘sucker punched’ by one of the other inmates. The court finds the evidence sufficient to support the conviction, as the testimony and video footage demonstrate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. The court also finds that Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds the facts and circumstances indicate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Appellant is responsible for the natural and foreseeable consequences that follow in the ordinary course of events unfolding as a result of Appellant’s actions as instigator of the June 18, 2016 altercation. Furthermore, the facts and circumstances demonstrate Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds an earlier decision in our district, State v. Johnson, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 13CA3580, 2014-Ohio-4443, involving an altercation in a prison, to be instructive. There, Johnson claimed that despite the fact that he hit his victim in the face, the evidence was clear that the injuries to his victim’s shoulder and head were not from Johnson’s punch, but from a fall to the ground or possibly from the unrest that ensued after prison guards intervened in the prison fight. Johnson argued that the evidence failed to demonstrate that he knowingly caused serious physical harm to his victim, Officer Meier. Johnson pointed out while he may have knowingly caused physical harm to the officer in starting the incident by punching him in the head, it was the officer who escalated the incident by attempting to throw Johnson to the floor. The appellate court reasoned, however: ‘it is a fundamental principle that a person is presumed to intend the natural, reasonable and probable consequences of his voluntary acts.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 18, quoting State v. Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006–Ohio–791, 842 N.E.2d 966, ¶ 143. (Internal citations omitted.) ‘[T]he jury, unable to enter the mind of another, is required to consider common-sense, causal probabilities in considering whether the defendant acted ‘knowingly.’’ State v. Kelly, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2010–P–0049, 2012–Ohio–523, ¶ 23. We observed it was ‘unquestioned’ that Johnson set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to the officer. Furthermore, the jury could have reasonably inferred from those punches themselves that Johnson had caused serious physical harm to Meier resulting in his closed-head injury and recurring, debilitating headaches. Id. at 19.3 (Emphasis added.) We reasoned: ‘More importantly, Johnson could have reasonably foreseen that his unprovoked inmate attack on a prison guard would result in the guard he assaulted and other guards following prison protocol by attempting to restrain him by taking him down to the ground. Meier's injuries were consequently reasonably foreseeable to Johnson and they would not have occurred if Johnson had not started the altercation by punching Meier.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 21. ‘For the causation element, we noted the following in Smith at ¶ 24–26: Courts generally treat the issue of legal causation in the criminal context similarly to that in tort cases because the situations are closely analogous. See, generally, LaFave Substantive Criminal Law (2003), 2nd Ed., Section 6.4(c). When dealing with claims of intervening causation, the proper analysis starts with a determination of whether the intervening act was a mere coincidence or alternatively, a response to the accused's prior conduct. Id. at 6.4(f). * * * An intervening act is a response to the prior acts of the defendant where it involves reaction to the condition created by the defendant.* * * [T]he law will impose a less exacting standard of legal causation where the intervening cause is a response rather than a coincidence. A coincidence will break the chain of legal causation if it was unforeseeable.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 26. Even if Meier's actions constituted intervening acts, they were a reasonable, foreseeable response to the repeated punches by Johnson to his head rather than a mere coincidence. Because Meier's actions in attempting to restrain and neutralize Johnson were neither abnormal nor unforeseeable, they did not break the chain of causation so as to relieve Johnson from criminal liability for felonious assault related to the serious physical injuries incurred by Meier. *Id.* at 22. We held at ¶ 23, ‘Although Meier's injuries may not have been the “immediate or most obvious result” of Johnson's initial punches to Meier's head, they were the “natural and foreseeable consequences” of the actions that followed “in the ordinary course of events.” Therefore, we held after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. “The uncontroverted evidence was sufficient for the jury to determine that Johnson knowingly caused serious physical harm to Meier during his prison attack.” *Id.* at 24. Likewise, we hold that after viewing the evidence in light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Given the testimony that Appellant was the instigator, and “egged on” the fighting, it is unquestioned that Appellant, like Johnson, set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Like Johnson, Appellant could have reasonably foreseen that his creating the violent environment in the days leading up to the 18th and insisting that the men fight on the 18th, would result in the other inmates punching and kicking Lunsford. The other inmates’ actions constituted reasonable and foreseeable responses to Appellant’s initial actions in instigating the right. Another instructive case is In re Miller, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2000-A-0014, 2002-Ohio-3360. Here, Miller, a juvenile convicted of felonious assault at a party, stressed the fact that the testimony establishes several other people were kicking the victim in the head before he became involved in the fight. The appellate court noted it was impossible to sort out which blow to the victim’s head caused what amount of damage and observed at ¶31: ‘[As to the persons kicking the victim] Those actions caused serious physical harm. Assuming, for purposes of this point, that they did, a party cannot then jump on top of the victim bargaining only for a “regular” assault by hitting the victim in a manner that may not, under normal circumstances, cause serious physical harm. If, in fact, appellant did not enter the melee until the victim had already suffered serious physical harm, his actions are all the more inculpatory. Harm heaped on top of serious physical harm must itself be considered serious physical harm even if under different circumstances it may not have risen to that level. It is impossible to sort out which blow to the victim's head caused what amount of damage. Those that assaulted him all contributed jointly in the harm the victim suffered.’ Here, Appellant’s argument assumes that the only serious physical harm Lunsford suffered was a ‘possible concussion’ after the sucker punch which rendered him, via eyewitness and admittedly not expert opinion, unconscious. We disagree. The surveillance footage demonstrates Lunsford was obviously weakened and had fallen down when Blanton administered repeated blows to Lunsford’s head. Mefford described Lunsford’s injuries as follows: Q: After seeing Mr. Blanton, Mr. McKee and Mr. Michaels strike Gary did Gary have any injuries? A: Yes, Ma’am. * * * A: I seen blood coming out of [Gary’s] nose and stuff and several lacerations around his face and head area. Lunsford was the taken to the Adams County Hospital. At trial, he identified State’s exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, photographs of his injuries which depicted two black eyes; bruising of his eyes, ear, neck, stomach, and back; a busted lip; and a gash on his head.

Appellant is responsible for the natural and foreseeable consequences that follow in the ordinary course of events unfolding as a result of Appellant’s actions as instigator of the June 18, 2016 altercation. Furthermore, the facts and circumstances demonstrate Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds an earlier decision in our district, State v. Johnson, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 13CA3580, 2014-Ohio-4443, involving an altercation in a prison, to be instructive. There, Johnson claimed that despite the fact that he hit his victim in the face, the evidence was clear that the injuries to his victim’s shoulder and head were not from Johnson’s punch, but from a fall to the ground or possibly from the unrest that ensued after prison guards intervened in the prison fight. Johnson argued that the evidence failed to demonstrate that he knowingly caused serious physical harm to his victim, Officer Meier. Johnson pointed out while he may have knowingly caused physical harm to the officer in starting the incident by punching him in the head, it was the officer who escalated the incident by attempting to throw Johnson to the floor. The appellate court reasoned, however: ‘it is a fundamental principle that a person is presumed to intend the natural, reasonable and probable consequences of his voluntary acts.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 18, quoting State v. Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006–Ohio–791, 842 N.E.2d 966, ¶ 143. (Internal citations omitted.) ‘[T]he jury, unable to enter the mind of another, is required to consider common-sense, causal probabilities in considering whether the defendant acted ‘knowingly.’’ State v. Kelly, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2010–P–0049, 2012–Ohio–523, ¶ 23. We observed it was ‘unquestioned’ that Johnson set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to the officer. Furthermore, the jury could have reasonably inferred from those punches themselves that Johnson had caused serious physical harm to Meier resulting in his closed-head injury and recurring, debilitating headaches. Id. at 19.3 (Emphasis added.) We reasoned: ‘More importantly, Johnson could have reasonably foreseen that his unprovoked inmate attack on a prison guard would result in the guard he assaulted and other guards following prison protocol by attempting to restrain him by taking him down to the ground. Meier's injuries were consequently reasonably foreseeable to Johnson and they would not have occurred if Johnson had not started the altercation by punching Meier.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 21. ‘For the causation element, we noted the following in Smith at ¶ 24–26: Courts generally treat the issue of legal causation in the criminal context similarly to that in tort cases because the situations are closely analogous. See, generally, LaFave Substantive Criminal Law (2003), 2nd Ed., Section 6.4(c). When dealing with claims of intervening causation, the proper analysis starts with a determination of whether the intervening act was a mere coincidence or alternatively, a response to the accused's prior conduct. Id. at 6.4(f). * * * An intervening act is a response to the prior acts of the defendant where it involves reaction to the condition created by the defendant.* * * [T]he law will impose a less exacting standard of legal causation where the intervening cause is a response rather than a coincidence. A coincidence will break the chain of legal causation if it was unforeseeable.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 26. Even if Meier's actions constituted intervening acts, they were a reasonable, foreseeable response to the repeated punches by Johnson to his head rather than a mere coincidence. Because Meier's actions in attempting to restrain and neutralize Johnson were neither abnormal nor unforeseeable, they did not break the chain of causation so as to relieve Johnson from criminal liability for felonious assault related to the serious physical injuries incurred by Meier. *Id.* at 22. We held at ¶ 23, ‘Although Meier's injuries may not have been the “immediate or most obvious result” of Johnson's initial punches to Meier's head, they were the “natural and foreseeable consequences” of the actions that followed “in the ordinary course of events.” Therefore, we held after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. “The uncontroverted evidence was sufficient for the jury to determine that Johnson knowingly caused serious physical harm to Meier during his prison attack.” *Id.* at 24. Likewise, we hold that after viewing the evidence in light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Given the testimony that Appellant was the instigator, and “egged on” the fighting, it is unquestioned that Appellant, like Johnson, set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Like Johnson, Appellant could have reasonably foreseen that his creating the violent environment in the days leading up to the 18th and insisting that the men fight on the 18th, would result in the other inmates punching and kicking Lunsford. The other inmates’ actions constituted reasonable and foreseeable responses to Appellant’s initial actions in instigating the right. Another instructive case is In re Miller, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2000-A-0014, 2002-Ohio-3360. Here, Miller, a juvenile convicted of felonious assault at a party, stressed the fact that the testimony establishes several other people were kicking the victim in the head before he became involved in the fight. The appellate court noted it was impossible to sort out which blow to the victim’s head caused what amount of damage and observed at ¶31: ‘[As to the persons kicking the victim] Those actions caused serious physical harm. Assuming, for purposes of this point, that they did, a party cannot then jump on top of the victim bargaining only for a “regular” assault by hitting the victim in a manner that may not, under normal circumstances, cause serious physical harm. If, in fact, appellant did not enter the melee until the victim had already suffered serious physical harm, his actions are all the more inculpatory. Harm heaped on top of serious physical harm must itself be considered serious physical harm even if under different circumstances it may not have risen to that level. It is impossible to sort out which blow to the victim's head caused what amount of damage. Those that assaulted him all contributed jointly in the harm the victim suffered.’ Here, Appellant’s argument assumes that the only serious physical harm Lunsford suffered was a ‘possible concussion’ after the sucker punch which rendered him, via eyewitness and admittedly not expert opinion, unconscious. We disagree. The surveillance footage demonstrates Lunsford was obviously weakened and had fallen down when Blanton administered repeated blows to Lunsford’s head. Mefford described Lunsford’s injuries as follows: Q: After seeing Mr. Blanton, Mr. McKee and Mr. Michaels strike Gary did Gary have any injuries? A: Yes, Ma’am. * * * A: I seen blood coming out of [Gary’s] nose and stuff and several lacerations around his face and head area. Lunsford was the taken to the Adams County Hospital. At trial, he identified State’s exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, photographs of his injuries which depicted two black eyes; bruising of his eyes, ear, neck, stomach, and back; a busted lip; and a gash on his head. Dr. Richard Durbin, the emergency room doctor who treated Lunsford at Adams County Regional Medical Center on June 21, 2016, testified Lunsford had ‘obvious’ injuries to his face, and gave a history of being ‘knocked unconscious.’ Based on the subjective history, Dr. Durbin ordered a CT scan of the head and x-rays of the left elbow and chest. He testified there were no fractures seen. On cross-examination, Dr. Durbin testified Appellant was discharged in ‘fair’ condition back to the jail with a diagnosis of soft tissue injuries to the head, face, left lateral chest wall and left elbow. He was advised to follow up with the physician at the jail. On redirect, Dr. Durbin testified he ‘believed’ that Lunsford sustained a concussion. Even if Appellant was not responsible for the blow which may or may not have rendered Lunsford unconscious and caused a ‘possible concussion,’ we find sufficient evidence that Appellant caused serious physical harm. In State v. Adams, 2016-Ohio-7772, 84 N.E.3d 1155, (4th Dist.), we observed: ‘The degree of harm that rises to the level of ‘serious’ physical harm is not an exact science, particularly when the definition includes such terms as ‘substantial,’ ‘temporary,’ ‘acute,’ and ‘prolonged.’ ’ Id. at 26, quoting State v. Mango, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103146, 2016-Ohio-2935, ¶ 33. (Internal citations omitted.) The statute does not define ‘substantial suffering’; instead, the trier-of-fact must determine its existence from the facts of each particular case. State v. Bell, 1989 WL 10372, (Feb. 7, 1989), *2. (Internal citations omitted.) ‘Physical harm to persons’ means ‘any injury, illness, or other physiological impairment, regardless of its gravity or duration.’ R.C. 2901.01(A)(3) State v. Henry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 10002634, 2016-Ohio-692, ¶ 40. The Henry court observed that serious physical harm has been found where a victim sustains a bloody cut and/or significant swelling to the face because this is sufficient to establish serious physical harm in that it constitutes ‘temporary, serious disfigurement.’ Id. at ¶ 42. Courts have also determined that ‘serious physical harm’ exists ‘‘where the injuries caused the victim to seek medical treatment.’ ’ Adams, supra, at ¶ 30, quoting Scott, supra, at ¶ 3. (Internal citations omitted.) Within his sufficiency argument, Appellant is quick to discredit the testimony of Lunsford and the other ‘criminals.’ We are mindful, however, ‘ ‘A jury, sitting as the trier of fact, is free to believe all, part or none of the testimony of any witness who appears before it.’ ’ State v. Reyes–Rosales, 4th Dist. Adams No. 15CA1010, 2016–Ohio–3338, ¶ 17, quoting State v. West, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 12CA3507, 2014–Ohio–1941, ¶ 23. ‘A sufficiency assignment of error challenges the legal adequacy of the State's prima facie case, not its rational persuasiveness.’ State v. Oldaker, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 16CA3, 2017-Ohio-1201, ¶ 41, quoting State v. Koon, 4th Dist. Hocking No. 15CA17, 2016–Ohio–416, ¶ 17. ‘That limited review does not intrude on the jury's role ‘to resolve conflicts in testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.’ ’ Musacchio v. United States, 84 U.S.L.W. 4077, 136 S.Ct. 709, 715 (2016), quoting Jackson at 319, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781. Any doubts one might have as to the credibility of the witnesses’ testimony is dispelled by the surveillance footage which demonstrates Appellant restarting the wrestling match between Lunsford and Gray, and then repeatedly and viciously striking Lunsford’s head later when he is lying on the floor. The jury further had the photographic depiction of Lunsford’s serious, temporary disfigurement to his face and body. We find any rational trier of fact could have found proven beyond reasonable doubt that Appellant acted knowingly and created serious physical harm to Lunsford. For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit to Appellant’s first assignment of error. It is hereby overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

At trial, he identified State’s exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, photographs of his injuries which depicted two black eyes; bruising of his eyes, ear, neck, stomach, and back; a busted lip; and a gash on his head. Dr. Richard Durbin, the emergency room doctor who treated Lunsford at Adams County Regional Medical Center on June 21, 2016, testified Lunsford had ‘obvious’ injuries to his face, and gave a history of being ‘knocked unconscious.’ Based on the subjective history, Dr. Durbin ordered a CT scan of the head and x-rays of the left elbow and chest. He testified there were no fractures seen. On cross-examination, Dr. Durbin testified Appellant was discharged in ‘fair’ condition back to the jail with a diagnosis of soft tissue injuries to the head, face, left lateral chest wall and left elbow. He was advised to follow up with the physician at the jail. On redirect, Dr. Durbin testified he ‘believed’ that Lunsford sustained a concussion. Even if Appellant was not responsible for the blow which may or may not have rendered Lunsford unconscious and caused a ‘possible concussion,’ we find sufficient evidence that Appellant caused serious physical harm.

Appellant argues his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to prove he acted either as a principal offender or as a collective participant, given the video evidence and testimony regarding the timing of Lunsford’s being ‘sucker punched’ by one of the other inmates. The court finds the evidence sufficient to support the conviction, as the testimony and video footage demonstrate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. The court also finds that Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds the facts and circumstances indicate Appellant’s awareness of the probability that his conduct would result in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Appellant is responsible for the natural and foreseeable consequences that follow in the ordinary course of events unfolding as a result of Appellant’s actions as instigator of the June 18, 2016 altercation. Furthermore, the facts and circumstances demonstrate Appellant was an active participant in the actual physical violence. The court finds an earlier decision in our district, State v. Johnson, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 13CA3580, 2014-Ohio-4443, involving an altercation in a prison, to be instructive. There, Johnson claimed that despite the fact that he hit his victim in the face, the evidence was clear that the injuries to his victim’s shoulder and head were not from Johnson’s punch, but from a fall to the ground or possibly from the unrest that ensued after prison guards intervened in the prison fight. Johnson argued that the evidence failed to demonstrate that he knowingly caused serious physical harm to his victim, Officer Meier. Johnson pointed out while he may have knowingly caused physical harm to the officer in starting the incident by punching him in the head, it was the officer who escalated the incident by attempting to throw Johnson to the floor. The appellate court reasoned, however: ‘it is a fundamental principle that a person is presumed to intend the natural, reasonable and probable consequences of his voluntary acts.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 18, quoting State v. Conway, 108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006–Ohio–791, 842 N.E.2d 966, ¶ 143. (Internal citations omitted.) ‘[T]he jury, unable to enter the mind of another, is required to consider common-sense, causal probabilities in considering whether the defendant acted ‘knowingly.’’ State v. Kelly, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2010–P–0049, 2012–Ohio–523, ¶ 23. We observed it was ‘unquestioned’ that Johnson set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to the officer. Furthermore, the jury could have reasonably inferred from those punches themselves that Johnson had caused serious physical harm to Meier resulting in his closed-head injury and recurring, debilitating headaches. Id. at 19.3 (Emphasis added.) We reasoned: ‘More importantly, Johnson could have reasonably foreseen that his unprovoked inmate attack on a prison guard would result in the guard he assaulted and other guards following prison protocol by attempting to restrain him by taking him down to the ground. Meier's injuries were consequently reasonably foreseeable to Johnson and they would not have occurred if Johnson had not started the altercation by punching Meier.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 21. ‘For the causation element, we noted the following in Smith at ¶ 24–26: Courts generally treat the issue of legal causation in the criminal context similarly to that in tort cases because the situations are closely analogous. See, generally, LaFave Substantive Criminal Law (2003), 2nd Ed., Section 6.4(c). When dealing with claims of intervening causation, the proper analysis starts with a determination of whether the intervening act was a mere coincidence or alternatively, a response to the accused's prior conduct. Id. at 6.4(f). * * * An intervening act is a response to the prior acts of the defendant where it involves reaction to the condition created by the defendant.* * * [T]he law will impose a less exacting standard of legal causation where the intervening cause is a response rather than a coincidence. A coincidence will break the chain of legal causation if it was unforeseeable.’ Johnson, supra, at ¶ 26. Even if Meier's actions constituted intervening acts, they were a reasonable, foreseeable response to the repeated punches by Johnson to his head rather than a mere coincidence. Because Meier's actions in attempting to restrain and neutralize Johnson were neither abnormal nor unforeseeable, they did not break the chain of causation so as to relieve Johnson from criminal liability for felonious assault related to the serious physical injuries incurred by Meier. *Id.* at 22. We held at ¶ 23, ‘Although Meier's injuries may not have been the “immediate or most obvious result” of Johnson's initial punches to Meier's head, they were the “natural and foreseeable consequences” of the actions that followed “in the ordinary course of events.” Therefore, we held after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. “The uncontroverted evidence was sufficient for the jury to determine that Johnson knowingly caused serious physical harm to Meier during his prison attack.” *Id.* at 24. Likewise, we hold that after viewing the evidence in light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find that the essential elements of felonious assault had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Given the testimony that Appellant was the instigator, and “egged on” the fighting, it is unquestioned that Appellant, like Johnson, set into motion the sequence of events which resulted in serious physical harm to Lunsford. Like Johnson, Appellant could have reasonably foreseen that his creating the violent environment in the days leading up to the 18th and insisting that the men fight on the 18th, would result in the other inmates punching and kicking Lunsford. The other inmates’ actions constituted reasonable and foreseeable responses to Appellant’s initial actions in instigating the right. Another instructive case is In re Miller, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2000-A-0014, 2002-Ohio-3360. Here, Miller, a juvenile convicted of felonious assault at a party, stressed the fact that the testimony establishes several other people were kicking the victim in the head before he became involved in the fight. The appellate court noted it was impossible to sort out which blow to the victim’s head caused what amount of damage and observed at ¶31: ‘[As to the persons kicking the victim] Those actions caused serious physical harm. Assuming, for purposes of this point, that they did, a party cannot then jump on top of the victim bargaining only for a “regular” assault by hitting the victim in a manner that may not, under normal circumstances, cause serious physical harm. If, in fact, appellant did not enter the melee until the victim had already suffered serious physical harm, his actions are all the more inculpatory. Harm heaped on top of serious physical harm must itself be considered serious physical harm even if under different circumstances it may not have risen to that level. It is impossible to sort out which blow to the victim's head caused what amount of damage. Those that assaulted him all contributed jointly in the harm the victim suffered.’ Here, Appellant’s argument assumes that the only serious physical harm Lunsford suffered was a ‘possible concussion’ after the sucker punch which rendered him, via eyewitness and admittedly not expert opinion, unconscious. We disagree. The surveillance footage demonstrates Lunsford was obviously weakened and had fallen down when Blanton administered repeated blows to Lunsford’s head. Mefford described Lunsford’s injuries as follows: Q: After seeing Mr. Blanton, Mr. McKee and Mr. Michaels strike Gary did Gary have any injuries? A: Yes, Ma’am. * * * A: I seen blood coming out of [Gary’s] nose and stuff and several lacerations around his face and head area. Lunsford was the taken to the Adams County Hospital. At trial, he identified State’s exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, photographs of his injuries which depicted two black eyes; bruising of his eyes, ear, neck, stomach, and back; a busted lip; and a gash on his head.

Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997).\\n\\nOn appeal, courts'must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all of the reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the factfinder 'clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.'' Brentlinger, supra, at ¶ 36, quoting Thompkins at 387.\\n\\n'Only in exceptional cases, where the evidence 'weighs heavily against the conviction,' should an appellate court overturn the trial court's judgment.' State v. Little, 2016-Ohio-8398, 78 N.E.3d 323, ¶ 27 (3d Dist.), quoting State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 119.\\n\\nIn this case, Brown was convicted of corrupting another with drugs in violation of R.C. 2925.02(A)(3). Thus, the State had to establish that Brown (1) knowingly (2) by any means, furnished to another (3) a controlled substance (4) and thereby caused serious physical harm to that person. R.C. 2925.02(A)(3). 'A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature.' R.C. 2901.22(B). A controlled substance is 'a drug, compound, mixture, preparation, or substance included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V.' R.C. 3719.01(C). See R.C. 2925.01(A), R.C. 3719.41. The offense of corrupting another with drugs is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2925.02(C)(1)(a).\\n\\nFor a conviction of involuntary manslaughter, under R.C. 2903.04(A), the State had to establish that Brown (1) caused the death of another (2) as a proximate result (3) of the offender’s committing a felony. R.C. 2903.04(A). The 'criminal intent of involuntary manslaughter is supplied by the criminal intent to do the underlying unlawful act of which the homicide is a consequence.' State v. Potee, 2017-Ohio-2926, --- N.E.3d ---, ¶ 32 (12th Dist.). State v. Mansfield, 2016- defendant will be held responsible for those foreseeable consequences which are known to be, or should be known to be, within the scope of the risk created by his conduct. Here, that means that death reasonably could be anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result under these or similar circumstances.\\n\\n(Citations omitted.) State v. Shoemaker, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-06-12, 2006-Ohio-5159, ¶ 65 (holding the victim’s 'death, resulting from a morphine overdose, could have reasonably been anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result from Shoemaker’s trafficking in morphine.'), quoting Losey at 94-95.\\n\\nLegal Analysis\\n\\nAt trial, Jarrod’s brother testified that he discovered Jarrod on the morning of January 11, 2016. Tr. 357-358. Shortly thereafter, when the police arrived at Jarrod’s house on January 11, 2016, the police observed Jarrod on his back, lying next to his bed in his room. Tr. 358, 386-387. Jarrod had a hypodermic needle next to his body. Tr. 339, 385-386. On the dresser, the police found a Q-tip, syringe caps, a lighter, and a spoon with drug residue on it. Tr. 388-389. Ex. 11, 12. Deputy Thomas L. Miller ('Deputy Miller') of the Hancock County Sheriff’s Office testified that these were items frequently used in the administration of heroin. Tr. 388-392.\\n\\nMiller discovered a piece of brown paper on the dresser that contained a brown, powdery substance. Tr. 391-392. Kelsey Degen ('Degen'), a forensic scientist at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations, tested this substance on March 31, 2016. Tr. 563. Degen testified that this substance weighed one tenth of a gram and was composed of heroin and fentanyl. Tr. 573, 575. Ex. 34, 36. Dr. Mark Fox ('Dr. Fox'), the county coroner, testified that fentanyl is being added to heroin, which is leading to overdose deaths. Tr. 318. He then testified that he has also seen overdose deaths after fentanyl was used by itself. Tr. 318. Dr. Fox identified Jarrod’s death certificate during his testimony, which showed that Jarrod was pronounced dead at 7:43 A.M. on January 11, 2016. Tr. 313-314. Ex. 34.\\n\\nThe police also discovered Suboxone on Jarrod’s dresser. Tr. 390, 396. Ex. 12. Jarrod’s brother and sister testified that Jarrod had been prescribed Suboxone to help with his heroin addiction. Tr. 265, 329. Dr. Robert Fortney ('Dr. Fortney'), a toxicologist at the Lucas County Coroner’s Office, testified that Suboxone contains Buprenorphine and Naloxone. Tr. 552. Neither Buprenorphine nor Naloxone was listed in the toxicology report as being present in Jarrod’s system. Ex. 35. Dr. Fortney testified that these drugs would have been detected by the tests that he performed. Tr. 552. He also testified that Suboxone does not contain morphine. Tr. 551. The record does not indicate that any other drugs were found in Jarrod’s room, though marijuana paraphernalia was discovered 'tucked away' in a plastic container on the other side of Jarrod’s bed. Tr. 383, 396-397.\\n\\nDuring their investigation, the police discovered Jarrod’s phone on his bed. Tr. 242, 267, 384-385. At trial, the phone was identified by his mother, sister, brother, and Deputy Tom Miller of the Hancock County Sheriff’s Office. Tr. 244, 267, 344, 385. Michael testified that he had seen his brother texting from this phone throughout the day on January 10, 2016. Tr. 332. After examining the contents of the phone, the police discovered that Jarrod had been in contact with a person listed as 'Naythan Brown' in Jarrod’s phone’s contact list. Tr. 246-247, 332, 478.\\n\\nOfficer Fred Smith testified that he then interviewed Brown, who admitted that he had spoken with Jarrod on the night of January 10, 2016 and had texted with him that day. Tr. 468. Brown was also able to recite the first few digits of Jarrod’s phone number. Tr. 469. At trial, the text messages were identified by Officer Fred Smith. Tr. 475-476.\\n\\n| Time       | Type | From  | To    | Duration of Call/Content of Text                                      |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 12:40 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod| My bad I crashed                                                    |\n| 12:48 P.M. | Text | Jarrod| Brown | It’s all good brotha                                                |\n| 12:48 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod| Been at work since 11 just got my phone on trying to make a run when I get on break soon |\n| 12:52 P.M. | Text | Jarrod| Brown | Well where u gettin it from                                         |\n| 12:53 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod| Dude from yesterday unless drizzy has ima try him                  |\n| Time     | Type | From  | To     | Message                                                                 |\n|----------|------|-------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 12:55 P.M. | Text | Jarrod Brown | Brown | Ok well as long as it’s good s--- I’m down                              |\n| 12:56 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod | Either ones dank lol                                                   |\n| 12:56 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod | Ima have to hurry tho whenever I get break what u thinking?             |\n| 12:56 P.M. | Text | Jarrod | Brown | Well yeah but that same dude had diff stuff 2 days n a row              |\n| 12:58 P.M. | Text | Jarrod | Brown | I’ll take 80 my n--                                                    |\n| 12:58 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod | I think the first was cuz its all be had left and alright soon as I hit break I’ll b with ya |\n| 12:59 P.M. | Text | Jarrod | Brown | Ok.

Tr. 489, 491-492. In his experience, 'points' was generally used as the measure of heroin as this is the drug that is sold in an amount that small. Tr. 491. He then testified that the number of shots referenced by Jarrod referred to the 'usage dose that he’s going to use as far as an injection * * *.' Tr. 493.\\n\\nHe also testified that the '80' in this series of text messages referred to a sum of cash. Tr. 483. Jarrod’s mother testified at trial that she knew about Jarrod’s drug addiction. To help him, she would monitor his bank account and would watch for withdrawals of forty or eighty dollars because these were the amounts that he would withdraw if he wanted to purchase drugs. Tr. 249-250. Further, Detective Fred Smith testified that the Econo Lodge was a location in Findlay that was known for drug trafficking. Tr. 488.

As this segment of the text messages was introduced at trial, Detective Fred Smith testified that 'a G is what they refer to for a gram.' Tr. 496.\\n\\nMichael testified at trial that he was home 'all day.' Tr. 332. He also testified that his house, where he and Jarrod lived at the time of Jarrod’s death, was in close proximity to Outback. Tr. 324. He also testified that Jarrod did not have a driver’s license and was 'hanging out at the house' during the day on January 10, 2016. Tr. 332. He testified that Jarrod would occasionally step outside into the garage to smoke a cigarette because the terms of their lease prohibited smoking inside the house. Tr. 333. He also said that Jarrod 'had his cell phone on him at all times. * * * [W]hen I would see him out in the garage texting he would just be smoking a cigarette or texting.' Tr. 332-333. Michael then testified that he did not see anyone else come inside his house on January 10, 2016. Tr. 342. Michael testified that Jarrod left the house around '10:30-ish' P.M.¹ Tr. 334. Michael observed Jarrod 'putting on his shoes, he had his coat on, he was putting on his shoes about to exit the garage door to go inside the garage and that was the last time I saw him.' Tr. 334.\\n\\n¹ On January 11, 2016, Michael told the police that he believed he went to bed at 11:00 P.M. on the night of January 10, 2016. Tr. 347. At trial, Michael stated that he usually went to bed in between 10:00 and 10:30 P.M. Tr. 334. He testified that he saw Jarrod after he (Michael) got up to get a glass of water. Tr. 334. He also testified that he was unsure as to what time he went to bed on the night of January 10, 2016. Tr. 334. Since he usually went to bed around 10:00 P.M., he thought that he saw Jarrod leaving the house at around 10:30 P.M. Tr. 334.\\n\\nLater at trial, Dr. Fortney testified that Jarrod had cocaine, morphine, and fentanyl in his system at the time of his death. Tr. 535-536, 537, 540. Ex. 35. However, the cocaine was not in Jarrod’s blood, indicating to Dr. Fortney that Jarrod used cocaine at some point on the day of his death; that he was not under the influence of cocaine at the time of his death; and that 'the cocaine was not used near the time of his death.' Tr. 540. Further, the level of morphine in Jarrod’s system was relatively low and was not the cause of death. Tr. 537. The morphine that was present in Jarrod’s system was consistent with heroin use and indicated that Jarrod had used either heroin or morphine within several hours of his death. Tr. 537-538. Ex. 35. However, Dr. Fortney could not, based upon the results of these tests, conclude with medical certainty whether Jarrod had taken heroin or morphine. Tr. 538.\\n\\nThe toxicology report indicated that Jarrod had eighteen nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter of his blood. Tr. 519, 547-548. At trial, Dr. Fortney testified that a level of five nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter of blood was fatal and that therapeutic range of fentanyl use was between one or two nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter of blood. Tr. 547-548. Based on the results in this report, he determined that the cause of death was the fentanyl, stating that 'but for the fentanyl there would be no death.' Tr. 550. Dr. Fortney further testified that 'the cause of death is respiratory depression but what caused the respiratory depression [was] the fentanyl.' Tr. 547. Dr. Fortney could not pinpoint the exact time of death, but he was able to conclude that death occurred shortly after Jarrod introduced the fentanyl into his system. Tr. 549. He also testified that fentanyl is a Schedule II drug under Ohio law. Tr. 543.\\n\\nFollowing our decision in State v. Kramer, 3d Dist. Defiance No. 4-15-14, 2016-Ohio-2984, we conclude that neither of Brown’s convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. We find that competent, credible evidence exists as to all elements of each indicted charge. We do not find evidence in the record that indicates the jurors lost their way and made a decision that constitutes a manifest miscarriage of justice. The facts of this case do not present one of the exceptional circumstances in which a reversal of the jury’s verdict is warranted. Kramer at ¶ 56, citing State v. Haller, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-11-34, 2012-Ohio-5233, ¶ 9. For these reasons, appellant’s second assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

First, appellant argues that the State did not establish that Brown furnished Jarrod with fentanyl. Second, appellant argues that any evidence that the State did provide suggesting that Brown provided Jarrod with fentanyl was contradicted by other evidence.\\n\\nLegal Standard\\n\\nWhen 'deciding whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court determines whether the state has appropriately carried its burden of persuasion.' State v. Blanton, 121 Ohio App.3d 162, 169, 699 N.E.2d 136 (3d Dist.1997). 'Unlike our review of the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court’s function when reviewing the weight of the evidence is to determine whether the greater amount of credible evidence supports the verdict.' State v. Plott, 2017-Ohio-38, 80 N.E.3d 1108, ¶ 73 (3d Dist.). 'In a manifest weight analysis, 'the appellate court sits as a 'thirteenth juror' * * *.'' State v. Davis, 3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-16-30, 2017-Ohio-2916, ¶ 17, quoting State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997).\\n\\nOn appeal, courts'must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all of the reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the factfinder 'clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.'' Brentlinger, supra, at ¶ 36, quoting Thompkins at 387.\\n\\n'Only in exceptional cases, where the evidence 'weighs heavily against the conviction,' should an appellate court overturn the trial court's judgment.' State v. Little, 2016-Ohio-8398, 78 N.E.3d 323, ¶ 27 (3d Dist.), quoting State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 119.\\n\\nIn this case, Brown was convicted of corrupting another with drugs in violation of R.C. 2925.02(A)(3). Thus, the State had to establish that Brown (1) knowingly (2) by any means, furnished to another (3) a controlled substance (4) and thereby caused serious physical harm to that person. R.C. 2925.02(A)(3). 'A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature.' R.C. 2901.22(B). A controlled substance is 'a drug, compound, mixture, preparation, or substance included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V.' R.C. 3719.01(C). See R.C. 2925.01(A), R.C. 3719.41. The offense of corrupting another with drugs is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2925.02(C)(1)(a).\\n\\nFor a conviction of involuntary manslaughter, under R.C. 2903.04(A), the State had to establish that Brown (1) caused the death of another (2) as a proximate result (3) of the offender’s committing a felony. R.C. 2903.04(A). The 'criminal intent of involuntary manslaughter is supplied by the criminal intent to do the underlying unlawful act of which the homicide is a consequence.' State v. Potee, 2017-Ohio-2926, --- N.E.3d ---, ¶ 32 (12th Dist.). State v. Mansfield, 2016- defendant will be held responsible for those foreseeable consequences which are known to be, or should be known to be, within the scope of the risk created by his conduct. Here, that means that death reasonably could be anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result under these or similar circumstances.\\n\\n(Citations omitted.) State v. Shoemaker, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-06-12, 2006-Ohio-5159, ¶ 65 (holding the victim’s 'death, resulting from a morphine overdose, could have reasonably been anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result from Shoemaker’s trafficking in morphine.'), quoting Losey at 94-95.\\n\\nLegal Analysis\\n\\nAt trial, Jarrod’s brother testified that he discovered Jarrod on the morning of January 11, 2016. Tr. 357-358. Shortly thereafter, when the police arrived at Jarrod’s house on January 11, 2016, the police observed Jarrod on his back, lying next to his bed in his room. Tr. 358, 386-387. Jarrod had a hypodermic needle next to his body. Tr. 339, 385-386. On the dresser, the police found a Q-tip, syringe caps, a lighter, and a spoon with drug residue on it. Tr. 388-389. Ex. 11, 12. Deputy Thomas L. Miller ('Deputy Miller') of the Hancock County Sheriff’s Office testified that these were items frequently used in the administration of heroin. Tr. 388-392.\\n\\nMiller discovered a piece of brown paper on the dresser that contained a brown, powdery substance. Tr. 391-392. Kelsey Degen ('Degen'), a forensic scientist at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations, tested this substance on March 31, 2016. Tr. 563. Degen testified that this substance weighed one tenth of a gram and was composed of heroin and fentanyl. Tr. 573, 575. Ex. 34, 36. Dr. Mark Fox ('Dr. Fox'), the county coroner, testified that fentanyl is being added to heroin, which is leading to overdose deaths. Tr. 318. He then testified that he has also seen overdose deaths after fentanyl was used by itself. Tr. 318. Dr. Fox identified Jarrod’s death certificate during his testimony, which showed that Jarrod was pronounced dead at 7:43 A.M. on January 11, 2016. Tr. 313-314. Ex. 34.\\n\\nThe police also discovered Suboxone on Jarrod’s dresser. Tr. 390, 396. Ex. 12. Jarrod’s brother and sister testified that Jarrod had been prescribed Suboxone to help with his heroin addiction. Tr. 265, 329. Dr. Robert Fortney ('Dr. Fortney'), a toxicologist at the Lucas County Coroner’s Office, testified that Suboxone contains Buprenorphine and Naloxone. Tr. 552. Neither Buprenorphine nor Naloxone was listed in the toxicology report as being present in Jarrod’s system. Ex. 35. Dr. Fortney testified that these drugs would have been detected by the tests that he performed. Tr. 552. He also testified that Suboxone does not contain morphine. Tr. 551. The record does not indicate that any other drugs were found in Jarrod’s room, though marijuana paraphernalia was discovered 'tucked away' in a plastic container on the other side of Jarrod’s bed. Tr. 383, 396-397.\\n\\nDuring their investigation, the police discovered Jarrod’s phone on his bed. Tr. 242, 267, 384-385. At trial, the phone was identified by his mother, sister, brother, and Deputy Tom Miller of the Hancock County Sheriff’s Office. Tr. 244, 267, 344, 385. Michael testified that he had seen his brother texting from this phone throughout the day on January 10, 2016. Tr. 332. After examining the contents of the phone, the police discovered that Jarrod had been in contact with a person listed as 'Naythan Brown' in Jarrod’s phone’s contact list. Tr. 246-247, 332, 478.\\n\\nOfficer Fred Smith testified that he then interviewed Brown, who admitted that he had spoken with Jarrod on the night of January 10, 2016 and had texted with him that day. Tr. 468. Brown was also able to recite the first few digits of Jarrod’s phone number. Tr. 469. At trial, the text messages were identified by Officer Fred Smith. Tr. 475-476.\\n\\n| Time       | Type | From  | To    | Duration of Call/Content of Text                                      |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 12:40 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod| My bad I crashed                                                    |\n| 12:48 P.M. | Text | Jarrod| Brown | It’s all good brotha                                                |\n| 12:48 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod| Been at work since 11 just got my phone on trying to make a run when I get on break soon |\n| 12:52 P.M. | Text | Jarrod| Brown | Well where u gettin it from                                         |\n| 12:53 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod| Dude from yesterday unless drizzy has ima try him                  |\n| Time     | Type | From  | To     | Message                                                                 |\n|----------|------|-------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 12:55 P.M. | Text | Jarrod Brown | Brown | Ok well as long as it’s good s--- I’m down                              |\n| 12:56 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod | Either ones dank lol                                                   |\n| 12:56 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod | Ima have to hurry tho whenever I get break what u thinking?             |\n| 12:56 P.M. | Text | Jarrod | Brown | Well yeah but that same dude had diff stuff 2 days n a row              |\n| 12:58 P.M. | Text | Jarrod | Brown | I’ll take 80 my n--                                                    |\n| 12:58 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod | I think the first was cuz its all be had left and alright soon as I hit break I’ll b with ya |\n| 12:59 P.M. | Text | Jarrod | Brown | Ok.

Tr. 489, 491-492. In his experience, 'points' was generally used as the measure of heroin as this is the drug that is sold in an amount that small. Tr. 491. He then testified that the number of shots referenced by Jarrod referred to the 'usage dose that he’s going to use as far as an injection * * *.' Tr. 493.\\n\\nHe also testified that the '80' in this series of text messages referred to a sum of cash. Tr. 483. Jarrod’s mother testified at trial that she knew about Jarrod’s drug addiction. To help him, she would monitor his bank account and would watch for withdrawals of forty or eighty dollars because these were the amounts that he would withdraw if he wanted to purchase drugs. Tr. 249-250. Further, Detective Fred Smith testified that the Econo Lodge was a location in Findlay that was known for drug trafficking. Tr. 488.

As this segment of the text messages was introduced at trial, Detective Fred Smith testified that 'a G is what they refer to for a gram.' Tr. 496.\\n\\nMichael testified at trial that he was home 'all day.' Tr. 332. He also testified that his house, where he and Jarrod lived at the time of Jarrod’s death, was in close proximity to Outback. Tr. 324. He also testified that Jarrod did not have a driver’s license and was 'hanging out at the house' during the day on January 10, 2016. Tr. 332. He testified that Jarrod would occasionally step outside into the garage to smoke a cigarette because the terms of their lease prohibited smoking inside the house. Tr. 333. He also said that Jarrod 'had his cell phone on him at all times. * * * [W]hen I would see him out in the garage texting he would just be smoking a cigarette or texting.' Tr. 332-333. Michael then testified that he did not see anyone else come inside his house on January 10, 2016. Tr. 342. Michael testified that Jarrod left the house around '10:30-ish' P.M.¹ Tr. 334. Michael observed Jarrod 'putting on his shoes, he had his coat on, he was putting on his shoes about to exit the garage door to go inside the garage and that was the last time I saw him.' Tr. 334.\\n\\n¹ On January 11, 2016, Michael told the police that he believed he went to bed at 11:00 P.M. on the night of January 10, 2016. Tr. 347. At trial, Michael stated that he usually went to bed in between 10:00 and 10:30 P.M. Tr. 334. He testified that he saw Jarrod after he (Michael) got up to get a glass of water. Tr. 334. He also testified that he was unsure as to what time he went to bed on the night of January 10, 2016. Tr. 334. Since he usually went to bed around 10:00 P.M., he thought that he saw Jarrod leaving the house at around 10:30 P.M. Tr. 334.\\n\\nLater at trial, Dr. Fortney testified that Jarrod had cocaine, morphine, and fentanyl in his system at the time of his death. Tr. 535-536, 537, 540. Ex. 35. However, the cocaine was not in Jarrod’s blood, indicating to Dr. Fortney that Jarrod used cocaine at some point on the day of his death; that he was not under the influence of cocaine at the time of his death; and that 'the cocaine was not used near the time of his death.' Tr. 540. Further, the level of morphine in Jarrod’s system was relatively low and was not the cause of death. Tr. 537. The morphine that was present in Jarrod’s system was consistent with heroin use and indicated that Jarrod had used either heroin or morphine within several hours of his death. Tr. 537-538. Ex. 35. However, Dr. Fortney could not, based upon the results of these tests, conclude with medical certainty whether Jarrod had taken heroin or morphine. Tr. 538.\\n\\nThe toxicology report indicated that Jarrod had eighteen nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter of his blood. Tr. 519, 547-548. At trial, Dr. Fortney testified that a level of five nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter of blood was fatal and that therapeutic range of fentanyl use was between one or two nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter of blood. Tr. 547-548. Based on the results in this report, he determined that the cause of death was the fentanyl, stating that 'but for the fentanyl there would be no death.' Tr. 550. Dr. Fortney further testified that 'the cause of death is respiratory depression but what caused the respiratory depression [was] the fentanyl.' Tr. 547. Dr. Fortney could not pinpoint the exact time of death, but he was able to conclude that death occurred shortly after Jarrod introduced the fentanyl into his system. Tr. 549. He also testified that fentanyl is a Schedule II drug under Ohio law. Tr. 543.\\n\\nFollowing our decision in State v. Kramer, 3d Dist. Defiance No. 4-15-14, 2016-Ohio-2984, we conclude that neither of Brown’s convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. We find that competent, credible evidence exists as to all elements of each indicted charge. We do not find evidence in the record that indicates the jurors lost their way and made a decision that constitutes a manifest miscarriage of justice. The facts of this case do not present one of the exceptional circumstances in which a reversal of the jury’s verdict is warranted. Kramer at ¶ 56, citing State v. Haller, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-11-34, 2012-Ohio-5233, ¶ 9. For these reasons, appellant’s second assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

First, appellant argues that the State did not establish that Brown furnished Jarrod with fentanyl. Second, appellant argues that any evidence that the State did provide suggesting that Brown provided Jarrod with fentanyl was contradicted by other evidence.\\n\\nLegal Standard\\n\\nWhen 'deciding whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court determines whether the state has appropriately carried its burden of persuasion.' State v. Blanton, 121 Ohio App.3d 162, 169, 699 N.E.2d 136 (3d Dist.1997). 'Unlike our review of the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court’s function when reviewing the weight of the evidence is to determine whether the greater amount of credible evidence supports the verdict.' State v. Plott, 2017-Ohio-38, 80 N.E.3d 1108, ¶ 73 (3d Dist.). 'In a manifest weight analysis, 'the appellate court sits as a 'thirteenth juror' * * *.'' State v. Davis, 3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-16-30, 2017-Ohio-2916, ¶ 17, quoting State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997).\\n\\nOn appeal, courts'must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all of the reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the factfinder 'clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.'' Brentlinger, supra, at ¶ 36, quoting Thompkins at 387.\\n\\n'Only in exceptional cases, where the evidence 'weighs heavily against the conviction,' should an appellate court overturn the trial court's judgment.' State v. Little, 2016-Ohio-8398, 78 N.E.3d 323, ¶ 27 (3d Dist.), quoting State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 119.\\n\\nIn this case, Brown was convicted of corrupting another with drugs in violation of R.C. 2925.02(A)(3). Thus, the State had to establish that Brown (1) knowingly (2) by any means, furnished to another (3) a controlled substance (4) and thereby caused serious physical harm to that person. R.C. 2925.02(A)(3). 'A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature.' R.C. 2901.22(B). A controlled substance is 'a drug, compound, mixture, preparation, or substance included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V.' R.C. 3719.01(C). See R.C. 2925.01(A), R.C. 3719.41. The offense of corrupting another with drugs is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2925.02(C)(1)(a).\\n\\nFor a conviction of involuntary manslaughter, under R.C. 2903.04(A), the State had to establish that Brown (1) caused the death of another (2) as a proximate result (3) of the offender’s committing a felony. R.C. 2903.04(A). The 'criminal intent of involuntary manslaughter is supplied by the criminal intent to do the underlying unlawful act of which the homicide is a consequence.' State v. Potee, 2017-Ohio-2926, --- N.E.3d ---, ¶ 32 (12th Dist.). State v. Mansfield, 2016- defendant will be held responsible for those foreseeable consequences which are known to be, or should be known to be, within the scope of the risk created by his conduct. Here, that means that death reasonably could be anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result under these or similar circumstances.\\n\\n(Citations omitted.) State v. Shoemaker, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-06-12, 2006-Ohio-5159, ¶ 65 (holding the victim’s 'death, resulting from a morphine overdose, could have reasonably been anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result from Shoemaker’s trafficking in morphine.'), quoting Losey at 94-95.\\n\\nLegal Analysis\\n\\nAt trial, Jarrod’s brother testified that he discovered Jarrod on the morning of January 11, 2016. Tr. 357-358. Shortly thereafter, when the police arrived at Jarrod’s house on January 11, 2016, the police observed Jarrod on his back, lying next to his bed in his room. Tr. 358, 386-387. Jarrod had a hypodermic needle next to his body. Tr. 339, 385-386. On the dresser, the police found a Q-tip, syringe caps, a lighter, and a spoon with drug residue on it. Tr. 388-389. Ex. 11, 12. Deputy Thomas L. Miller ('Deputy Miller') of the Hancock County Sheriff’s Office testified that these were items frequently used in the administration of heroin. Tr. 388-392.\\n\\nMiller discovered a piece of brown paper on the dresser that contained a brown, powdery substance. Tr. 391-392. Kelsey Degen ('Degen'), a forensic scientist at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations, tested this substance on March 31, 2016. Tr. 563. Degen testified that this substance weighed one tenth of a gram and was composed of heroin and fentanyl. Tr. 573, 575. Ex. 34, 36. Dr. Mark Fox ('Dr. Fox'), the county coroner, testified that fentanyl is being added to heroin, which is leading to overdose deaths. Tr. 318. He then testified that he has also seen overdose deaths after fentanyl was used by itself. Tr. 318. Dr. Fox identified Jarrod’s death certificate during his testimony, which showed that Jarrod was pronounced dead at 7:43 A.M. on January 11, 2016. Tr. 313-314. Ex. 34.\\n\\nThe police also discovered Suboxone on Jarrod’s dresser. Tr. 390, 396. Ex. 12. Jarrod’s brother and sister testified that Jarrod had been prescribed Suboxone to help with his heroin addiction. Tr. 265, 329. Dr. Robert Fortney ('Dr. Fortney'), a toxicologist at the Lucas County Coroner’s Office, testified that Suboxone contains Buprenorphine and Naloxone. Tr. 552. Neither Buprenorphine nor Naloxone was listed in the toxicology report as being present in Jarrod’s system. Ex. 35. Dr. Fortney testified that these drugs would have been detected by the tests that he performed. Tr. 552. He also testified that Suboxone does not contain morphine. Tr. 551. The record does not indicate that any other drugs were found in Jarrod’s room, though marijuana paraphernalia was discovered 'tucked away' in a plastic container on the other side of Jarrod’s bed. Tr. 383, 396-397.\\n\\nDuring their investigation, the police discovered Jarrod’s phone on his bed. Tr. 242, 267, 384-385.

Tr. 489, 491-492. In his experience, 'points' was generally used as the measure of heroin as this is the drug that is sold in an amount that small. Tr. 491. He then testified that the number of shots referenced by Jarrod referred to the 'usage dose that he’s going to use as far as an injection * * *.' Tr. 493.\\n\\nHe also testified that the '80' in this series of text messages referred to a sum of cash. Tr. 483. Jarrod’s mother testified at trial that she knew about Jarrod’s drug addiction. To help him, she would monitor his bank account and would watch for withdrawals of forty or eighty dollars because these were the amounts that he would withdraw if he wanted to purchase drugs. Tr. 249-250. Further, Detective Fred Smith testified that the Econo Lodge was a location in Findlay that was known for drug trafficking. Tr. 488.

As this segment of the text messages was introduced at trial, Detective Fred Smith testified that 'a G is what they refer to for a gram.' Tr. 496.\\n\\nMichael testified at trial that he was home 'all day.' Tr. 332. He also testified that his house, where he and Jarrod lived at the time of Jarrod’s death, was in close proximity to Outback. Tr. 324. He also testified that Jarrod did not have a driver’s license and was 'hanging out at the house' during the day on January 10, 2016. Tr. 332. He testified that Jarrod would occasionally step outside into the garage to smoke a cigarette because the terms of their lease prohibited smoking inside the house. Tr. 333. He also said that Jarrod 'had his cell phone on him at all times. * * * [W]hen I would see him out in the garage texting he would just be smoking a cigarette or texting.' Tr. 332-333. Michael then testified that he did not see anyone else come inside his house on January 10, 2016. Tr. 342. Michael testified that Jarrod left the house around '10:30-ish' P.M.¹ Tr. 334. Michael observed Jarrod 'putting on his shoes, he had his coat on, he was putting on his shoes about to exit the garage door to go inside the garage and that was the last time I saw him.' Tr. 334.\\n\\n¹ On January 11, 2016, Michael told the police that he believed he went to bed at 11:00 P.M. on the night of January 10, 2016. Tr. 347. At trial, Michael stated that he usually went to bed in between 10:00 and 10:30 P.M. Tr. 334. He testified that he saw Jarrod after he (Michael) got up to get a glass of water. Tr. 334. He also testified that he was unsure as to what time he went to bed on the night of January 10, 2016. Tr. 334. Since he usually went to bed around 10:00 P.M., he thought that he saw Jarrod leaving the house at around 10:30 P.M. Tr. 334.\\n\\nLater at trial, Dr. Fortney testified that Jarrod had cocaine, morphine, and fentanyl in his system at the time of his death. Tr. 535-536, 537, 540. Ex. 35. However, the cocaine was not in Jarrod’s blood, indicating to Dr. Fortney that Jarrod used cocaine at some point on the day of his death; that he was not under the influence of cocaine at the time of his death; and that 'the cocaine was not used near the time of his death.' Tr. 540. Further, the level of morphine in Jarrod’s system was relatively low and was not the cause of death. Tr. 537. The morphine that was present in Jarrod’s system was consistent with heroin use and indicated that Jarrod had used either heroin or morphine within several hours of his death. Tr. 537-538. Ex. 35. However, Dr. Fortney could not, based upon the results of these tests, conclude with medical certainty whether Jarrod had taken heroin or morphine. Tr. 538.\\n\\nThe toxicology report indicated that Jarrod had eighteen nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter of his blood. Tr. 519, 547-548. At trial, Dr. Fortney testified that a level of five nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter of blood was fatal and that therapeutic range of fentanyl use was between one or two nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter of blood. Tr. 547-548. Based on the results in this report, he determined that the cause of death was the fentanyl, stating that 'but for the fentanyl there would be no death.' Tr. 550. Dr. Fortney further testified that 'the cause of death is respiratory depression but what caused the respiratory depression [was] the fentanyl.' Tr. 547. Dr. Fortney could not pinpoint the exact time of death, but he was able to conclude that death occurred shortly after Jarrod introduced the fentanyl into his system. Tr. 549. He also testified that fentanyl is a Schedule II drug under Ohio law. Tr. 543.\\n\\nFollowing our decision in State v. Kramer, 3d Dist. Defiance No. 4-15-14, 2016-Ohio-2984, we conclude that neither of Brown’s convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. We find that competent, credible evidence exists as to all elements of each indicted charge. We do not find evidence in the record that indicates the jurors lost their way and made a decision that constitutes a manifest miscarriage of justice. The facts of this case do not present one of the exceptional circumstances in which a reversal of the jury’s verdict is warranted. Kramer at ¶ 56, citing State v. Haller, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-11-34, 2012-Ohio-5233, ¶ 9. For these reasons, appellant’s second assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

First, appellant argues that the State did not establish that Brown furnished Jarrod with fentanyl. Second, appellant argues that any evidence that the State did provide suggesting that Brown provided Jarrod with fentanyl was contradicted by other evidence.\\n\\nLegal Standard\\n\\nWhen 'deciding whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court determines whether the state has appropriately carried its burden of persuasion.' State v. Blanton, 121 Ohio App.3d 162, 169, 699 N.E.2d 136 (3d Dist.1997). 'Unlike our review of the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court’s function when reviewing the weight of the evidence is to determine whether the greater amount of credible evidence supports the verdict.' State v. Plott, 2017-Ohio-38, 80 N.E.3d 1108, ¶ 73 (3d Dist.). 'In a manifest weight analysis, 'the appellate court sits as a 'thirteenth juror' * * *.'' State v. Davis, 3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-16-30, 2017-Ohio-2916, ¶ 17, quoting State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997).\\n\\nOn appeal, courts'must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all of the reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the factfinder 'clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.'' Brentlinger, supra, at ¶ 36, quoting Thompkins at 387.\\n\\n'Only in exceptional cases, where the evidence 'weighs heavily against the conviction,' should an appellate court overturn the trial court's judgment.' State v. Little, 2016-Ohio-8398, 78 N.E.3d 323, ¶ 27 (3d Dist.), quoting State v. Hunter, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 119.\\n\\nIn this case, Brown was convicted of corrupting another with drugs in violation of R.C. 2925.02(A)(3). Thus, the State had to establish that Brown (1) knowingly (2) by any means, furnished to another (3) a controlled substance (4) and thereby caused serious physical harm to that person. R.C. 2925.02(A)(3). 'A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature.' R.C. 2901.22(B). A controlled substance is 'a drug, compound, mixture, preparation, or substance included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V.' R.C. 3719.01(C). See R.C. 2925.01(A), R.C. 3719.41. The offense of corrupting another with drugs is a felony of the second degree. R.C. 2925.02(C)(1)(a).\\n\\nFor a conviction of involuntary manslaughter, under R.C. 2903.04(A), the State had to establish that Brown (1) caused the death of another (2) as a proximate result (3) of the offender’s committing a felony. R.C. 2903.04(A). The 'criminal intent of involuntary manslaughter is supplied by the criminal intent to do the underlying unlawful act of which the homicide is a consequence.' State v. Potee, 2017-Ohio-2926, --- N.E.3d ---, ¶ 32 (12th Dist.). State v. Mansfield, 2016- defendant will be held responsible for those foreseeable consequences which are known to be, or should be known to be, within the scope of the risk created by his conduct. Here, that means that death reasonably could be anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result under these or similar circumstances.\\n\\n(Citations omitted.) State v. Shoemaker, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-06-12, 2006-Ohio-5159, ¶ 65 (holding the victim’s 'death, resulting from a morphine overdose, could have reasonably been anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result from Shoemaker’s trafficking in morphine.'), quoting Losey at 94-95.\\n\\nLegal Analysis\\n\\nAt trial, Jarrod’s brother testified that he discovered Jarrod on the morning of January 11, 2016. Tr. 357-358. Shortly thereafter, when the police arrived at Jarrod’s house on January 11, 2016, the police observed Jarrod on his back, lying next to his bed in his room. Tr. 358, 386-387. Jarrod had a hypodermic needle next to his body. Tr. 339, 385-386. On the dresser, the police found a Q-tip, syringe caps, a lighter, and a spoon with drug residue on it. Tr. 388-389. Ex. 11, 12. Deputy Thomas L. Miller ('Deputy Miller') of the Hancock County Sheriff’s Office testified that these were items frequently used in the administration of heroin. Tr. 388-392.\\n\\nMiller discovered a piece of brown paper on the dresser that contained a brown, powdery substance. Tr. 391-392. Kelsey Degen ('Degen'), a forensic scientist at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations, tested this substance on March 31, 2016. Tr. 563. Degen testified that this substance weighed one tenth of a gram and was composed of heroin and fentanyl. Tr. 573, 575. Ex. 34, 36. Dr. Mark Fox ('Dr. Fox'), the county coroner, testified that fentanyl is being added to heroin, which is leading to overdose deaths. Tr. 318. He then testified that he has also seen overdose deaths after fentanyl was used by itself. Tr. 318. Dr. Fox identified Jarrod’s death certificate during his testimony, which showed that Jarrod was pronounced dead at 7:43 A.M. on January 11, 2016. Tr. 313-314. Ex. 34.\\n\\nThe police also discovered Suboxone on Jarrod’s dresser. Tr. 390, 396. Ex. 12. Jarrod’s brother and sister testified that Jarrod had been prescribed Suboxone to help with his heroin addiction. Tr. 265, 329. Dr. Robert Fortney ('Dr. Fortney'), a toxicologist at the Lucas County Coroner’s Office, testified that Suboxone contains Buprenorphine and Naloxone. Tr. 552. Neither Buprenorphine nor Naloxone was listed in the toxicology report as being present in Jarrod’s system. Ex. 35. Dr. Fortney testified that these drugs would have been detected by the tests that he performed. Tr. 552. He also testified that Suboxone does not contain morphine. Tr. 551. The record does not indicate that any other drugs were found in Jarrod’s room, though marijuana paraphernalia was discovered 'tucked away' in a plastic container on the other side of Jarrod’s bed. Tr. 383, 396-397.\\n\\nDuring their investigation, the police discovered Jarrod’s phone on his bed. Tr. 242, 267, 384-385. At trial, the phone was identified by his mother, sister, brother, and Deputy Tom Miller of the Hancock County Sheriff’s Office. Tr. 244, 267, 344, 385. Michael testified that he had seen his brother texting from this phone throughout the day on January 10, 2016. Tr. 332. After examining the contents of the phone, the police discovered that Jarrod had been in contact with a person listed as 'Naythan Brown' in Jarrod’s phone’s contact list. Tr. 246-247, 332, 478.\\n\\nOfficer Fred Smith testified that he then interviewed Brown, who admitted that he had spoken with Jarrod on the night of January 10, 2016 and had texted with him that day. Tr. 468. Brown was also able to recite the first few digits of Jarrod’s phone number. Tr. 469. At trial, the text messages were identified by Officer Fred Smith. Tr. 475-476.\\n\\n| Time       | Type | From  | To    | Duration of Call/Content of Text                                      |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 12:40 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod| My bad I crashed                                                    |\n| 12:48 P.M. | Text | Jarrod| Brown | It’s all good brotha                                                |\n| 12:48 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod| Been at work since 11 just got my phone on trying to make a run when I get on break soon |\n| 12:52 P.M. | Text | Jarrod| Brown | Well where u gettin it from                                         |\n| 12:53 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod| Dude from yesterday unless drizzy has ima try him                  |\n| Time     | Type | From  | To     | Message                                                                 |\n|----------|------|-------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 12:55 P.M. | Text | Jarrod Brown | Brown | Ok well as long as it’s good s--- I’m down                              |\n| 12:56 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod | Either ones dank lol                                                   |\n| 12:56 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod | Ima have to hurry tho whenever I get break what u thinking?             |\n| 12:56 P.M. | Text | Jarrod | Brown | Well yeah but that same dude had diff stuff 2 days n a row              |\n| 12:58 P.M. | Text | Jarrod | Brown | I’ll take 80 my n--                                                    |\n| 12:58 P.M. | Text | Brown | Jarrod | I think the first was cuz its all be had left and alright soon as I hit break I’ll b with ya |\n| 12:59 P.M. | Text | Jarrod | Brown | Ok.

Tr. 489, 491-492. In his experience, 'points' was generally used as the measure of heroin as this is the drug that is sold in an amount that small. Tr. 491. He then testified that the number of shots referenced by Jarrod referred to the 'usage dose that he’s going to use as far as an injection * * *.' Tr. 493.\\n\\nHe also testified that the '80' in this series of text messages referred to a sum of cash. Tr. 483. Jarrod’s mother testified at trial that she knew about Jarrod’s drug addiction. To help him, she would monitor his bank account and would watch for withdrawals of forty or eighty dollars because these were the amounts that he would withdraw if he wanted to purchase drugs. Tr. 249-250. Further, Detective Fred Smith testified that the Econo Lodge was a location in Findlay that was known for drug trafficking. Tr. 488.

As this segment of the text messages was introduced at trial, Detective Fred Smith testified that 'a G is what they refer to for a gram.' Tr. 496.\\n\\nMichael testified at trial that he was home 'all day.' Tr. 332. He also testified that his house, where he and Jarrod lived at the time of Jarrod’s death, was in close proximity to Outback. Tr. 324. He also testified that Jarrod did not have a driver’s license and was 'hanging out at the house' during the day on January 10, 2016. Tr. 332. He testified that Jarrod would occasionally step outside into the garage to smoke a cigarette because the terms of their lease prohibited smoking inside the house. Tr. 333. He also said that Jarrod 'had his cell phone on him at all times. * * * [W]hen I would see him out in the garage texting he would just be smoking a cigarette or texting.' Tr. 332-333. Michael then testified that he did not see anyone else come inside his house on January 10, 2016. Tr. 342. Michael testified that Jarrod left the house around '10:30-ish' P.M.¹ Tr. 334. Michael observed Jarrod 'putting on his shoes, he had his coat on, he was putting on his shoes about to exit the garage door to go inside the garage and that was the last time I saw him.' Tr. 334.\\n\\n¹ On January 11, 2016, Michael told the police that he believed he went to bed at 11:00 P.M. on the night of January 10, 2016. Tr. 347. At trial, Michael stated that he usually went to bed in between 10:00 and 10:30 P.M. Tr. 334. He testified that he saw Jarrod after he (Michael) got up to get a glass of water. Tr. 334. He also testified that he was unsure as to what time he went to bed on the night of January 10, 2016. Tr. 334. Since he usually went to bed around 10:00 P.M., he thought that he saw Jarrod leaving the house at around 10:30 P.M. Tr. 334.\\n\\nLater at trial, Dr. Fortney testified that Jarrod had cocaine, morphine, and fentanyl in his system at the time of his death. Tr. 535-536, 537, 540. Ex. 35. However, the cocaine was not in Jarrod’s blood, indicating to Dr. Fortney that Jarrod used cocaine at some point on the day of his death; that he was not under the influence of cocaine at the time of his death; and that 'the cocaine was not used near the time of his death.' Tr. 540. Further, the level of morphine in Jarrod’s system was relatively low and was not the cause of death. Tr. 537. The morphine that was present in Jarrod’s system was consistent with heroin use and indicated that Jarrod had used either heroin or morphine within several hours of his death. Tr. 537-538. Ex. 35. However, Dr. Fortney could not, based upon the results of these tests, conclude with medical certainty whether Jarrod had taken heroin or morphine. Tr. 538.\\n\\nThe toxicology report indicated that Jarrod had eighteen nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter of his blood. Tr. 519, 547-548. At trial, Dr. Fortney testified that a level of five nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter of blood was fatal and that therapeutic range of fentanyl use was between one or two nanograms of fentanyl per milliliter of blood. Tr. 547-548. Based on the results in this report, he determined that the cause of death was the fentanyl, stating that 'but for the fentanyl there would be no death.' Tr. 550. Dr. Fortney further testified that 'the cause of death is respiratory depression but what caused the respiratory depression [was] the fentanyl.' Tr. 547. Dr. Fortney could not pinpoint the exact time of death, but he was able to conclude that death occurred shortly after Jarrod introduced the fentanyl into his system. Tr. 549. He also testified that fentanyl is a Schedule II drug under Ohio law. Tr. 543.\\n\\nFollowing our decision in State v. Kramer, 3d Dist. Defiance No. 4-15-14, 2016-Ohio-2984, we conclude that neither of Brown’s convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. We find that competent, credible evidence exists as to all elements of each indicted charge. We do not find evidence in the record that indicates the jurors lost their way and made a decision that constitutes a manifest miscarriage of justice. The facts of this case do not present one of the exceptional circumstances in which a reversal of the jury’s verdict is warranted. Kramer at ¶ 56, citing State v. Haller, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-11-34, 2012-Ohio-5233, ¶ 9. For these reasons, appellant’s second assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Under this assignment of error, Hawkins contends that he suffered actual prejudice due to a delay of nearly 13 years between the alleged crime and the filing of the indictment. Hawkins’ claim of prejudice is based on the fact that the only two persons who could potentially corroborate what happened on the night in question are now deceased. ‘An unjustifiable delay between the commission of an offense and a defendant's indictment therefor, which results in actual prejudice to the defendant, is a violation of the right to due process of law under Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.’ State v. Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097 (1984), paragraph two of the syllabus. ‘Once a defendant presents evidence of actual prejudice, the burden shifts to the state to produce evidence of a justifiable reason for the delay.’ (Citations omitted.) State v. Jones, 148 Ohio St.3d 167, 2016-Ohio-5105, 69 N.E.3d 688, ¶ 13. Decisions on ‘actual prejudice’ involve ‘a delicate judgment based on the circumstances of each case.’’ State v. Walls, 96 Ohio St.3d 437, 2002-Ohio-5059, 775 N.E.2d 829, ¶ 52, quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 325, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971). To make this assessment, ‘courts are to consider the evidence as it exists when the indictment is filed and the prejudice the defendant will suffer at trial due to the delay.’ Walls at ¶ 52, citing Luck at 154. (Other citation omitted.) However, ‘speculative prejudice does not satisfy the defendant's burden.’ Jones at ¶ 20, citing Luck at ¶ 56. (Other citation omitted.) In the case before us, the trial court heard from the following witnesses at the evidentiary hearings in connection with Hawkins’ motion to dismiss: Brian Hawkins; Wayne Miller, Hawkins’ private investigator; Carol Ewing, a retired detective with the Dayton Police Department (“DPD”); Lindsey Dulaney, a current detective with the DPD Special Victims’ Unit (“SVU”); Gary Ware, an investigator with the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office; and Justin Hayes, a training detective for the DPD SVU. The testimony of these individuals revealed the following factual background. In July 2002, Ewing was a detective assigned to the DPD sexual assault child endangerment unit. Ewing was assigned a case involving A.J., who had allegedly been raped in the early morning hours of July 30, 2002, while she was a runaway from a foster home. The rape occurred outdoors behind the Wesley Center, which was located on Delphos Avenue, in Dayton, Ohio.¹ At the time, A.J. was fifteen years old. After the alleged rape, A.J. ran to a nearby Burger King, which was located a few blocks from the Wesley Center, and pounded on the restaurant’s door. A security guard answered and called the police, who transported A.J. to Dayton Children’s Hospital, where a rape kit was done. The rape kit was then sent to the Miami Valley Regional Crime Lab (“MVRCL”) for processing. Originally, based on information as to the assailant’s alleged nickname of ‘Twin,’ Ewing put together two photospreads, but A.J. did not pick out either of the suspected individuals. On August 6, 2002, A.J. provided Ewing with Brian Hawkins’ name, which A.J. had obtained from friends. Ewing compiled another photospread, and on August 14, 2002, A.J. identified Hawkins as the person who had committed the rape. Ewing interviewed Hawkins in his home on October 29, 2002, because he had been recently shot and could not walk. The interview was not recorded. Ewing would have noted in her report if Hawkins were heavily sedated or under the influence during the interview. She did not make such a notation. Ewing told Hawkins the date of the alleged offense, and he said he thought he might have been in the hospital at the time. Ewing later followed up and learned that Hawkins had been in the hospital on August 11, 2002, which was about a week and a half after the alleged rape. Ewing asked Hawkins if he knew someone with A.J.’s name, and he said he did not. He stated that he did not know A.J., that he would not have sex with a minor, and that he would not have sex outside. Hawkins did not provide Ewing with the names of any witnesses or an alibi. If Hawkins had given Ewing the names of witnesses, she would have followed up. Hawkins recalled talking to a detective in October 2002. He stated that he had just gotten shot and was sedated. Although he could not recall what the detective said, he also testified that she talked about a knife, which ‘threw’ him off. He said he thought they had the wrong person because he had never pulled a knife on anyone. The police did not show him any pictures of the victim. He also denied that he had said he would not have sex outside, as he had done that plenty of times. He claimed Ewing had lied in her report. In November 2002, Ewing was injured and her last day of work was February 2, 2004. During the interim, she had two surgeries and at some point was on restricted duty until she retired. She could not recall specific dates, other than that she had her first surgery in July 2003. In February or March 2003, Ewing received results back from MVRCL, indicating the presence of sperm in the rape kit. Ewing then obtained a court order in October 2003 for a buccal swab from Hawkins. At that point, Ewing was on restricted duty, and another detective obtained the sample from Hawkins. DPD did not receive the results from the DNA test until March 2004, which was after Ewing retired. Hawkins’ DNA was a match, and there would have been sufficient cause at that time for the police to present the case to the prosecutor’s office. Ewing’s notes on the case, including the photo spread, were kept in a packet, which was the official police file. There would have been a notation on the front concerning whether the case was closed or open. Ewing also kept her pending cases in a certain file cabinet. She did not know what happened to the case files after she left the DPD, and she did not recall if she specifically told someone that there were pending cases in the file cabinet. Hawkins continued to reside in the Dayton area and did not move out of state between 2002 and 2015. Nothing more was done on the case until January 2015, when Detective Dulaney received a phone call from the Miami County Prosecutor’s Office, indicating that the office had received a CODIS hit or DNA match on a case that was an investigation in the city of Dayton. The prosecutor sent Dulaney a copy of the 2004 lab report. Dulaney pulled the police report and saw that A.J.’s case had never been presented to the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office. After the case was assigned to her, Dulaney located A.J., and spoke with her. Dulaney also attempted to find Hawkins to obtain his side of the story, but could not locate him at the time. Dulaney was never able to locate Ewing’s packet, which contained the photo spread and Ewing’s notes. However, any notes that Ewing took and anything she did during her investigation would have been put into a police report. Dulaney was able to obtain a copy of the police report, because that was stored electronically. The police were also able to locate the following evidence: the 2002 rape kit, which was stored at the old Montgomery County Jail; Hawkins' buccal swab, which was still at MVRCL; and A.J.'s clothing, which was still intact. In addition, DPD was able to locate the following witnesses: the MVRCL employee who had processed the rape kit; the doctor and nurse who had collected the rape kit and who were still working at Dayton Children's Hospital; the Burger King security guard, who recalled speaking to A.J.; and the DPD officer who had responded to the call from the Burger King. This officer had retired from the DPD, but recalled the incident. After being unable to find Hawkins, Detective Dulaney entered a suspect locator into the police system, which meant that if police came into contact with Hawkins, he would be told that Dulaney wished to speak with him. After the locator was in the system for a time with no success, the prosecutor went to a grand jury and obtained a warrant for Hawkins' arrest. In May 2015, Dulaney was able to interview Hawkins. At the time, he was in jail and was transported to the Safety Building for an interview. Hawkins was told that he was there for an interview in connection with a rape investigation, and after being informed of his Miranda rights, agreed to speak with the police. Dulaney told Hawkins about the allegations, and Hawkins said it never happened and that he did not know A.J. Although Dulaney showed him photos of A.J. – one photo was older, and the other was recent – Hawkins still did not recall knowing A.J. During the interview, Hawkins did not give Dulaney the names or addresses of any witnesses. If he had given her names, she would have tried to locate the witnesses. At the pre-indictment hearing, Hawkins testified that he had reviewed the police report as part of discovery and did not deny having sex with A.J. He maintained that they agreed to have sexual relations and the activity was not due to force. According to Hawkins, he met A.J. around 3:00 a.m. on July 30, 2002, when he was leaving a ‘bootleg joint’ on Shoop Avenue in Dayton, Ohio. The bootleg joint was an after-hours place where people came to gamble, drink, and meet women. Hawkins stated that the bootleg joint had two security guards who checked identification and patted people down. They also had a metal detector, and would not let people in who had weapons like knives. In addition, no one under 18 years of age was allowed inside. Hawkins identified three people as potential witnesses: Bobby Cartwright, who worked as a security guard, Kevin Cartwright, who used to come to the bootleg joint, and Jermaine Hunter, who was present in the yard of the bootleg joint that night. The Cartwrights were Hawkins’ cousins, and could discuss security, as well as the fact that underage persons were not allowed, meaning that A.J. had lied about her age. Bobby was working that night, but would not have seen Hawkins and A.J., because he was inside. Jermaine Hunter was outside talking to A.J. when Hawkins left the bootleg joint, and was close enough to hear conversation between Hawkins and A.J. when she initially followed Hawkins away from the bootleg joint. Hunter could also testify that A.J. initiated contact with Hawkins. According to Hawkins, he had lost contact with these individuals and had not seen them for a number of years. He thought Hunter was in prison and had mental problems. Hawkins testified that when he left the bootleg joint, A.J. followed him. He stated that at the time, he stayed at different people’s houses. Consequently, he and A.J. went to different people’s houses but no one was there. Hawkins described walking to a house on Delphos Avenue, then to a house on Bedford Street, back to the house on Delphos, and next to another house located at Oakridge Drive and Tyson Avenue. On the way back from the last location, A.J. propositioned Hawkins for sex the whole time. According to Hawkins, he and A.J. then had a sexual encounter behind the Wesley Center. Afterward, they went to a house on Upland Avenue, where Hawkins’ friend, ‘Moochie,’ lived. Hawkins did not know Moochie’s real name; everyone just called him Moochie. When Hawkins and A.J. arrived at Moochie’s house, Hawkins told A.J. to stay outside, but she insisted on coming inside. Several people were at the house, including a woman named Tony Ousley, who was the mother of Hawkins’ friend, ‘Squiggy.’ Hawkins and Squiggy had both grown up in the same neighborhood. According to Hawkins, he told Ousley that he and A.J. had sex and that A.J. was 18 years old. While they were there, Ousley spoke to A.J., who verified that she and Hawkins had sex. When Hawkins and A.J. left, Ousley pulled him to the side and said he needed to get away from A.J. or he was going to get in trouble. Ousley specifically stated that A.J. was lying about her age. When Hawkins found out from Ousley that A.J. was too young, he walked with A.J. for a few blocks and then handed her a couple of dollars. At that point, A.J. became angry. Hawkins believed she was mad because she thought she was going to stay with him the rest of the night. By the time of the pre-indictment hearing, Moochie’s house and the house where the bootleg joint was had been torn down. Hawkins’ investigator, Wayne Miller, found the last known address of the Cartwrights, but was not able to actually locate them. He visited their last known address, but it looked vacant and vines were growing from beside the house onto the front door. Miller did locate Hunter, who was in a prison mental ward, and interviewed him. When shown a picture of A.J., Hunter said he had never seen her; he also said he could not recall ever visiting the bootleg joint on Shoop Avenue. Miller additionally discovered that Squiggy had been murdered in 2008 and that Tony Ousley passed away in 2011. At the hearing, Hawkins testified that Moochie was also dead and that he was not previously aware that Ousley had died. Hawkins said he could, however, have located both Moochie and Ousley in the past. As was noted, after the court heard the evidence, it concluded that Hawkins failed to prove actual, substantial prejudice. In particular, the court noted that its evaluation hinged on Hawkins’ credibility, and that Hawkins was not credible. In contending that the trial court erred, Hawkins argues that Ohio courts have not employed a credibility analysis in pre-indictment delay cases. Hawkins further contends that the facts of this case directly compare to those in Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097, where the Supreme Court of Ohio held that pre-indictment delay had prejudiced the defendant. We disagree with both assertions. As a preliminary matter, Ohio appellate courts have held that decisions on motions to dismiss for pre-indictment delay should be reviewed on the following basis: legal issues are reviewed de novo, but ‘the court’s findings of fact are afforded great deference.’ (Citations omitted.) State v. Powell, 2016-Ohio-1220, 61 N.E.3d 789, ¶ 11 (8th Dist.). See also State v. Zimbeck, 195 Ohio App.3d 729, 2011-Ohio-2171, 961 N.E.2d 1141, ¶ 20 (6th Dist.); State v. Winkle, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 12 MA 162, 2014-Ohio-895, ¶ 23; State v. Cochenour, 4th Dist. Ross No. 98CA2440, 1999 WL 152127, *1 (Mar. 8, 1999). We agree with these standards, which are consistent with standards of review for other pretrial matters like suppression motions. In suppression situations, trial courts hear evidence on factual points and must necessarily make decisions on witness credibility. See, e.g., State v. Burnside, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, ¶ 8; State v. Brown, 2016-Ohio-4973, 67 N.E.3d 1278, ¶ 7 (2d Dist.). As these decisions note, trial courts ‘are in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.’ Burnside at ¶ 8, citing State v. Mills, 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 366, 582 N.E.2d 972 (1992). In Luck, the Supreme Court of Ohio considered whether the defendant was prejudiced by a fifteen-year delay between the time of a murder and her indictment for the murder. Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d at 152, 472 N.E.2d 1097. The defendant, Katherine Luck, was one of the suspects originally interviewed around the time of the crime. However, after an initial investigation, the police could not gather any new evidence and took no official action for about fifteen years. Id. at 151. At that point, for reasons that were not clear in the record, an indictment was obtained against Luck, and she was arrested. Id. While under arrest, Luck made a confession at the police station, indicating that she had been physically attacked by the decedent, who was then killed in the fight that ensued. Id. at 157. According to Luck’s confession, another individual, who was her acquaintance (and who had also been an original suspect) was present at the time of the alleged murder. *Id.* She told the police that this person, who was the only one who could help her, was dead. *Id.* After concluding that the confession had been illegally obtained, the court found that defendant was ‘obviously prejudiced by not being able to seek verification of her story from [the deceased witness] and thereby establish mitigating factors or a defense to the charge against her.’ *Id.* at 158. Finding both actual prejudice and an unjustifiable delay by the State, the court affirmed the dismissal of the murder charge. *Id.* at 159. Unlike the defendant in *Luck*, Hawkins never asserted, either when he was originally interviewed in 2002, or when he was interviewed in 2015, that he had consensual sex with A.J. and that witnesses existed who could verify his story. Instead, he denied that he had been involved in any such incident. Consequently, *Luck* is not directly comparable to the case before us. In *State v. Dixon*, 2015-Ohio-3144, 40 N.E.3d 601 (8th Dist.), the State waited almost 20 years to indict a defendant for rape. *Id.* at ¶ 2. After the trial court dismissed the charge due to pre-indictment delay, the Eighth District Court of Appeals affirmed. Notably, in that case, two parole revocation hearings were held in 1993, shortly after the victim told the police that the defendant had raped her.² At the parole revocation hearings, the defendant admitted having sexual intercourse with the complainant, but claimed it was consensual. *Id.* at ¶ 6. The defendant was sent back to prison for the parole violation, but the State did not initiate any prosecution on the rape charge for almost 20 years, after the police ‘received a CODIS [Combined DNA Index System] hit confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation that they had made a preliminary association between a submitted rape kit and the Defendant.’  *Id.* Two witnesses who had testified at the parole revocation hearings were unavailable, including the defendant’s former employer, who was deceased.  *Id.* at ¶ 9. This witness, Norman Diamond, had testified at the revocation hearings that ‘he spoke with the alleged victim after the incident and the victim told Diamond that ‘she had feelings for [Dixon]’ and ‘if she could not have [Dixon], no one would.’  Diamond further testified that the alleged victim told him that the sexual encounter was ‘mutual with no force.’ ”  *Id.* In concluding that the defendant had established actual prejudice, the court commented that the case against the defendant hinged on the victim’s credibility.  *Id.* at ¶ 30. The court further observed that the testimony of the deceased witness directly supported the defendant’s assertion that the sex was consensual, and also undermined the victim’s testimony.  *Id.* Again, these facts are far different than those involved in the case before us. Hawkins never asserted that the sex was consensual or that witnesses existed. Hawkins also relies on *State v. Jones*, 148 Ohio St.3d 167, 2016-Ohio-5105, 69 N.E.3d 688, in which the court stated that a defendant’s ‘inability to articulate specifically what [a witness’s] testimony would have been does not render his claim of prejudice fatally speculative,’ as the court has ‘held that a defendant may establish actual prejudice where he or she is unable to seek verification of his or her story from a deceased witness.’  *Id.* at ¶ 28, citing *Luck*, 15 Ohio St. 3d at 157, 472 N.E.2d 1097. However, by making these comments, the court was not advancing a novel proposition of law; it was discussing its prior decision in Luck. Moreover, the issue in the case before us is not Hawkins’ inability to articulate the content of a deceased witness’s testimony; the relevant matter is that the trial court did not find Hawkins credible. As was noted, the trial court was in the best position to assess credibility, and we defer to the court’s factual findings. As a final matter, Hawkins contends that the State’s pre-indictment delay was not justifiable, as the police simply allowed the case to ‘slip through the cracks.’ Because Hawkins failed to meet his initial burden of proving actual prejudice, we need not consider this issue. See, e.g., Jones at ¶ 13, citing State v. Whiting, 84 Ohio St.3d 215, 217, 702 N.E.2d 1199 (1998), and State v. Adams, 144 Ohio St.3d 429, 2015-Ohio-3954, 45 N.E.3d 127, ¶ 99. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it concluded that Hawkins failed to establish actual prejudice. The First Assignment of Error, therefore, is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Under this assignment of error, Hawkins contends that he suffered actual prejudice due to a delay of nearly 13 years between the alleged crime and the filing of the indictment. Hawkins’ claim of prejudice is based on the fact that the only two persons who could potentially corroborate what happened on the night in question are now deceased. ‘An unjustifiable delay between the commission of an offense and a defendant's indictment therefor, which results in actual prejudice to the defendant, is a violation of the right to due process of law under Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.’ State v. Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097 (1984), paragraph two of the syllabus. ‘Once a defendant presents evidence of actual prejudice, the burden shifts to the state to produce evidence of a justifiable reason for the delay.’ (Citations omitted.)

Walls, 96 Ohio St.3d 437, 2002-Ohio-5059, 775 N.E.2d 829, ¶ 52, quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 325, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971). To make this assessment, ‘courts are to consider the evidence as it exists when the indictment is filed and the prejudice the defendant will suffer at trial due to the delay.’ Walls at ¶ 52, citing Luck at 154. (Other citation omitted.) However, ‘speculative prejudice does not satisfy the defendant's burden.’ Jones at ¶ 20, citing Luck at ¶ 56. (Other citation omitted.) In the case before us, the trial court heard from the following witnesses at the evidentiary hearings in connection with Hawkins’ motion to dismiss: Brian Hawkins; Wayne Miller, Hawkins’ private investigator; Carol Ewing, a retired detective with the Dayton Police Department (“DPD”); Lindsey Dulaney, a current detective with the DPD Special Victims’ Unit (“SVU”); Gary Ware, an investigator with the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office; and Justin Hayes, a training detective for the DPD SVU. The testimony of these individuals revealed the following factual background. In July 2002, Ewing was a detective assigned to the DPD sexual assault child endangerment unit. Ewing was assigned a case involving A.J., who had allegedly been raped in the early morning hours of July 30, 2002, while she was a runaway from a foster home. The rape occurred outdoors behind the Wesley Center, which was located on Delphos Avenue, in Dayton, Ohio.¹ At the time, A.J. was fifteen years old. After the alleged rape, A.J. ran to a nearby Burger King, which was located a few blocks from the Wesley Center, and pounded on the restaurant’s door. A security guard answered and called the police, who transported A.J. to Dayton Children’s Hospital, where a rape kit was done. The rape kit was then sent to the Miami Valley Regional Crime Lab (“MVRCL”) for processing. Originally, based on information as to the assailant’s alleged nickname of ‘Twin,’ Ewing put together two photospreads, but A.J. did not pick out either of the suspected individuals. On August 6, 2002, A.J. provided Ewing with Brian Hawkins’ name, which A.J. had obtained from friends. Ewing compiled another photospread, and on August 14, 2002, A.J. identified Hawkins as the person who had committed the rape. Ewing interviewed Hawkins in his home on October 29, 2002, because he had been recently shot and could not walk. The interview was not recorded. Ewing would have noted in her report if Hawkins were heavily sedated or under the influence during the interview. She did not make such a notation. Ewing told Hawkins the date of the alleged offense, and he said he thought he might have been in the hospital at the time. Ewing later followed up and learned that Hawkins had been in the hospital on August 11, 2002, which was about a week and a half after the alleged rape. Ewing asked Hawkins if he knew someone with A.J.’s name, and he said he did not. He stated that he did not know A.J., that he would not have sex with a minor, and that he would not have sex outside. Hawkins did not provide Ewing with the names of any witnesses or an alibi. If Hawkins had given Ewing the names of witnesses, she would have followed up. Hawkins recalled talking to a detective in October 2002. He stated that he had just gotten shot and was sedated. Although he could not recall what the detective said, he also testified that she talked about a knife, which ‘threw’ him off. He said he thought they had the wrong person because he had never pulled a knife on anyone. The police did not show him any pictures of the victim. He also denied that he had said he would not have sex outside, as he had done that plenty of times. He claimed Ewing had lied in her report. In November 2002, Ewing was injured and her last day of work was February 2, 2004. During the interim, she had two surgeries and at some point was on restricted duty until she retired. She could not recall specific dates, other than that she had her first surgery in July 2003. In February or March 2003, Ewing received results back from MVRCL, indicating the presence of sperm in the rape kit. Ewing then obtained a court order in October 2003 for a buccal swab from Hawkins. At that point, Ewing was on restricted duty, and another detective obtained the sample from Hawkins. DPD did not receive the results from the DNA test until March 2004, which was after Ewing retired. Hawkins’ DNA was a match, and there would have been sufficient cause at that time for the police to present the case to the prosecutor’s office. Ewing’s notes on the case, including the photo spread, were kept in a packet, which was the official police file. There would have been a notation on the front concerning whether the case was closed or open. Ewing also kept her pending cases in a certain file cabinet. She did not know what happened to the case files after she left the DPD, and she did not recall if she specifically told someone that there were pending cases in the file cabinet. Hawkins continued to reside in the Dayton area and did not move out of state between 2002 and 2015. Nothing more was done on the case until January 2015, when Detective Dulaney received a phone call from the Miami County Prosecutor’s Office, indicating that the office had received a CODIS hit or DNA match on a case that was an investigation in the city of Dayton. The prosecutor sent Dulaney a copy of the 2004 lab report. Dulaney pulled the police report and saw that A.J.’s case had never been presented to the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office. After the case was assigned to her, Dulaney located A.J., and spoke with her. Dulaney also attempted to find Hawkins to obtain his side of the story, but could not locate him at the time. Dulaney was never able to locate Ewing’s packet, which contained the photo spread and Ewing’s notes. However, any notes that Ewing took and anything she did during her investigation would have been put into a police report. Dulaney was able to obtain a copy of the police report, because that was stored electronically. The police were also able to locate the following evidence: the 2002 rape kit, which was stored at the old Montgomery County Jail; Hawkins' buccal swab, which was still at MVRCL; and A.J.'s clothing, which was still intact. In addition, DPD was able to locate the following witnesses: the MVRCL employee who had processed the rape kit; the doctor and nurse who had collected the rape kit and who were still working at Dayton Children's Hospital; the Burger King security guard, who recalled speaking to A.J.; and the DPD officer who had responded to the call from the Burger King. This officer had retired from the DPD, but recalled the incident. After being unable to find Hawkins, Detective Dulaney entered a suspect locator into the police system, which meant that if police came into contact with Hawkins, he would be told that Dulaney wished to speak with him. After the locator was in the system for a time with no success, the prosecutor went to a grand jury and obtained a warrant for Hawkins' arrest. In May 2015, Dulaney was able to interview Hawkins. At the time, he was in jail and was transported to the Safety Building for an interview. Hawkins was told that he was there for an interview in connection with a rape investigation, and after being informed of his Miranda rights, agreed to speak with the police. Dulaney told Hawkins about the allegations, and Hawkins said it never happened and that he did not know A.J. Although Dulaney showed him photos of A.J. – one photo was older, and the other was recent – Hawkins still did not recall knowing A.J. During the interview, Hawkins did not give Dulaney the names or addresses of any witnesses. If he had given her names, she would have tried to locate the witnesses. At the pre-indictment hearing, Hawkins testified that he had reviewed the police report as part of discovery and did not deny having sex with A.J. He maintained that they agreed to have sexual relations and the activity was not due to force. According to Hawkins, he met A.J. around 3:00 a.m. on July 30, 2002, when he was leaving a ‘bootleg joint’ on Shoop Avenue in Dayton, Ohio. The bootleg joint was an after-hours place where people came to gamble, drink, and meet women. Hawkins stated that the bootleg joint had two security guards who checked identification and patted people down. They also had a metal detector, and would not let people in who had weapons like knives. In addition, no one under 18 years of age was allowed inside. Hawkins identified three people as potential witnesses: Bobby Cartwright, who worked as a security guard, Kevin Cartwright, who used to come to the bootleg joint, and Jermaine Hunter, who was present in the yard of the bootleg joint that night. The Cartwrights were Hawkins’ cousins, and could discuss security, as well as the fact that underage persons were not allowed, meaning that A.J. had lied about her age. Bobby was working that night, but would not have seen Hawkins and A.J., because he was inside. Jermaine Hunter was outside talking to A.J. when Hawkins left the bootleg joint, and was close enough to hear conversation between Hawkins and A.J. when she initially followed Hawkins away from the bootleg joint. Hunter could also testify that A.J. initiated contact with Hawkins. According to Hawkins, he had lost contact with these individuals and had not seen them for a number of years. He thought Hunter was in prison and had mental problems. Hawkins testified that when he left the bootleg joint, A.J. followed him. He stated that at the time, he stayed at different people’s houses. Consequently, he and A.J. went to different people’s houses but no one was there. Hawkins described walking to a house on Delphos Avenue, then to a house on Bedford Street, back to the house on Delphos, and next to another house located at Oakridge Drive and Tyson Avenue. On the way back from the last location, A.J. propositioned Hawkins for sex the whole time. According to Hawkins, he and A.J. then had a sexual encounter behind the Wesley Center. Afterward, they went to a house on Upland Avenue, where Hawkins’ friend, ‘Moochie,’ lived. Hawkins did not know Moochie’s real name; everyone just called him Moochie. When Hawkins and A.J. arrived at Moochie’s house, Hawkins told A.J. to stay outside, but she insisted on coming inside. Several people were at the house, including a woman named Tony Ousley, who was the mother of Hawkins’ friend, ‘Squiggy.’ Hawkins and Squiggy had both grown up in the same neighborhood. According to Hawkins, he told Ousley that he and A.J. had sex and that A.J. was 18 years old. While they were there, Ousley spoke to A.J., who verified that she and Hawkins had sex. When Hawkins and A.J. left, Ousley pulled him to the side and said he needed to get away from A.J. or he was going to get in trouble. Ousley specifically stated that A.J. was lying about her age. When Hawkins found out from Ousley that A.J. was too young, he walked with A.J. for a few blocks and then handed her a couple of dollars. At that point, A.J. became angry. Hawkins believed she was mad because she thought she was going to stay with him the rest of the night. By the time of the pre-indictment hearing, Moochie’s house and the house where the bootleg joint was had been torn down. Hawkins’ investigator, Wayne Miller, found the last known address of the Cartwrights, but was not able to actually locate them. He visited their last known address, but it looked vacant and vines were growing from beside the house onto the front door. Miller did locate Hunter, who was in a prison mental ward, and interviewed him. When shown a picture of A.J., Hunter said he had never seen her; he also said he could not recall ever visiting the bootleg joint on Shoop Avenue. Miller additionally discovered that Squiggy had been murdered in 2008 and that Tony Ousley passed away in 2011. At the hearing, Hawkins testified that Moochie was also dead and that he was not previously aware that Ousley had died. Hawkins said he could, however, have located both Moochie and Ousley in the past. As was noted, after the court heard the evidence, it concluded that Hawkins failed to prove actual, substantial prejudice. In particular, the court noted that its evaluation hinged on Hawkins’ credibility, and that Hawkins was not credible. In contending that the trial court erred, Hawkins argues that Ohio courts have not employed a credibility analysis in pre-indictment delay cases. Hawkins further contends that the facts of this case directly compare to those in Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097, where the Supreme Court of Ohio held that pre-indictment delay had prejudiced the defendant. We disagree with both assertions. As a preliminary matter, Ohio appellate courts have held that decisions on motions to dismiss for pre-indictment delay should be reviewed on the following basis: legal issues are reviewed de novo, but ‘the court’s findings of fact are afforded great deference.’ (Citations omitted.) State v. Powell, 2016-Ohio-1220, 61 N.E.3d 789, ¶ 11 (8th Dist.). See also State v. Zimbeck, 195 Ohio App.3d 729, 2011-Ohio-2171, 961 N.E.2d 1141, ¶ 20 (6th Dist.); State v. Winkle, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 12 MA 162, 2014-Ohio-895, ¶ 23; State v. Cochenour, 4th Dist. Ross No. 98CA2440, 1999 WL 152127, *1 (Mar. 8, 1999). We agree with these standards, which are consistent with standards of review for other pretrial matters like suppression motions. In suppression situations, trial courts hear evidence on factual points and must necessarily make decisions on witness credibility. See, e.g., State v. Burnside, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, ¶ 8; State v. Brown, 2016-Ohio-4973, 67 N.E.3d 1278, ¶ 7 (2d Dist.). As these decisions note, trial courts ‘are in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.’ Burnside at ¶ 8, citing State v. Mills, 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 366, 582 N.E.2d 972 (1992). In Luck, the Supreme Court of Ohio considered whether the defendant was prejudiced by a fifteen-year delay between the time of a murder and her indictment for the murder. Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d at 152, 472 N.E.2d 1097. The defendant, Katherine Luck, was one of the suspects originally interviewed around the time of the crime. However, after an initial investigation, the police could not gather any new evidence and took no official action for about fifteen years. Id. at 151. At that point, for reasons that were not clear in the record, an indictment was obtained against Luck, and she was arrested. Id. While under arrest, Luck made a confession at the police station, indicating that she had been physically attacked by the decedent, who was then killed in the fight that ensued. Id. at 157. According to Luck’s confession, another individual, who was her acquaintance (and who had also been an original suspect) was present at the time of the alleged murder. *Id.* She told the police that this person, who was the only one who could help her, was dead. *Id.* After concluding that the confession had been illegally obtained, the court found that defendant was ‘obviously prejudiced by not being able to seek verification of her story from [the deceased witness] and thereby establish mitigating factors or a defense to the charge against her.’ *Id.* at 158. Finding both actual prejudice and an unjustifiable delay by the State, the court affirmed the dismissal of the murder charge. *Id.* at 159. Unlike the defendant in *Luck*, Hawkins never asserted, either when he was originally interviewed in 2002, or when he was interviewed in 2015, that he had consensual sex with A.J. and that witnesses existed who could verify his story. Instead, he denied that he had been involved in any such incident. Consequently, *Luck* is not directly comparable to the case before us. In *State v.

Nothing more was done on the case until January 2015, when Detective Dulaney received a phone call from the Miami County Prosecutor’s Office, indicating that the office had received a CODIS hit or DNA match on a case that was an investigation in the city of Dayton. The prosecutor sent Dulaney a copy of the 2004 lab report. Dulaney pulled the police report and saw that A.J.’s case had never been presented to the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office. After the case was assigned to her, Dulaney located A.J., and spoke with her. Dulaney also attempted to find Hawkins to obtain his side of the story, but could not locate him at the time. Dulaney was never able to locate Ewing’s packet, which contained the photo spread and Ewing’s notes. However, any notes that Ewing took and anything she did during her investigation would have been put into a police report. Dulaney was able to obtain a copy of the police report, because that was stored electronically. The police were also able to locate the following evidence: the 2002 rape kit, which was stored at the old Montgomery County Jail; Hawkins' buccal swab, which was still at MVRCL; and A.J.'s clothing, which was still intact. In addition, DPD was able to locate the following witnesses: the MVRCL employee who had processed the rape kit; the doctor and nurse who had collected the rape kit and who were still working at Dayton Children's Hospital; the Burger King security guard, who recalled speaking to A.J.; and the DPD officer who had responded to the call from the Burger King. This officer had retired from the DPD, but recalled the incident. After being unable to find Hawkins, Detective Dulaney entered a suspect locator into the police system, which meant that if police came into contact with Hawkins, he would be told that Dulaney wished to speak with him. After the locator was in the system for a time with no success, the prosecutor went to a grand jury and obtained a warrant for Hawkins' arrest. In May 2015, Dulaney was able to interview Hawkins. At the time, he was in jail and was transported to the Safety Building for an interview. Hawkins was told that he was there for an interview in connection with a rape investigation, and after being informed of his Miranda rights, agreed to speak with the police. Dulaney told Hawkins about the allegations, and Hawkins said it never happened and that he did not know A.J. Although Dulaney showed him photos of A.J. – one photo was older, and the other was recent – Hawkins still did not recall knowing A.J. During the interview, Hawkins did not give Dulaney the names or addresses of any witnesses. If he had given her names, she would have tried to locate the witnesses. At the pre-indictment hearing, Hawkins testified that he had reviewed the police report as part of discovery and did not deny having sex with A.J. He maintained that they agreed to have sexual relations and the activity was not due to force. According to Hawkins, he met A.J. around 3:00 a.m. on July 30, 2002, when he was leaving a ‘bootleg joint’ on Shoop Avenue in Dayton, Ohio. The bootleg joint was an after-hours place where people came to gamble, drink, and meet women. Hawkins stated that the bootleg joint had two security guards who checked identification and patted people down. They also had a metal detector, and would not let people in who had weapons like knives. In addition, no one under 18 years of age was allowed inside. Hawkins identified three people as potential witnesses: Bobby Cartwright, who worked as a security guard, Kevin Cartwright, who used to come to the bootleg joint, and Jermaine Hunter, who was present in the yard of the bootleg joint that night. The Cartwrights were Hawkins’ cousins, and could discuss security, as well as the fact that underage persons were not allowed, meaning that A.J. had lied about her age. Bobby was working that night, but would not have seen Hawkins and A.J., because he was inside. Jermaine Hunter was outside talking to A.J. when Hawkins left the bootleg joint, and was close enough to hear conversation between Hawkins and A.J. when she initially followed Hawkins away from the bootleg joint. Hunter could also testify that A.J. initiated contact with Hawkins. According to Hawkins, he had lost contact with these individuals and had not seen them for a number of years. He thought Hunter was in prison and had mental problems. Hawkins testified that when he left the bootleg joint, A.J. followed him. He stated that at the time, he stayed at different people’s houses. Consequently, he and A.J. went to different people’s houses but no one was there. Hawkins described walking to a house on Delphos Avenue, then to a house on Bedford Street, back to the house on Delphos, and next to another house located at Oakridge Drive and Tyson Avenue. On the way back from the last location, A.J. propositioned Hawkins for sex the whole time. According to Hawkins, he and A.J. then had a sexual encounter behind the Wesley Center. Afterward, they went to a house on Upland Avenue, where Hawkins’ friend, ‘Moochie,’ lived. Hawkins did not know Moochie’s real name; everyone just called him Moochie. When Hawkins and A.J. arrived at Moochie’s house, Hawkins told A.J. to stay outside, but she insisted on coming inside. Several people were at the house, including a woman named Tony Ousley, who was the mother of Hawkins’ friend, ‘Squiggy.’ Hawkins and Squiggy had both grown up in the same neighborhood. According to Hawkins, he told Ousley that he and A.J. had sex and that A.J. was 18 years old. While they were there, Ousley spoke to A.J., who verified that she and Hawkins had sex. When Hawkins and A.J. left, Ousley pulled him to the side and said he needed to get away from A.J. or he was going to get in trouble. Ousley specifically stated that A.J. was lying about her age. When Hawkins found out from Ousley that A.J. was too young, he walked with A.J. for a few blocks and then handed her a couple of dollars. At that point, A.J. became angry. Hawkins believed she was mad because she thought she was going to stay with him the rest of the night. By the time of the pre-indictment hearing, Moochie’s house and the house where the bootleg joint was had been torn down. Hawkins’ investigator, Wayne Miller, found the last known address of the Cartwrights, but was not able to actually locate them. He visited their last known address, but it looked vacant and vines were growing from beside the house onto the front door. Miller did locate Hunter, who was in a prison mental ward, and interviewed him. When shown a picture of A.J., Hunter said he had never seen her; he also said he could not recall ever visiting the bootleg joint on Shoop Avenue. Miller additionally discovered that Squiggy had been murdered in 2008 and that Tony Ousley passed away in 2011. At the hearing, Hawkins testified that Moochie was also dead and that he was not previously aware that Ousley had died. Hawkins said he could, however, have located both Moochie and Ousley in the past. As was noted, after the court heard the evidence, it concluded that Hawkins failed to prove actual, substantial prejudice. In particular, the court noted that its evaluation hinged on Hawkins’ credibility, and that Hawkins was not credible. In contending that the trial court erred, Hawkins argues that Ohio courts have not employed a credibility analysis in pre-indictment delay cases. Hawkins further contends that the facts of this case directly compare to those in Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097, where the Supreme Court of Ohio held that pre-indictment delay had prejudiced the defendant. We disagree with both assertions. As a preliminary matter, Ohio appellate courts have held that decisions on motions to dismiss for pre-indictment delay should be reviewed on the following basis: legal issues are reviewed de novo, but ‘the court’s findings of fact are afforded great deference.’ (Citations omitted.) State v. Powell, 2016-Ohio-1220, 61 N.E.3d 789, ¶ 11 (8th Dist.). See also State v. Zimbeck, 195 Ohio App.3d 729, 2011-Ohio-2171, 961 N.E.2d 1141, ¶ 20 (6th Dist.); State v. Winkle, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 12 MA 162, 2014-Ohio-895, ¶ 23; State v. Cochenour, 4th Dist. Ross No. 98CA2440, 1999 WL 152127, *1 (Mar. 8, 1999). We agree with these standards, which are consistent with standards of review for other pretrial matters like suppression motions. In suppression situations, trial courts hear evidence on factual points and must necessarily make decisions on witness credibility. See, e.g., State v. Burnside, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, ¶ 8; State v. Brown, 2016-Ohio-4973, 67 N.E.3d 1278, ¶ 7 (2d Dist.). As these decisions note, trial courts ‘are in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.’ Burnside at ¶ 8, citing State v. Mills, 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 366, 582 N.E.2d 972 (1992). In Luck, the Supreme Court of Ohio considered whether the defendant was prejudiced by a fifteen-year delay between the time of a murder and her indictment for the murder. Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d at 152, 472 N.E.2d 1097. The defendant, Katherine Luck, was one of the suspects originally interviewed around the time of the crime. However, after an initial investigation, the police could not gather any new evidence and took no official action for about fifteen years. Id. at 151. At that point, for reasons that were not clear in the record, an indictment was obtained against Luck, and she was arrested. Id. While under arrest, Luck made a confession at the police station, indicating that she had been physically attacked by the decedent, who was then killed in the fight that ensued. Id. at 157. According to Luck’s confession, another individual, who was her acquaintance (and who had also been an original suspect) was present at the time of the alleged murder. *Id.* She told the police that this person, who was the only one who could help her, was dead. *Id.* After concluding that the confession had been illegally obtained, the court found that defendant was ‘obviously prejudiced by not being able to seek verification of her story from [the deceased witness] and thereby establish mitigating factors or a defense to the charge against her.’ *Id.* at 158. Finding both actual prejudice and an unjustifiable delay by the State, the court affirmed the dismissal of the murder charge. *Id.* at 159. Unlike the defendant in *Luck*, Hawkins never asserted, either when he was originally interviewed in 2002, or when he was interviewed in 2015, that he had consensual sex with A.J. and that witnesses existed who could verify his story. Instead, he denied that he had been involved in any such incident. Consequently, *Luck* is not directly comparable to the case before us. In *State v. Dixon*, 2015-Ohio-3144, 40 N.E.3d 601 (8th Dist.), the State waited almost 20 years to indict a defendant for rape. *Id.* at ¶ 2. After the trial court dismissed the charge due to pre-indictment delay, the Eighth District Court of Appeals affirmed. Notably, in that case, two parole revocation hearings were held in 1993, shortly after the victim told the police that the defendant had raped her.² At the parole revocation hearings, the defendant admitted having sexual intercourse with the complainant, but claimed it was consensual. *Id.* at ¶ 6. The defendant was sent back to prison for the parole violation, but the State did not initiate any prosecution on the rape charge for almost 20 years, after the police ‘received a CODIS [Combined DNA Index System] hit confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation that they had made a preliminary association between a submitted rape kit and the Defendant.’  *Id.* Two witnesses who had testified at the parole revocation hearings were unavailable, including the defendant’s former employer, who was deceased.  *Id.* at ¶ 9. This witness, Norman Diamond, had testified at the revocation hearings that ‘he spoke with the alleged victim after the incident and the victim told Diamond that ‘she had feelings for [Dixon]’ and ‘if she could not have [Dixon], no one would.’  Diamond further testified that the alleged victim told him that the sexual encounter was ‘mutual with no force.’ ”  *Id.* In concluding that the defendant had established actual prejudice, the court commented that the case against the defendant hinged on the victim’s credibility.  *Id.* at ¶ 30. The court further observed that the testimony of the deceased witness directly supported the defendant’s assertion that the sex was consensual, and also undermined the victim’s testimony.  *Id.* Again, these facts are far different than those involved in the case before us. Hawkins never asserted that the sex was consensual or that witnesses existed. Hawkins also relies on *State v. Jones*, 148 Ohio St.3d 167, 2016-Ohio-5105, 69 N.E.3d 688, in which the court stated that a defendant’s ‘inability to articulate specifically what [a witness’s] testimony would have been does not render his claim of prejudice fatally speculative,’ as the court has ‘held that a defendant may establish actual prejudice where he or she is unable to seek verification of his or her story from a deceased witness.’  *Id.* at ¶ 28, citing *Luck*, 15 Ohio St. 3d at 157, 472 N.E.2d 1097. However, by making these comments, the court was not advancing a novel proposition of law; it was discussing its prior decision in Luck. Moreover, the issue in the case before us is not Hawkins’ inability to articulate the content of a deceased witness’s testimony; the relevant matter is that the trial court did not find Hawkins credible. As was noted, the trial court was in the best position to assess credibility, and we defer to the court’s factual findings. As a final matter, Hawkins contends that the State’s pre-indictment delay was not justifiable, as the police simply allowed the case to ‘slip through the cracks.’ Because Hawkins failed to meet his initial burden of proving actual prejudice, we need not consider this issue. See, e.g., Jones at ¶ 13, citing State v. Whiting, 84 Ohio St.3d 215, 217, 702 N.E.2d 1199 (1998), and State v. Adams, 144 Ohio St.3d 429, 2015-Ohio-3954, 45 N.E.3d 127, ¶ 99. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it concluded that Hawkins failed to establish actual prejudice. The First Assignment of Error, therefore, is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Under this assignment of error, Hawkins contends that he suffered actual prejudice due to a delay of nearly 13 years between the alleged crime and the filing of the indictment. Hawkins’ claim of prejudice is based on the fact that the only two persons who could potentially corroborate what happened on the night in question are now deceased. ‘An unjustifiable delay between the commission of an offense and a defendant's indictment therefor, which results in actual prejudice to the defendant, is a violation of the right to due process of law under Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.’ State v.

Walls, 96 Ohio St.3d 437, 2002-Ohio-5059, 775 N.E.2d 829, ¶ 52, quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 325, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971). To make this assessment, ‘courts are to consider the evidence as it exists when the indictment is filed and the prejudice the defendant will suffer at trial due to the delay.’ Walls at ¶ 52, citing Luck at 154. (Other citation omitted.) However, ‘speculative prejudice does not satisfy the defendant's burden.’ Jones at ¶ 20, citing Luck at ¶ 56. (Other citation omitted.) In the case before us, the trial court heard from the following witnesses at the evidentiary hearings in connection with Hawkins’ motion to dismiss: Brian Hawkins; Wayne Miller, Hawkins’ private investigator; Carol Ewing, a retired detective with the Dayton Police Department (“DPD”); Lindsey Dulaney, a current detective with the DPD Special Victims’ Unit (“SVU”); Gary Ware, an investigator with the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office; and Justin Hayes, a training detective for the DPD SVU. The testimony of these individuals revealed the following factual background. In July 2002, Ewing was a detective assigned to the DPD sexual assault child endangerment unit. Ewing was assigned a case involving A.J., who had allegedly been raped in the early morning hours of July 30, 2002, while she was a runaway from a foster home. The rape occurred outdoors behind the Wesley Center, which was located on Delphos Avenue, in Dayton, Ohio.¹ At the time, A.J. was fifteen years old. After the alleged rape, A.J. ran to a nearby Burger King, which was located a few blocks from the Wesley Center, and pounded on the restaurant’s door. A security guard answered and called the police, who transported A.J. to Dayton Children’s Hospital, where a rape kit was done. The rape kit was then sent to the Miami Valley Regional Crime Lab (“MVRCL”) for processing. Originally, based on information as to the assailant’s alleged nickname of ‘Twin,’ Ewing put together two photospreads, but A.J. did not pick out either of the suspected individuals. On August 6, 2002, A.J. provided Ewing with Brian Hawkins’ name, which A.J. had obtained from friends. Ewing compiled another photospread, and on August 14, 2002, A.J. identified Hawkins as the person who had committed the rape. Ewing interviewed Hawkins in his home on October 29, 2002, because he had been recently shot and could not walk. The interview was not recorded. Ewing would have noted in her report if Hawkins were heavily sedated or under the influence during the interview. She did not make such a notation. Ewing told Hawkins the date of the alleged offense, and he said he thought he might have been in the hospital at the time. Ewing later followed up and learned that Hawkins had been in the hospital on August 11, 2002, which was about a week and a half after the alleged rape. Ewing asked Hawkins if he knew someone with A.J.’s name, and he said he did not. He stated that he did not know A.J., that he would not have sex with a minor, and that he would not have sex outside. Hawkins did not provide Ewing with the names of any witnesses or an alibi. If Hawkins had given Ewing the names of witnesses, she would have followed up. Hawkins recalled talking to a detective in October 2002. He stated that he had just gotten shot and was sedated. Although he could not recall what the detective said, he also testified that she talked about a knife, which ‘threw’ him off. He said he thought they had the wrong person because he had never pulled a knife on anyone. The police did not show him any pictures of the victim. He also denied that he had said he would not have sex outside, as he had done that plenty of times. He claimed Ewing had lied in her report. In November 2002, Ewing was injured and her last day of work was February 2, 2004. During the interim, she had two surgeries and at some point was on restricted duty until she retired. She could not recall specific dates, other than that she had her first surgery in July 2003. In February or March 2003, Ewing received results back from MVRCL, indicating the presence of sperm in the rape kit. Ewing then obtained a court order in October 2003 for a buccal swab from Hawkins. At that point, Ewing was on restricted duty, and another detective obtained the sample from Hawkins. DPD did not receive the results from the DNA test until March 2004, which was after Ewing retired. Hawkins’ DNA was a match, and there would have been sufficient cause at that time for the police to present the case to the prosecutor’s office. Ewing’s notes on the case, including the photo spread, were kept in a packet, which was the official police file. There would have been a notation on the front concerning whether the case was closed or open. Ewing also kept her pending cases in a certain file cabinet. She did not know what happened to the case files after she left the DPD, and she did not recall if she specifically told someone that there were pending cases in the file cabinet. Hawkins continued to reside in the Dayton area and did not move out of state between 2002 and 2015. Nothing more was done on the case until January 2015, when Detective Dulaney received a phone call from the Miami County Prosecutor’s Office, indicating that the office had received a CODIS hit or DNA match on a case that was an investigation in the city of Dayton. The prosecutor sent Dulaney a copy of the 2004 lab report. Dulaney pulled the police report and saw that A.J.’s case had never been presented to the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office. After the case was assigned to her, Dulaney located A.J., and spoke with her. Dulaney also attempted to find Hawkins to obtain his side of the story, but could not locate him at the time. Dulaney was never able to locate Ewing’s packet, which contained the photo spread and Ewing’s notes. However, any notes that Ewing took and anything she did during her investigation would have been put into a police report. Dulaney was able to obtain a copy of the police report, because that was stored electronically. The police were also able to locate the following evidence: the 2002 rape kit, which was stored at the old Montgomery County Jail; Hawkins' buccal swab, which was still at MVRCL; and A.J.'s clothing, which was still intact. In addition, DPD was able to locate the following witnesses: the MVRCL employee who had processed the rape kit; the doctor and nurse who had collected the rape kit and who were still working at Dayton Children's Hospital; the Burger King security guard, who recalled speaking to A.J.; and the DPD officer who had responded to the call from the Burger King. This officer had retired from the DPD, but recalled the incident. After being unable to find Hawkins, Detective Dulaney entered a suspect locator into the police system, which meant that if police came into contact with Hawkins, he would be told that Dulaney wished to speak with him. After the locator was in the system for a time with no success, the prosecutor went to a grand jury and obtained a warrant for Hawkins' arrest. In May 2015, Dulaney was able to interview Hawkins. At the time, he was in jail and was transported to the Safety Building for an interview. Hawkins was told that he was there for an interview in connection with a rape investigation, and after being informed of his Miranda rights, agreed to speak with the police. Dulaney told Hawkins about the allegations, and Hawkins said it never happened and that he did not know A.J. Although Dulaney showed him photos of A.J. – one photo was older, and the other was recent – Hawkins still did not recall knowing A.J. During the interview, Hawkins did not give Dulaney the names or addresses of any witnesses. If he had given her names, she would have tried to locate the witnesses. At the pre-indictment hearing, Hawkins testified that he had reviewed the police report as part of discovery and did not deny having sex with A.J. He maintained that they agreed to have sexual relations and the activity was not due to force. According to Hawkins, he met A.J. around 3:00 a.m. on July 30, 2002, when he was leaving a ‘bootleg joint’ on Shoop Avenue in Dayton, Ohio. The bootleg joint was an after-hours place where people came to gamble, drink, and meet women.

Finding both actual prejudice and an unjustifiable delay by the State, the court affirmed the dismissal of the murder charge. *Id.* at 159. Unlike the defendant in *Luck*, Hawkins never asserted, either when he was originally interviewed in 2002, or when he was interviewed in 2015, that he had consensual sex with A.J. and that witnesses existed who could verify his story. Instead, he denied that he had been involved in any such incident. Consequently, *Luck* is not directly comparable to the case before us. In *State v. Dixon*, 2015-Ohio-3144, 40 N.E.3d 601 (8th Dist.), the State waited almost 20 years to indict a defendant for rape. *Id.* at ¶ 2. After the trial court dismissed the charge due to pre-indictment delay, the Eighth District Court of Appeals affirmed. Notably, in that case, two parole revocation hearings were held in 1993, shortly after the victim told the police that the defendant had raped her.² At the parole revocation hearings, the defendant admitted having sexual intercourse with the complainant, but claimed it was consensual. *Id.* at ¶ 6. The defendant was sent back to prison for the parole violation, but the State did not initiate any prosecution on the rape charge for almost 20 years, after the police ‘received a CODIS [Combined DNA Index System] hit confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation that they had made a preliminary association between a submitted rape kit and the Defendant.’  *Id.* Two witnesses who had testified at the parole revocation hearings were unavailable, including the defendant’s former employer, who was deceased.  *Id.* at ¶ 9. This witness, Norman Diamond, had testified at the revocation hearings that ‘he spoke with the alleged victim after the incident and the victim told Diamond that ‘she had feelings for [Dixon]’ and ‘if she could not have [Dixon], no one would.’  Diamond further testified that the alleged victim told him that the sexual encounter was ‘mutual with no force.’ ”  *Id.* In concluding that the defendant had established actual prejudice, the court commented that the case against the defendant hinged on the victim’s credibility.  *Id.* at ¶ 30. The court further observed that the testimony of the deceased witness directly supported the defendant’s assertion that the sex was consensual, and also undermined the victim’s testimony.  *Id.* Again, these facts are far different than those involved in the case before us. Hawkins never asserted that the sex was consensual or that witnesses existed. Hawkins also relies on *State v. Jones*, 148 Ohio St.3d 167, 2016-Ohio-5105, 69 N.E.3d 688, in which the court stated that a defendant’s ‘inability to articulate specifically what [a witness’s] testimony would have been does not render his claim of prejudice fatally speculative,’ as the court has ‘held that a defendant may establish actual prejudice where he or she is unable to seek verification of his or her story from a deceased witness.’  *Id.* at ¶ 28, citing *Luck*, 15 Ohio St. 3d at 157, 472 N.E.2d 1097. However, by making these comments, the court was not advancing a novel proposition of law; it was discussing its prior decision in Luck. Moreover, the issue in the case before us is not Hawkins’ inability to articulate the content of a deceased witness’s testimony; the relevant matter is that the trial court did not find Hawkins credible. As was noted, the trial court was in the best position to assess credibility, and we defer to the court’s factual findings. As a final matter, Hawkins contends that the State’s pre-indictment delay was not justifiable, as the police simply allowed the case to ‘slip through the cracks.’ Because Hawkins failed to meet his initial burden of proving actual prejudice, we need not consider this issue. See, e.g., Jones at ¶ 13, citing State v. Whiting, 84 Ohio St.3d 215, 217, 702 N.E.2d 1199 (1998), and State v. Adams, 144 Ohio St.3d 429, 2015-Ohio-3954, 45 N.E.3d 127, ¶ 99. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it concluded that Hawkins failed to establish actual prejudice. The First Assignment of Error, therefore, is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

To make this assessment, ‘courts are to consider the evidence as it exists when the indictment is filed and the prejudice the defendant will suffer at trial due to the delay.’ Walls at ¶ 52, citing Luck at 154. (Other citation omitted.) However, ‘speculative prejudice does not satisfy the defendant's burden.’ Jones at ¶ 20, citing Luck at ¶ 56. (Other citation omitted.) In the case before us, the trial court heard from the following witnesses at the evidentiary hearings in connection with Hawkins’ motion to dismiss: Brian Hawkins; Wayne Miller, Hawkins’ private investigator; Carol Ewing, a retired detective with the Dayton Police Department (“DPD”); Lindsey Dulaney, a current detective with the DPD Special Victims’ Unit (“SVU”); Gary Ware, an investigator with the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office; and Justin Hayes, a training detective for the DPD SVU. The testimony of these individuals revealed the following factual background. In July 2002, Ewing was a detective assigned to the DPD sexual assault child endangerment unit. Ewing was assigned a case involving A.J., who had allegedly been raped in the early morning hours of July 30, 2002, while she was a runaway from a foster home. The rape occurred outdoors behind the Wesley Center, which was located on Delphos Avenue, in Dayton, Ohio.¹ At the time, A.J. was fifteen years old. After the alleged rape, A.J. ran to a nearby Burger King, which was located a few blocks from the Wesley Center, and pounded on the restaurant’s door. A security guard answered and called the police, who transported A.J. to Dayton Children’s Hospital, where a rape kit was done. The rape kit was then sent to the Miami Valley Regional Crime Lab (“MVRCL”) for processing. Originally, based on information as to the assailant’s alleged nickname of ‘Twin,’ Ewing put together two photospreads, but A.J. did not pick out either of the suspected individuals. On August 6, 2002, A.J. provided Ewing with Brian Hawkins’ name, which A.J. had obtained from friends. Ewing compiled another photospread, and on August 14, 2002, A.J. identified Hawkins as the person who had committed the rape. Ewing interviewed Hawkins in his home on October 29, 2002, because he had been recently shot and could not walk. The interview was not recorded. Ewing would have noted in her report if Hawkins were heavily sedated or under the influence during the interview. She did not make such a notation. Ewing told Hawkins the date of the alleged offense, and he said he thought he might have been in the hospital at the time. Ewing later followed up and learned that Hawkins had been in the hospital on August 11, 2002, which was about a week and a half after the alleged rape. Ewing asked Hawkins if he knew someone with A.J.’s name, and he said he did not. He stated that he did not know A.J., that he would not have sex with a minor, and that he would not have sex outside. Hawkins did not provide Ewing with the names of any witnesses or an alibi. If Hawkins had given Ewing the names of witnesses, she would have followed up. Hawkins recalled talking to a detective in October 2002. He stated that he had just gotten shot and was sedated. Although he could not recall what the detective said, he also testified that she talked about a knife, which ‘threw’ him off. He said he thought they had the wrong person because he had never pulled a knife on anyone. The police did not show him any pictures of the victim. He also denied that he had said he would not have sex outside, as he had done that plenty of times. He claimed Ewing had lied in her report. In November 2002, Ewing was injured and her last day of work was February 2, 2004. During the interim, she had two surgeries and at some point was on restricted duty until she retired. She could not recall specific dates, other than that she had her first surgery in July 2003. In February or March 2003, Ewing received results back from MVRCL, indicating the presence of sperm in the rape kit. Ewing then obtained a court order in October 2003 for a buccal swab from Hawkins. At that point, Ewing was on restricted duty, and another detective obtained the sample from Hawkins. DPD did not receive the results from the DNA test until March 2004, which was after Ewing retired. Hawkins’ DNA was a match, and there would have been sufficient cause at that time for the police to present the case to the prosecutor’s office. Ewing’s notes on the case, including the photo spread, were kept in a packet, which was the official police file. There would have been a notation on the front concerning whether the case was closed or open. Ewing also kept her pending cases in a certain file cabinet. She did not know what happened to the case files after she left the DPD, and she did not recall if she specifically told someone that there were pending cases in the file cabinet. Hawkins continued to reside in the Dayton area and did not move out of state between 2002 and 2015. Nothing more was done on the case until January 2015, when Detective Dulaney received a phone call from the Miami County Prosecutor’s Office, indicating that the office had received a CODIS hit or DNA match on a case that was an investigation in the city of Dayton. The prosecutor sent Dulaney a copy of the 2004 lab report. Dulaney pulled the police report and saw that A.J.’s case had never been presented to the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office. After the case was assigned to her, Dulaney located A.J., and spoke with her. Dulaney also attempted to find Hawkins to obtain his side of the story, but could not locate him at the time. Dulaney was never able to locate Ewing’s packet, which contained the photo spread and Ewing’s notes. However, any notes that Ewing took and anything she did during her investigation would have been put into a police report. Dulaney was able to obtain a copy of the police report, because that was stored electronically. The police were also able to locate the following evidence: the 2002 rape kit, which was stored at the old Montgomery County Jail; Hawkins' buccal swab, which was still at MVRCL; and A.J.'s clothing, which was still intact. In addition, DPD was able to locate the following witnesses: the MVRCL employee who had processed the rape kit; the doctor and nurse who had collected the rape kit and who were still working at Dayton Children's Hospital; the Burger King security guard, who recalled speaking to A.J.; and the DPD officer who had responded to the call from the Burger King. This officer had retired from the DPD, but recalled the incident. After being unable to find Hawkins, Detective Dulaney entered a suspect locator into the police system, which meant that if police came into contact with Hawkins, he would be told that Dulaney wished to speak with him. After the locator was in the system for a time with no success, the prosecutor went to a grand jury and obtained a warrant for Hawkins' arrest. In May 2015, Dulaney was able to interview Hawkins. At the time, he was in jail and was transported to the Safety Building for an interview. Hawkins was told that he was there for an interview in connection with a rape investigation, and after being informed of his Miranda rights, agreed to speak with the police. Dulaney told Hawkins about the allegations, and Hawkins said it never happened and that he did not know A.J. Although Dulaney showed him photos of A.J. – one photo was older, and the other was recent – Hawkins still did not recall knowing A.J. During the interview, Hawkins did not give Dulaney the names or addresses of any witnesses. If he had given her names, she would have tried to locate the witnesses. At the pre-indictment hearing, Hawkins testified that he had reviewed the police report as part of discovery and did not deny having sex with A.J. He maintained that they agreed to have sexual relations and the activity was not due to force. According to Hawkins, he met A.J. around 3:00 a.m. on July 30, 2002, when he was leaving a ‘bootleg joint’ on Shoop Avenue in Dayton, Ohio. The bootleg joint was an after-hours place where people came to gamble, drink, and meet women. Hawkins stated that the bootleg joint had two security guards who checked identification and patted people down. They also had a metal detector, and would not let people in who had weapons like knives. In addition, no one under 18 years of age was allowed inside. Hawkins identified three people as potential witnesses: Bobby Cartwright, who worked as a security guard, Kevin Cartwright, who used to come to the bootleg joint, and Jermaine Hunter, who was present in the yard of the bootleg joint that night. The Cartwrights were Hawkins’ cousins, and could discuss security, as well as the fact that underage persons were not allowed, meaning that A.J. had lied about her age. Bobby was working that night, but would not have seen Hawkins and A.J., because he was inside. Jermaine Hunter was outside talking to A.J. when Hawkins left the bootleg joint, and was close enough to hear conversation between Hawkins and A.J. when she initially followed Hawkins away from the bootleg joint. Hunter could also testify that A.J. initiated contact with Hawkins. According to Hawkins, he had lost contact with these individuals and had not seen them for a number of years. He thought Hunter was in prison and had mental problems. Hawkins testified that when he left the bootleg joint, A.J. followed him. He stated that at the time, he stayed at different people’s houses. Consequently, he and A.J. went to different people’s houses but no one was there. Hawkins described walking to a house on Delphos Avenue, then to a house on Bedford Street, back to the house on Delphos, and next to another house located at Oakridge Drive and Tyson Avenue. On the way back from the last location, A.J. propositioned Hawkins for sex the whole time. According to Hawkins, he and A.J. then had a sexual encounter behind the Wesley Center. Afterward, they went to a house on Upland Avenue, where Hawkins’ friend, ‘Moochie,’ lived. Hawkins did not know Moochie’s real name; everyone just called him Moochie. When Hawkins and A.J. arrived at Moochie’s house, Hawkins told A.J. to stay outside, but she insisted on coming inside. Several people were at the house, including a woman named Tony Ousley, who was the mother of Hawkins’ friend, ‘Squiggy.’ Hawkins and Squiggy had both grown up in the same neighborhood. According to Hawkins, he told Ousley that he and A.J. had sex and that A.J. was 18 years old. While they were there, Ousley spoke to A.J., who verified that she and Hawkins had sex. When Hawkins and A.J. left, Ousley pulled him to the side and said he needed to get away from A.J. or he was going to get in trouble. Ousley specifically stated that A.J. was lying about her age. When Hawkins found out from Ousley that A.J. was too young, he walked with A.J. for a few blocks and then handed her a couple of dollars. At that point, A.J. became angry. Hawkins believed she was mad because she thought she was going to stay with him the rest of the night. By the time of the pre-indictment hearing, Moochie’s house and the house where the bootleg joint was had been torn down. Hawkins’ investigator, Wayne Miller, found the last known address of the Cartwrights, but was not able to actually locate them. He visited their last known address, but it looked vacant and vines were growing from beside the house onto the front door. Miller did locate Hunter, who was in a prison mental ward, and interviewed him. When shown a picture of A.J., Hunter said he had never seen her; he also said he could not recall ever visiting the bootleg joint on Shoop Avenue. Miller additionally discovered that Squiggy had been murdered in 2008 and that Tony Ousley passed away in 2011. At the hearing, Hawkins testified that Moochie was also dead and that he was not previously aware that Ousley had died. Hawkins said he could, however, have located both Moochie and Ousley in the past. As was noted, after the court heard the evidence, it concluded that Hawkins failed to prove actual, substantial prejudice. In particular, the court noted that its evaluation hinged on Hawkins’ credibility, and that Hawkins was not credible. In contending that the trial court erred, Hawkins argues that Ohio courts have not employed a credibility analysis in pre-indictment delay cases. Hawkins further contends that the facts of this case directly compare to those in Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097, where the Supreme Court of Ohio held that pre-indictment delay had prejudiced the defendant. We disagree with both assertions. As a preliminary matter, Ohio appellate courts have held that decisions on motions to dismiss for pre-indictment delay should be reviewed on the following basis: legal issues are reviewed de novo, but ‘the court’s findings of fact are afforded great deference.’ (Citations omitted.) State v. Powell, 2016-Ohio-1220, 61 N.E.3d 789, ¶ 11 (8th Dist.). See also State v. Zimbeck, 195 Ohio App.3d 729, 2011-Ohio-2171, 961 N.E.2d 1141, ¶ 20 (6th Dist.); State v. Winkle, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 12 MA 162, 2014-Ohio-895, ¶ 23; State v. Cochenour, 4th Dist. Ross No. 98CA2440, 1999 WL 152127, *1 (Mar. 8, 1999). We agree with these standards, which are consistent with standards of review for other pretrial matters like suppression motions. In suppression situations, trial courts hear evidence on factual points and must necessarily make decisions on witness credibility. See, e.g., State v. Burnside, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, ¶ 8; State v. Brown, 2016-Ohio-4973, 67 N.E.3d 1278, ¶ 7 (2d Dist.). As these decisions note, trial courts ‘are in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.’ Burnside at ¶ 8, citing State v. Mills, 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 366, 582 N.E.2d 972 (1992). In Luck, the Supreme Court of Ohio considered whether the defendant was prejudiced by a fifteen-year delay between the time of a murder and her indictment for the murder. Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d at 152, 472 N.E.2d 1097. The defendant, Katherine Luck, was one of the suspects originally interviewed around the time of the crime. However, after an initial investigation, the police could not gather any new evidence and took no official action for about fifteen years. Id. at 151. At that point, for reasons that were not clear in the record, an indictment was obtained against Luck, and she was arrested. Id. While under arrest, Luck made a confession at the police station, indicating that she had been physically attacked by the decedent, who was then killed in the fight that ensued. Id. at 157. According to Luck’s confession, another individual, who was her acquaintance (and who had also been an original suspect) was present at the time of the alleged murder. *Id.* She told the police that this person, who was the only one who could help her, was dead. *Id.* After concluding that the confession had been illegally obtained, the court found that defendant was ‘obviously prejudiced by not being able to seek verification of her story from [the deceased witness] and thereby establish mitigating factors or a defense to the charge against her.’ *Id.* at 158. Finding both actual prejudice and an unjustifiable delay by the State, the court affirmed the dismissal of the murder charge. *Id.* at 159. Unlike the defendant in *Luck*, Hawkins never asserted, either when he was originally interviewed in 2002, or when he was interviewed in 2015, that he had consensual sex with A.J. and that witnesses existed who could verify his story. Instead, he denied that he had been involved in any such incident. Consequently, *Luck* is not directly comparable to the case before us. In *State v.

At that point, Ewing was on restricted duty, and another detective obtained the sample from Hawkins. DPD did not receive the results from the DNA test until March 2004, which was after Ewing retired. Hawkins’ DNA was a match, and there would have been sufficient cause at that time for the police to present the case to the prosecutor’s office. Ewing’s notes on the case, including the photo spread, were kept in a packet, which was the official police file. There would have been a notation on the front concerning whether the case was closed or open. Ewing also kept her pending cases in a certain file cabinet. She did not know what happened to the case files after she left the DPD, and she did not recall if she specifically told someone that there were pending cases in the file cabinet. Hawkins continued to reside in the Dayton area and did not move out of state between 2002 and 2015. Nothing more was done on the case until January 2015, when Detective Dulaney received a phone call from the Miami County Prosecutor’s Office, indicating that the office had received a CODIS hit or DNA match on a case that was an investigation in the city of Dayton. The prosecutor sent Dulaney a copy of the 2004 lab report. Dulaney pulled the police report and saw that A.J.’s case had never been presented to the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office. After the case was assigned to her, Dulaney located A.J., and spoke with her. Dulaney also attempted to find Hawkins to obtain his side of the story, but could not locate him at the time. Dulaney was never able to locate Ewing’s packet, which contained the photo spread and Ewing’s notes. However, any notes that Ewing took and anything she did during her investigation would have been put into a police report. Dulaney was able to obtain a copy of the police report, because that was stored electronically. The police were also able to locate the following evidence: the 2002 rape kit, which was stored at the old Montgomery County Jail; Hawkins' buccal swab, which was still at MVRCL; and A.J.'s clothing, which was still intact. In addition, DPD was able to locate the following witnesses: the MVRCL employee who had processed the rape kit; the doctor and nurse who had collected the rape kit and who were still working at Dayton Children's Hospital; the Burger King security guard, who recalled speaking to A.J.; and the DPD officer who had responded to the call from the Burger King. This officer had retired from the DPD, but recalled the incident. After being unable to find Hawkins, Detective Dulaney entered a suspect locator into the police system, which meant that if police came into contact with Hawkins, he would be told that Dulaney wished to speak with him. After the locator was in the system for a time with no success, the prosecutor went to a grand jury and obtained a warrant for Hawkins' arrest. In May 2015, Dulaney was able to interview Hawkins. At the time, he was in jail and was transported to the Safety Building for an interview. Hawkins was told that he was there for an interview in connection with a rape investigation, and after being informed of his Miranda rights, agreed to speak with the police. Dulaney told Hawkins about the allegations, and Hawkins said it never happened and that he did not know A.J. Although Dulaney showed him photos of A.J. – one photo was older, and the other was recent – Hawkins still did not recall knowing A.J. During the interview, Hawkins did not give Dulaney the names or addresses of any witnesses. If he had given her names, she would have tried to locate the witnesses. At the pre-indictment hearing, Hawkins testified that he had reviewed the police report as part of discovery and did not deny having sex with A.J. He maintained that they agreed to have sexual relations and the activity was not due to force. According to Hawkins, he met A.J. around 3:00 a.m. on July 30, 2002, when he was leaving a ‘bootleg joint’ on Shoop Avenue in Dayton, Ohio. The bootleg joint was an after-hours place where people came to gamble, drink, and meet women. Hawkins stated that the bootleg joint had two security guards who checked identification and patted people down. They also had a metal detector, and would not let people in who had weapons like knives. In addition, no one under 18 years of age was allowed inside. Hawkins identified three people as potential witnesses: Bobby Cartwright, who worked as a security guard, Kevin Cartwright, who used to come to the bootleg joint, and Jermaine Hunter, who was present in the yard of the bootleg joint that night. The Cartwrights were Hawkins’ cousins, and could discuss security, as well as the fact that underage persons were not allowed, meaning that A.J. had lied about her age. Bobby was working that night, but would not have seen Hawkins and A.J., because he was inside. Jermaine Hunter was outside talking to A.J. when Hawkins left the bootleg joint, and was close enough to hear conversation between Hawkins and A.J. when she initially followed Hawkins away from the bootleg joint. Hunter could also testify that A.J. initiated contact with Hawkins. According to Hawkins, he had lost contact with these individuals and had not seen them for a number of years. He thought Hunter was in prison and had mental problems. Hawkins testified that when he left the bootleg joint, A.J. followed him. He stated that at the time, he stayed at different people’s houses. Consequently, he and A.J. went to different people’s houses but no one was there. Hawkins described walking to a house on Delphos Avenue, then to a house on Bedford Street, back to the house on Delphos, and next to another house located at Oakridge Drive and Tyson Avenue. On the way back from the last location, A.J. propositioned Hawkins for sex the whole time. According to Hawkins, he and A.J. then had a sexual encounter behind the Wesley Center. Afterward, they went to a house on Upland Avenue, where Hawkins’ friend, ‘Moochie,’ lived. Hawkins did not know Moochie’s real name; everyone just called him Moochie. When Hawkins and A.J. arrived at Moochie’s house, Hawkins told A.J. to stay outside, but she insisted on coming inside. Several people were at the house, including a woman named Tony Ousley, who was the mother of Hawkins’ friend, ‘Squiggy.’ Hawkins and Squiggy had both grown up in the same neighborhood. According to Hawkins, he told Ousley that he and A.J. had sex and that A.J. was 18 years old. While they were there, Ousley spoke to A.J., who verified that she and Hawkins had sex. When Hawkins and A.J. left, Ousley pulled him to the side and said he needed to get away from A.J. or he was going to get in trouble. Ousley specifically stated that A.J. was lying about her age. When Hawkins found out from Ousley that A.J. was too young, he walked with A.J. for a few blocks and then handed her a couple of dollars. At that point, A.J. became angry. Hawkins believed she was mad because she thought she was going to stay with him the rest of the night. By the time of the pre-indictment hearing, Moochie’s house and the house where the bootleg joint was had been torn down. Hawkins’ investigator, Wayne Miller, found the last known address of the Cartwrights, but was not able to actually locate them. He visited their last known address, but it looked vacant and vines were growing from beside the house onto the front door. Miller did locate Hunter, who was in a prison mental ward, and interviewed him. When shown a picture of A.J., Hunter said he had never seen her; he also said he could not recall ever visiting the bootleg joint on Shoop Avenue. Miller additionally discovered that Squiggy had been murdered in 2008 and that Tony Ousley passed away in 2011. At the hearing, Hawkins testified that Moochie was also dead and that he was not previously aware that Ousley had died. Hawkins said he could, however, have located both Moochie and Ousley in the past. As was noted, after the court heard the evidence, it concluded that Hawkins failed to prove actual, substantial prejudice. In particular, the court noted that its evaluation hinged on Hawkins’ credibility, and that Hawkins was not credible. In contending that the trial court erred, Hawkins argues that Ohio courts have not employed a credibility analysis in pre-indictment delay cases. Hawkins further contends that the facts of this case directly compare to those in Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097, where the Supreme Court of Ohio held that pre-indictment delay had prejudiced the defendant. We disagree with both assertions. As a preliminary matter, Ohio appellate courts have held that decisions on motions to dismiss for pre-indictment delay should be reviewed on the following basis: legal issues are reviewed de novo, but ‘the court’s findings of fact are afforded great deference.’ (Citations omitted.) State v. Powell, 2016-Ohio-1220, 61 N.E.3d 789, ¶ 11 (8th Dist.). See also State v. Zimbeck, 195 Ohio App.3d 729, 2011-Ohio-2171, 961 N.E.2d 1141, ¶ 20 (6th Dist.); State v. Winkle, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 12 MA 162, 2014-Ohio-895, ¶ 23; State v. Cochenour, 4th Dist. Ross No. 98CA2440, 1999 WL 152127, *1 (Mar. 8, 1999). We agree with these standards, which are consistent with standards of review for other pretrial matters like suppression motions. In suppression situations, trial courts hear evidence on factual points and must necessarily make decisions on witness credibility. See, e.g., State v. Burnside, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, ¶ 8; State v. Brown, 2016-Ohio-4973, 67 N.E.3d 1278, ¶ 7 (2d Dist.). As these decisions note, trial courts ‘are in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.’ Burnside at ¶ 8, citing State v. Mills, 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 366, 582 N.E.2d 972 (1992). In Luck, the Supreme Court of Ohio considered whether the defendant was prejudiced by a fifteen-year delay between the time of a murder and her indictment for the murder. Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d at 152, 472 N.E.2d 1097. The defendant, Katherine Luck, was one of the suspects originally interviewed around the time of the crime. However, after an initial investigation, the police could not gather any new evidence and took no official action for about fifteen years. Id. at 151. At that point, for reasons that were not clear in the record, an indictment was obtained against Luck, and she was arrested. Id. While under arrest, Luck made a confession at the police station, indicating that she had been physically attacked by the decedent, who was then killed in the fight that ensued. Id. at 157. According to Luck’s confession, another individual, who was her acquaintance (and who had also been an original suspect) was present at the time of the alleged murder. *Id.* She told the police that this person, who was the only one who could help her, was dead. *Id.* After concluding that the confession had been illegally obtained, the court found that defendant was ‘obviously prejudiced by not being able to seek verification of her story from [the deceased witness] and thereby establish mitigating factors or a defense to the charge against her.’ *Id.* at 158. Finding both actual prejudice and an unjustifiable delay by the State, the court affirmed the dismissal of the murder charge. *Id.* at 159. Unlike the defendant in *Luck*, Hawkins never asserted, either when he was originally interviewed in 2002, or when he was interviewed in 2015, that he had consensual sex with A.J. and that witnesses existed who could verify his story. Instead, he denied that he had been involved in any such incident. Consequently, *Luck* is not directly comparable to the case before us. In *State v. Dixon*, 2015-Ohio-3144, 40 N.E.3d 601 (8th Dist.), the State waited almost 20 years to indict a defendant for rape. *Id.* at ¶ 2. After the trial court dismissed the charge due to pre-indictment delay, the Eighth District Court of Appeals affirmed. Notably, in that case, two parole revocation hearings were held in 1993, shortly after the victim told the police that the defendant had raped her.² At the parole revocation hearings, the defendant admitted having sexual intercourse with the complainant, but claimed it was consensual. *Id.* at ¶ 6. The defendant was sent back to prison for the parole violation, but the State did not initiate any prosecution on the rape charge for almost 20 years, after the police ‘received a CODIS [Combined DNA Index System] hit confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation that they had made a preliminary association between a submitted rape kit and the Defendant.’  *Id.* Two witnesses who had testified at the parole revocation hearings were unavailable, including the defendant’s former employer, who was deceased.  *Id.* at ¶ 9. This witness, Norman Diamond, had testified at the revocation hearings that ‘he spoke with the alleged victim after the incident and the victim told Diamond that ‘she had feelings for [Dixon]’ and ‘if she could not have [Dixon], no one would.’  Diamond further testified that the alleged victim told him that the sexual encounter was ‘mutual with no force.’ ”  *Id.* In concluding that the defendant had established actual prejudice, the court commented that the case against the defendant hinged on the victim’s credibility.  *Id.* at ¶ 30. The court further observed that the testimony of the deceased witness directly supported the defendant’s assertion that the sex was consensual, and also undermined the victim’s testimony.  *Id.* Again, these facts are far different than those involved in the case before us. Hawkins never asserted that the sex was consensual or that witnesses existed. Hawkins also relies on *State v. Jones*, 148 Ohio St.3d 167, 2016-Ohio-5105, 69 N.E.3d 688, in which the court stated that a defendant’s ‘inability to articulate specifically what [a witness’s] testimony would have been does not render his claim of prejudice fatally speculative,’ as the court has ‘held that a defendant may establish actual prejudice where he or she is unable to seek verification of his or her story from a deceased witness.’  *Id.* at ¶ 28, citing *Luck*, 15 Ohio St. 3d at 157, 472 N.E.2d 1097. However, by making these comments, the court was not advancing a novel proposition of law; it was discussing its prior decision in Luck. Moreover, the issue in the case before us is not Hawkins’ inability to articulate the content of a deceased witness’s testimony; the relevant matter is that the trial court did not find Hawkins credible. As was noted, the trial court was in the best position to assess credibility, and we defer to the court’s factual findings. As a final matter, Hawkins contends that the State’s pre-indictment delay was not justifiable, as the police simply allowed the case to ‘slip through the cracks.’ Because Hawkins failed to meet his initial burden of proving actual prejudice, we need not consider this issue. See, e.g., Jones at ¶ 13, citing State v. Whiting, 84 Ohio St.3d 215, 217, 702 N.E.2d 1199 (1998), and State v. Adams, 144 Ohio St.3d 429, 2015-Ohio-3954, 45 N.E.3d 127, ¶ 99. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it concluded that Hawkins failed to establish actual prejudice. The First Assignment of Error, therefore, is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Under this assignment of error, Hawkins contends that he suffered actual prejudice due to a delay of nearly 13 years between the alleged crime and the filing of the indictment. Hawkins’ claim of prejudice is based on the fact that the only two persons who could potentially corroborate what happened on the night in question are now deceased. ‘An unjustifiable delay between the commission of an offense and a defendant's indictment therefor, which results in actual prejudice to the defendant, is a violation of the right to due process of law under Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.’ State v. Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097 (1984), paragraph two of the syllabus. ‘Once a defendant presents evidence of actual prejudice, the burden shifts to the state to produce evidence of a justifiable reason for the delay.’ (Citations omitted.)

Walls, 96 Ohio St.3d 437, 2002-Ohio-5059, 775 N.E.2d 829, ¶ 52, quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 325, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971). To make this assessment, ‘courts are to consider the evidence as it exists when the indictment is filed and the prejudice the defendant will suffer at trial due to the delay.’ Walls at ¶ 52, citing Luck at 154. (Other citation omitted.) However, ‘speculative prejudice does not satisfy the defendant's burden.’ Jones at ¶ 20, citing Luck at ¶ 56. (Other citation omitted.) In the case before us, the trial court heard from the following witnesses at the evidentiary hearings in connection with Hawkins’ motion to dismiss: Brian Hawkins; Wayne Miller, Hawkins’ private investigator; Carol Ewing, a retired detective with the Dayton Police Department (“DPD”); Lindsey Dulaney, a current detective with the DPD Special Victims’ Unit (“SVU”); Gary Ware, an investigator with the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office; and Justin Hayes, a training detective for the DPD SVU. The testimony of these individuals revealed the following factual background. In July 2002, Ewing was a detective assigned to the DPD sexual assault child endangerment unit. Ewing was assigned a case involving A.J., who had allegedly been raped in the early morning hours of July 30, 2002, while she was a runaway from a foster home. The rape occurred outdoors behind the Wesley Center, which was located on Delphos Avenue, in Dayton, Ohio.¹ At the time, A.J. was fifteen years old. After the alleged rape, A.J. ran to a nearby Burger King, which was located a few blocks from the Wesley Center, and pounded on the restaurant’s door. A security guard answered and called the police, who transported A.J. to Dayton Children’s Hospital, where a rape kit was done. The rape kit was then sent to the Miami Valley Regional Crime Lab (“MVRCL”) for processing. Originally, based on information as to the assailant’s alleged nickname of ‘Twin,’ Ewing put together two photospreads, but A.J. did not pick out either of the suspected individuals. On August 6, 2002, A.J. provided Ewing with Brian Hawkins’ name, which A.J. had obtained from friends. Ewing compiled another photospread, and on August 14, 2002, A.J. identified Hawkins as the person who had committed the rape. Ewing interviewed Hawkins in his home on October 29, 2002, because he had been recently shot and could not walk. The interview was not recorded. Ewing would have noted in her report if Hawkins were heavily sedated or under the influence during the interview. She did not make such a notation. Ewing told Hawkins the date of the alleged offense, and he said he thought he might have been in the hospital at the time. Ewing later followed up and learned that Hawkins had been in the hospital on August 11, 2002, which was about a week and a half after the alleged rape. Ewing asked Hawkins if he knew someone with A.J.’s name, and he said he did not. He stated that he did not know A.J., that he would not have sex with a minor, and that he would not have sex outside. Hawkins did not provide Ewing with the names of any witnesses or an alibi. If Hawkins had given Ewing the names of witnesses, she would have followed up. Hawkins recalled talking to a detective in October 2002. He stated that he had just gotten shot and was sedated. Although he could not recall what the detective said, he also testified that she talked about a knife, which ‘threw’ him off. He said he thought they had the wrong person because he had never pulled a knife on anyone. The police did not show him any pictures of the victim. He also denied that he had said he would not have sex outside, as he had done that plenty of times. He claimed Ewing had lied in her report. In November 2002, Ewing was injured and her last day of work was February 2, 2004. During the interim, she had two surgeries and at some point was on restricted duty until she retired. She could not recall specific dates, other than that she had her first surgery in July 2003. In February or March 2003, Ewing received results back from MVRCL, indicating the presence of sperm in the rape kit. Ewing then obtained a court order in October 2003 for a buccal swab from Hawkins. At that point, Ewing was on restricted duty, and another detective obtained the sample from Hawkins. DPD did not receive the results from the DNA test until March 2004, which was after Ewing retired. Hawkins’ DNA was a match, and there would have been sufficient cause at that time for the police to present the case to the prosecutor’s office. Ewing’s notes on the case, including the photo spread, were kept in a packet, which was the official police file. There would have been a notation on the front concerning whether the case was closed or open. Ewing also kept her pending cases in a certain file cabinet. She did not know what happened to the case files after she left the DPD, and she did not recall if she specifically told someone that there were pending cases in the file cabinet. Hawkins continued to reside in the Dayton area and did not move out of state between 2002 and 2015. Nothing more was done on the case until January 2015, when Detective Dulaney received a phone call from the Miami County Prosecutor’s Office, indicating that the office had received a CODIS hit or DNA match on a case that was an investigation in the city of Dayton. The prosecutor sent Dulaney a copy of the 2004 lab report. Dulaney pulled the police report and saw that A.J.’s case had never been presented to the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office. After the case was assigned to her, Dulaney located A.J., and spoke with her. Dulaney also attempted to find Hawkins to obtain his side of the story, but could not locate him at the time. Dulaney was never able to locate Ewing’s packet, which contained the photo spread and Ewing’s notes. However, any notes that Ewing took and anything she did during her investigation would have been put into a police report. Dulaney was able to obtain a copy of the police report, because that was stored electronically. The police were also able to locate the following evidence: the 2002 rape kit, which was stored at the old Montgomery County Jail; Hawkins' buccal swab, which was still at MVRCL; and A.J.'s clothing, which was still intact. In addition, DPD was able to locate the following witnesses: the MVRCL employee who had processed the rape kit; the doctor and nurse who had collected the rape kit and who were still working at Dayton Children's Hospital; the Burger King security guard, who recalled speaking to A.J.; and the DPD officer who had responded to the call from the Burger King. This officer had retired from the DPD, but recalled the incident. After being unable to find Hawkins, Detective Dulaney entered a suspect locator into the police system, which meant that if police came into contact with Hawkins, he would be told that Dulaney wished to speak with him. After the locator was in the system for a time with no success, the prosecutor went to a grand jury and obtained a warrant for Hawkins' arrest. In May 2015, Dulaney was able to interview Hawkins. At the time, he was in jail and was transported to the Safety Building for an interview.

During the interview, Hawkins did not give Dulaney the names or addresses of any witnesses. If he had given her names, she would have tried to locate the witnesses. At the pre-indictment hearing, Hawkins testified that he had reviewed the police report as part of discovery and did not deny having sex with A.J.

At that point, for reasons that were not clear in the record, an indictment was obtained against Luck, and she was arrested. Id. While under arrest, Luck made a confession at the police station, indicating that she had been physically attacked by the decedent, who was then killed in the fight that ensued. Id. at 157. According to Luck’s confession, another individual, who was her acquaintance (and who had also been an original suspect) was present at the time of the alleged murder. *Id.* She told the police that this person, who was the only one who could help her, was dead. *Id.* After concluding that the confession had been illegally obtained, the court found that defendant was ‘obviously prejudiced by not being able to seek verification of her story from [the deceased witness] and thereby establish mitigating factors or a defense to the charge against her.’ *Id.* at 158. Finding both actual prejudice and an unjustifiable delay by the State, the court affirmed the dismissal of the murder charge. *Id.* at 159. Unlike the defendant in *Luck*, Hawkins never asserted, either when he was originally interviewed in 2002, or when he was interviewed in 2015, that he had consensual sex with A.J. and that witnesses existed who could verify his story. Instead, he denied that he had been involved in any such incident. Consequently, *Luck* is not directly comparable to the case before us. In *State v. Dixon*, 2015-Ohio-3144, 40 N.E.3d 601 (8th Dist.), the State waited almost 20 years to indict a defendant for rape. *Id.* at ¶ 2. After the trial court dismissed the charge due to pre-indictment delay, the Eighth District Court of Appeals affirmed. Notably, in that case, two parole revocation hearings were held in 1993, shortly after the victim told the police that the defendant had raped her.² At the parole revocation hearings, the defendant admitted having sexual intercourse with the complainant, but claimed it was consensual. *Id.* at ¶ 6. The defendant was sent back to prison for the parole violation, but the State did not initiate any prosecution on the rape charge for almost 20 years, after the police ‘received a CODIS [Combined DNA Index System] hit confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation that they had made a preliminary association between a submitted rape kit and the Defendant.’  *Id.* Two witnesses who had testified at the parole revocation hearings were unavailable, including the defendant’s former employer, who was deceased.  *Id.* at ¶ 9. This witness, Norman Diamond, had testified at the revocation hearings that ‘he spoke with the alleged victim after the incident and the victim told Diamond that ‘she had feelings for [Dixon]’ and ‘if she could not have [Dixon], no one would.’  Diamond further testified that the alleged victim told him that the sexual encounter was ‘mutual with no force.’ ”  *Id.* In concluding that the defendant had established actual prejudice, the court commented that the case against the defendant hinged on the victim’s credibility.  *Id.* at ¶ 30. The court further observed that the testimony of the deceased witness directly supported the defendant’s assertion that the sex was consensual, and also undermined the victim’s testimony.  *Id.* Again, these facts are far different than those involved in the case before us. Hawkins never asserted that the sex was consensual or that witnesses existed. Hawkins also relies on *State v. Jones*, 148 Ohio St.3d 167, 2016-Ohio-5105, 69 N.E.3d 688, in which the court stated that a defendant’s ‘inability to articulate specifically what [a witness’s] testimony would have been does not render his claim of prejudice fatally speculative,’ as the court has ‘held that a defendant may establish actual prejudice where he or she is unable to seek verification of his or her story from a deceased witness.’  *Id.* at ¶ 28, citing *Luck*, 15 Ohio St. 3d at 157, 472 N.E.2d 1097. However, by making these comments, the court was not advancing a novel proposition of law; it was discussing its prior decision in Luck. Moreover, the issue in the case before us is not Hawkins’ inability to articulate the content of a deceased witness’s testimony; the relevant matter is that the trial court did not find Hawkins credible. As was noted, the trial court was in the best position to assess credibility, and we defer to the court’s factual findings. As a final matter, Hawkins contends that the State’s pre-indictment delay was not justifiable, as the police simply allowed the case to ‘slip through the cracks.’ Because Hawkins failed to meet his initial burden of proving actual prejudice, we need not consider this issue. See, e.g., Jones at ¶ 13, citing State v. Whiting, 84 Ohio St.3d 215, 217, 702 N.E.2d 1199 (1998), and State v. Adams, 144 Ohio St.3d 429, 2015-Ohio-3954, 45 N.E.3d 127, ¶ 99. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it concluded that Hawkins failed to establish actual prejudice. The First Assignment of Error, therefore, is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

In the course of arguing these issues, he also takes issue with the way in which the state obtained cell phone records. This court’s review of a decision on a motion to suppress is a mixed question of law and fact. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects people from illegal searches and seizures. In order to employ Fourth Amendment protections, a defendant must have a 'constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.' Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 360, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). The United States Supreme Court has directed reviewing courts to consider a two-part test in order to determine whether the Fourth Amendment is implicated. 'First, has the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search? Second, is society willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable?' California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207, 211, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986), citing Katz at 360. To the extent appellant challenges the decision related to the search warrants for the attachment of a GPS tracking device, this court cannot properly address those arguments. Appellant’s initial suppression motion references the warrants and accompanying affidavits, but those documents were not attached. At the suppression hearing, appellant did not introduce those documents as exhibits. As a result, those documents were not before the trial court at the appropriate time. We cannot discern the merit of appellant’s arguments without these documents. Statements made in a search warrant affidavit enjoy a presumption of validity. State v. Taylor, 174 Ohio App.3d 477, 2007-Ohio-7066, 882 N.E.2d 945 (1st Dist.). Without evidence to the contrary, this court is bound to find the statements made in the affidavit valid and, thus, the warrants valid. The evidence adduced at the suppression hearing indicated that police were investigating an incident where a person cashed fraudulent checks made to resemble payroll checks. Officers interviewed an individual, D.H., and she provided them with a phone number that she says was used to contact her in order to arrange the provision of a fraudulent check to her. She indicated the person with whom she communicated was named 'Ike,' and the two had exchanged text messages and talked over the phone. With her permission, officers examined her phone and viewed the text messages that were exchanged between that phone number and the person being interviewed. Det. Duffy then approached a municipal court judge for an order directing the cell phone provider to release records related to the account. Det. Duffy relayed the steps in the investigation that had occurred and the statements made by the individual under the investigation. Det. Duffy did not disclose that this individual had a history of mental illness and was recently hospitalized for mental health treatment, and did not disclose that this individual lied about her current address. The judge issued a court order directing AT&T to produce subscriber records relating to the phone number provided, including address, call logs, location data, and text messages. Det. Duffy and Det. Witalis received information regarding the phone number from AT&T, and the subscriber information was not helpful. The account information provided did not include a name, and the address listed was a California address. Det. Witalis described the phone as a 'burner' or anonymous phone. Using information contained in the call logs, Det. Witalis testified that he determined, through the frequency of the calls and other information, that the phone was likely related to an address on Monticello Boulevard in Richmond Heights, Ohio. A records check revealed a car registration for a white Oldsmobile Aurora owned by a person at that address. Upon surveillance of that address, he observed a car that matched the description provided by D.H., a white Oldsmobile Aurora. First, the trial court held that appellant did not have an expectation of privacy because he denied being the owner of the phone, the subscriber using the phone, or associated with the phone in any way. For a person to have been aggrieved by an unlawful search or seizure, he or she'must have been a victim of a search or seizure, one against whom the search was directed, as distinguished from one who claims prejudice only through the use of evidence gathered as a consequence of a search or seizure directed at someone else.' State v. Crawford, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98605, 2013-Ohio-1659, ¶ 45, quoting Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 173, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969), quoting Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 261, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960). This, alone, is a basis to affirm the trial court’s decision. Appellant has maintained that these records do not pertain to him. Therefore, he would not be aggrieved by a search of these records. However, because the state has asserted that these are records that relate to appellant in that they pertain to a cell phone used by appellant, in an abundance of caution, this court will analyze the matter further. This court has previously found no privacy right exists for cell phone records maintained by a phone company. Id. at ¶ 47 ('telephone users have no right of privacy in the numerical information they convey to the telephone company. Courts have also held that this reasoning applies to cell phone records obtained from cell phone companies as well.'), citing State v. Neely, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24317, 2012-Ohio-212; United States v. Dye, N.D.Ohio No. 1:10CR221, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47287 (Apr. 27, 2011). Information that has been voluntarily turned over to third parties does not enjoy protection because a person does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in such information. The Second District has reaffirmed its holding in Neely and found that an individual has no constitutional privacy interest in cell phone location data, or ping data, maintained by a cell phone carrier. State v. Taylor, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25764, 2014-Ohio-2550. The request for information sent to the phone company in that case requested location data, call logs, and subscriber information. Id. at ¶ 8. The court order in the present case also sought text messages. The request for text messages could lead to the disclosure of metadata about appellant’s communications as well as the content of communications where a privacy interest may exist. 18 U.S.C.S. 2703(c) specifically limits its application to records of electronic communications, but subsection (b) provides for the release of the contents of communications of a remote computing service only with prior notice to the subscriber and other restrictions. It is unclear from the suppression hearing whether any contents of text messages were, in fact, turned over and, if they were, whether they were used against appellant in any manner. If the requested information turned over by the phone company was limited to the date, time, and phone numbers of exchanged text messages, then appellant would not have a privacy interest in that metadata. Det. Duffy testified that he used the call logs of the anonymous cell phone to link that number to others that were frequently called. Through an investigation of those numbers, using searches of publicly available information, he was able to identify a residential address that was in some way associated with the person that used the anonymous phone. An Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles search yielded a vehicle matching the description given to police that was also associated with the address. There is no indication that the contents of the communications to which appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy were turned over as a result of the court order or, if the contents of text messages were turned over, were used in the investigation against appellant as a result of the court order. Appellant has the burden of at least prima facie establishing a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to privacy, and without showing that the contents of text messages were, in fact, turned over to police, appellant has not made that showing. Appellant argues that the records disclosed to police were not turned over in discovery. This court cannot review such a claim, but it is apparent that appellant did not ask the detectives that testified at the suppression hearing whether the contents of text messages were disclosed. Further, the records were not otherwise used at trial. Therefore, the trial court did not err in this respect when denying appellant’s motion to suppress. Appellant also argues that there were material omissions made to the judge issuing the order that should have resulted in a lack of reasonable suspicion. Generally, when this court is reviewing this type of issue, there is a search warrant affidavit that details the information relayed to the authorizing judge. In this case, there is no affidavit relating to the court order used to obtain cell phone records, but Det. Duffy testified about the information relayed to the issuing judge. Det. Duffy readily admitted that he did not disclose that the witness had lied to him about her residence, and that he did not disclose that she was recently hospitalized for mental illness. Appellant likens this to cases where a search warrant affidavit contained material misstatements or omissions, allegedly causing them to be fatally deficient. See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). In those cases, 'a defendant who claims that a warrant is flawed because it is based upon a false statement must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the affiant made a false statement, either intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth.' State v. Tinsley, 2d Dist. No. 23542, 2010 Ohio 3535, ¶ 23, citing Franks [v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-156, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978)]. State v. Perry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 97572, 2012-Ohio-4273, ¶ 15. The Perry court went on to note that 'even if the affidavit contains false statements [or omissions] made intentionally or recklessly, a warrant based on the affidavit is still valid unless, with the affidavit’s false material set to one side [or with the omissions included], the affidavit’s remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause.' Id. at ¶ 16, quoting State v. Sells, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2005-CA-8, 2006-Ohio-1859, ¶ 11, citing State v. Waddy, 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 441, 588 N.E.2d 819 (1992). Here, this issuance of the court order for records is governed by a standard less than probable cause due to the lack of a privacy interest in the requested records. 18 U.S.C.S. 2703(d). According to this statute, the standard for the issuing judge is whether 'the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.' This standard is similar to that fleshed out in the Terry line of cases. United States v. Warshak, 631 F.3d 266, 291 (6th Cir.2010), citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Under this standard, an investigative search is reasonable when the state actor is able to point to articulable facts that give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. State v. Eddy, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. Assuming for the sake of argument that appellant has standing and an interest in the cell phone records, even with the omissions appellant points out, there still exists a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity based on the factual recitation above. The GPS search warrants and affidavits are not attached to any of appellant’s suppression motions filed with the clerk. However, an undocketed, unfiled copy of appellant’s May 18, 2016 suppression motion is included in the lower court file. This document has hand-written notations and other irregularities. Therefore, given these limitations, this court will examine appellant’s arguments in light of these warrants and affidavits. Attached to a May 7, 2015 GPS warrant is an affidavit executed by Det. Witalis. There, he describes the investigation of several individuals passing bad checks and the individuals supplying these checks. The information provided by D.H. was set forth, including the phone contact she had with a person named 'Ike' and the fact that he drove a white Oldsmobile Aurora. Det. Witalis averred that he was able to use phone records from the number provided by D.H. to hone in on a person closely associated with that phone number that also owned a white Oldsmobile Aurora. Detectives and a secret service agent then met with D.H. again and she picked appellant out of a photo array and identified him as Ike. Further surveillance of the address that Det. Witalis identified as being closely related to the cell phone number provided by D.H. resulted in Det. Witalis observing appellant driving the white Oldsmobile Aurora. This court’s review is further hampered by the nature of the record in this case because there are two documents purporting to be GPS warrants issued on May 7, 2015, for the same vehicle and appear to be copies of the same warrant. However, the affidavit attached to each is different. The second May 7, 2015 search warrant affidavit avers similar statements, but also included that an officer had taken a statement from J.M. She was caught attempting to pass a fraudulent check and indicated that it was supplied to her by someone who identified himself by the name of 'Black' and drove a white Oldsmobile Aurora. A June 24, 2015 warrant for an extension of the original GPS warrant indicated that appellant’s vehicle was at several banks when attempts were made to pass fraudulent checks. Det. Witalis also averred that the vehicle visited a check cashing business — the same check cashing business that employed Bohanon — prior to visiting the various financial institutions where fraudulent checks were passed. Regardless, at the suppression hearing, appellant argued in his opening statement that the GPS warrant affidavits were deficient, but then failed to pursue the issue further at the suppression hearing. All the evidence adduced was in relation to the court order issued by a municipal court judge for phone records, not the GPS warrants that were issued by a common pleas court judge. Appellant adduced testimony that detectives failed to disclose facts about D.H. — she had a history of mental illness including recent hospitalization, and she lied to police about her address — but that was in the context of the court order to obtain cell phone records. As this court recognized in Perry, it is the defendant’s burden to demonstrate a material misstatement or omission in a search warrant affidavit under Franks. Perry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 97572, 2012-Ohio-4273, ¶ 15. Appellant failed to do so at the suppression hearing. Therefore, appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

Cuyahoga No. Assuming for the sake of argument that appellant has standing and an interest in the cell phone records, even with the omissions appellant points out, there still exists a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity based on the factual recitation above. The GPS search warrants and affidavits are not attached to any of appellant’s suppression motions filed with the clerk. However, an undocketed, unfiled copy of appellant’s May 18, 2016 suppression motion is included in the lower court file. This document has hand-written notations and other irregularities. Therefore, given these limitations, this court will examine appellant’s arguments in light of these warrants and affidavits. Attached to a May 7, 2015 GPS warrant is an affidavit executed by Det. Witalis. There, he describes the investigation of several individuals passing bad checks and the individuals supplying these checks. The information provided by D.H. was set forth, including the phone contact she had with a person named 'Ike' and the fact that he drove a white Oldsmobile Aurora. Det. Witalis averred that he was able to use phone records from the number provided by D.H. to hone in on a person closely associated with that phone number that also owned a white Oldsmobile Aurora. Detectives and a secret service agent then met with D.H. again and she picked appellant out of a photo array and identified him as Ike. Further surveillance of the address that Det. Witalis identified as being closely related to the cell phone number provided by D.H. resulted in Det. Witalis observing appellant driving the white Oldsmobile Aurora. This court’s review is further hampered by the nature of the record in this case because there are two documents purporting to be GPS warrants issued on May 7, 2015, for the same vehicle and appear to be copies of the same warrant. However, the affidavit attached to each is different. The second May 7, 2015 search warrant affidavit avers similar statements, but also included that an officer had taken a statement from J.M. She was caught attempting to pass a fraudulent check and indicated that it was supplied to her by someone who identified himself by the name of 'Black' and drove a white Oldsmobile Aurora. A June 24, 2015 warrant for an extension of the original GPS warrant indicated that appellant’s vehicle was at several banks when attempts were made to pass fraudulent checks. Det. Witalis also averred that the vehicle visited a check cashing business — the same check cashing business that employed Bohanon — prior to visiting the various financial institutions where fraudulent checks were passed. Regardless, at the suppression hearing, appellant argued in his opening statement that the GPS warrant affidavits were deficient, but then failed to pursue the issue further at the suppression hearing. All the evidence adduced was in relation to the court order issued by a municipal court judge for phone records, not the GPS warrants that were issued by a common pleas court judge. Appellant adduced testimony that detectives failed to disclose facts about D.H. — she had a history of mental illness including recent hospitalization, and she lied to police about her address — but that was in the context of the court order to obtain cell phone records. As this court recognized in Perry, it is the defendant’s burden to demonstrate a material misstatement or omission in a search warrant affidavit under Franks. Perry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 97572, 2012-Ohio-4273, ¶ 15. Appellant failed to do so at the suppression hearing. Therefore, appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

In the course of arguing these issues, he also takes issue with the way in which the state obtained cell phone records. This court’s review of a decision on a motion to suppress is a mixed question of law and fact. The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution protects people from illegal searches and seizures. In order to employ Fourth Amendment protections, a defendant must have a 'constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy.' Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 360, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). The United States Supreme Court has directed reviewing courts to consider a two-part test in order to determine whether the Fourth Amendment is implicated. 'First, has the individual manifested a subjective expectation of privacy in the object of the challenged search? Second, is society willing to recognize that expectation as reasonable?' California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207, 211, 106 S.Ct. 1809, 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986), citing Katz at 360. To the extent appellant challenges the decision related to the search warrants for the attachment of a GPS tracking device, this court cannot properly address those arguments. Appellant’s initial suppression motion references the warrants and accompanying affidavits, but those documents were not attached. At the suppression hearing, appellant did not introduce those documents as exhibits. As a result, those documents were not before the trial court at the appropriate time. We cannot discern the merit of appellant’s arguments without these documents. Statements made in a search warrant affidavit enjoy a presumption of validity. State v. Taylor, 174 Ohio App.3d 477, 2007-Ohio-7066, 882 N.E.2d 945 (1st Dist.). Without evidence to the contrary, this court is bound to find the statements made in the affidavit valid and, thus, the warrants valid. The evidence adduced at the suppression hearing indicated that police were investigating an incident where a person cashed fraudulent checks made to resemble payroll checks. Officers interviewed an individual, D.H., and she provided them with a phone number that she says was used to contact her in order to arrange the provision of a fraudulent check to her. She indicated the person with whom she communicated was named 'Ike,' and the two had exchanged text messages and talked over the phone. With her permission, officers examined her phone and viewed the text messages that were exchanged between that phone number and the person being interviewed. Det. Duffy then approached a municipal court judge for an order directing the cell phone provider to release records related to the account. Det. Duffy relayed the steps in the investigation that had occurred and the statements made by the individual under the investigation. Det. Duffy did not disclose that this individual had a history of mental illness and was recently hospitalized for mental health treatment, and did not disclose that this individual lied about her current address. The judge issued a court order directing AT&T to produce subscriber records relating to the phone number provided, including address, call logs, location data, and text messages. Det. Duffy and Det. Witalis received information regarding the phone number from AT&T, and the subscriber information was not helpful. The account information provided did not include a name, and the address listed was a California address. Det. Witalis described the phone as a 'burner' or anonymous phone. Using information contained in the call logs, Det. Witalis testified that he determined, through the frequency of the calls and other information, that the phone was likely related to an address on Monticello Boulevard in Richmond Heights, Ohio. A records check revealed a car registration for a white Oldsmobile Aurora owned by a person at that address. Upon surveillance of that address, he observed a car that matched the description provided by D.H., a white Oldsmobile Aurora. First, the trial court held that appellant did not have an expectation of privacy because he denied being the owner of the phone, the subscriber using the phone, or associated with the phone in any way. For a person to have been aggrieved by an unlawful search or seizure, he or she'must have been a victim of a search or seizure, one against whom the search was directed, as distinguished from one who claims prejudice only through the use of evidence gathered as a consequence of a search or seizure directed at someone else.' State v. Crawford, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98605, 2013-Ohio-1659, ¶ 45, quoting Alderman v. United States, 394 U.S. 165, 173, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22 L.Ed.2d 176 (1969), quoting Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 261, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960). This, alone, is a basis to affirm the trial court’s decision. Appellant has maintained that these records do not pertain to him. Therefore, he would not be aggrieved by a search of these records. However, because the state has asserted that these are records that relate to appellant in that they pertain to a cell phone used by appellant, in an abundance of caution, this court will analyze the matter further. This court has previously found no privacy right exists for cell phone records maintained by a phone company. Id. at ¶ 47 ('telephone users have no right of privacy in the numerical information they convey to the telephone company. Courts have also held that this reasoning applies to cell phone records obtained from cell phone companies as well.'), citing State v. Neely, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24317, 2012-Ohio-212; United States v. Dye, N.D.Ohio No. 1:10CR221, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47287 (Apr. 27, 2011). Information that has been voluntarily turned over to third parties does not enjoy protection because a person does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in such information. The Second District has reaffirmed its holding in Neely and found that an individual has no constitutional privacy interest in cell phone location data, or ping data, maintained by a cell phone carrier. State v. Taylor, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25764, 2014-Ohio-2550. The request for information sent to the phone company in that case requested location data, call logs, and subscriber information. Id. at ¶ 8. The court order in the present case also sought text messages. The request for text messages could lead to the disclosure of metadata about appellant’s communications as well as the content of communications where a privacy interest may exist. 18 U.S.C.S. 2703(c) specifically limits its application to records of electronic communications, but subsection (b) provides for the release of the contents of communications of a remote computing service only with prior notice to the subscriber and other restrictions. It is unclear from the suppression hearing whether any contents of text messages were, in fact, turned over and, if they were, whether they were used against appellant in any manner. If the requested information turned over by the phone company was limited to the date, time, and phone numbers of exchanged text messages, then appellant would not have a privacy interest in that metadata. Det. Duffy testified that he used the call logs of the anonymous cell phone to link that number to others that were frequently called. Through an investigation of those numbers, using searches of publicly available information, he was able to identify a residential address that was in some way associated with the person that used the anonymous phone. An Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles search yielded a vehicle matching the description given to police that was also associated with the address. There is no indication that the contents of the communications to which appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy were turned over as a result of the court order or, if the contents of text messages were turned over, were used in the investigation against appellant as a result of the court order. Appellant has the burden of at least prima facie establishing a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to privacy, and without showing that the contents of text messages were, in fact, turned over to police, appellant has not made that showing. Appellant argues that the records disclosed to police were not turned over in discovery. This court cannot review such a claim, but it is apparent that appellant did not ask the detectives that testified at the suppression hearing whether the contents of text messages were disclosed. Further, the records were not otherwise used at trial. Therefore, the trial court did not err in this respect when denying appellant’s motion to suppress. Appellant also argues that there were material omissions made to the judge issuing the order that should have resulted in a lack of reasonable suspicion. Generally, when this court is reviewing this type of issue, there is a search warrant affidavit that details the information relayed to the authorizing judge. In this case, there is no affidavit relating to the court order used to obtain cell phone records, but Det. Duffy testified about the information relayed to the issuing judge. Det. Duffy readily admitted that he did not disclose that the witness had lied to him about her residence, and that he did not disclose that she was recently hospitalized for mental illness. Appellant likens this to cases where a search warrant affidavit contained material misstatements or omissions, allegedly causing them to be fatally deficient. See Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978). In those cases, 'a defendant who claims that a warrant is flawed because it is based upon a false statement must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the affiant made a false statement, either intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth.' State v. Tinsley, 2d Dist. No. 23542, 2010 Ohio 3535, ¶ 23, citing Franks [v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-156, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978)]. State v. Perry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 97572, 2012-Ohio-4273, ¶ 15. The Perry court went on to note that 'even if the affidavit contains false statements [or omissions] made intentionally or recklessly, a warrant based on the affidavit is still valid unless, with the affidavit’s false material set to one side [or with the omissions included], the affidavit’s remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause.' Id. at ¶ 16, quoting State v. Sells, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2005-CA-8, 2006-Ohio-1859, ¶ 11, citing State v. Waddy, 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 441, 588 N.E.2d 819 (1992). Here, this issuance of the court order for records is governed by a standard less than probable cause due to the lack of a privacy interest in the requested records. 18 U.S.C.S. 2703(d). According to this statute, the standard for the issuing judge is whether 'the governmental entity offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the contents of a wire or electronic communication, or the records or other information sought, are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.' This standard is similar to that fleshed out in the Terry line of cases. United States v. Warshak, 631 F.3d 266, 291 (6th Cir.2010), citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Under this standard, an investigative search is reasonable when the state actor is able to point to articulable facts that give rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. State v.

A June 24, 2015 warrant for an extension of the original GPS warrant indicated that appellant’s vehicle was at several banks when attempts were made to pass fraudulent checks. Det. Witalis also averred that the vehicle visited a check cashing business — the same check cashing business that employed Bohanon — prior to visiting the various financial institutions where fraudulent checks were passed. Regardless, at the suppression hearing, appellant argued in his opening statement that the GPS warrant affidavits were deficient, but then failed to pursue the issue further at the suppression hearing. All the evidence adduced was in relation to the court order issued by a municipal court judge for phone records, not the GPS warrants that were issued by a common pleas court judge. Appellant adduced testimony that detectives failed to disclose facts about D.H. — she had a history of mental illness including recent hospitalization, and she lied to police about her address — but that was in the context of the court order to obtain cell phone records. As this court recognized in Perry, it is the defendant’s burden to demonstrate a material misstatement or omission in a search warrant affidavit under Franks. Perry, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 97572, 2012-Ohio-4273, ¶ 15. Appellant failed to do so at the suppression hearing. Therefore, appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}

When reviewing a judgment to determine if it is against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court ‘review[s] the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.’ State v. Mendoza, 137 Ohio App.3d 336, 738 N.E.2d 822 (3d Dist. 2000). Here, Rupert claims that the testimony of the victims was inconsistent and unreliable. The jury convicted Rupert of two counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05, which provides in pertinent part as follows. (A) No person shall have sexual contact with another, not the spouse of the offender; cause another, not the spouse of the offender, to have sexual contact with the offender; or cause two or more other persons to have sexual contact when any of the following applies: * * * (4) The other person, or one of the other persons, is less than thirteen years of age, whether or not the offender knows the age of that person. There is no dispute in this case that the two victims were under the age of 13 at the time of the offenses. Thus, the only question is whether there was credible evidence that Rupert had sexual contact with the victims. Sexual contact is defined as ‘any touching of an erogenous zone of another, including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if the person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.’ R.C. 2907.01(B). T.R., the victim of the actions making up Count 2, testified that on multiple occasions, Rupert would grab her hand and force her to touch her breasts, her vaginal area, or his ‘private area.’ Tr. 121. She also testified that Rupert would touch her vaginal area, breasts, and butt. Tr. 121. She indicated that most of the touching occurred over her clothing, but that there were two instances where he touched her vaginal area under her clothing. Tr. 128, 146-47. Rupert argues that this testimony is not credible because there were discrepancies in her testimony. The jury is the sole judge of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses. It may believe or disbelieve any witness or accept part of what a witness says and reject the rest. In reaching its verdict, the jury should consider the demeanor of the witness and the manner in which he testifies, his connection or relationship with the prosecution or the defendant, and his interest, if any, in the outcome. State v. Antill, 176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 197 N.E.2d 548 (1964). ‘The choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact.’ State v. Kruse, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-16-15, 2017-Ohio-5667, ¶ 66 quoting State v. Awan, 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 123, 489 N.E.2d 277 (1986). Here, the alleged inconsistencies were before the jury and it had the opportunity to weigh the evidence presented. The jury clearly took its task seriously as it found Rupert not guilty of Counts 3 and 4 which were also based upon T.R.’s testimony. E.B., who was the victim of the actions in Count 1, testified that she was lying on the bed in Rupert’s bedroom watching tv when he came in and laid on the bed behind her. Tr. 168-69. E.B. then testified that Rupert reached his arm over her and started touching her vagina inside her pants, but on the outside of her underwear. Tr. 169-70. According to E.B., Rupert was rubbing the outside of her vaginal area, but did not go inside of her. Tr. 171. Rupert argues this testimony lacks credibility because on redirect, she indicated that his finger went in. However, as discussed above, the jury was given the opportunity to hear all of the evidence, including the inconsistencies and determine what was credible. The jury was not required to believe all of the testimony. The jury evidently chose to believe the testimony given on direct because it found Rupert not guilty of rape, but guilty of the lesser included offense of gross sexual imposition. The jury also found him not guilty of sexual battery as it related to E.B. Viewing all the evidence as a whole, we cannot say that the evidence weighs heavily against conviction or that the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice.

He contends that the jury lost its way when it reconciled the conflicting evidence in favor of the state. In reviewing a challenge to the weight of the evidence, we sit as a 'thirteenth juror.' State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). We must review the entire record, weigh the evidence, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. Id. Hayes argues that Kelley's and Johnson's testimony was not credible, that Chandler's investigation did not properly test their reliability, and that the evidence relating to the white SUV was inconclusive. A. Kelley's Credibility Hayes argues that Kelley's prior use of the court system against Hayes diluted her credibility. Defense counsel thoroughly cross-examined Kelley about her history of court filings and charges against Hayes, so that the jury was able to use that information in determining her credibility. And in closing argument, defense counsel walked through the timing of each of Kelley's filings against Hayes and argued that Kelley 'knows how to weaponize the Court system to try to get what she wants.' He also argued, 'We've gotten the legal past of Ms. Kelley: the filing, after filing, after filing, after filing that she has done to try and get a conviction on Mr. Hayes.' Therefore, the jury was able to weigh Kelley's credibility in light of her previous use of the court system. Next, Hayes points out that Kelley was admonished numerous times by the trial court to confine her testimony to the questions asked and to stop inserting gratuitous commentary. However, Hayes did not assign as error the trial court's failure to control Kelley as a witness. Nonetheless, the court's admonitions to Kelley were made in the jury's presence, so the jury could weigh them in assessing Kelley's testimony. Hayes also argues that there was an unexplained 36-minute lapse between the time that a neighbor knocked on Kelley's door at 7:00 a.m., and Kelley's 911 call at 7:36 a.m. Kelley testified that the neighbor knocked at 'about' 7:00 a.m., and Johnson was asked to tell the jury what happened 'around' 7:00 a.m. Defense counsel argued this discrepancy in closing, so the jury was able to consider the evidence as to the timing of the call in relationship to the report of fire. In addition, Hayes argues that there were inconsistencies between Kelley’s statements to the 911 operator and Kelley’s testimony at trial as to whether Hayes walked or ran from the burning car, as to Kelley’s identification of Hayes by his tall, bowlegged frame despite not having seen his face, and Kelley’s not having told the 911 operator that Hayes had gotten into a white SUV. Defense counsel explored these inconsistencies during cross-examination and argued them in closing, so the jury was able to weigh them in considering Kelley’s credibility. B. Johnson’s Credibility Hayes argues that Johnson was not credible because he initially denied being at the scene of the burned car despite photos from Officer Cameron’s body-worn camera showing that Johnson was there. The jury heard defense counsel’s cross-examination of Johnson on the issue and defense counsel argued this inconsistency in closing: 'Then why is [Johnson] on the body cams standing right next to [Kelley]?' The jury, therefore, was able to weigh these inconsistencies when evaluating Johnson’s credibility. Hayes further argues that Johnson’s claim that he and Kelley did not discuss the case was belied by cell-phone records indicating that they had spoken 38 times in the days following the fire. However, those records were not admitted into evidence, and both Kelley and Johnson denied that contact. When asked if she had 38 contacts with Johnson between December 25 and January 4, Kelley said, 'I don’t know if I did or didn’t. * * * I don’t see how I would call him that many times.' Defense counsel asked Johnson, 'You said when your dog gets out * * * is when you contact Ms. Kelley. So between December 25th and January the 4th, did your dog get out 38 times?' Johnson replied, 'Hell no.' Counsel asked, 'So these records are wrong too?,' and Johnson replied, 'If I called her, it’s wrong. It might be butt dialed, but not no 38 times.' In closing, defense counsel argued, 'once they realized I had phone records, there had to be some explanation. And Mr. Johnson had that locked and loaded by the time he got to the stand.' Accordingly, the jury was able to weigh Johnson’s testimony about his contacts with Kelley. C. The Investigation Hayes argues that Chandler’s investigation unfairly targeted him from the start. He points to Chandler’s failure to obtain written statements from Kelley or Johnson and his failure to obtain Kelley’s cell phone records when she refused to hand over her phone. However, defense counsel explored these matters on cross-examination and argued them in closing, so the jury could assess the weight to be given to Chandler’s testimony. D. The White SUV Hayes argues that, at most, the LPR evidence established that a white SUV registered to Moore was tracked somewhere in the vicinity of Kelley’s apartment within 15 hours of the fire. Defense counsel cross-examined Whitton about the evidence and argued in closing: 'This white SUV that was seen somewhere in the vicinity, 15 hours later, at night, on the road that is not in question, with a driver that we cannot see and had no idea if there’s a passenger,' and 'This is the best they have to try to put Mr. Hayes in the area some 15-and-a-half hours later in a car that is not his in a location that is irrelevant to this case.' The jury heard the evidence and defense counsel’s cross-examination of Whitton and closing argument, and was able to assess what weight to give the evidence. E. Conclusion as to Manifest Weight Overall, the jury was in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses. See State v. Spaulding, 151 Ohio St.3d 378, 2016-Ohio-8126, 89 N.E.3d 554, ¶ 165, citing State v. DeHass, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212 (1967), paragraph one of the syllabus.

Hamilton No. C-180574, 2020-Ohio-1367, ¶ 36. This was not the rare case in which the jury lost its way and committed such a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting Hayes that his conviction must be reversed.

The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution forbids prosecutors from exercising peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. The Batson v. Kentucky case set forth a procedure for evaluating claims of racial discrimination in the use of peremptory strikes at criminal trials. The trial court committed clear error by allowing the strike, and we must reverse Saunders’s convictions and remand for a new trial. The dispute in this case involves prospective juror number 5, who is black. During voir dire, she indicated that her brother and brother-in-law had been convicted of murder and had turned their lives around after their release from prison. The prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges against two potential jurors, including Juror 5, and later stated that Juror 5's family situations prompted the strike. The prosecutor's reasoning involved the shared-race concern condemned in Batson. The trial court responded 'okay' without further inquiry and ultimately allowed the strike, even though Saunders established that the prosecutor's challenge was'motivated in substantial part by discriminatory intent.' The trial court's acceptance of the state's explanation and its denial of Saunders's equal-protection claim was clearly erroneous. Consequently, we sustain Saunders’s second assignment of error, reverse the trial court’s judgment, and remand this cause for a new trial.\"\n}\n```"}

[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Thank you. After the trial court overruled the prosecutor's objection, defense counsel continued his opening statement without any further interruption. Appellant contends the prosecutor's single objection during defense counsel's opening statement damaged his right to a fair trial. He argues that by interrupting defense counsel's opening remarks, the prosecutor 'tainted the jury' by'sending a signal to the jury that [defense counsel] d[id] not deserve to be listened to. This is bad behavior and an example of a prosecutor using dirty tricks to achieve his point.' 'For a conviction to be reversed because of prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must prove the prosecutor's acts were improper and that they prejudicially affected the defendant's substantial rights.' State v. Harner, 12th Dist. Clinton No. CA2019-05-011, 2020-Ohio-1184, ¶ 29, citing State v. Elmore, 111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, ¶ 62. 'To demonstrate prejudice, a defendant must show that the improper acts were so prejudicial that the outcome of the trial would clearly have been different had those improper acts not occurred.' State v. Kaufhold, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2019-09-148, 2020-Ohio-3835, ¶ 42, citing State v. Jones, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2006-11-298, 2008-Ohio-865, ¶ 21. 'The focus of 'an inquiry into allegations of prosecutorial misconduct is upon the fairness of the trial, not upon the culpability of the prosecutor.' Id. at ¶ 43, quoting State v. Gray, 12th Dist.

Landrum, 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 112 (1990) (noting that a defendant is not guaranteed an 'error free, perfect trial'). In the present case, appellant cannot establish that the prosecutor's objection was improper or that it prejudicially affected his substantial rights. 'Although it is considered quite rude to repeatedly object during another party's opening or closing, there is no rule prohibiting counsel from interrupting a party's arguments with valid objections.' State v. Mulvey, 7th Dist. Belmont No. 08 BE 31, 2009-Ohio-6756, ¶ 44. Here, although the trial court overruled the prosecutor's objection, there was a valid basis for the objection. The prosecutor objected as he believed defense counsel was attempting to use a police officer's statements to vouch for appellant's credibility. Not only are officers not permitted to render opinions on an accused's truthfulness; see State v. Carpenter, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-06-041, 2013-Ohio-1385, ¶ 18-20; but in this case, shortly before defense counsel gave his opening statement, the trial court admonished the jury as follows regarding an officer's ability to vouch for appellant's truthfulness: THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, both counsel asked questions of Capt. Hampton in terms of his belief in terms of whether or not Mr. Combs was being truthful. I probably should have then objected and not permitted anybody to inquire about that. The issue in terms of credibility is for you to decide, and a witness is not allowed to testify as to their opinion as to whether or not they believe a person was being truthful or untruthful. You can certainly consider everything that was testified to, the defendant's statement in relation to the evidence that has been offered. But you are instructed to disregard the testimony that was given, both in response to [defense counsel's] questioning, as well as [the prosecutor's] questioning, in terms of whether or not Capt. Hampton believed that Mr. Combs was being truthful. Okay? That's a decision ultimately that you're going to make. Accordingly, the prosecutor's objection was not improper and had a valid basis. Additionally, the prosecutor's single objection did not result in any prejudice to appellant. The objection, which consisted of the prosecutor saying, 'I'm going to object' and then a sidebar discussion, did not prejudice the jury or have an impact on the outcome of the trial. The jury continued to give their attention to defense counsel, and at the close of trial, rendered an acquittal on two of the three charges appellant faced. Appellant cannot demonstrate any prejudice and his claim of prosecutorial misconduct, therefore, fails. Appellant also argues he received ineffective representation from defense counsel as counsel failed to move for a mistrial following the interruption of defense counsel's opening statement. 'In order to prevail on an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, a defendant must prove that counsel's performance was deficient and that the defendant was prejudiced by counsel's deficient performance.' State v. Davis, 159 Ohio St.3d 31, 2020-Ohio-309, ¶ 10, citing State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 141-142 (1989) and Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). 'Thus, the defendant must demonstrate that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there exists a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.' Id., citing Bradley at paragraphs two and three of the syllabus. In the present case, appellant cannot demonstrate that counsel was deficient for not moving for a mistrial or that he was prejudiced by this decision. '[W]hether or not to move for a mistrial is a tactical decision and is well within the range of competent assistance of counsel.' State v. Gilbert, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2010-09-240, 2011-Ohio-4340, ¶ 83. Appellant was not prejudiced by counsel's decision not to move for a mistrial, as such a motion would have been futile. Mistrials are only declared 'when the ends of justice so require and a fair trial is no longer possible.' State v. Garner, 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 59 (1995). As discussed above, the prosecutor's sole objection during defense counsel's opening statement did not prevent appellant from receiving a fair trial and it did not affect the outcome of trial. Appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim is, therefore, without merit.\"\n}\n```"}

Three of the jurors indicated that they saw appellant in handcuffs; they all stated that they would not be prejudiced by their observations. All jurors that were questioned were admonished not to discuss the questioning with the other jurors. Denying counsel’s request for a mistrial, the court concluded that the incident was inadvertent and that those jurors who observed appellant were given a cautionary instruction. The court found that despite the incident, appellant could still receive a fair trial. Appellant acknowledges that “[i]n cases where a defendant is inadvertently witnessed by members of the jury in handcuffs or prison garb, there is a heavy burden on the defendant to justify a mistrial.” State v. James, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-86-171, 1988 WL 38861 (Apr. 22, 1988), citing Dupont v. Hall, 555 F.2d 15 (1st Cir.1977). Reviewing appellant’s argument we find that this burden has not been met and prejudice not demonstrated.\"\n}\n```"}

However, because the testimony was elicited on cross-examination to impeach Hamm (and not the accused—McDuffie) as to her credibility for truthfulness or untruthfulness, the evidence falls within the scope of Evid.R. 404(A)(3), 607, 611, 608(B) and not 404(B). See Evid.R. 404(A)(3), 607, 611, and 608(B). See also Evid.R. 616(A), (B). (Oct. 9, 2019 Tr. at 118-119, 121-123). Evid.R. 607 states in pertinent part: The credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party except that the credibility of a witness may be attacked by the party calling the witness by means of a prior inconsistent statement only upon a showing of surprise and affirmative damage. This exception does not apply to statements admitted pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(A), 801(D)(2), or 803. Evid.R. 607(A). 'Cross-examination shall be permitted on all relevant matters and matters affecting credibility.' State v. Potts, 3d Dist. Hancock No. 5-16-03, 2016-Ohio-5555, ¶ 73, quoting Evid.R. 611(B). Under Evid.R. 608, the credibility of a witness may be attacked through opinion, reputation, and specific instances of conduct evidence as to the character of the witness for truthfulness or untruthfulness. See Evid.R. 608. Moreover, and relevant to the facts presented, under Evid.R. 616, a witness may be impeached as to bias (motive to misrepresent), sensory or mental defect (inability to remember the events), and specific contradictions within certain limitations. See Evid.R. 616 (A)-(C). Here, the State attacked the credibility of Hamm on cross-examination under Evid.R. 608 and 616. (See Oct. 9, 2019 Tr. at 118-119, 121-123). Notwithstanding the permissibility of such an attack on a witness’ credibility under Evid.R. 608(B), Evid.R. 403(A) would mandate exclusion of this type of relevant-character evidence 'if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.' However, and important to this discussion, Hamm testified that the large quantity of crack cocaine (24.12 grams) seized was for her exclusive-personal use and that McDuffie was not aware that she used crack cocaine or that the crack cocaine was located in their bedroom. (See Oct. 9, 2019 Tr. at 87-88, 101, 110). Here, the State’s line of questioning (of Hamm) attacked Hamm’s credibility, since such evidence indicated that McDuffie was aware that Hamm possessed the drugs, and that such drugs were not for Hamm’s exclusive-personal use. (See id.). As a consequence, the jury was free to conclude that since Hamm was not credible (because she was untruthful as to McDuffie’s knowledge of her drug use and the purpose of her possession) perhaps the remainder of her testimony lacked any indicia of truthfulness. See State v. Schwegmann, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180053, 2018-Ohio-3757, ¶ 11, citing State v. Hussein, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-020155, 2003-Ohio-1369, ¶ 8, citing State v. Boggs, 63 Ohio St.3d 418, 421 (1992). Because McDuffie does not challenge whether Hamm’s testimony is relevant or admissible as such, we will not address the applicability of Evid.R. 401 and 402. Moreover, Hamm was subject to impeachment by the State as to bias (i.e., her motive to misrepresent the ownership of the drugs as well as McDuffie’s knowledge of the drugs because of their relationship) and to a sensory or mental defect (for her inability to remember certain text messages with McDuffie despite being able to recall other unrelated text messages). (See Oct. 9, 2019 Tr. at 97-98, 132, 133, 138, 141). See Hussein at ¶ 8-9. Her testimony is not merely contradictory testimony on collateral issues, but rather, material to the issue presently before the trial court regarding the truthfulness of this witness. See Boggs at 422. Nevertheless, the trial court admonished the parties to proceed carefully because of its duty to consider mandatory exclusion under Evid.R. 403(A) stating: [Trial Court] Again, that being said, I want to caution the parties that I’m going to continue to weigh the probative value as compared to the prejudicial effect of any evidence that might sought to be elicited. The mere fact that I’m saying that this witness can be cross-examined does not mean that everything is now fair game. And I think the Prosecutors know what I’m saying. Are [sic] well aware of the fact that the Defendant in this case is not charged with Trafficking, that I’m not, by saying that this witness can be cross-examined in order to examine potential inconsistencies or untruthfulness that there may be in her testimony for the purposes of impeaching her. That does not mean that I’m saying that the State would now have carte blanche to go into other things that may be indicative of trafficking of drugs on the part of the Defendant. We’re not going to go there. Let me [sic] abundantly clear about that. So anything further that we need to address while out of the presence of the jury? (Oct. 9, 2019 Tr. at 121-122). Notably, McDuffie never objected on the basis that exclusion was mandatory or discretionary under Evid.R. 403. Thus, upon our review of the record, we cannot conclude that there is an obvious defect in this trial that affected McDuffie’s substantial rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and even if we were to have concluded otherwise, McDuffie cannot demonstrate prejudice since Hamm was not able to recall the content of any of the text messages despite the attempts made by the State to refresh her recollection. (Id. at 132-133). See Evid.R. 612. Accordingly, McDuffie’s argument is without merit. Moreover, we cannot conclude that there is any error and certainly not error that rises to the level of plain error in relation to Hamm’s impeachment by the State, which has caused a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting a new trial. Therefore, McDuffie’s first assignment of error is overruled.\"\n}\n```"}
