Skatzes*, 104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, ¶ 216.

Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\n\n¶24 R.C. 2945.59 provides:\n\nIn any criminal case in which the defendant’s motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant’s scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\nRule 404(B) of the Ohio Rules of Evidence and R.C. 2945.59 preclude admission of other acts evidence to prove a character trait in order to demonstrate conduct in conformity with that trait. *State v. Williams*, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, ¶16. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts of an accused tending to show the plan with which an act is done may be admissible for other purposes, such as those listed in Evid.R. 404(B); to show “proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.”\n\nIn considering other acts evidence, trial courts should conduct a three-step analysis. The first step is to consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Evid.R. 401. Next, the trial court must consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show conformity therewith, or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B), proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident. Finally, a trial court is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. See Evid.R. 403, *Williams*, at ¶¶19-20.\n\n“Because R.C. 2945.59 and Evid.R. 404(B) codify an exception to the common law with respect to evidence of other acts of wrongdoing, they must be construed against admissibility, and the standard for determining admissibility of such evidence is strict.” *State v. Broom*, 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 281-82, 533 N.E.2d 682 (1988).\nAs cautioned by the Ohio Supreme Court in *State v. Lowe*, 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 634 N.E.2d 616 (1994), “…we therefore must be careful…to recognize the distinction between evidence which shows that a defendant is the type of person who might commit a particular crime and evidence which shows that a defendant is the person who committed a particular crime.” *Id.* at 530. Evidence to prove the character of person the defendant is to show he acted in conformity therewith is barred by Evid.R. 404(B).\n\n¶28 We must first determine whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact of consequence to determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. In *Williams*, the Ohio Supreme Court found testimony of prior acts describing grooming techniques were relevant to show the defendant’s intent was sexual gratification. *Williams*, supra, ¶22. Gross Sexual Imposition, with which the defendant was charged, requires “sexual contact.” R.C. 2907.05(A)(1). R.C. 2907.01 defines “sexual contact” to require the touching be for the purpose of “sexual arousing or gratifying either person.” In the instant case, Appellant was charged with both Rape and Gross Sexual Imposition, making intent of sexual gratification an element which the State must prove.\n\n¶29 The second step is to consider whether the evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show conformity therewith, or whether the acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose.\n\n¶30 In the case *sub judice*, Appellee was permitted to introduce the testimony of another child Appellant raped in similar fashion to that of ZS and AW, raping young female children living in the same home as Appellant when other adults were not around. In its Judgment Entry dated December 19, 2019, the trial court stated, “the sought-after\ntestimony is relevant because it may tend to prove what the prosecution alleges was the defendant’s motive and intent: to derive sexual gratification from groping and raping children.” We find the legitimate purpose of proving Appellant’s intent to derive sexual gratification from groping and raping children relevant for the charge of Gross Sexual Imposition.\n\n¶31 The final step is to consider whether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. In the case sub judice, the trial court gave a limiting instruction before the testimony, after the testimony, and at the close of trial, that the evidence may not be considered as character evidence and that Appellant acted in accordance with any such character trait. In Williams, the Ohio Supreme Court allowed the testimony because:\n\nThe evidence is not unduly prejudicial, because the trial court instructed the jury that this evidence could not be considered to show that Williams had acted in conformity with a character trait. This instruction lessened the prejudicial effect of A.B.’s testimony, and A.B. corroborated J.H.’s testimony about the sexual abuse, which had been denied by Williams. Thus Evid.R. 404(B) permitted admission of evidence of William’s prior crime because it helped to prove motive, preparation, and plan on the part of Williams. The prejudicial effect did not substantially outweigh the probative value of that evidence.134 Ohio St.3d 521, ¶24.\n\n¶32 In the case sub judice, the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence could not be considered to show that Appellant had acted in conformity with a character trait. The testimony tended to show Appellant’s motive to show sexual gratification for\ngroping and raping children. The prejudicial effect did not outweigh the probative value of that evidence.\n\n¶33 Moreover, assuming, arguendo, the trial court erred in admitting testimony from LC and EB, we find any error was harmless. Crim.R. 52(A) defines harmless error as “[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.” Before constitutional error can be considered harmless, we must be able to “declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Where no reasonable possibility exists that the unlawful testimony contributed to a conviction, the error is harmless and therefore will not be grounds for reversal. State v. Lytle, 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 358 N.E.2d 623 (1976), paragraph three of the syllabus, vacated on other grounds in Lytle v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 910, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1978).\n\n¶34 In the case at bar, there was overwhelming evidence, as set forth above, of Appellant’s guilt. The two victims testified in detail how Appellant raped them when they were little girls, both recounted multiple specific instances and identified Appellant as their abuser. Accordingly, we find any error in admitting the testimony did not have an impact on the verdict, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and the other evidence in the case established Appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n¶35 Appellant argues the prosecutor is arguing Appellant is acting in conformity with a character trait when the prosecutor remarked Appellant is attracted to young girls and is motivated to have sexual relations with them.\nAs Appellant did not object to the remarks during closing arguments, he has waived all but plain error. An error not raised in the trial court must be plain error for an appellate court to reverse. *State v. Long*, 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978) at paragraph one of the syllabus; Crim.R. 52(B). To prevail under a plain error analysis, Appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that the outcome of the trial clearly would have been different but for the error. *Id.* at paragraph two of the syllabus. Notice of plain error “is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” *Id.* at paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n“A presumption always exists that the jury has followed the instructions given to it by the trial court.” *Pang v. Minch*, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 187, 559 N.E.2d 1313 (1990), at paragraph four of the syllabus, *rehearing denied*, 54 Ohio St.3d 716, 562 N.E.2d 163.\n\nAs noted above, the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence could not be considered to show that Appellant had acted in conformity with a character trait. Appellant has not demonstrated that “but for” this isolated statement by the prosecutor, he would not have been convicted of the crimes.\n\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of prior acts of child molestation.\n¶40 Appellant’s sole Assignment of Error is overruled.\n\n¶41 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, Delaware County, Ohio, is hereby affirmed.\n\nBy: Wise, John, J.\n\nBaldwin, P. J., concurs.\n\nWise, Earle, J., concurs separately\n\nJWW/br 0322\nWise, Earle, J., concurs separately.\n\n¶ 42 I concur in the judgment of the majority.\n\n¶ 43 While I find error, I find it to be harmless and specifically concur with paragraphs 33 and 34 of the majority opinion.\n\n¶ 44 I write separately because I find the other-acts evidence should not have been admitted.\n\n¶ 45 The trial court’s December 19, 2019, judgment entry allowed the other-acts evidence because it found the evidence fit several of the exceptions in Evid.R. 404(B) and R.C. 2945.59.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n¶ 46 The Supreme Court of Ohio recently reviewed the admission of other-acts evidence in two cases decided on September 22, 2020; State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.2d 651, and State v. Smith, --- Ohio St.3d ---, 2020-Ohio-4441, --- N.E.2d ---. In Hartman at ¶ 19, the court sought to “clear up some of the confusion that exists regarding the use of other-acts evidence.” One issue it made clear was that “the admissibility of other-acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) is a question of law.” Id. at ¶ 22. The question of “whether the evidence is offered for an impermissible purpose does not involve the exercise of discretion” and is subject to review de novo. Id. If a permissible nonpropensity purpose is found, the trial court then has discretion to admit other-acts evidence. Id.\nPURPOSES FOR WHICH OTHER-ACTS EVIDENCE WERE ADMITTED\n\n¶ 47 The trial court considered whether the evidence supported permissible purposes pursuant to R.C. 2945.59 and Evid.R. 404(B) and found several exceptions. In its judgment entry at page 7, the trial court found:\n\nThe factual overlap between the prospective testimonies [of the witnesses] may point to a motive and intent: engaging in the sexual abuse of minors for sexual gratification. Detailed other-acts testimony here may help the jury identify [appellant] by a common scheme, plan, system, or modus operandi – a “behavioral fingerprint” – aimed at the targeting, grooming, and raping of children. The testimony about prior acts of child sex abuse may cast significant doubt, too, on the possibility that any of the alleged conduct in the present matter was accidental. (Citation omitted, emphasis added.)\n\n¶ 48 The trial court further defined the purposes of the other-acts evidence in the instructions it gave to the jury prior to deliberation (T. at 955-956):\n\nIf you find that the evidence about other acts on the part of the Defendant is true, then you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether that evidence proves: one, the absence of a mistake or an accident on his part on the dates of the crimes at issue in this case; two, his motive or his intent on the dates of the crimes at issue in this case; three, his\nknowledge of the circumstances surrounding the crimes at issue in this case; or, four, his use of a particular method of selecting, grooming, and sexually abusing minor victims. The evidence about other acts may not be considered by you for any other purpose. (Emphasis added.)\n\nANALYSIS OF OTHER-ACTS EVIDENCE\n\n¶ 49 The four nonpropensity reasons for admission of the evidence given by the trial court to the jury will be discussed out of order.\n\n1. ABSENCE OF A MISTAKE OR AN ACCIDENT\n\n¶ 50 The trial court first instructed the jury the other-acts evidence may be used to show appellant’s actions were not a mistake nor accidental. Appellant plead not guilty making a general denial of all allegations. He did not testify, nor did the police testify as to statements made by appellant. The record does not reflect any indication he ever claimed mistake or accident. Additionally, the state made no argument that appellant raised a defense claiming the acts were accidental.\n\n¶ 51 In Smith, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed lack of mistake evidence. In Smith, the defendant was charged in 2016 with rape, gross sexual imposition and disseminating matter harmful to a juvenile. The victim was his granddaughter. The allegations were he rubbed oil on her body under her clothes on her chest, buttock and vagina then licked her breast and vagina. He played a pornographic film showing oral and vaginal intercourse. The next morning he pressed his penis into her backside and began to remove her underwear; she moved away and he stop. He denied any of this was for sexual purposes. He admitted that he rubbed lotion on the child’s body, but any\ninappropriate touching of private parts was accidental. He claimed that if his penis did touch her it was accidental because he tends to get erections in his sleep. He further claimed an R-rated movie accidentally began to play for a few seconds when he attempted to play a cartoon on a DVD. The state sought to admit other-acts evidence from a 1986 allegation that he did similar things to one of his daughters. The Smith court held the prior testimony was admissible to rebut the defendant’s claim that his 2016 acts were accidental, inadvertent or a mistake.\n\n¶ 52 In the instant case there is no such claim by appellant. In Hartman, supra, the Supreme Court of Ohio at ¶ 27 stated, “it is not enough to say the evidence is relevant to a nonpropensity purpose. The nonpropensity purpose for which the evidence is offered must go to a ‘material’ issue that is actually in dispute....”\n\n¶ 53 Because there is no claim of mistake or accident before the jury, there is nothing for the prosecution to rebut on this issue. I find the evidence may not be admitted for a legitimate purpose under this exception to the rule.\n\n3. KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE CRIMES\n\n¶ 54 This purpose was not addressed in the trial court’s judgment entry. It is unclear from the record exactly what nonpropensity purpose, “his knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the crimes,” refers to in this case. Typically, this type of other-acts evidence is admitted to show a defendant’s awareness, such as knowledge that he possessed contraband or his awareness of illegal activity. I find under the facts of this case, this is not a permissible purpose to admit other-acts evidence.\n\nPURPOSES 2. AND 4.\n¶ 55 The next two purposes are the focus of the case as highlighted by the prosecutors’ statements to the jury.\n\n¶ 56 In closing argument, the state told the jury: “So for our purposes, we’re asking that you consider this evidence of other acts on the issues of motive and method. Specifically, his motive and his intent to engage in sexual conduct with minor girls and his method of selecting, grooming, and sexually abusing these minor girls.” T. at 908. Later in rebuttal, the state again argued to the jury how it should use this evidence. “So yes, of course you can consider [L.C.’s] testimony for those purposes that we discussed in our first closing which was to show method and to show motivation that Ron Williams is attracted to underage girls.” T. at 944.\n\n4. USE OF A PARTICULAR METHOD OF SELECTING, GROOMING, AND SEXUALLY ABUSING MINOR VICTIMS\n\n¶ 57 The state sought to use the other-acts evidence to show appellant used a particular method of selecting, grooming and abusing his victims. In its judgment entry, the trial court found the other-acts evidence may be helpful to the jury to identify appellant by this common scheme or plan, modus operandi or behavioral fingerprint.\n\n¶ 58 This type of other acts evidence is a permissible purpose if the identity of the actor is an issue in actual dispute. “[Modus operandi] is evidence of signature, fingerprint-like characteristics unique enough ‘to show that the crimes were committed by the same person.’ Evidence of modus operandi is relevant to prove identity.” Hartman, supra, at ¶ 37. (Citations omitted.)\n\n¶ 59 In the instant case there is no question as to who may have done the acts. Both victims were clear the actor was appellant. The only question before the jury was whether the acts occurred. I find the other-acts evidence to prove identity by showing\nmodus operandi or a behavioral fingerprint is not permissible because identity is not in dispute.\n\n¶ 60 In State v. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 330 N.E.2d 720 (1975), the Supreme Court of Ohio discussed the two factual situations where the defendant’s scheme, plan or system pursuant to R.C. 2945.59 is relevant. One is identity, which as discussed above is not at issue here. The other, as cited in Curry at 73 is when:\n\n[T]he “other acts” form part of the immediate background of the alleged act which forms the foundation of the crime charged in the indictment.\n\n***\n\nTo be admissible pursuant to this sub-category of ‘scheme, plan or system’ evidence, the ‘other acts’ testimony must concern events which are inextricably related to the alleged criminal act. The July 8, 1972, incident and the December 22, 1972, incident are not so related; they are chronologically and factually separate occurrences.\n\n¶ 61 The Hartman court at ¶ 13 cited Curry to re-emphasize the connection of the other-acts evidence to the current crime:\n\nCommon-plan evidence generally concerns events that are “inextricably related’ to the crime charged. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d at 73. The other acts form the “immediate background” of the present crime: they are typically either part of the “same transaction” as the crime for which the defendant is\non trial or they are part of “a sequence of events” leading up to the commission of the crime in question.\n\n¶ 62 In Curry there was a five to six-month gap between the charged acts and the other-acts. In our current case there is a at least a seventeen-year gap between the “chronological and factually separate” other-acts and the current charges. I find the other-acts evidence is not admissible pursuant to a common scheme, plan or system exception.\n\n2. MOTIVE OR INTENT\n\n¶ 63 Motive and intent can be distinct issues. In Hartman at ¶ 48, motive is described as a specific reason for committing a crime. If a person commits a murder to cover up a previous crime, the other-acts evidence of the previous crime may tend to prove the motive for the murder, a permissible nonpropensity purpose. Id. Motive is not typically an element of a criminal offense. Intent is normally an element. Did a person act with the purpose to cause a certain result which culminated in a criminal offense? In the murder example, the motive may be to want a person dead; the intent is the mental purpose to do the act to cause the death (to pull the trigger of a gun). In this case, the trial court and the arguments of the prosecutor appear to treat the terms as one. The evidence was admitted to show appellant’s intent was to derive sexual gratification from the acts alleged in the charge of gross sexual imposition.\n\n¶ 64 Generally, intent is “not a material issue for other-acts purposes unless it is genuinely disputed – in most cases, ‘the act speaks for itself.’ ” Hartman at ¶ 55. However, when the crime charged is one of specific intent, such intent is a material issue in the case. Id. The crime of gross sexual imposition requires the state prove appellant had the\nspecific intent to perform the act(s) for the sexual gratification of himself or another. This is a potential proper purpose for other-acts evidence to be considered. However, based upon the facts of this case, a more thorough examination of the purpose is warranted.\n\n¶ 65 The decision on whether to allow other-acts evidence on the single count of gross sexual imposition should not be considered in a vacuum. Appellant faced sixteen counts of rape as well. The testimony relating to these counts was replete with explicit accounts of sexual conduct that left no question as to appellant’s intent. A single jury heard all of the testimony from both victims. There is certainly an argument, in light of the extensive testimony in the rape counts, that the element of sexual gratification in gross sexual imposition is not in actual dispute.\n\n¶ 66 Assuming arguendo, the permissible purpose to show intent by way of the other-acts evidence is justified, in my view the Evid.R. 403 balancing test is still a bar to this evidence. The Hartman court at ¶ 32 advised courts to, “consider whether the prosecution is able to present alternative evidence to prove the same fact through less prejudicial means…” In this case, the attendant sixteen counts of rape provided the jury with extensive and overwhelming evidence to find intent. This other-acts evidence is certainly probative of intent. However, it does not show anything about appellant’s intent not already shown by the extensive testimony in the current charges. I find the probative value of the other-acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Therefore, I would prohibit the admission of the other-acts evidence based upon the Evid.R. 403 balancing test.\n¶ 67 However, as indicated above, I find the error to admit the other-acts evidence to be harmless, and I join in the judgment of the majority in affirming the conviction of appellant."}
{"index": "077-Breneman", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "The trial court erred in failing to grant him a new trial due to the prosecutor’s informing the jury of Breneman’s three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions during opening statements.", "extracted_text": "¶ 34 On August 8, 2019, prior to trial, the parties filed three written stipulations signed by the prosecutor and defense counsel. The first concerned the title for the 1995 Toyota Corolla at issue, the second concerned Breneman’s criminal history, and the third concerned the prescription medication prescribed for Breneman’s mother. In the criminal history stipulation, the parties agreed and stipulated that Breneman was previously convicted of or plead guilty to the following felony drug abuse offenses:\n\n1. Possession of Heroin in violation of section 2925.11 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on July 21, 2014 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2014 CR 121.\n\n2. Possession of Cocaine in violation of section 2925.11 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on July 21, 2011 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2010 CR 103.\n\n3. Trafficking in Cocaine in violation of section 2925.03 of the Ohio Revised Code. This conviction took place on April 30, 2002 in Champaign County, Ohio Common Pleas Court, in case number 2002 CR 004.\n\n¶ 35 Trial began on August 12. That morning, before jury selection, the\n\n¹ Breneman’s sentencing occurred the day after the trial ended, and the trial court filed its written judgment entry of conviction on the same day. Breneman’s counsel filed a written motion for a new trial after the trial court filed its judgment entry of conviction. The court ruled on that motion after Breneman filed his notice of appeal of his conviction. The court’s decision denying the motion for a new trial is not before us. However, Breneman repeatedly claimed at trial and sentencing that he was denied a fair trial due to the prosecutor’s opening statement. We will construe his assignment of error as claiming that the prosecutor’s alleged misconduct violated his due process rights and that the court should have ordered a new trial.\nprosecutor and defense counsel gave opening statements to the prospective jurors. During the State’s opening statement, the prosecutor told the jury that Breneman was released from prison on September 17, 2018, and that he committed the offense of escape by failing to report to his parole officer and moving without notifying his parole officer. The prosecutor further indicated that the parole officers nevertheless “were learning that he [Breneman] was getting into some trouble.” (Tr. at 21.) The prosecutor continued:\n\nThey heard of how the Defendant, who was previously convicted of felony drug abuse offenses of trafficking in cocaine in 2002, possession of cocaine in 2010, and possession of heroin in 2014 – They learned how this Defendant had stolen his mother’s prescription pain medication. * * *\n\nThe parole officers also learned about how this Defendant took possession of a 1995 Toyota Corolla that didn’t belong to him, and he sold the car without the permission of the owner. * * *\n\n(Tr. at 21-22.)\n\n¶ 36 After the prosecutor completed his opening statement, the court, sua sponte, gave the jury the following instruction:\n\nLadies and gentleman, from the prosecutor’s opening statement, we’ve learned that evidence may be received that the Defendant has been previously convicted of certain criminal offenses.\n\nThe Court is instructing you that that evidence may be received because a prior conviction is an element of the offense of theft of drugs in Count One.\nThat evidence was not received and you may not consider it to prove\nthe character of the Defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity\nor in accordance with that character.\n\n(Tr. at 23-24.)\n\n¶ 37 At this juncture, defense counsel asked for a sidebar discussion. Counsel\nstated that he wanted to “strenuously object to the opening statement in that it included\noffenses of prior history that were not part of the post-release control,” that is, Breneman\nwas not on post-release control for those offenses. Defense counsel asked for a mistrial.\n\n¶ 38 The trial court then asked defense counsel if he agreed that the three\nreferenced drug charges were predicate offenses for the theft of drug allegation.\nDefense counsel responded that he did. The court indicated that “[t]hat was the purpose\nfor the Court’s instruction to the jury.” The court denied the motion for a mistrial. It\nreasoned that, although the court “had a concern with the way the prosecution had\npositioned those offenses,” the opening statement was not evidence and the concern was\ncured through the jury instruction.\n\n¶ 39 After the jury was selected, but prior to the presentation of testimony, the\ntrial court, sua sponte, admirably raised with the parties that it had concerns about the\ncriminal history stipulation. The court referred the parties to two cases: State v. Totarella,\n11th Dist. Lake No. 2002-L-147, 2004-Ohio-1175, and State v. Overton, 2017-Ohio-8389,\n99 N.E.3d 1007 (5th Dist.). Discussing Totarella, the court expressed concern that it\nwould be prejudicial for the jury to learn that Breneman had three convictions and the\ndetails of those convictions if Breneman were acknowledging, by stipulation, that he had\na prior drug abuse conviction. The trial court told counsel that Overton addressed undue\nprejudice caused by evidence of a defendant’s prior convictions.\n\n¶ 40 After having an opportunity to read the two cases, the prosecutor argued that they were distinguishable, because in both cases defense counsel had sought to exclude evidence of the prior convictions and the trial court had denied those requests. The prosecutor argued that, in contrast, the trial court here was raising the issue sua sponte. Specifically, the prosecutor noted that the trial court had denied a motion in limine in Totarella; the appellate court found that to be error, but overruled the defendant’s assignment of error because the defendant had failed to preserve the error at trial. In Overton, the trial court overruled an oral motion to stipulate to a prior conviction, and the appellate court determined that the court should have allowed the stipulation. The prosecutor stated that the stipulation at issue stated that Breneman was agreeing that he previously was convicted of a felony drug abuse offense.\n\n¶ 41 Defense counsel indicated that he had been unaware of the Totarella case, and that the defense now wished only to stipulate that Breneman was previously convicted of or pled guilty to a felony drug abuse offense. The prosecutor responded that, given the case law and defense counsel’s request, the State would be required to agree to the request. The court indicated that the parties would need to file an amended stipulation. (The new stipulation regarding Breneman’s criminal history was filed on August 12, 2019.)\n\n¶ 42 The court then addressed the fact that the jury had been told of Breneman’s prior offenses during opening statements. The court concluded that the error in informing the jury of the three convictions was harmless. Breneman told the court that he did not believe he could get a fair trial due to the prosecutor’s opening statement. The\nprosecutor responded that he did not intentionally engage in any improper conduct and only told the jury of the three offenses mentioned in the stipulation; he did not mention the rest of Breneman’s “very extensive” criminal history or that Breneman was on post-release control for a burglary offense.\n\n¶ 43 None of the State’s witnesses discussed Breneman’s criminal history, although there was testimony that Breneman was released from prison and placed on post-release control. After the State’s final witness, the court read the stipulations regarding Breneman’s criminal history and the motor vehicle title. The stipulation regarding Breneman’s criminal history read, in its entirety: “The State of Ohio and the Defendant do hereby agree to stipulate that the Defendant, Virgil Royale Lee Breneman, was previously convicted of or pled guilty to a felony drug abuse offense.”\n\n¶ 44 During closing argument, the prosecutor stated that, as part of the theft of drug offense, the State had to prove that Breneman had a prior conviction of a felony drug abuse offense. The prosecutor told that jury that the parties had stipulated to that. The prosecutor did not mention Breneman’s specific criminal history.\n\n¶ 45 The court subsequently provided instructions to the jury. It told the jury that opening statements and closing statements were not evidence and were designed to assist the jury in evaluating the evidence. In a section entitled “Use of Prior Conviction – Enhancing the Degree of Offense,” the court stated:\n\nEvidence was received that the Defendant has been convicted of a felony drug abuse offense. That evidence was received because a prior conviction is an element of the offense charged. It was not received, and you may not consider it, to prove the character of the Defendant in order to\nshow that he acted in conformity with the character.\n\n¶ 46 On appeal, Breneman claims that the trial court should have ordered a new trial due to the prosecutor’s prejudicial opening statement. He claims that the prosecutor’s reference to his three prior convictions precluded him from receiving a fair trial. The State counters that Breneman’s argument is barred by the invited error doctrine, and that Breneman did not timely object to the prosecutor’s mentioning of the three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions. We conclude that Breneman invited the prosecutor’s reference to the three prior drug offenses in his opening statement. Moreover, with the unique record before us, we further conclude that Breneman was not prejudiced by the prosecutor’s isolated reference to Breneman’s three specific prior convictions, and no new trial was warranted.\n\n¶ 47 The indictment for Count 1, alleging theft of drugs as a felony of the third degree, include allegations that Breneman was previously convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony drug abuse offense, and it listed the 2014 conviction for possession of heroin, the 2011 conviction for possession of cocaine, and the 2002 conviction for trafficking in cocaine. The parties’ pretrial stipulation agreed that Breneman had been convicted of those three offenses. The prosecutor’s opening statement conformed to the parties’ stipulation; it did not add any details about those offenses or mention any other prior offenses.\n\n¶ 48 Under the doctrine of invited error, “[a] party will not be permitted to take advantage of an error [that] he himself invited or induced.” (Citations omitted.) State v. Fair, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24388, 2011-Ohio-4454, ¶ 69. Defense counsel agreed to a stipulation, prior to trial, that Breneman had been convicted of the three drug offenses\nreferenced in Count I of the indictment. The prosecutor cannot be faulted for relying on that stipulation in his opening statement, and Breneman cannot now complain about the prosecutor’s informing the jury of those convictions in the State’s opening statement.\n\n¶ 49 Moreover, under the facts of this case, any prejudice that resulted from the prosecutor’s single reference to Breneman’s three specific prior convictions was diminished by court’s jury instructions and the nature of the charges at trial. First, the jury was told, immediately after the prosecutor’s opening statement, that evidence of Breneman’s prior convictions was permitted because a prior conviction was an element of the offense of theft of drugs in Count One, but “[t]hat evidence was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the Defendant in order to show that he acted in conformity or in accordance with that character.” The court repeated that instruction at the conclusion of the trial. The court also twice instructed the jury that opening statements were not evidence. We presume that the jury followed the trial court’s instructions. State v. Keeton, 2d Dist. Darke No. 2019-CA-8, 2020-Ohio-950, ¶ 24, citing State v. Jones, 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 414, 739 N.E.2d 300 (2000) (“We presume that juries follow the instructions provided to them.”).\n\n¶ 50 Second, as part of the trial, the jury properly heard that Breneman had a prior felony drug abuse offense conviction and that he had previously served a prison sentence, for which he was on post-release control. The parties stipulated that Breneman had a prior felony drug abuse offense, and that stipulation was read to the jury. Although the prosecutor’s opening statement provided the specific offense, date and case number for three prior felony drug abuse offense convictions, the prosecutor did not inform the jury of the factual circumstances underlying those offenses or discuss any\nother aspect of Breneman’s criminal history.\n\n¶ 51 Upon review of the trial transcript, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor’s opening statement prejudicially affected Breneman’s substantial rights, resulting in an unfair trial. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant Breneman a new trial.\n\n¶ 52 Breneman’s first assignment of error is overruled."}

It was only for a few moments, and he looked up and his eyes opened and his head came up. But his eyes were closed for a few moments, and I felt that I needed to bring it to the Court’s attention.’ (Tr. at 388.)\nThe court responded that it ‘had taken a look at Juror No. 10 as well, and I never thought he was ‘sleeping.’ Some jurors will tend to listen to evidence without taking notes as if they’re listening to music. But I will seek to keep a closer eye as well.’ (Id. at 388-389.) The court asked the prosecutor if he wanted the court to take any action. The prosecutor responded, ‘No. I just wanted to bring it to your attention.’ (Id. at 389.)

The first argument is that the trial court erred by sustaining the State’s objection to the defense expert, Kapelsohn, testifying regarding a soft wood experiment conducted prior to trial.\n\nWhile testifying on redirect examination regarding the issue of whether pressing the Beretta against Carol’s forehead so as to put the weapon out of battery would have left a mark, Kapelsohn was asked if he had had “an opportunity to test this weapon about whether or not it would leave a mark on let’s say a piece of soft wood?” Kapelsohn answered that he did and began to explain the experiment when the State objected. The trial court sustained the objection having determined that, while Kapelsohn’s expert report contained his opinion that pushing the Beretta against a person’s forehead would leave a mark, the report did not disclose an experiment with a piece of wood which, apparently, was conducted after his report was turned over to the State.\n\nUnder the Rules of Criminal Procedure, “[t]he defendant shall provide copies or photographs, or permit the prosecuting attorney to copy or photograph, * * * [the] [r]esults of * * * experiments or scientific tests.” Crim.R. 16(H)(2).\n\n“If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.” Crim.R. 16(L)(1). This Rule “vests in the trial court the discretion to determine the appropriate response for failure of a party to disclose material subject to a valid discovery request,” and “[r]eversible error exists only where the exercise of such authority by the trial court constitutes an abuse of discretion.” State v. Wiles, 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 78, 571 N.E.2d 97 (1991); State v. Darmond, 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, 986 N.E.2d 971, ¶ 20.\n\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s decision to prevent the defense expert from testifying regarding the soft wood experiment. Burry offered no explanation for the failure to disclose to the State that the experiment had been conducted. The issue of whether pushing a pistol against a person’s forehead or stomach so as to put it out of battery would leave a mark was disputed at trial. The probative value of conducting an experiment with soft wood as a substitute for the human body is not immediately apparent. To allow Kapelsohn to testify regarding the results of such an experiment on redirect, when the State was unaware of either the methodology or the results of the experiment would have been unfair to the prosecution.\nThe case of *State v. Branham*, 104 Ohio App.3d 355, 662 N.E.2d 54 (12th Dist.1995), is comparable. In *Branham*, defense counsel had identified an expert witness in the pretrial discovery statement but did not disclose the details of an experiment “involving the shooting of arrows into a pig skull stuffed with styrofoam.” *Id.* at 361. “Therefore, the trial court confined the expert’s testimony to his expertise as developed through his experience and precluded testimony based upon the pig skull experiment.” *Id.* The court of appeals affirmed, observing that “[t]he trial court excluded only that expert testimony concerning the pig skull experiment,” while “[a]ll other testimony by the expert was permitted.” *Id.* at 362. “Under the circumstances, the sanction imposed by the trial court is entirely consistent with the Criminal Rules and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.” *Id.* Similarly in the present case, the trial court excluded only Kapelsohn’s testimony regarding an experiment which had not been included in his expert report."}

{"index": "078-Burry", "allegation_num": "allegation_3", "allegation": "The trial court erred to the prejudice of the defendant-appellant when it returned a verdict of guilty against the manifest weight of the evidence.", "extracted_text": "Burry raises issues with Carol’s credibility, noting that she did not believe that the pistol was loaded at the time of the incident, did not claim that she had been held down in her initial statements to the police, and changed her account of events as to whether Burry held the magazine in his other hand and the number of clicks she heard when he pulled the trigger. Burry impugns Carol’s credibility by noting that, after he allegedly threatened her life and the lives of her dogs, she remained on the couch watching television. We find Carol’s testimony to be credible, if not wholly consistent. It is evident that immediately after the assault she was confused as to what had happened. She had no reason for believing that the gun was unloaded other than the fact that it did not fire. She also struggled with the fact that Burry had never been violent with her before. The salient aspects of Carol's testimony are corroborated by other evidence. Kyle, who never doubted the Beretta was loaded, confirmed that Burry held Carol down while pointing the gun at her. Burry suggests that Kyle has also changed his testimony to conform to the State's theory of the crime. But there is no inconsistency between Carol's and Kyle's testimony that she was held down and their initial statements to the police. That Burry held Carol down is merely an additional detail that is consonant with the fact that Carol was sitting down on a couch when Burry put the gun to her head and stomach. He would have to have been standing over her or be physically on top of her to do this. It is likewise significant that Carol was able to immediately locate the Beretta's magazine between the couch and ottoman, although she was unaware of the pistol's location in Burry's dresser drawer. Burry emphasizes his expert witness' testimony that the possibility of the Beretta being out of battery twice within seconds of the trigger being pulled is extremely unlikely and that it is more probable that it was not loaded when Burry fired. Burry's theory of events, however, is not without its incredible elements. It presupposes Burry loading the Beretta after he had fired twice at Carol for reasons unknown, chambering a round, dropping the magazine in the living room, and then moving to his bedroom where he discharged the weapon. Under this theory, there is no obvious logic or reason behind Burry's actions. It fails to account for Carol's knowledge of the magazine's location (unless we assume she remained on the couch while Burry actually loaded the weapon and then waited for him to change his mind and discard the magazine). And it is inconsistent with Burry’s own explanation of events from Sergeant Hirz’ and Officer Subkowich’s body cams. Both parties’ experts essentially agreed that the Beretta would not discharge if it was more than an eighth of an inch out of battery and that it could be put out of battery by pressing it against a person’s body. The likelihood of the weapon being put out of battery by pressing against a person’s forehead and stomach is especially for the jury to decide inasmuch as the jury was able to physically handle and manipulate the weapon in addition to witnessing the experts doing so."}

Burry maintains that he showed genuine remorse as evidenced by his apology to Carol and Kyle at sentencing:\n\nCarol, I’ve been waiting ten months to tell you how truly sorry I am for any pain or suffering I put you through that night. I constantly thank God that no one was hurt and killed. There is not a moment that I don’t think about that night. It haunts me constantly. I hope someday you and Kyle and Todd can find it in your heart to forgive me.\n\nThe sentencing court did not find Burry’s remorse genuine, or at least a mitigating factor, in light of Burry’s claim to not remember pointing the gun at Carol:\n\nI did pick up on the fact that you remember certain aspects [of the night’s events] in the presentence report as you related them to the probation officer and/or in writing and then indicate that you didn’t\nremember most things because you blacked out. So I don’t know which way it is. To me it’s of no significance, the likelihood is you’re at some point trying to minimize what happened **.5\n\nBurry further cites as mitigating factors the fact that he worked for thirty-five years and led a law-abiding life; the stress of the impending divorce; his age (sixty-three at the time of sentencing); and his anxiety and depression. The sentencing court noted that Burry ‘charged Sergeant Hirz’ but Burry claims that, ‘on the bodycam, it appears that he was requesting a ‘suicide by cop’ by standing up and telling the officers to shoot him.\n\n{¶81} With respect to Burry’s remorse, it has been the position of this court to ‘defer to the trial court as to whether a defendant’s remarks are indicative of genuine remorse because it is in the best position to make that determination.’ (Citation omitted.)

The court\nemphasized the psychological harm/‘torment’ suffered by Carol and Burry’s responsibility for causing the situation that evening (‘you knew that taking that medication and mixing it with not only alcohol but a lot of alcohol *** was a combination that wasn’t going to result in anything good’). The court recognized Burry’s lack of a criminal record and several letters of support received from friends and family but concluded, ultimately, ‘I don’t know how you get beyond the fact that other than that gun not going off because of the slide because it was out of battery [Carol] wouldn’t be here and you’d be in a whole different stretch of years that I would be considering right now.’\n\n{¶83} In light of the foregoing we cannot conclude that the record does not clearly and convincingly support the sentence imposed."}

Accordingly, we must vacate the consecutive nature of Bolware’s sentences and remand the cause for the trial court to consider whether consecutive sentences are appropriate under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) and, if so, to make the required findings on the record and incorporate those findings in the sentencing journal entry. We sustain Bolware’s fifth assignment of error."}

The male, who was later identified as Appellant, was the sole individual in the vehicle. (*Id.). As Kunkleman exited his vehicle, Appellant exited the vehicle in which he was sitting. (Id. at 67).

Shelby No. 17-08-06, 2008-Ohio-4784, ¶ 4 quoting State v. Jackson, 169 Ohio App.3d 440, 2006-Ohio-6059, 863 N.E.2d 223, ¶14 (citations omitted). However, in sitting as the thirteenth juror the appellate court should give due deference to the findings made by the jury. Id.\nAnalysis\n\n{¶63} The Eighth District Court of Appeals identified the following eight factors as a guide to assist a reviewing court in determining whether a decision of the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence:\n\n1. A reviewing court is not required to accept the incredible as true;\n2. Whether the evidence is uncontradicted;\n3. Whether a witness was impeached;\n4. What was not proved;\n5. Certainty of evidence;\n6. Reliability of evidence;\n7. Whether witness’ testimony is self-serving;\n8. And whether evidence is vague, uncertain, conflicting, or fragmentary.\n\nState v. Mattison, 23 Ohio App.3d 10, 14, 490 N.E.2d 926 (8th Dist.1985). We discuss the relevant factors to each underlying case below.\n\nUncontradicted Evidence\n\n{¶64} Initially, we note that Appellant failed to introduce any evidence that contradicted the State’s evidence at trial. In respect to case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant produced no evidence to contradict the State’s testimony that on March 21, 2014 at approximately 3:00 a.m., the Lima Police Department was dispatched to 234 North Main Street in Lima, Ohio for a call of a suspicious vehicle sitting in\nthe parking lot. It is not disputed that the Appellant exited his vehicle when officers arrived, and when Kunkleman approached him, Appellant turned back and leaned into the car on the driver’s side. It is further undisputed that officers could smell the smell of raw marijuana at this time and that officers grabbed Appellant and pulled him away from the vehicle for their safety.\n\n{¶65} There is no dispute that the Appellant, when ordered to put his hands up in the air, disregarded the officer’s commands, which led to him being detained. A pat down of Appellant produced a large sum of money and marijuana, which led to his arrest and the subsequent search of the vehicle, which produced a large amount of cocaine, marijuana, heroin, digital scales, and Appellant’s billfold. With no testimony or evidence produced at trial to cast doubt upon this version of events, Appellant cannot contradict the elements of possession of cocaine and possession of heroin as established by the State in case number CR 2014 0118.\n\n{¶66} In regards to case number CR 2015 0361, the State’s uncontradicted evidence demonstrated that on January 17, 2015, after receiving an anonymous tip and surveilling the premises, law enforcement entered 1222 Catalpa Street after repeatedly requesting that Appellant come to the front door. Once inside the premises, and while conducting a protective sweep of the home, officers viewed a marijuana grow tent in plain view. Based on the information collected, officers obtained a search warrant and searched the premises in its entirety. During the\nsearch, officers located credit cards, mail, and other personal effects bearing Appellant’s name.\n\n{¶67} While Appellant contends that no witness had personal knowledge that he occupied the premises, the evidence indicates otherwise. Specifically, many of Appellant’s personal effects were found within the residence, which is indicative of occupation. Accordingly, we find that the uncontradicted evidence supports that Appellant was occupying the residence on January 17, 2015.\n\nImpeached Witness\n\n{¶68} A review of the record reveals that no witness for the State was impeached in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361.\n\nReliability of Evidence\n\n{¶69} With respect to case number CR 2015 0361, Appellant attempts to discredit the reliability of the testimony and evidence produced at trial, because ‘not one single witness [***] actually had personal knowledge of Appellant allegedly occupying the premises testified [to] at trial.’ (Br. of Appellant at 10). Appellant further classifies all of the testimony produced regarding occupation of the premises as ‘hearsay.’\n\n{¶70} However, we find that the State produced competent and credible evidence that Appellant was occupying 1222 Catalpa Street in Lima, Ohio at the time the officers conducted their raid. Specifically, officers testified that they\nobserved Appellant leave the back of the duplex in an attempt to flee, and then run back inside once he saw that officers had the duplex surrounded. Furthermore, the evidence established that officers personally observed Appellant leave out of the back of the residence prior to it being breached. With eyewitness testimony confirming that Appellant was, in fact, inside the residence, we find no merit in Appellant’s argument in regards to reliability.\n\n**Self-Serving Testimony**\n\n{¶71} The record reveals that the trial court did not characterize any witness’s testimony as self-serving in either case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, on review, we do not find any indicia of self-serving testimony in either case and Appellant does not argue that testimony was self-serving on appeal.\n\n**Vague, Uncertain, Conflicting, or Fragmentary Evidence**\n\n{¶72} In case number CR 2014 0118, Appellant points to the evidence produced at the suppression hearing to cast into doubt officers’ testimony at trial. Specifically, Appellant argues that the officers, when testifying at the suppression hearing, described a ‘much more leisurely encounter at the suppression hearing than they did at trial.’ (Br. of Appellant at 10). However, Appellant fails to develop this argument and further fails to demonstrate how this ‘conflict’ in testimonies between the suppression hearing and trial creates a manifest miscarriage of justice warranting\nreversal. Even should Appellant establish that a true ‘conflict’ exists in the evidence presented at the suppression hearing and the trial, and that such issue was properly before this Court, we find that the record contains competent, credible evidence to support the trial court’s findings. *Phelps v. Horn’s Crop Serv. Ctr.*, 3rd Dist. Wyandot No. 16-89-8, 1990 WL 157282, * 2 (holding that the choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact).\n\n{¶73} Accordingly, we find that the weight of the evidence supports Appellant’s convictions. We further find that the jury did not lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting Appellant of possession of cocaine and heroin in case number CR 2014 0118 or CR 2015 0361. Accordingly, we overrule Appellant’s second assignment of error."}

For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\n{¶75} ‘When a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel’s assistance, the defendant must show that the counsel’s representation fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.” State v. Sanders, 94 Ohio St.3d 150, 151, 2002-Ohio-350, 761 N.E.2d 18 quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). Additionally, “[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.” Id., at 694. See also, State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 137, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).\n\n{¶76} In analyzing a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, this court’s scrutiny of counsel’s performance must be highly deferential, with a ‘strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.’” Bradley, supra, at 142, quoting Strickland, supra, at 687-88. “Counsel’s performance will not be deemed ineffective unless and until counsel’s performance is proved to have fallen below an objective standard of reasonable representation and, in addition, prejudice arises from counsel’s performance.” Id.\n\nAnalysis\n\n{¶77} At the outset, we note that Appellant, during the course of the proceedings below, had five (5) different attorneys represent him. Interestingly, Appellant does not specify which trial counsel was ineffective. However, it appears from this assignment that Appellant questions the effectiveness of his trial counsel.\nAppellant initially argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because trial counsel failed to object to any of the hearsay regarding Appellant residing in the residence during the raid by police officers, as charged in case number CR 2015 0361. However, we note that the failure to make objections is not alone enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Conway*, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, ¶ 103. *See also, State v. Holloway*, 38 Ohio St.3d 239, 244, 527 N.E.2d 831 (1988) (failure to object to error, alone, is not enough to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel); *State v. Gumm*, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 428, 1995-Ohio-24, 653 N.E.2d 253 holding modified by *State v. Wogenstahl*, 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 1996-Ohio-219, 662 N.E.2d 311 (the failure to make objections does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel per se, as that failure may be justified as a tactical decision).\n\nNext, Appellant argues that his trial counsel’s performance was ineffective because trial counsel did not voir dire Sergeant Dana Sutherland (“Sutherland”), the State’s marijuana expert witness. This argument lacks merit for two reasons. First, the record reveals, and the Appellant concedes, that trial counsel objected to the expert being certified as an expert witness, and the trial court overruled the objection. (*See, Trial Tr., Vol. II, at 286*). And second, the record reveals that the Appellant’s concerns with Sutherland’s qualifications to testify as an expert were addressed by the trial court prior to trial. (*Trial, 08/01/2017 Tr., Vol.*\nI, at 11). Given the trial court’s rulings, we do not find that Appellant’s trial counsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation under the facts presented.\n\nLastly, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective because his trial counsel failed to file a proper motion to sever the counts at the appropriate time during trial. However, the record is clear, and the Appellant concedes, that objections to the State’s motions to consolidate were made and a motion to sever was filed prior to trial. (See, CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 139; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 48). Despite Appellant’s objections and motion, the trial court found that the charges were of similar character and part of a common scheme or course of criminal conduct, then consolidated the cases and joined them for purposes of trial. (CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 163; CR 2015 0361, Doc. No. 82). Thus, because the trial court had already ruled on Appellant’s motion to sever, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that a subsequent trial counsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness by failing to file an additional motion to sever, and we overrule Appellant’s third assignment of error in its entirety."}
{"index": "084-Davis", "allegation_num": "allegation_4", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING THE APPELLANTS [SIC] MOTION TO DISMISS THE CASE BASED UPON VIOLATION OF HIS RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL.", "extracted_text": "Appellant argues that the trial court erred by denying his motion to dismiss his cases based upon a speedy trial violation. Specifically, Appellant argues that the continuance granted at the request of the State beyond the February 21, 2017 trial date was unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n¶82 “Our standard of review upon an appeal raising a speedy trial issue is to count the expired days as directed by R.C. 2945.71, et seq.” State v. King, 3rd Dist. Marion No. 9-06-18, 2007-Ohio-335, ¶ 30. See also, State v. DePue, 96 Ohio App.3d 513, 516, 645 N.E.2d 745 (4th Dist.1994). “If any ambiguity exists, we construe the record in favor of the accused.” Id.\n\n¶83 The applicable statutory speedy trial provision, R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), provides that a person charged with a felony shall be brought to trial within two hundred and seventy (270) days after the person’s arrest. R.C. 2945.71(C)(2). In computing time under division (C)(2), “each day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charges shall be counted as three days.” R.C. 2945.71(E).\n\n¶84 Further, R.C. 2945.73(B) provides:\n\nUpon motion made at or prior to the commencement of trial, a person charged with an offense shall be discharged if he is not brought to trial within the time required by sections 2945.71 and 2945.72 of the Revised Code.\n\nR.C. 2945.73(B). “R.C. 2945.71 and R.C. 2945.73 are ‘mandatory and must be strictly complied with by the State.’” King at ¶ 32, quoting State v. Pudlock, 44 Ohio St.2d 104, 105, 338 N.E.2d 524 (1975). “However, R.C. 2945.72 allows for\nan extension of the time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances.” *Id.*\n\n**Analysis**\n\n{¶85} In the instant matter, both the State and Appellant agree that Appellant’s speedy trial rights were upheld throughout the proceedings up until Appellant’s scheduled jury trial on February 21, 2017. However, at the request of the State, Appellant’s trial was rescheduled for May 16, 2017, outside of the Appellant’s statutory speedy trial period. Thus, the question before us is not whether Appellant was brought to trial within the statutorily permitted time frame, but rather, was the speedy trial violation permissible under the circumstances of the case. We answer that question in the affirmative.\n\n{¶86} R.C. 2945.72, entitled “extension of time for hearing or trial,” allows for an extension of time that the accused must be brought to trial under certain circumstances. R.C. 2945.72(H) provides:\n\nThe time within which an accused must be brought to trial, or, in the case of felony, to preliminary hearing and trial, may be extended only by the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(H) The period of any continuance granted on the accused’s own motion, and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused’s own motion.\n\n(Emphasis added). R.C. 2945.72(H).\nThe resolution of this issue, therefore, depends upon whether the trial court’s continuance was reasonable. “Determining the ‘reasonableness’ of the continuance beyond the ninety-day stricture of R.C. 2945.71, invariably, ‘depends on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case.’” State v. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, ¶ 10, quoting State v. Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988). “‘In addition, precedent requires that such a continuance be necessary under the circumstances of the case.’” Id. quoting Saffell, 35 Ohio St.3d. 90, 91, 518 N.E.2d 934 (1988) citing City of Aurora v. Patrick, 61 Ohio St.2d 107, 108-09, 399 N.E.2d 1220 (1980).\n\nOn February 3, 2017, the State requested a continuance of the trial date, due to the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision in State v. Gonzales. See, State v. Gonzales, 150 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-Ohio-8319, 81 N.E.3d 405, reconsideration granted, decision vacated, 150 Ohio St.3d 276, 2017-Ohio-777, 81 N.E.3d 419, reconsideration denied, 149 Ohio St.3d 1409, 2017-Ohio-2822, 74 N.E.3d 466. In Gonzales, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the offense level for possession of cocaine was determined only by the weight of the actual cocaine, not by the total weight of cocaine plus any filler. Id. at ¶ 22. This opinion was inconsistent with prior case law on the same topic. Id. at ¶ 51. Given the new purity requirements, the State requested a continuance to send Appellant’s cocaine to a lab equipped to determine the weight of actual cocaine, separate from the filler weight.\nThe trial court, on February 9, 2017, granted the State’s request for a continuance and set Appellant’s jury trial for May 16, 2017. (Case number CR 2014 0118, Doc. No. 182; case number CR 2015, Doc. No. 109). In granting the continuance, the trial court acknowledged that State v. Gonzales was a significant departure from previous precedent and custom. Furthermore, the trial court relied on the Seventh District Court of Appeal’s decision in State v. High, wherein the Appellate court held that an extension request by the State for testing of evidence was reasonable. State v. High, 143 Ohio App.3d 232, 242, 2001-Ohio-3530, 757 N.E.2d 1176.\n\nWe find that the continuance was reasonable in light of the need for additional time to conduct testing (of the drugs in question) in accordance with Gonzales. While Appellant argues that the State took “too long” (after the Gonzales decision was announced) to request the continuance, we find that the State’s request was made prior to the already scheduled jury trial.\n\nAppellant further argues that the continuance was unreasonable because the trial court focused on its schedule in denying Appellant’s motion to dismiss. However, “scheduling and docketing conflicts have been held to be reasonable grounds for extending an accused’s trial date beyond the speedy trial limit date by both [the Appellate Court] and the Supreme Court of Ohio. Glass, 3rd Dist. Auglaize No. 2-04-01, 2004-Ohio-4402, ¶ 11. See also, State v. Lee, 48 Ohio\nSt.2d 208, 210, 357 N.E.2d 1095 (1976) (continuance due to “crowded docket & judge’s conference” was reasonable). Thus, we find that the continuance was reasonable, and therefore met the exception requirement listed in R.C. 2945.72(H).\n\n¶92 For the foregoing reasons, we find Appellant’s fourth assignment of error not well taken and overrule the same."}

In examining the purposes and policies behind joinder, courts have expressed that: ‘joinder and the avoidance of multiple trials are favored to conserve judicial resources, including time and expense, reduce the chance of incongruous results in successive trials before different juries, and diminish inconvenience to the witnesses.’ State v. Clifford, 135 Ohio App.3d 207, 211, 733 N.E.2d 621 (1999), cause dismissed, 87 Ohio St.3d 1422, 717 N.E.2d 1108 (1999). ‘To prevail on a claim that the trial court erred in consolidating charges for trial, the defendant must demonstrate affirmatively (1) that his rights were prejudiced, (2) that at the time that the trial court ruled on the motion to consolidate, he provided the court with sufficient information so that it could weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant’s right to a fair trial, and (3) that given the information provided to the court, it abused its discretion in consolidating the charges for trial.’ (Emphasis added). Id. In reviewing Appellant’s argument, we find that the Appellant failed to demonstrate affirmatively exactly how his rights were prejudiced by joinder. Even though Appellant argues that questions exist concerning his actual dominion and control over items of contraband, we find this argument addresses the sufficiency of the evidence, not whether Appellant was prejudiced by the joinder of the cases. Next, Appellant argues that the evidence in one case would not have been admissible in the other case. However, this is not the standard for joinder announced in Crim.R. 13 or Crim.R. 8(A). Lastly, Appellant argues that ‘it is undeniable that juries do not like fugitives.’ (See, Br. of Appellant at 18). Appellant then argues that this fact, standing alone, was sufficient to establish that the trial court abused its discretion by joining the two cases. However, Appellant provides us no support for such assertion. Thus, when reviewed in its entirety, Appellant’s argument fails to demonstrate affirmatively that his rights were prejudiced and thus, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the trial court erred in joining the two cases."}

Godfrey was further informed that a maintenance man for the Catalpa residence had attempted to inspect the residence but was denied entry by Appellant. (Id. at 8). Godfrey knew Appellant had active warrants for his arrest, so he set up a surveillance of 1222 Catalpa Street on January 13, 2015. (Id. at 8-9). On January 17, 2015, Godfrey observed a Chrysler 300 in the driveway with temporary tags. (Id. at 10). When the Chrysler 300 left the residence, Godfrey followed the vehicle. (Id. at 11). The Ohio State Highway Patrol, in conjunction with the West Central Ohio Crime Task force, conducted a traffic stop of the vehicle due to a window tint violation. (Id.). Kunkleman, who was assisting Godfrey with 1222 Catalpa Street surveillance, spoke with the individuals in the Chrysler 300 and learned that they were visiting their friend “Ray” at the Catalpa residence in question. (Id. at 12).\nThe passenger of the Chrysler identified “Ray” as Appellant, and informed officers that Appellant had been living at the address for about a month. (Id. at 12). Because of this information, Godfrey verified that Appellant had active warrants and then set up a perimeter around 1222 Catalpa Street to arrest Appellant. (Id.).\nAfter the residence was surrounded, Godfrey knocked on the front door and ordered Appellant to come out. (Id. at 13). Instead, Appellant exited the rear of the house, but quickly ran back to the residence after observing law enforcement officials surrounding the duplex. (Id.). Officers eventually gained entry into the house, and the Appellant was arrested without incident. (Id. at 15). After Appellant’s arrest, law enforcement officers conducted a protective sweep of the residence to make sure that there were no other individuals or threats within the house. (Id.). In conducting the protective sweep of the residence, law enforcement officials observed a black tent in one of the rooms. (Id.). Because the tent was large enough for someone to hide in, officers looked inside it, finding marijuana plants and a “grow operation” inside. (Id. at 15-16).\nBased on observing the marijuana grow tent in the residence, officers secured the residence and sought out a search warrant for the premises. (Id. at 17-18). The reviewing judge found probable cause and signed the affidavit/search warrant for the residence. (Id. at 39-40; State’s Ex. 1). Based on the search of the residence, law enforcement officials found guns, drugs, electronics, I.D.’s, and paperwork. (Id. at 41; State’s Ex. 1)."}

In Appellant’s brief in support of his motion, Appellant set forth the procedural history leading up to the mistrial. Appellant challenged the admission of texts extracted from a separate analysis of his IPhone, asserting that the texts were not admissible pursuant to Crim.R. 16. Crim.R. 16 (B)(1), discovery, generally provides that upon receipt of a written demand for discovery by the defendant, the prosecuting attorney shall provide copies or photographs of any written or recorded statement by the defendant which is material to the preparation of a defense, or is intended for use by the prosecuting attorney as evidence at the trial. In chambers, the State acknowledged that the texts from Appellant’s IPhone had not been provided because they had not been intended for use at trial, except for possible rebuttal. However, defense counsel’s opening statement indicated the defense strategy would be to shift blame to another person, Cory Forshey, as a person who had access and who may have used Appellant’s phone during the relevant time period. Furthermore, it was indicated Appellant might take the stand to testify in this manner. The texts at issue demonstrated a conversation between Appellant and his girlfriend at the relevant times, which would also strongly suggest that Appellant was in control of his cell phone at the same time a discussion regarding the purchase of heroin by Tyler Miller was taking place. Based upon the above discussion in chambers, the State indicated the texts at issue would now need to be utilized during the State’s case in chief. Defense counsel asserted that the admission of the text messages would create a conflict of interest for him as he represented Cory Forshey in an unrelated matter in West Virginia. For the reasons which follow, we agree with the trial court’s finding that a mistrial was necessary and thus, did not abuse its discretion in ordering a mistrial. Further, we agree with the trial court’s finding that the State’s failure to provide the additional texts was not prosecutorial misconduct intentionally calculated to create or invite a mistrial. Consequently, we find the trial court did not err by denying Appellant’s motion to dismiss."}

ADDITIONALLY, APPELLANT VOGT WAS DENIED THE EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL WHEN HIS ATTORNEY FAILED TO REQUEST AN INSTRUCTION ON THE LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSE OF RECKLESS HOMICIDE. FIFTH, SIXTH, AND FOURTEENTH AMENDMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND ARTICLE I, SECTION 10 AND 16 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION.", "extracted_text": "The question of whether a particular offense should be submitted to the finder of fact as a lesser-included offense involves a two-tiered analysis. The first tier, also called the ‘statutory-elements step,’ is a purely legal question, wherein we determine whether one offense is generally a lesser-included offense of the charged offense. The second tier looks to the evidence in a particular case and determines whether ‘a jury could reasonably find the defendant not guilty of the charged offense, but could convict the defendant of the lesser-included offense.’ In State v. Deem, 40 Ohio St.3d 205, 533 N.E.2d 294 (1988), paragraph three of the syllabus, the Supreme Court of Ohio held: ‘An offense may be a lesser-included offense of another if (i) the offense carries a lesser penalty than the other; (ii) the greater offense cannot, as statutorily defined, ever be committed without the lesser offense, as statutorily defined, also being committed; and (iii) some element of the greater offense is not required to prove the commission of the lesser offense.’ In State v. Hipshire, 2nd Dist. Darke No. 2010-CA-07, 2011-Ohio-3863, the defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of reckless homicide. The trial court instructed the jury on the elements of involuntary manslaughter, but stated that it could find nothing to indicate that reckless homicide was a lesser-included offense in terms of statutory interpretation or common law decision. In Hipshire, the underlying felony offense for which Hipshire was indicted was a violation of R.C. 2903.16(A), failing to provide for a functionally impaired person, which required proof of the mental state of ‘knowingly.’ The appellate court held: ‘Although Hipshire should have been more attentive to his wife's condition, there is evidence that she was not malnourished, that she did receive food and medication, and that some degree of care was given. A jury could reasonably conclude that Hipshire showed heedless indifference to the consequences and perversely disregarded a known risk that his conduct was likely to result in his wife's death, thus meriting the Reckless Homicide instruction. Accordingly, the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on Reckless Homicide as a lesser-included offense.’ The Hipshire court ultimately concluded that the trial court based its decision on incorrect legal grounds, not on factual conclusions relating to the state of the evidence. In State v. Carusone, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C–010681, 2003–Ohio–1018, the appellate court considered the culpable mental states required for involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide and concluded that the mental states were inconsistent. However, Carusone is distinguishable in that Carusone was involved in an altercation with two victims. The court held: ‘We hold, under the facts of this case, that Carusone could not have been found guilty of both involuntary manslaughter and reckless homicide. The evidence did not reasonably support findings that Carusone acted both knowingly and recklessly.’ In State v. Patterson, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2013-T-0062, 2015-Ohio-4423, a case similar to ours, the defendant was convicted for reckless homicide and corrupting another with drugs, along with other felonies. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Wright opined: ‘Involuntary manslaughter can be committed without reckless homicide also being committed.’ Assuming, as in Hipshire, there are occasions where reckless homicide may fairly be considered a lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter, here, we do not find the trial court’s failure to give a lesser-included instruction was in error, let alone plain error. At trial, the defense theory of the case was that there was an absence of evidence that Appellant trafficked in drugs. Appellant’s involuntary manslaughter conviction is contingent only upon proof of the underlying felony trafficking. Defense counsel pointed out in closing that there was only circumstantial evidence of texting between Tyler Miller’s phone and ‘whomever’ was using Appellant’s phone. Defense counsel emphasized Appellant’s lack of a criminal record. Defense counsel’s closing argument emphasized that Appellant’s friend, Cory Forshey, had access to Appellant’s cell phone, thus attempting to plant the idea that Corey Forshey was the one trafficking in drugs the night Tyler Miller overdosed. It appears defense counsel’s strategy was ‘all or nothing,’ to argue for a complete acquittal of both charges. It would have been inconsistent for Appellant’s counsel to argue for complete acquittal while at the same time, attempt to argue that Appellant ‘knew of a dangerous situation,’ yet ‘failed to use ordinary care’ as set forth above in the definition of ‘recklessness.’ Generally, a failure to request a jury instruction on a lesser-included offense is presumed to be a matter of trial strategy. For the foregoing reasons, we find no plain error with regard to the trial court’s failure to give a lesser-included offense jury instruction. Related to the above argument, Appellant has also asserted he received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his attorney’s failure to request a lesser-included offense instruction. Given our finding that Appellant did not request the instruction as a matter of reasonable trial strategy, similarly, we find Appellant was not rendered the ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to the lack of request for this instruction."}

According to the assistant prosecutor, she provided the interview recording to defense counsel marked “for counsel only.” The court reporter prepared a transcript of the interview at the state's request and provided defense counsel with a copy of the transcript. The assistant prosecutor suspected that defense counsel had violated Crim.R. 16(C) by giving the interview transcript to Svoboda or members of his family. According to her affidavit, the assistant prosecutor discussed the quandary with her supervisor and the “ethical hotline” and general counsel for the Cincinnati Bar Association. After getting the okay from her supervisor, the assistant prosecutor requested that Svoboda's jail cell be searched for a copy of the transcript. On April 12, 2019, a Hamilton County Sheriff's Deputy searched Svoboda's cell and removed all of his legal paperwork. Surveillance footage from the jail showed that the deputy took the paperwork to an office unmonitored by security cameras. Approximately 15 minutes later, the deputy left the office to meet the assistant prosecutor and brought her back to the office. The deputy and assistant prosecutor were in the office for approximately 17 minutes while the assistant prosecutor searched the paperwork. She did not find a copy of A.S.’s interview transcript. After the assistant prosecutor left, the deputy returned the paperwork to Svoboda's cell. On April 15, 2019, the parties gathered for trial, but the court continued the case to the next day because the assistant prosecutor informed the court that the state believed defense counsel had violated Crim.R. 16(C). On April 16, 2019, the assistant prosecutor explained to the court her suspicion that defense counsel had provided Svoboda or members of his family with a copy of the transcript from A.S.’s interview. Defense counsel denied any wrongdoing and informed the judge of the seizure and search of Svoboda's legal paperwork. Defense counsel told the court that he learned that the state had searched Svoboda's cell on the same day as the search. However, he explained that when he called the assistant prosecutor that day, she told him the search was unrelated to the prosecution. Svoboda's counsel filed a motion to disqualify the assistant prosecutor, claiming that Svoboda's legal paperwork contained notes taken during meetings with defense counsel discussing trial preparation and strategy. The state filed a motion in response and a motion for contempt against defense counsel for violating Crim.R. 16(C). On June 7, 2019, the parties appeared at a hearing to discuss the pending motions. The assistant prosecutor's supervisor represented the state. The assistant prosecutor did not appear at the hearing. The supervisor stated that the assistant prosecutor, in the presence of the sheriff's deputy, “leafed” through Svoboda's legal paperwork in a cursory manner. He stated that she was looking only for the transcript, which would have been easily identifiable and distinguishable from Svoboda's legal paperwork. He claimed that she did not examine the content of Svoboda's papers, did not take any notes, and did not make any copies. The supervisor stated that the assistant prosecutor had not gained any information about any of Svoboda's privileged communications. Nevertheless, the state agreed to the appointment of a special prosecutor and withdrew its motion for contempt. Defense counsel agreed to withdraw his motion to remove the assistant prosecutor, and agreed not to relitigate the issue with the special prosecutor. On July 10, 2019, in a written entry, the trial court stated that a special prosecutor would be appointed, and “the parties contemplate and agree that the Sixth Amendment claims and discovery issues which underlied the above motions will not be relitigated.” Two months later, on September 11, 2019, Svoboda filed a motion to dismiss the indictments on the grounds that the assistant prosecutor's search of his legal paperwork violated his Sixth Amendment rights. The state did not file a motion in opposition. The court denied the motion. A special prosecutor from Warren County was appointed to try the case. The special prosecutor told the court, “I know nothing about anything that was recovered from the Defendant's jail cell. Nothing has been provided to me, from any of the information and the stuff that I had received in this case, that came from the Defendant's jail cell. To me, it was as if the Defendant's jail cell was never searched because there is nothing in our file that would indicate [sic]. In fact, everything that I have is stuff that pertains prior to that.”"}

He complains that the purpose of this testimony was to portray him as a bad father unable to provide for his family. He cites the prosecutor's statement in closing argument: “[Svoboda] wants you to believe that he had absolute love and affection for, this child that he left in a house for sheriff's deputies to show up and escort her out as they were being evicted because of his decision making.”\n\nSvoboda did not object to A.S.’s testimony. Therefore, we review only for plain error. See State v. Smith, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-190507, 2020-Ohio-4976, 2020 WL 6158467, ¶ 81. To prevail on a claim that the trial court committed plain error, Svoboda must show that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was obvious, and (3) it affected the outcome of the trial. See id.\n\n“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.” State v. Hartman, 161 Ohio St.3d 214, 2020-Ohio-4440, 161 N.E.3d 651, ¶ 21, quoting Evid.R. 404(B). But other-acts evidence is admissible for “other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” (Emphasis deleted.) Hartman at ¶ 22, quoting Evid.R. 404(B).\n\nThe state argues that the eviction served as an important temporal landmark in the family history, which helped A.S. identify when specific instances of abuse occurred. This could be a proper basis upon which to admit the testimony, but the state's assertion is undercut by the prosecutor's statement during closing argument where he inferred that Svoboda's actions belied his claims that he loved A.S. and would never sexually abuse her.\n\nBut even if we were to find A.S.’s testimony to be bad-acts evidence, its admission was not obvious error that affected the outcome of the trial. Svoboda was accused of repeatedly raping his stepdaughter for ten years. Evidence that he was irresponsible or reckless with his money was not so prejudicial as to rise to the level of plain error.\n\nSvoboda also points to A.W.’s testimony that A.S. had developed a physical reaction (a “tick”) in response to hearing Svoboda's name as further evidence that the state sought to convict Svoboda on the basis that he was a bad father. However, this testimony has nothing to do with other-acts evidence. The eighth assignment of error is overruled."}

DeMarco, 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\nVoir Dire\n\n¶ 12 Appellant makes two arguments under this first assignment of error. In the first he argues the trial court improperly permitted the state to present factual elements of its case during voir dire over his counsel's objection. We disagree.\n\n¶ 13 Because the scope of voir dire lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, we review Appellant's argument for an abuse of discretion. State v. Jackson, 107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, ¶ 28. In order to find an abuse of discretion, we must determine the trial court's decision was unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983).\n\n¶ 14 \"The scope of voir dire * * * varies depending on the circumstances of each case.\" State v. Bedford, 39 Ohio St.3d 122, 129, 529 N.E.2d 913 (1988). A prosecutor has a right to give an overview of the facts of the case and of those involved in order to ascertain whether prospective jurors know anything about the offense. State v. Tyler, 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 32, 553 N.E.2d 576 (1990). While jurors must be impartial, they need not be completely ignorant of the facts and issues involved in a case to be qualified as jurors.\nState v. Gross, 97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, ¶ 38. \"The purpose of voir dire is not to establish how a juror will vote on the case to be tried; it is to discover whether any juror has a bias that would prevent him or her from individually weighing the facts of the case.\" State v. Madison, 160 Ohio St.3d 232, 2020-Ohio-3735, 155 N.E.2d 867, ¶ 24.\n\n¶ 15 In support of his argument that the trial court erred in permitting the state to present factual evidence of its case during voir dire over his counsel's objection, Appellant directs us to pages 128-137 of the transcript. Within these pages the prosecutor asked the prospective jurors where they believed sexual assaults occurred and instances they could think of where there would be no evidence of a sexual assault. Transcript of Trial (T.) 128-130. One prospective juror answered there may not be physical evidence if there had been a passage of time. T. 130. The prosecutor responded \"[t]hat is something that is called delayed reporting.\" He then asked if any of the prospective jurors were familiar with the term. T.131. Counsel for Appellant objected.\n\n¶ 16 At a side bar counsel for Appellant argued the prosecutor was \"starting to put into play facts not in evidence and we're trying to condition the jury on the case facts.\" T. 132. In response the prosecutor pointed out he had not referred to any victims and that whether or not jurors could accept the idea that sexual assault cases can be proven without physical evidence and whether they were open to the idea of delayed reporting was central to whether a potential juror in this matter could fairly weigh the evidence. T. 131. The trial court overruled Appellants objection but cautioned the prosecutor: \"* * *make sure you stay really narrow with regard to this line of questioning.\" T. 133. The\nprosecutor continued his voir dire and counsel for Appellant raised no further objection. T. 133-137.\n\n¶ 17 Appellant argues that after the trial court overruled his objection, the prosecutor went on to explain the science behind delayed reporting and polled jurors on the same. But the record simply does not support Appellant's allegations. Rather, the record reflects the prosecutor asked if jurors would immediately discount the testimony of a child who did not report their abuse right away and further asked if jurors would be willing to listen to an expert explain why there may not be physical signs of trauma as a result of sexual assault. T. 134-137.\n\n¶ 18 Upon review of the record, we find the state's questioning of the venire was narrowly tailored to determine whether any potential jurors harbored any bias which would make them ill-suited to determine this particular matter. Based on the circumstances of this case, the trial court's decision to overrule Appellant's objection was not error. We therefore reject Appellant's arguments pertaining to voir dire.\n\nHearsay\n\n¶ 19 Appellant next argues the trial court erred in permitting hearsay testimony from J.M. the mother of V.1 and V.2. We disagree.\n\n¶ 20 The admission or exclusion of evidence rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Sage, 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 180, 510 N.E.2d 343 (1987). As a general rule, all relevant evidence is admissible. Evid.R. 402; cf. Evid.R. 802. We therefore review this issue for an abuse of discretion.\n¶ 21} Hearsay is \"a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Evid.R. 801(C).\n\n¶ 22} Appellant directs us to pages 425 and 426 of the transcript wherein the state was conducting direct examination of J.M., mother of the victims. The relevant portion reads:\n\n[The State]: Going back to August of 2017, do you remember a conversation you had with your daughter [V.1]?\n\n[J.M]: Yes\n\n[The State]: * * * And what was that conversation about?\n\n[Counsel for Appellant] Objection; hearsay Your Honor.\n\n[The State]: Your Honor, it goes to - -\n\n[The Court]: Overruled. Go Ahead.\n\n[The State]: What was that conversation about?\n\n[J.M.]: She said [Appellant] raped and molested her.\n\n[The State]: All right. Based on that conversation what did you do?\n\n[J.M.]: I called the sheriff's department.\n\n¶ 23} Appellant further directs our attention to page 428 of the transcript. At this point the state's direct examination of J.M. focused on the fact she is a recovering drug addict and that her drug abuse had impacted her ability to properly parent her children:\n[The State]: Taking drugs, did that have an impact on your ability to be a good mother?\n\n[J.M]: Yes it did.\n\n[The State]: did you place yourself in front of your children?\n\n[J.M]: Do I? Yes.\n\n[The State]: Did you then?\n\n[J.M.]: No.\n\n[The State]: * * * Did you put yourself - - your needs in front of your children's needs?\n\n[J.M.]: Oh, yes.\n\n[The State]: And do you remember a time when [V.1] talked to you about something that was going on with [Appellant]?\n\n[Counsel for Appellant]: Objection, Your Honor. It's hearsay.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Court: Stop.\n\n[Counsel for Appellant]: There's no foundation.\n\nThe Court: Overruled.\n\n[The State]: Do you remember a time when you were on drugs [V.1.] talking to you about something going on with defendant?\n\n[J.M.]: I know she did. I don't remember the details.\n\n[The State]: Okay. Do you remember the nature of what she told you was going on?\n\n[J.M]: I remember she used the word rape.\n[The State]: Okay. Did you report it?\n\n[J.M.]: No.\n\n[The State]: Did you believe her?\n\n[J.M.]: No.\n\n[The State]: When you were told this time, what did you do?\n\n[J.M.]: I contacted law enforcement.\n\n[The State]: And did you make arrangements for your girls to go to Children's Hospital?\n\n[J.M.]: I did.\n\n{¶ 24} T. 427-429.\n\n{¶ 25} Appellee argues this testimony was not hearsay because it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. We agree. The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that if a statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, it is not prohibited by the hearsay rule and will be admissible, subject to the standards governing relevancy and undue prejudice. State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 196, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 262-263, 473 N.E.2d 768 (1984). Thus \"'testimony which explains the actions of a witness to whom a statement was directed, such as to explain the witness' activities, is not hearsay.'\" Id., quoting Maurer at 262.\n\n{¶ 26} Here, J.M.'s testimony in the first instance was limited to a single statement made by V.1 to explain why J.M. involved law enforcement. In the second instance J.M.'s testimony explained why she initially did nothing about the ongoing abuse. Each statement, therefore, was elicited to explain J.M's actions.\n¶ 27 In factually similar cases, such testimony was not hearsay. *State v. Hoseclaw*, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-12-31, 2013-Ohio-3486 ¶ 48 (\"The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the witness to testify concerning the victim’s statement that she was raped since it was offered not for its truth but to show why the witness reported the rape to the victim’s mother, which the mother, then, reported to law enforcement.\"). *State v. Dunn*, 9th Dist. No. 04CA008549, 2005-Ohio-1270, ¶ 17, *State v. Thomas*, 61 Ohio St.3d 223, 232, 400 N.E.2d 401 (1980) (\"It is well established that extrajudicial statements made by an out-of-court declarant are properly admissible to explain the actions of a witness to whom the statement was directed\").\n\n¶ 28 Moreover, even if that were not true, J.M.’s testimony was cumulative to that of V.1 making its admission harmless error. T. 452-453, 458. \"[T]he erroneous admission or exclusion of hearsay, cumulative to properly admitted testimony, constitutes harmless error.\" *State v. Hogg*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 11AP-50, 2011-Ohio-6454, ¶ 46.\n\n¶ 29 Appellant’s complaints regarding both voir dire and the admission of hearsay evidence are without merit. Since we do not find multiple instances of harmless error, the doctrine of cumulative error is inapplicable. The first assignment of error is overruled."}

The granting or denial of a motion in limine is a tentative, interlocutory,\nprecautionary ruling reflecting the trial court's anticipatory treatment of an evidentiary issue. *State v. Grubb*, 28 Ohio St.3d 199, 201, 503 N.E.2d 142 (1986). A motion in limine does not preserve an issue for appeal. *Id.* Rather, in order to preserve the error, the evidence must be presented at trial, and a proper objection lodged. *Id.* paragraph two of the syllabus (1986). Once properly preserved an appellate court will then review the trial court's ruling on the objection rather than the ruling on the motion in limine. See *Wray v. Herrell*, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 93CA08, 1994 WL 64293.\n\n{¶ 32} In his reply brief, Appellant cites five instances wherein the state referred to V.1 and V.2 as \"victims.\" Our examination of the record reveals Appellant did not lodge an objection in any of these five instances. We further note four of these instances occurred during closing argument. Transcript of Trial, Volume III (T. III), 621, 624-625, 632, 651-652. Even if Appellant had objected there would be no error because in closing argument a prosecutor may comment freely on \"what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.\" *State v. Lott*, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990), quoting *State v. Stephens*, 24 Ohio St.2d 76, 82, 263 N.E.2d 773 (1970). Referring to the child victims as such in closing argument would therefore not be improper.\n\n{¶ 33} The remaining transcript reference cites to a single instance during trial wherein the prosecutor referred to the V.1 as \"victim.\" This instance occurred during the direct testimony of Katharine Doughty, a pediatric nurse practitioner who examined the children following their disclosure of sexual abuse by Appellant. Again, even if Appellant had objected to this use of the word \"victim\" we would find no prejudicial error as this was one isolated incident which took place during a three-day trial.\nFinally, in his February 2020 Motion in Limine Regarding the Term Victim as well as here on appeal, Appellant relies on State v. Almedom, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-852, 2016-Ohio-1553 to support his argument that the trial court should have prohibited the prosecutor from using the term \"victim\" with respect to V.1 and V.2. In Almedom, however, most of the offending references were made by the trial court judge, not the prosecutor. Additionally, the improper references were made throughout the entire trial. The Almedom court also found that defense counsel's ineffective assistance, linked with the trial court's and prosecutor's prejudicial comments, \"undermined the proper function of the adversarial process\" so that it could not \"be sure a just result was produced.\" Id. at ¶10. The instant matter presents no comparable facts.\n\nAppellant failed to preserve this argument for review and even if he had, it would be without merit. The final assignment of error is overruled."}

Although Sipple raised multiple arguments in his motion to suppress, on appeal he only argues that any statements made during the December 2016 incident were not relevant to his prosecution for unauthorized use, or that the probative value of such evidence was outweighed by the risk of undue prejudice. Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact. State v. Castagnola, 145 Ohio St.3d 1, 2015-Ohio-1565, ¶ 32, citing State v. Burnside, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, ¶ 8. An appellate court must accept the trial court's findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. Burnside at ¶ 8. \"Accepting these facts as true, the appellate court must then independently determine, without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard.\" Id. In this case, the trial court orally denied the motion to suppress after the hearing and did not enter written findings of fact. Sipple argues any statements to Officer Stock during the December 2016 incident were not relevant to his prosecution for unauthorized use of a computer. Generally, relevant evidence is admissible, except where excluded by the federal or state constitutions, statute, or rule. Evid.R. 402. Relevant evidence is \"evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Evid.R. 401. Sipple was charged with unauthorized use of a computer, in violation of R.C. 2913.04. As relevant to this case, that statute prohibits knowingly gaining access to a computer or computer system without the consent of the owner of the computer or computer system. Officer Stock testified Sipple stated he deleted records from the slate room computer and was intoxicated when he did it. If true, this statement would constitute an admission of having accessed the slate room computer, which is a fact of consequence to determining whether Sipple committed the charged offense. Thus, evidence regarding Sipple's statements during the December 2016 incident was relevant to the present case. Sipple further argues that even if the statements were relevant, they should have been suppressed due to the risk of undue prejudice. Relevant evidence \"is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\" Evid.R. 403(A). Sipple appears to argue there was a risk of undue prejudice because the statements were alleged to have been made while he was in a police cruiser. Exclusion of relevant evidence due to undue prejudice involves more than mere prejudice, because anything adverse to a party's case could be deemed prejudicial to that party. State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, ¶ 8. \"Unfair prejudice is that quality of evidence which might result in an improper basis for a jury decision. Consequently, if the evidence arouses the jury's emotional sympathies, evokes a sense of horror, or appeals to an instinct to punish, the evidence may be unfairly prejudicial.\" Id. at ¶ 24, quoting Oberlin v. Akron Gen. Med. Ctr., 91 Ohio St.3d 169, 172 (2001). A review of the trial transcript indicates Officer Stock did not testify on direct examination that Sipple's statements during the December 2016 incident occurred while Sipple was in a police cruiser. To the extent the jury became aware that this conversation occurred while Sipple was in a police cruiser, that fact was raised by Sipple's trial counsel in the course of cross-examining Officer Stock in impeaching his credibility based on the fact that no recording of the conversation from the cruiser's dash camera was preserved. Moreover, there was no testimony suggesting to the jury that Sipple was arrested or charged with any crime as a result of the December 2016 incident. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude this was the type of evidence that would arouse the jury's sympathies, evoke a sense of horror, or appeal to the jury's instinct to punish Sipple, and the trial court did not err by failing to exclude the evidence based on the risk of undue prejudice."}
{"index": "090-Sipple", "allegation_num": "allegation_2", "allegation": "The trial court erred in denying Defendant-Appellant's motion to declare a mistrial.", "extracted_text": "Sipple asserts the trial court erred by denying a mistrial. As noted above, Sipple's trial counsel moved for a mistrial after the prosecutor asked Officer Ortega whether he was familiar with Sipple, and the trial court denied that motion. Sipple does not contest that denial on appeal. Rather, Sipple argues the trial court should have granted a mistrial based on a comment made by the prosecutor in closing argument. Sipple cites the following comment by the prosecutor and the sidebar exchange that followed:\n\n[Prosecutor]: And the defendant happened to testify, so you have to use that same metric when you think about his testimony. You heard that he had just graduated and gotten his CPA. He was going to be sitting for the CPA license. His job and his future were on the line, and along comes another OVI arrest, another charge on his record, or something on his record.\n\n[Sipple's trial counsel]: Objection, Your Honor.\n\n[Prosecutor]: Strike that, Your Honor.\n\nThe Court: Can you approach?\n\n(Tr. Vol. II at 360.) The trial court then conducted a sidebar discussion with counsel:\n\n[Sipple's trial counsel]: Again, Your Honor, same objection I keep making. I understand that in the heat of the moment we say things we are not supposed to say, but I don't know what else to do. I just think it is improper. I don't think it is intentional, but I think it is improper. It is another comment on his record.\n\nThe Court: Uh-huh.\n\n[Sipple's trial counsel]: And it is not in evidence.\n\nThe Court: Closing arguments are not evidence, and I will reread that again. Don't bring it up anymore.\n\n[Prosecutor]: That was unintentional.\n\nThe Court: Motion for mistrial denied.\n\n[Sipple's trial counsel]: Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n(Tr. Vol. II at 360-61.)

The state contends that “there is ample evidence to support a rational trier of fact’s decision that penetration occurred.”\n\nIn State v. Falkenstein, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 83316, 2004-Ohio 2561, ¶ 16, this court held that “evidence of slight penetration, entering the vulva or labia, is sufficient to support a rape conviction.” The Falkenstein Court further held that “there was sufficient evidence that could lead a rational trier of fact to conclude that appellant penetrated the victim by placing his penis on the outside of the victim’s vagina.” Id.\n\nC.H. testified that she was asleep and woke up to Roan penetrating her with his penis while lying on top of her. Ohio courts have consistently held that a victim’s testimony alone is sufficient to support a rape conviction. State v. Blankenship, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 77900, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 5520, 11 (Dec. 13, 2001). “[T]estimony, if believed, is sufficient to prove each element of the offense of rape. There is no requirement that a rape victim’s testimony be corroborated precedent to conviction.” (Citation omitted.) Id. Furthermore, this court has held that “sleep constitutes a mental or physical condition that substantially impairs a person from resisting or consenting to sexual conduct.”\nState v. Clark, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90148, 2008-Ohio-3358, ¶ 21. Thus, C.H.’s testimony alone can provide sufficient evidence of substantial impairment rape pursuant to R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c). While Roan’s testimony contradicts C.H.’s testimony that this event occurred, when reviewing whether a conviction is supported by sufficient evidence, we look to whether the state presented sufficient evidence, not whether that evidence was rebutted by the defense. Thus, upon review of the state’s evidence, namely C.H.’s testimony that Roan penetrated her vagina while she was sleeping, we find sufficient evidence to convict Roan of substantial impairment rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c).\n\nTurning to the rapes in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), Roan argues that there was insufficient evidence of force or threat of force. Force is defined in R.C. 2901.01(A)(1) as “any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.”\n\nC.H. testified that she “was describing [Roan] forcing his penis inside me” when she woke up the first time. According to C.H., she pushed Roan off of her and jumped out of bed. As to the next count of rape, C.H. testified that Roan digitally penetrated her vagina. According to C.H., she did not move other than to “try to squeeze my legs closed and cross them.” C.H. testified as follows about what happened next:\n\nBut he does — his fingers do go inside of me. * * * At that point, I kind of realized the only way that this is going to end and I can go home is if he gets what he wants at that point, because then I realized he’s completely naked. * * * I was just still, and I was trying to cross my legs and hope that the body language would make him realize that this isn’t\nwhat I want. * * * I just remember just wanting to leave, just being —\nwiggling and just uncomfortable.\n\nOhio courts have held that force may be established when the victim\ntestifies that she resisted the defendant during the rape. See State v. Zimpfer, 2d\nDist. Montgomery No. 26062, 2014-Ohio-4401, ¶ 48; State v. Miller, 9th Dist.\nSummit No. 27048, 2015-Ohio-279, ¶ 37.\n\nAdditionally, this court has held the following regarding forcible\nrape: “Force need not be overt and physically brutal, but can be subtle and\npsychological. As long as it can be shown that the rape victim’s will was overcome\nby fear or duress, the forcible element of rape can be established.” State v. Fowler,\n27 Ohio App.3d 149, 154, 500 N.E.2d 390 (8th Dist.1985).\n\nHere, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, C.H.’s testimony was sufficient to support Roan’s convictions for rape,\nand his first assigned error is overruled."}

While Roan’s testimony contradicts C.H.’s testimony that this event occurred, when reviewing whether a conviction is supported by sufficient evidence, we look to whether the state presented sufficient evidence, not whether that evidence was rebutted by the defense.

We disagree.\na. Standard of Review\n\nOur standard of review is set forth in Strickland v. Washington (1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed. 674. Ohio adopted this standard in the case of State v. Bradley (1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373. These cases require a two-pronged analysis in reviewing a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. First, we must determine whether counsel’s assistance was ineffective; whether counsel’s performance\nfell below an objective standard of reasonable representation and was violative of any of his essential duties to the client. If we find ineffective assistance of counsel, we must then determine whether or not the defense was actually prejudiced by counsel’s ineffectiveness such that the reliability of the outcome of the trial is suspect. This requires a showing there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional error, the outcome of the trial would have been different. *Id.*\n\n**¶26** Trial counsel is entitled to a strong presumption that all decisions fall within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. *State v. Sallie* (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 673, 675, 693 N.E.2d 267. In addition, the United States Supreme Court and the Ohio Supreme Court have held a reviewing court “need not determine whether counsel’s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies. *Bradley* at 143, 538 N.E.2d 373, quoting *Strickland* at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Even debatable trial tactics and strategies do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Clayton*, 62 Ohio St.3d 45, 402 N.E.2d 1189 (1980). Counsel’s decision to challenge or exclude a juror is typically attributed to trial strategy. *State v. Mundt*, 115 Ohio St.3d 22, 2007-Ohio-4836, 873 N.E.2d 828, ¶64.\n\n**b. Failure to strike a biased juror**\n\n**¶27** In order to demonstrate that Appellant’s trial counsel’s performance was objectively unreasonable in light of counsel’s failure to strike a juror, Appellant “*must* show that [a] juror was *actually biased* against him.” (Emphasis added in *Mundt.*) *Mundt*, at ¶67, quoting *Miller v. Francis*, 269 F.3d 609, 616 (6th Cir.2001). “Actual bias is ‘bias in fact’-the existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference that the person will not act with entire impartiality.” *United States v. Torres*, 128 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir.1997), citing\nUnited States v. Wood, 299 U.S. 123, 133, 57 S.Ct. 177, 81 L.Ed. 78 (1936). Therefore, Appellant must prove that the juror, because of the juror’s partiality or biases, was not “capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence” before that juror. Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 217, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982).\n\n¶28 Actual bias can be found from either a juror’s express admission or from circumstantial evidence of the juror’s biased attitudes. Hughes v. United States, 258 F.3d 453, 459 (6th Cir.2001). In other instances, courts have found actual bias when a juror unequivocally states he or she cannot be fair due to a law-enforcement bias, id at 459-460, when a juror’s opinion of the defendant’s guilt based on pretrial publicity was fixed, Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 727-728, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751 (1961), or when a juror’s expressed views on the death penalty would “prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties,” Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 728, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992), quoting Adams v. Texas, 448 U.S. 38, 45, 100 S.Ct. 2521, 65 L.Ed.2d 581 (1980).\n\n¶29 In the case sub judice, juror No. 34 stated he had previously been charged with disorderly conduct while intoxicated and criminal damaging property a few months before the trial. When asked by the trial court, juror No. 34 indicated that he had been treated fairly and that he bore no ill will towards the police. Juror No. 34 went on to explain to the court that he wore a Thin Blue Line sweatshirt, showing support for law enforcement, to court. The trial court then asked if he bore ill will toward either side. The Juror answered in the negative. The trial court then followed up asking juror No. 34 if he could remain fair and impartial, given the incident with police. He indicated he would be able to be fair and impartial.\nDefense counsel did have a peremptory challenge, and failed to strike juror No. 34.\n\nThis Court has previously held that “‘[few decisions at trial are as subjective or prone to individual attorney strategy as juror voir dire, where decisions are often made on the basis of intangible factors.’” State v. Dixon, 5th Dist Muskingum No. CT2013-0055, 2014-Ohio-4235, ¶82, citing Miller 269 F.3d at 620. In summary, even though juror No. 34 pointed out to the court he was wearing a Thin Blue Line sweatshirt, he had also previously been charged with disorderly conduct while intoxicated, and he also indicated he could be impartial. Therefore, we conclude counsel’s seating of juror No. 34 did not fall below an objective standard of reasonable representation."}

The term abuse of discretion implies that the court’s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. State v. Adams, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157 (1980). An abuse of discretion involves views or actions \"that no conscientious judge, acting intelligently, could honestly have taken.\" State v.

Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 267 (1984).\n\n{¶ 25} As noted above, in this case, counsel for appellant moved for a mistrial based on prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument. In the context of closing arguments, the test for prosecutorial misconduct is \"whether 'the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.' \" State v. Fudge, 10th Dist. No. 16AP-821, 2018-Ohio-601, ¶ 48, quoting State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14 (1984). In determining whether allegedly improper remarks resulted in prejudice to the defendant, a reviewing court must consider \"'(1) the nature of the remarks, (2) whether an objection was made by counsel, (3) whether corrective instructions were given by the court, and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendant.' \" (Further quotations and citations omitted.) Id. at ¶ 47, quoting Aleshire at ¶ 42. Furthermore, because isolated instances of prosecutorial misconduct are deemed harmless, \"'the closing argument must be viewed in its entirety to determine whether the defendant has been prejudiced.' \" Id. at ¶ 48, quoting State v. Muhleka, 2d Dist. No. 19827, 2004-Ohio-1822, at ¶ 85, quoting State v. Stevens, 2d Dist.

Id., quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, citing State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 165 (1990). The prosecutor is likewise free to \"state his or her opinion if it is based on the evidence presented at trial.\" State v.

Thompson, 3d Dist. No. 7-16-10, 2017-Ohio-792, ¶ 26, citing Pang v. Minch, 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 187 (1990).\n\n¶ 29 In this case, as noted previously, after the jury had retired to commence deliberations, defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor's alleged misconduct during closing arguments. Defense counsel specifically averred:\n\nYour Honor, I try to be restrained during closing arguments, but particularly when counsel in rebuttal makes statements, it becomes even more difficult. But I would note my objection and even move for a mistrial based upon comments that were made on rebuttal. First of all, one comment was made to the jurors that they, too, should be outraged. And that was made in response to or during her explanation about the community standards. But that's an invitation for this jury to decide this case based upon emotion and not the facts or the law in this case, which specifically they are told not to do. Another objection I have is several times in her argument she stated that it doesn't matter that Hanna injected herself. Well, so she is asking the jury to again ignore the evidence. The jurors' responsibility is to consider all of the evidence and the fact that that particular comment or the other point of my presentation that it is not in the jury instructions is still relevant to their deliberations, both in terms of evaluating the evidence and specifically in weighing whether or not the death was the proximate cause of my client's conduct versus that of Hanna's conduct. So for those reasons, we make our objections and we would make our motion.\n\n(Tr. at 451-52.)\nAfter listening to arguments from both the prosecutor and defense counsel, the trial court denied the motion for a mistrial, stating:\n\nI instructed the jury prior to taking evidence and during my instructions that closing statements of counsel are not evidence and should not be considered by them as evidence. I will deny your motion for a mistrial. I will note your objection.\n\n(Tr. at 453.)\n\nA review of the record reveals that during rebuttal closing arguments, the prosecutor stated to the jury, \"[d]isturbing photographs, I hope they are disturbing to you. They should be disturbing to you. They should be disturbing and y'all should be outraged.\" (Tr. at 436.) Defense counsel did not object to the foregoing remarks at the time they were made.\n\nThe prosecutor also stated to the jury, \"[t]he Judge has given you all of the law on these jury instructions. Right? That is the law that you've got to follow. And not one place in here will you find if Hanna Geiger, the victim, injected herself or because she wanted the drugs, that that means he is not culpable. You won't find that in here.\" (Tr. at 439.) Defense counsel lodged a general objection to the foregoing statement, but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 439.)\n\nThe prosecutor continued rebuttal closing arguments and informed the jury, \"[a]gain, I never once said that she didn't inject herself. And you know, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day it doesn't matter if she injected it, smoked it, ate it. He still provided that cocaine to her.\" (Tr. at 443.) Defense counsel made no objection to the foregoing remarks at the time the prosecutor made them.\n\nThe prosecutor also stated to the jury, \"[y]ou are here to judge the facts and determine whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, Andrew Nichols -- not Hanna Geiger. She's not on trial here. She is the victim in this case.\" (Tr. at 444.) Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor's use of the word \"victim,\" but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 444.)\n\n---\n\n6 It is unclear from the transcript to which part or parts of the statement counsel was specifically objecting; however, appellant stated in his appellate brief that the objection was premised on the use of the word \"victim\" in describing Hanna Geiger.\nContinuing rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor informed the jury, \"[y]ou have to decide this case. You follow the law, and it is did we prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt. I submit to you we did. And now he just wants to blame the victim, Hanna.\" (Tr. at 446.) Defense counsel again objected to the use of the word \"victim\" by the prosecutor, but the objection was overruled by the trial court. (Tr. at 446-47.)\n\nUpon consideration, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant appellant's motion for mistrial premised on the foregoing remarks made by the prosecutor during rebuttal closing argument. First, regarding appellant's contention that the prosecutor improperly invited the jury to decide the case based on emotion rather than the facts of the case or the applicable law by stating to the jurors that they should be \"outraged\" by what they saw in the photographs presented at trial, we reiterate that defense counsel made no objection to this remark at the time it was made. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error on this point. Fudge at ¶ 49.\n\nFurthermore, we find no improper conduct on the part of the prosecutor in commenting that the jurors should be outraged in viewing the photographs. This is so, because \"outrage\" is an element of the offense of gross abuse of a corpse,7 one of the counts with which appellant had been charged. When this comment is viewed in context with the indictment, the jury instructions, and the prosecutor's earlier closing argument on this point (Tr. at 409-11), it is apparent that the comment was meant to reference the element of outrage included in the offense. (Tr. at 409-11.) As the prosecutor had to prove this element, it was not improper to urge the jury that they should be outraged by the photographs they viewed because the photographs were direct evidence of the treatment of Hanna Geiger's body by appellant. Put another way, this remark by the prosecutor was an entirely fair one because it was based on \"'what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.'\" (Further citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48, quoting Muhleka at ¶ 85, quoting Lott at 165. The jurors would have understood the prosecutor's comment in this context and they would not have taken the prosecutor's comment to be an invitation to abandon their responsibility to decide the case based on the law and the facts and instead improperly decide the case based on emotion. There was no\n\n---\n\n7 R.C. 2927.01(B) provides that \"[n]o person, except as authorized by law, shall treat a human corpse in a way that would outrage reasonable community sensibilities.\"\nmisconduct on the part of the prosecutor in urging the jurors to be outraged by the photographs of Hanna's body, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis.\n\n¶ 38 Next, we turn to appellant's complaint that the prosecutor improperly used the word \"victim\" to describe Hanna Geiger three times during rebuttal closing argument. As set forth above, defense counsel lodged an objection each time the prosecutor referred to Hanna Geiger as a victim, and the trial court overruled each objection. In support of appellant's argument that the prosecutor's use of the term \"victim\" during closing argument substantially affected the jurors' impartiality in evaluating the evidence to the prejudice of appellant, he cites to State v. Almedom, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-852, 2016-Ohio-1553, in which this court determined, sua sponte, that defense counsel in that case had been ineffective by failing to object to repeated references made by the trial judge to the child witnesses as \"victims.\"\n\n¶ 39 We find Almedom readily distinguishable from the instant matter. First and foremost, in Almedom, the offending references to the witnesses as \"victims\" were made by the trial judge, not the prosecutor. While a trial judge must remain detached and neutral in any matter before the court, the prosecutor is not constrained by any such obligation of neutrality. State v. Harper, 10th Dist. No. 01-AP-201, 2001-Ohio-8875. Secondly, in Almedom, the improper references were made throughout the entire trial. Here, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a \"victim\" were made only during rebuttal closing argument. As discussed above, during closing argument, the prosecutor is free to comment on \"what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.\" (Internal quotations and citations omitted.) Fudge at ¶ 48. In our view, the prosecutor's references to Hanna Geiger as a \"victim\" entailed fair comment on what the evidence had shown and were not improper. Thus, there was no misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in referring to Hanna Geiger as a victim, and there was no error on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis.\n\n¶ 40 Finally, we address appellant's contention that, in referencing the court's instructions to the jury, the prosecutor improperly asked the jury to disregard evidence by stating it did not matter that Hanna Geiger injected herself with the cocaine for purposes of determining whether appellant was culpable in Hanna's death. We reiterate that defense\ncounsel made no objection to this remark at the time it was made. Accordingly, he has waived all but plain error on this issue. *Fudge* at ¶ 49.\n\n¶ 41 Furthermore, we do not agree that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by asserting that for purposes of determining appellant’s culpability in Hanna Geiger’s death, whether Hanna injected the narcotics herself was of no import. Instead, we find the prosecutor was appropriately arguing the legal insignificance of this evidence as it pertained to the jury’s consideration of the involuntary manslaughter charge. This is so because pursuant to the court’s instructions, appellant was culpable in Hanna’s death if the jury found that appellant provided Hanna with the cocaine. Put another way, the fact that Hanna injected herself would not negate appellant’s culpability. Indeed, the prosecutor conceded that Hanna injected herself in explaining why this fact did not negate appellant’s culpability or provide a legal defense to the charge of involuntary manslaughter. (Tr. at 439, 443.) In short, Hanna’s act of self-injection “would not change the basic fact that the victim took the drugs furnished by [the defendant] and died as a result.” *State v. Price*, 8th Dist. No. 107096, 2019-Ohio-1642, ¶ 89. The prosecutor did not improperly tell the jury that it did not matter if Hanna injected herself, and there was no error, plain or otherwise, on the part of the trial court in denying the motion for mistrial on this basis.\n\n¶ 42 Moreover, in considering all of appellants’ assertions of alleged prosecutorial misconduct during rebuttal closing argument, we observe the trial court instructed the jury “[t]he evidence does not include the indictment or opening statements or closing arguments of counsel. The opening statements and closing arguments of counsel are designed to assist you. They are not evidence.” (Jury Instr. at 2.) Thus, we presume that the jurors followed these instructions and the verdict was not based on the content of the closing arguments. *Fudge* at ¶ 52, citing at ¶ 26, citing *Pang* at 187.\n\n¶ 43 In short, appellant has failed to establish any prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments which resulted in appellant being deprived of a fair trial.

This statement also included a reference to Hanna being a “victim,” and appellant stated in his appellate brief that the objection was premised on the use of the word “victim” in describing Hanna Geiger.\nmistrial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct, and appellant’s first assignment of error is overruled."}

R.C. 2903.04 provides, in relevant part:\n\n(A) No person shall cause the death of another or the unlawful termination of another's pregnancy as a proximate result of the offender's committing or attempting to commit a felony.\n\n* * *\n\n(C) Whoever violates this section is guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Violation of division (A) of this section is a felony of the first degree.\nIn State v. Losey, 23 Ohio App.3d 93, 95 (10th Dist.1985), construing former R.C. 2903.04, this court stated that for purposes of determining culpability for involuntary manslaughter, \"'proximate result' bears a resemblance to the concept of 'proximate cause' in that defendant will be held responsible for those foreseeable consequences which are known to be, or should be known to be, within the scope of the risk created by his conduct.\" Id. at 95. Further, \"[i]t is not necessary that the accused be in a position to foresee the precise consequence of his conduct; only that the consequence be foreseeable in the sense that what actually transpired was natural and logical in that it was within the scope of the risk created by his conduct.\" Id. at 96. Thus, the issue of whether the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that appellant's acts were the proximate cause of Hanna Geiger's death is resolved by whether Hanna Geiger's death reasonably could be anticipated by an ordinarily prudent person as likely to result based upon the facts and circumstances of this case. State v. Platt, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1148, 2005-Ohio-705, ¶ 33.\n\nAppellant argues that Hanna's death was not within the foreseeable scope of risk created by his conduct when he provided her with the cocaine because he did not administer the cocaine to her; he did not mix the shot for her; and he \"had no prior knowledge as to whether or not the decedent consumed a large mixture of drugs and was inebriated prior to the consumption of the cocaine.\" (Appellant's Brief at 27.) Notably, the latter assertion is wholly belied by appellant's own admission during his interview that Hanna did not appear to be sober, appeared to be high when she arrived at the home the night she died, and had told him she had been smoking crack since she left the hospital. (Tr. at 342-43.)\n\nEven if appellant had not known she was high upon arrival, however, Hanna's overdose death was within the foreseeable scope of risk created by appellant's act of giving her the cocaine. We observe that over the past decade, Ohio courts have widely acknowledged that the possibility of an overdose death is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of providing a controlled substance to another person. See, e.g., State v. Sabo, 3d Dist. No. 14-09-33, 2010-Ohio-1261; State v. Vogt, 4th Dist. No. 17CA17, 2018-Ohio-4457; State v. Veley, 6th Dist. No. L-16-1038, 2017-Ohio-9064, ¶ 25 (finding death need not be actually envisioned to be foreseeable); State v. Wells, 12th Dist. No. CA2016-02-009, 2017-Ohio-420, ¶ 39 (finding \"[t]here is nothing extraordinary or surprising about the\nmanner of [decedent's] death in relation to appellant's actions. Appellant provided drugs to a known drug abuser. The possibility of an overdose is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of providing a controlled substance to another”). Upon consideration, we find we are of like mind.\n\n{¶ 52} Furthermore, although in his brief appellant specifically attempts to distinguish Sabo from the facts of this case, the attempt wholly fails as the facts of the cases bear much more in resemblance to each other than in difference. In both cases there was evidence of decedent's inebriated condition, which appellant admitted in this case (Tr. at 342-43); that the decedent and appellant had taken other substances together, which appellant admitted in stating he and Hanna were both smoking the cocaine initially (Tr. at 310); and that the defendant warned the decedent about using the illegal substance, which appellant admitted in stating he told Hanna not to inject the cocaine (Tr. at 311.). Thus, contrary to appellant's argument, under the facts of this case, a rational trier of fact could readily have found that the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant's conduct was the proximate cause of Hanna's death. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that this element of the crime was met. And, because there was no conflicting testimony on this issue for the jury to resolve, appellant's conviction of involuntary manslaughter was not against the manifest weight of the evidence."}

We do not agree.\n\n¶ 55 In reviewing a trial court's determination of whether a defendant's offenses should merge pursuant to R.C. 2941.25, otherwise known as the multiple counts statute, an appellate court conducts its review de novo. Flood at ¶ 25, citing State v. S.S., 10th Dist. No. 13AP-1060, 2014-Ohio-5352, ¶ 28, citing State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 482, 2012-Ohio-5699, ¶ 1. Thus, although we must apply the law to the facts of the individual case\nbefore us in making a legal determination as to whether R.C. 2941.25 allows multiple convictions, \"'[t]hat facts are involved in the analysis does not make the issue a question of fact deserving of deference to a trial court.'\" \" Id., quoting S.S. at ¶ 28, quoting Williams at ¶ 25.\n\n¶ 56 R.C. 2941.25 provides:\n\n(A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.\n\n(B) Where the defendant's conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\n\n¶ 57 \"'When the defendant's conduct constitutes a single offense, the defendant may be convicted and punished only for that offense. When the conduct supports more than one offense, however, a court must conduct an analysis of allied offenses of similar import to determine whether the offenses merge or whether the defendant may be convicted of separate offenses.'\" Flood at ¶ 27, quoting State v. Ruff, 143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015-Ohio-995, ¶ 24.\n\n¶ 58 In determining whether two offenses are allied offenses that merge into a single conviction, we \"'must evaluate three separate factors: the conduct, the animus, and the import.'\" Flood at ¶ 28, quoting State v. Harris, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-683, 2016-Ohio-3424, ¶ 42, citing Ruff at paragraph one of the syllabus. \"'If any of the following is true, the offenses cannot merge and the defendant may be convicted and sentenced for multiple offenses: (1) the offenses are dissimilar in import or significance—in other words, each offense caused separate, identifiable harm, (2) the offenses were committed separately, and (3) the offenses were committed with separate animus or motivation.'\" Flood at ¶ 28, quoting Ruff at ¶ 25. \"Ultimately, if the harm resulting from each offense is separate and identifiable, the offenses are of dissimilar import and do not merge.\" Id., citing Harris at ¶ 42, citing Ruff at ¶ 25.\n\n¶ 59 Appellant argues the trial court erred in failing to merge all five offenses for purposes of conviction and sentencing because they all emanate from his conduct of\nacquiring cocaine. This is not so. With respect to the offense of gross abuse of a corpse and the offense of tampering with evidence, the conduct of appellant was wholly separate and distinct both from each other and from the other three offenses. The tampering with evidence charge arose from appellant disposing of Hanna's purse and car. The gross abuse of a corpse charge arose from putting Hanna's body wrapped in trash bags in the basement and leaving it there for over a month after she had died. These acts exist separately and apart from the act of acquiring cocaine and should neither merge with each other nor with any of the other three offenses pursuant to R.C. 2941.25.\n\n¶ 60 With respect to the remaining three offenses of trafficking in drugs, corrupting another with drugs, and involuntary manslaughter, the offenses do not merge because of the dissimilar import of the offenses. As argued by the state, the three offenses clearly escalate in terms of import and the significance of the harm. Trafficking need not involve any harm at all and is a fifth-degree felony. Corrupting another with drugs requires serious harm and is a second-degree felony. Involuntary manslaughter requires death, the most serious harm of all, and is a first-degree felony. The three offenses clearly require differing degrees of harm.\n\n¶ 61 Further, we note that when the trial court conducted its analysis on the merger issue, it specifically addressed why it would not be proper to merge the corrupting another with drugs offense and the involuntary manslaughter offense as requested by appellant. The trial court rightly concluded that the physical harm caused by the corrupting with drugs was not Hanna's death; rather, it was the harm which occurred during the period of time between Hanna's ingestion of the cocaine and her death, which the coroner's expert testified could have been as long as 10 or 15 minutes. (Tr. at 222.) As urged by the state, the different timing of the offenses serves to further solidify the fact that the offenses are dissimilar in import.\n\n¶ 62 In sum, we find the five separate offenses for which appellant was convicted have different import and significance of harm, and the trial court did not err when it determined that none of them should merge for purposes of sentencing. Accordingly, appellant's third assignment of error is overruled."}

Lovasco*, 431 U.S. 783, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977). The Ohio Supreme Court has held that “[a]n unjustifiable delay between the commission of an offense and a defendant’s indictment therefor[e], which results in actual prejudice to the defendant, is a violation of the right to due process of law.”  *State v. Luck*, 15 Ohio St.3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097 (1984), paragraph two of the syllabus.

First, the burden is on the defendant to present evidence of actual prejudice; once a defendant does so, the burden then shifts to the state to produce evidence of a justifiable reason for the delay.  *Id.* at ¶ 13, citing *State v. Whiting*, 84 Ohio St.3d 215, 217, 702 N.E.2d 1199 (1998). “A court must determine whether the defendant has established actual prejudice to his ability to defend himself before independently determining whether the state met its burden of establishing a justifiable reason for the delay in bringing charges.”  *State v.

The “*possibility* that memories will fade, witnesses will become inaccessible, or evidence will be lost is not sufficient to establish actual prejudice.”  (Emphasis\nId. at ¶ 105, citing Marion at 325-326. Those are “the real possibilit[ies] of prejudice inherent in any extended delay,” and statutes of limitations sufficiently protect against them. Marion at 326.

State v. Smith, 87 Ohio St.3d 424, 442, 721 N.E.2d 93 (2000), citing Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d at 14, 470 N.E.2d 883. The touchstone of analysis ‘is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.’ Id., citing Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982).\n\n{¶37} In the instant matter, Lynch takes issue with the prosecutor’s comments about the rape kit examination procedure that M.H. went through at the hospital after disclosing the allegations against Lynch to her mother. During closing arguments, the prosecutor stated, in relevant part,\n\nNow, let’s talk about what happened to [M.H.] as a result of her disclosing what [Lynch] did to her.\n\nWhen she said what he did, when she said what he did, this is what happened to her. She had to go to the hospital. As a 12-year-old girl, she had to have her legs up in stirrups with her knees apart, a speculum inserted into her vagina, swabs stuck five to six centimeters into her vagina, swabbing her vagina, and swabbing her cervix. That’s what happened as a result of [M.H.] telling her mom what [Lynch] did to her.\n\n(Tr. 1284.) The prosecutor continued, ‘[a]t the hospital [M.H.] says who did this to her. Cornelius Lynch. And [Dr. Keith Lim] puts her in the stirrups, and he has her spread her legs. He has to insert a speculum into a child, all things [M.H.] had to endure for telling people what [Lynch] did to her[.]’ (Tr. 1287.)\n\n{¶38} Lynch argues that ‘[t]here was no proper reason, no justification for [the prosecutor’s] gratuitous statements to the jury. [The statements’] purpose, their only purpose, was to inflame, to prejudice, to create sympathy for M.H. And that is an improper purpose.’ Appellant’s brief at 8. We disagree.\n\n{¶39} Initially, we note that defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor’s statements about the rape kit examination procedure. Accordingly, Lynch has waived the issue on appeal except for plain error. Pate, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 95382, 2011-Ohio-1692, at ¶ 21, citing State v. Owens, 51 Ohio App.2d 132, 146, 366 N.E.2d 1367 (9th Dist.1975). Accord State v. Harris, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104329, 2017-Ohio-2751, ¶ 83. Under Crim.R. 52(B), ‘[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.’ Moreover, ‘[p]lain error does not exist unless, but for the error, the outcome at trial would have been different.’ State v. Joseph, 73 Ohio St.3d 450, 455, 653 N.E.2d 285 (1995), citing State v. Moreland, 50 Ohio St.3d 58, 552 N.E.2d 894 (1990).\n\n{¶40} One of the defense’s theories of the case was that M.H. made up the allegations against Lynch because she did not want her mother to marry him. On direct examination, Lynch testified that there was stress and tension in the home, both before and after M.H. alleged that he raped her. He explained that S.P.’s children did not care for him, did not want him in the home, and wanted S.P. to be with their father. During closing arguments, defense counsel stated that when S.P. took M.H. to the hospital, S.P. told the doctors that she was sure that M.H. made up the allegations against Lynch ‘because [her children] want [S.P.] to get back with their natural father[.]’ (Tr. 1304-1305.) Defense counsel further explained that while S.P. was going to marry Lynch, her children did not want him around and wanted him out of the house.\n\n{¶41} After reviewing the record and the purportedly improper remarks in context, we cannot say that prosecution’s comments about the rape kit examination procedure were improper. The prosecutor’s comments about the rape kit examination procedure were made to rebut the defense’s theory that M.H. fabricated the allegations and to support the prosecution’s theory that Lynch did, in fact, rape M.H. Furthermore, the prosecutor’s comments were supported by evidence in the record.\n\n{¶42} M.H. testified that her mother took her to the hospital where an examination was performed ‘[i]n [her] vagina area.’ (Tr. 1066.) Dr. Lim testified that he conducted M.H.’s rape kit examination and he described the procedure in detail. Based on this evidence, the prosecutor reasonably inferred that M.H. would not assent to or endure an invasive rape kit examination if she made up the allegations. The prosecutor’s comments fairly represented the state’s interpretation of the evidence that it presented during trial, and the prosecutor is entitled to latitude to argue the state’s interpretation of the evidence. See State v. Ketterer, 111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, ¶ 172.\n\n{¶43} Finally, the trial court instructed the jury that it must decide the case based on the evidence presented and that ‘closing arguments do not constitute evidence.’ (Tr. 1322.) We presume that the jury heeded the trial court’s instructions. State v. Leonard, 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, ¶ 157."}

Because there was no manifest necessity for the trial court to grant a mistrial, the constitutional protection against being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense required that the charges against [Lynch] be dismissed.", "extracted_text": "The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, protects a criminal defendant from multiple prosecutions for the same offense. Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 671, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982). The Double Jeopardy Clause does not, however, bar reprosecution in every case. Where a defendant requests a mistrial, double jeopardy does not bar a retrial unless the defendant’s request for a mistrial is precipitated by prosecutorial misconduct intended to provoke a defendant into seeking a mistrial. *N. Olmsted v. Himes*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 84076 and 84078, 2004-Ohio-4241, ¶ 36-37.\n\nIn the instant matter, we initially find no merit to Lynch’s assertion that he explicitly objected to the trial court declaring a mistrial. In fact, the record reflects that defense counsel requested a mistrial after the foreperson informed the trial court about the issues that arose with Juror 7: ‘Your Honor, I would — I think we’re in a position now — with the alternate being excused yesterday, I think we’re in the same position we would be in with a hung jury, and I would request a mistrial.’ (Tr. 518.) Defense counsel reiterated this request while the trial court was polling the individual jurors about these issues: ‘Your Honor, we’re asking for a mistrial.’ (Tr. 552.)\n\nLynch appeared to disagree with defense counsel’s request for a mistrial. When counsel stated that the defense was asking for a mistrial, Lynch asserted, ‘[n]o, no, we’re not.’ (Tr. 553.) In his appellate brief, Lynch appears to suggest that this statement demonstrates that he wanted to proceed with 11 jurors.\n\nIt is well established that ‘although a defendant has the right to counsel or the right to act pro se, a defendant does not have any right to ‘hybrid representation.’’ *State v. Mongo*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100926, 2015-Ohio-1139, ¶ 13, quoting *State v. Martin*, 103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, ¶ 29. This court has explained, ‘when counsel represents a criminal defendant, a trial court may not entertain a defendant’s pro se motion.’ *Mongo* at ¶ 14.\nLynch was represented by counsel in the first prosecution, and thus, the trial court could not entertain Lynch’s pro se objection to granting a mistrial. Furthermore, when the trial court declared a mistrial, neither defense counsel nor Lynch objected. Lynch does not argue nor does the record indicate that the state invited a mistrial. Accordingly, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a second prosecution.\n\nAssuming, arguendo, that Lynch objected to a mistrial, the record reflects that a manifest necessity existed for the mistrial.\n\nWhere a defendant objects to a mistrial, the defendant may be retried if ‘manifest necessity’ exists for the mistrial, State v. Gunnell, 132 Ohio St.3d 442, 2012-Ohio-3236, 973 N.E.2d 243, ¶ 25, or if ‘the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.’ State v. Glover, 35 Ohio St.3d 18, 19, 517 N.E.2d 900, quoting State v. Widner, 68 Ohio St.2d 188, 189, 429 N.E.2d 1065 (1981), citing [Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 505, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978)].\n\n‘Manifest necessity’ means a ‘high degree’ of necessity must exist before a mistrial may properly be declared. However, it does not require a showing that a mistrial was ‘absolutely necessary’ or that there was no other alternative but to declare a mistrial. Washington at 511.\n\nThere is no ‘mechanical formula’ for determining what constitutes a ‘manifest necessity’ for a mistrial: ‘[T]he manifest-necessity standard ‘abjures the application of any mechanical formula by which to judge the propriety of declaring a mistrial in the varying and often unique situations arising during the course of a criminal trial.’’ Gunnell at ¶ 27, quoting Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U.S. 458, 462, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973). What constitutes a manifest necessity for a mistrial is, therefore, left to the discretion of the trial court to be decided on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all the relevant circumstances.\n\nState v. Marshall, 2014-Ohio-4677, 22 N.E.3d 207, ¶ 21-22 (8th Dist.).\n\nLynch argues that there was no manifest necessity for the trial court to declare a mistrial. In support of his argument, Lynch suggests that although the alternate juror had been discharged, the alternate could have been brought back. Lynch asserts that the trial court failed to investigate the possibility of bringing back the alternate. These arguments are unsupported\nby the record.\n\nThe record reflects that the trial court made multiple attempts to reach the alternate juror. The jury commissioner attempted to contact the alternate juror, left the alternate a voicemail, and told the alternate to return the phone call. (Tr. 520.) Before declaring a mistrial, the trial court stated, ‘I would like to see if the alternate is available,’ and ‘I’m going to * * * see if we can get ahold of the alternate, if the alternate is available.’ (Tr. 530, 566.) When the trial court declared a mistrial, it explained, ‘we don’t have the alternate here to replace [Juror 7] with an alternate. It’s my understanding the alternate was discharged from jury service yesterday after the Court had let the alternate go from this trial, prior to this jury’s deliberations.’ (Tr. 571.)\n\nAfter review, we find that the trial court acted reasonably in determining that a manifest necessity existed for the declaration of a mistrial. The record reflects that the trial court exercised sound discretion in determining that Juror 7 was unable to follow the court’s instructions and perform his duty. After learning about the issues that arose with Juror 7, the trial court conducted a thorough inquiry, questioning the foreperson, Juror 7, and each juror separately. The trial court permitted defense counsel and the prosecution to question the jurors as well. Furthermore, before deciding to discharge Juror 7 or declare a mistrial, the trial court made multiple attempts to reach the alternate juror. The trial court only declared a mistrial after determining that (1) the jury would not be able to reach a fair and just resolution in the case with Juror 7 on the panel and (2) the alternate juror could not be reached. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by determining that there was a manifest necessity to declare a mistrial."}

At that time, she said that she had met Powell at a K-Mart, rather than a convenience store. She omitted smoking marijuana with him. She described the passenger in Powell’s car as a black man. She also stated that Powell had raped her in the car. D.E. admitted in her trial testimony that she lied to the police because she did not want her father to know that she had smoked marijuana, because she felt it was her fault, and because she just wanted everything to go away.\n\n4 Although in 2007, the police had obtained a hit that Powell’s DNA matched the DNA from D.E.’s rape kit, an interview with D.E. was not arranged until April 2015. In a blind administration of a photo array, D.E. identified Powell with 100% certainty as the man who raped her. A cold-case investigator interviewed Powell in a North Carolina prison in August 2015. He said that he did not remember D.E., but in 1997 he was taking a lot of drugs and did not remember much. He also consented to buccal swabs for further DNA testing. This testing confirmed that Powell was the sole contributor for seminal fluid found on D.E.’s underwear.\n\n6 A.W. gave the following testimony at the January 2018 trial. On November 16, 1998, A.W. was a fifteen-year-old girl. On that date, as she was walking to school, a two-door car driven by a man she knew from the neighborhood pulled up beside her. A dark-skinned man with dreadlocks was in the passenger seat. While she was talking to the driver, the passenger pulled her into the car. She further testified that she remembers the car heading east and stopping at a large house, but she also believed that she was drugged, because she remembers waking up in the house, in which there were a lot of people, a lot of noise, and a lot of drug activity. When she woke up, the driver, the man she knew, was raping her. A.W. testified that when she woke up later, she was alone in a room. She was able to put on her clothes and leave the house. She then went to a telephone and called her grandparents, who came and drove her to a hospital, where a rape kit was collected. A.W. further testified that Carlin Powell was the man she knew from the neighborhood and who raped her.\n\n7 As elicited on cross-examination, A.W. gave a different version of events to the police at the hospital on November 18, 1998. She was at a convenient store to get change for a bus ride to school, when a four-door car with four men pulled up beside her. She said it had a New Orleans license plate, with seat cushions and cigarette burns. A man did pull her into the car, and she gave a more explicit version of the drive. When they arrived at the house, the four men stripped her and took turns raping her. When she was able to leave, she took a bus to Tower City before her grandparents took her to the hospital."}

If the indictment is not brought to trial within that time period, the trial court shall enter an order dismissing the indictment with prejudice. Powell’s request for final disposition was docketed with the trial court on March 15, 2016. His trial started on January 22, 2018, clearly more than 180 days after the time began to run.

The prosecutor asked a prospective juror if the puzzle was an image of the Statue of Liberty, and the juror had about 20 percent of the puzzle complete, would the prospective juror know that it was the Statue of Liberty. The prospective juror replied in the affirmative. The prosecutor then continued by then talking about a puzzle that depicted the prosecutor, noting that the juror did not know her and that “[y]ou’d probably need 90% of it.” The prosecutor said that “that example is what I like to use for reasonable doubt, because there is no percentage that we can put on reasonable doubt. I wish I could but we can’t. Sometimes you need 20% or 40%, sometimes you need 90% of it, and it’s okay.” The prosecutor concluded by noting that “it’s not absolute certainty,” telling the prospective juror that “[t]he judge will instruct you that it’s not absolute certainty,” and asking the prospective juror not to hold her to the standard of absolute certainty."}

Ricks, 136 Ohio St.3d 356, 2013-Ohio-3712, 995 N.E.2d 1181. But Ricks doesn’t apply here.\n\nRicks was a case involving the admission of statements made to law enforcement officers that were repeated by officers during their testimony. The argument for allowing the statements made to the officers had been that they were not being offered for the truth of the matters asserted, but rather for the purpose of explaining why the investigation proceeded in the manner that it did. Id. at ¶ 20.\nTherefore, the statements were not hearsay. *Id.*, citing *State v. Thomas*, 61 Ohio St.2d 223, 232, 400 N.E.2d 401 (1980).

The weapon was not discharged during the incident, and no weapon was recovered.\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court has addressed the level of proof required to meet the burden of proof regarding the operability of a firearm.\n\nIn determining whether an individual was in possession of a firearm and whether the firearm was operable or capable of being readily rendered operable at the time of the offense, the trier of fact may consider all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the crime, which include any implicit threat made by the individual in control of the firearm. *State v.

Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of fact and law. The trial court, acting as the trier of fact, is in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate witness credibility. Therefore, we must accept the facts as found by the trial court as long as they are supported by competent, credible evidence. See State v. Burnside, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, ¶ 8. We must independently review, however, the trial court’s legal conclusions based on the facts to determine whether, as a matter of law, the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard. Id.; see State v. Billups, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150500, 2017-Ohio-4309, ¶ 5. Martin argues that the one-person arrest-scene show-up in which Rickman, Cannon, and Johnson identified him was impermissibly suggestive. Martin challenges as suggestive the fact that he was the only suspect presented at the show-up, he was in handcuffs in the back seat of a police cruiser, and the police failed to resort to less suggestive means like a more traditional lineup. He further contends that the identifications were unreliable under the totality of the circumstances. He maintains that none of witnesses' observations satisfy the factors set forth in Neil v.

Although DiPuccio could not identify Martin as his attacker, Rickman, Cannon, and Johnson each identified Martin as the attacker both before the trial and at the trial. They each testified that they had witnessed Martin attack DiPuccio with a knife, cutting and stabbing him multiple times in the head, face, and body. They then saw Martin walk down the sidewalk and down an alley. Rickman and Johnson called 911 during the attack. Their calls were admitted into evidence and played for the jury. During his 911 call, Johnson stated that he was following Martin so he could alert police to his whereabouts. Johnson can be heard on the 911 call telling the security officers to apprehend Martin. Contrary to Martin's assertions, Johnson testified at trial that he never lost sight of Martin and he was confident that Martin was the perpetrator of the offenses. Rickman, Cannon, and Johnson individually identified Martin as the perpetrator within 30 minutes of the offenses. Rickman's and Johnson's descriptions of the perpetrator's clothing at trial were consistent with the descriptions they had provided on the 911 calls. All three eye witnesses' descriptions were consistent with a photograph of Martin that had been taken the day of the offenses. Each testified unequivocally that Martin had been the perpetrator. The police apprehended Martin at the back of the building where DiPuccio had been attacked. Machol testified that she had seen a man matching Martin's description bend down near her vehicle in the parking lot behind the Taft building. The police recovered a skull cap in the alley, and two knives, one in the alley near the dumpster and one under Machol's car. DiPuccio, Rickman, Cannon, and Johnson identified the larger knife that had been recovered under Machol's vehicle as the knife that Martin had used to cut and stab DiPuccio. We hold that the state presented sufficient evidence to prove Martin guilty of attempted murder and tampering with the evidence."}

Martin contends that defense counsel was unprepared to go to trial and should have sought a continuance at the outset of the trial to determine whether he wanted to testify at the trial. Martin asserts that the result of his trial would have been different had defense counsel communicated more thoroughly with him and been more prepared for trial. We disagree.\n\nTo prevail on his claim of the ineffective assistance of trial counsel, Martin “must show that [his] counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness” and that he was prejudiced by counsel's deficient performance. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Prejudice is demonstrated by showing “that there is a reasonable probability that, but for * * * [the] errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Id. at 694. Both prongs of the test must be\nmet to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel. *Id.* at 697; *see State v. Bradley*, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\nMartin’s claims of ineffectiveness are belied by the record. Martin was represented by two attorneys during the trial. Just prior to the start of the trial, they told the court that they had discussed with Martin both orally and by way of a written letter the state’s offer of a plea deal with an eight-year prison sentence, and they had told Martin that if he proceeded to trial and was found guilty of all the offenses that he could be sentenced to 14 years in prison, but Martin had stated that he wanted to reject the plea deal and proceed to trial.\n\nDefense counsel told the court that they had worked hard on the case, but that they were at a disadvantage, not because of their efforts, but because Martin would not share factual information about the case with them and would not tell them if he wanted to testify at trial. One defense counsel told the court that he had reminded Martin that his case had been pending for two years and 134 days and that time was of the essence with the impending trial.\n\nThe trial court questioned Martin about defense attorneys’ impression of the case, including the potential consequences of proceeding to trial, and asked Martin if he still desired to have his case tried to a jury. Martin told the court that he wanted new attorneys. The trial court denied his request, reminding Martin that it had denied his request for attorneys the day before. The trial court told Martin that he had four prior attorneys, his current defense counsel knew what they were doing and they were zealously representing him. Martin told the court that he still wanted to proceed to trial.\n\nFollowing the presentation of the state’s witnesses and the trial court’s denial of his Crim.R. 29 motion, defense counsel informed the trial court on the\nrecord that they were not going to present any evidence. Defense counsel then asked Martin if he had confidence in his attorneys’ representation. Martin responded affirmatively. Defense counsel told the court that Martin had changed his mind and did not wish to testify. Counsel told the court that they had explained to Martin that it was certainly his 100 percent right to testify or not testify, and that Martin had decided not to testify. When asked by defense counsel if that was correct, Martin responded affirmatively. Immediately thereafter, in the presence of the jury, the defense rested without presenting evidence."}

See R.C. 2929.14(A). With respect to the trial court’s imposition of consecutive sentences, the trial court must engage in a three-step analysis and make certain findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). The court must find that the consecutive sentences are necessary either to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender; the imposition of consecutive sentences is not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and the danger he poses to the public; and at least one of the conditions listed in R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(a)-(c) applies. In State v. Bonnell, 140 Ohio St.3d 209, 2014-Ohio-3177, 16 N.E.3d 659, syllabus, the Ohio Supreme Court held that when a trial court imposes consecutive sentences, it must not only announce the requisite consecutive-sentencing findings at the sentencing hearing, but it must also incorporate those findings into the sentencing entry. The trial court is not required to provide a 'word-for-word' recitation of the language or to provide reasons to support the findings, as long as the reviewing court can discern that the trial court engaged in the correct analysis and can determine that the record contains evidence to support the findings. *Id.* at ¶ 29. Despite Martin’s assertions to the contrary, the record reflects that the trial court complied with *Bonnell*. At the sentencing hearing, the trial court orally announced the necessary findings for consecutive sentences. It stated that consecutive prison terms were necessary to protect the public from future crime and punish Martin for the offenses and were not disproportionate to the seriousness of his conduct and the danger he posed to the public, and 'his criminal conduct and criminal history demonstrated consecutive sentences were necessary to protect the public from future crime.' The trial court additionally stated that Martin’s 'failure to recognize his conduct [or] show remorse was alarming.' The trial court was not required to give any reasons to support its findings. *See State v. McGee*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150496, 2016-Ohio-7510, ¶ 32, citing *Bonnell* at syllabus.

Appellant also argues that his counsel was ineffective because he did not renew his motion to sever count two at the close of the evidence in this case. Had Appellant renewed his motion to sever at the close of the evidence, our standard in reviewing Appellant’s first assignment of error would have been abuse of discretion, as opposed to plain error. But, even under an abuse of discretion standard of review, we find that the outcome of Appellant’s motion to sever would not have changed because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant’s motion to sever. The trial court’s denial was not an abuse of discretion because Appellant did not sustain his burden of proving that a failure to sever would result in prejudice to him, and even assuming arguendo the trial court’s denial of Appellant’s motion to sever would result in prejudice, any such prejudice was negated because there was evidence ‘amply sufficient to sustain each verdict,’ and the evidence supporting the charges was direct and simple. In other words, but for counsel's error, the result of the proceeding would not have been different, and absent such prejudice, Appellant’s claim for ineffective assistance of counsel fails.

The Law\n\na. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n¶68 “When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction, an appellate court's role is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether the evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Simms, 165 Ohio App.3d 83, 86, 844 N.E.2d 1212 (4th Dist. 2005), ¶ 9, citing State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. The question is “whether, after\nviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.” *Id.*, citing *Jenks*. In a sufficiency review, the reviewing court does not “weigh the evidence.” *Id.*\n\nb. Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n\n{¶69} In a manifest-weight-of-the-evidence review, the court examines “the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses, and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.” *State v. Simms*, 165 Ohio App.3d 83, 844 N.E.2d 1212, ¶ 17 (4th Dist. 2005), citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. However, “[i]n making this review, the appellate court must be mindful that the original trier of fact was in the best position to judge the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given the evidence.” *Simms* at ¶ 18, citing *State v. DeHass*, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus (1967). “‘A reviewing court will not reverse a conviction where there is substantial evidence upon which the court could reasonably conclude that all the elements of an offense have been proven\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.’ ” Simms, at ¶ 19 quoting State v. Eskridge, 38 Ohio St.3d 56, 526 N.E.2d 304, paragraph two of the syllabus (1988).\n\n2. Criminal Convictions\n\na. Rape\n\nR.C. 2907.02 provides:\n\n(A)(1) No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another who is not the spouse of the offender or who is the spouse of the offender but is living separate and apart from the offender, when any of the following applies:\n\n* * *\n\n(b) The other person is less than thirteen years of age, whether or not the offender knows the age of the other person. (Emphasis added.)\n\nR.C. 2907.01(A) provides:\n\n“Sexual conduct” means vaginal intercourse between a male and female; anal intercourse, fellatio, and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex; and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of the body or any instrument, apparatus, or other object into the vaginal or anal opening of another.\nPenetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal or anal intercourse. (Emphasis added.)\n\n¶71 Appellant questions A.C.’s credibility and argues that even if she can be believed, her testimony can only prove sexual contact, as opposed to sexual conduct, which is required for rape because her testimony did not allege penetration.\n\n¶72 The State argues that the physical evidence of injury to A.C.’s genital area, including her hymen, as well as the testimonial evidence identifying Appellant as the assailant, was sufficient to support Appellant’s conviction and to show that his conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n¶73 Under a sufficiency review, with regard to whether penetration occurred, there is at least some evidence that Appellant’s thumb penetrated A.C.’s vagina and there is a significant amount of evidence that A.C. suffered physical injuries to her genital area, including “abrasions, redness, and swelling in her vaginal area, and her hymen was “beefy red in appearance and swollen,” which was “not normal.” Further, there was male DNA recovered from A.C.’s genital area. Finally, A.C. identified Appellant as the perpetrator. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that any rational trier of fact could have found the\nessential elements of the rape, including sexual conduct (i.e. penetration), beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n{¶74} With regard to the manifest weight of the evidence review, there is testimonial evidence that Appellant merely “touched” A.C. over clothing in her genital area, but there is also evidence that Appellant put his thumb “in” A.C.’s vagina. A.C. initially identified the perpetrator as a man named Peter, but later identified Appellant as the perpetrator. However, the physical injuries suffered by A.C. are undisputed and support more than an innocent touching of A.C.’s vagina. After carefully considering this critical evidence, as well as the remainder of the record, weighing the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considering the credibility of witnesses, and resolving those conflicts in the evidence, we conclude that the jury did not clearly lose its way so as to create a manifest miscarriage of justice that Appellant’s conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\n\n{¶75} Accordingly, we reject Appellant’s argument that his rape conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence, or is against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nb. Illegal Use of a Minor in Nudity-Oriented Material\n\n{¶76} Appellant was convicted of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material under R.C. 2907.323(A)(3), which provides that “No\nperson shall do any of the following: “* * * Possess or view any material or performance that shows a minor or impaired person who is not the person's child or ward in a state of nudity, unless” one of the enumerated exceptions applies, which are not applicable in this case. (Emphasis added.)\n\n{¶77} Appellant argues the State failed to prove that the images found on his PS3 were minors, and therefore his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence and is against the manifest weight of the evidence. In response, the State argues that the age of the persons in the images found was a question of fact for the jury to determine.\n\n{¶78} Although R.C. 2907.323 does not define “minor,” under Ohio law, a minor is anyone under 18 years of age. R.C. 3109.01. “Where the title, the text, the visual representation, and other factors gleaned from the material or performance represent or depict the person as a minor, the trier of fact may infer that the person is an actual minor.” State v. Kraft, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-060238, 2007-Ohio-2247, ¶ 88.\n\n{¶79} The jury was apparently able to view the images from Appellant’s PS3. Further, the evidence shows that some of the images are titled “Teen Panty Pics,” and the websites visited include “Teen Fuck Hardcore,” “Free Hardcore Teen,” “Free Teen Russian,” “X Videos Porn at Ultra Young Sex,” etc. We find that there was sufficient evidence to support\nAppellant’s conviction from which the jury could infer that Appellant possessed images of minors.\n\n{¶80} Furthermore, after weighing the evidence and considering all reasonable inferences, we find that there is substantial evidence upon which the court could reasonably conclude that the persons in the images are minors. Therefore, we also find that Appellant’s convictions for illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n{¶81} Accordingly, we reject Appellant’s argument that his conviction for illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material is not supported by sufficient evidence, or is against the weight of the evidence.\n\nc. Kidnapping\n\n{¶82} The State charged Appellant with kidnapping under R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), which provides that:\n\nNo person, by force, threat, or deception, or, in the case of a victim under the age of thirteen or mentally incompetent, by any means, shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, for any of the following purposes: * * * (4) To engage in sexual activity, as\ndefined in section 2907.01 of the Revised Code, with the victim against the victim's will * * *.\n\n{¶83} Appellant argues that there is no evidence that A.C.’s liberty was restrained. In response, the State argues that the apparent bruising, and that the “touching” by Appellant, is evidence that A.C. was restrained during the rape.\n\n{¶84} Initially, we note that we have already held that Appellant’s rape convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence, and “by definition, inherent in every act of rape is a kidnapping offense.” State v. Stewart, 4th Dist. Ross No. 44331, 1982 WL 5952, at *5. Moreover, we agree with the State that the bruising could be considered evidence of restraint that occurred during the rape.\n\n{¶85} Therefore, we find that there is sufficient evidence to support Appellant’s kidnapping conviction, and in reviewing the entire record, we do not find that the jury lost its way so as to create a manifest injustice justifying a reversal of his kidnapping conviction. Accordingly, we reject Appellant’s arguments that his kidnapping convictions are not supported by sufficient evidence or are against the weight of the evidence.\n\nd. Endangering Children\nAppellant was convicted of endangering children under R.C. 2919.22 (A), which in pertinent part provides: “No person, who is * * * in loco parentis of a child under eighteen years of age * * * shall create a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child, by violating a duty of care, protection, or support * * *.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nAppellant argues that there is no evidence he was in loco parentis to A.C., and therefore he could not be charged with endangering children. Appellant argues that as merely Sheri Trout’s live-in boyfriend, he was not in loco parentis to A.C.\n\nIn response, the State argues that there is evidence that Sheri Trout had a visitation order and Appellant lived in the same house when A.C. would come to visit. The State argues that A.C. suffered trauma as the result of inaction by Sheri and the action of Appellant.\n\nR.C. 2919.22 does not define the term “in loco parentis.” However, the Supreme Court has defined the term “in loco parentis” as being “charged, factitiously, with a parent's rights, duties, and responsibilities.” State v. Noggle, 67 Ohio St.3d 31, 33, 1993-Ohio-189, 615 N.E.2d 1040, citing Black's Law Dictionary (6th Ed.1990) 787, superseded by statute on other grounds. “A person in loco parentis has assumed the same duties as a guardian or custodian, only not through a legal proceeding.”\nId.\n\n¶90 Appellant was not married to Sheri. He was merely her live-in boyfriend, which does not, in and of itself, create an *in loco parentis* relationship with A.C. And the State points us to no evidence in the record indicating that Appellant was “charged, factitiously with parental rights, duties, and responsibilities” regarding A.C.\n\n¶91 Accordingly, we find that even viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, no rational trier of fact could have found that Appellant was *in loco parentis*, and therefore absent evidence of that required element, a jury could not convict Appellant of endangering children. Therefore, we sustain Appellant’s argument that there was insufficient evidence supporting his conviction for endangering children.\n\ne. Intimidation of a Victim\n\n¶92 Appellant was convicted of intimidating a witness under R.C. 2921.04(B)(1), which provides, “No person, knowingly and by force or by unlawful threat of harm to any person or property or by unlawful threat to commit any offense or calumny against any person, shall attempt to influence, intimidate, or hinder * * * the victim of a crime * * * in the filing or prosecution of criminal charges * * *.”\nAppellant argues that even if A.C. believed that Appellant told her to lie and say that Peter assaulted her, there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction for intimidation of a witness. Appellant argues that there is no evidence that Appellant attempted to prevent A.C. from filing charges. Therefore, he argues, there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction.\n\nIn response, the State argues that there is evidence of intimidation in that Appellant had hit A.C. in the past. The State argues that the impact of Appellant’s abuse, as well as telling A.C. to lie, is evident.\n\nIn State v. Muniz, the Eighth District Court of Appeals found that “where a defendant is charged with intimidation of a ‘victim of crime,’ an essential element of the charge is that the underlying crime occurred and thus created a victim.” Muniz, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 93528, 2010-Ohio-3720, ¶ 20. As such, the court reasoned that Muniz was “entitled to notice of the predicate crime in the indictment” because “[t]he charge of intimidation of a crime victim presupposes an earlier crime has been committed.” Id. at ¶ 19-20 (also explaining that these types of cases are “analogous to cases in which a defendant is charged with a crime that has its foundation on unindicted predicate acts”). Finding that “the record [was] unclear as to the nature of the predicate offense[,]” the Muniz court ultimately held that “[t]he\nstate’s failure to give notice of the underlying predicate acts in the indictment [rendered] it defective from the outset, and therefore fatal to her conviction.” *Id.* at ¶ 21, 23.\n\n{¶96} Nine years later, the Eighth District Court of Appeals revisited this issue in an en banc decision involving the crime of intimidation of a witness, as opposed to intimidation of a victim. *State v. Sanders*, 2019-Ohio-2566, -- N.E.3d --. The court reversed course somewhat, holding that “the fact that an underlying criminal or delinquent act occurred is not an essential element of the crime of intimidation of a witness.” *Id.* at ¶ 5. In reaching its decision, the court reviewed its prior holding in *Muniz*, noting that in *Muniz* it was not clear from the record that an underlying criminal act had occurred or the nature of the criminal act. *Id.* at ¶ 17. The *Sanders* court qualified its decision with respect to its prior holding in *Muniz*, stating as follows:\n\nNothing in this en banc opinion shall be construed to undermine the holding of *Muniz*, with respect to notice requirements. We maintain that a defendant is entitled to adequate notice of the crimes against which they must defend themself.\n\n*Sanders* at ¶ 8.\nUltimately, the Sanders court held that “[a charge of intimidation does not require a conviction on the underlying offense.” Id. at ¶ 9. However, the court explained that the State must prove as follows:\n\nA charge of intimidation does not require a conviction on the underlying offense. Had that been the legislature’s intent, it could easily have used the words “criminal conviction” or “delinquent adjudication” rather than “criminal or delinquent act.” Instead, the state need only prove that the intimidation victim had knowledge about a fact or facts concerning the underlying criminal or delinquent act, and that the defendant knowingly and by force or threat of harm intimidated the victim because of the victim’s knowledge of facts concerning the matter.\n\nId.\n\nIn support of its reasoning, the court stated as follows:\n\nWhile a defendant must be apprised of the nature of the underlying criminal or delinquent act, that act is not a separate element of the offense that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In holding that the occurrence of the underlying act is an essential element\nof intimidation, this court imposed an unworkable burden on the state. In making a case for intimidation, a prosecutor is not required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the predicate act occurred. Such a requirement, particularly in cases where the underlying offense may have been committed by someone other than the defendant in the intimidation case, would require a trial within a trial that we do not believe was intended or contemplated by the legislature in enacting R.C. 2921.04.\n\nId.\n\n¶99 Here, there was no evidence in the record and nothing in the indictment indicating a crime had occurred at the time Appellant allegedly intimidated the victim. More specifically, there is no evidence indicating at times Appellant may have “hit” the child in the “past” or that any criminal act related to the current case had occurred yet. Furthermore, telling A.C. to lie does not constitute intimidation of a victim of a crime.\n\n¶100 Therefore, even after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that any rational trier of fact could not have found that there was evidence of a “threat of harm” to influence or intimidate A.C. pertaining to the charges against Appellant. Accordingly,\nwe sustain Appellant’s argument that his conviction for intimidating a victim is not supported by sufficient evidence."}

Smith, 49 Ohio St.3d 137, 140 (1990). However, Evid.R. 404(B) permits other-acts evidence for other purposes, including but not limited to the purposes identified in the rule. Id. See also Morris at ¶ 13. The rule provides that \"[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\" Evid.R. 404(B). See also R.C. 2945.59.\n\n¶ 29 \"Another consideration permitting the admission of certain other-acts evidence is whether the other acts 'form part of the immediate background of the alleged act which forms the foundation of the crime charged in the indictment' and are 'inextricably related' to the crime.\" Morris at ¶ 13, quoting State v. Curry, 43 Ohio St.2d 66, 73 (1975). Thus, \"[e]vidence of other crimes may be presented when\" those crimes tend \"logically to prove any element of the crime charged.\" State v. Horsley, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-350, 2006-Ohio-1208, ¶ 24.\n\n¶ 30 To determine the admissibility of the other-acts evidence, a court must first \"consider whether the other acts evidence is relevant to making any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, ¶ 20, citing Evid.R. 401. Second, a court must \"consider whether evidence of the other crimes, wrongs, or acts is presented to prove the character of the accused in order to show activity in conformity therewith or whether the other acts evidence is presented for a legitimate purpose, such as those stated in Evid.R. 404(B).\" Id. Finally, the court must \"consider\nwhether the probative value of the other acts evidence is substantially outweighed by the\ndanger of unfair prejudice.\" *Id.*, citing Evid.R. 403.\n\n{¶ 31} A number of the rape charges at issue charged appellant pursuant to R.C.\n2907.02(A)(2), which provides that \"[n]o person shall engage in sexual conduct with\nanother when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat\nof force.\" \"Force\" is defined as \"any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted\nby any means upon or against a person or thing.\" R.C. 2901.01(A)(1).\n\n{¶ 32} To prove the force element of a sexual offense, the state must establish force\nbeyond that force inherent in the crime itself. *State v. Griffith*, 10th Dist. No. 05AP-1042,\n2006-Ohio-6983, ¶ 17, citing *State v. Dye*, 82 Ohio St.3d 323 (1998). However, the \"force\nand violence necessary to commit the crime of rape depends upon the age, size and strength\nof the parties and their relation to each other.\" *State v. Eskridge*, 38 Ohio St.3d 56 (1988),\nparagraph one of the syllabus. In cases involving parents or stepparents sexually abusing\ntheir children, the force \" 'need not be overt or physically brutal, but can be subtle and\npsychological. As long as it can be shown that the rape victim's will was overcome by fear\nor duress, the forcible element of rape can be established.' \" *Id.* at 58-59, quoting *State v.\nFowler*, 27 Ohio App.3d 149, 154 (8th Dist.1985). *See also Griffith* at ¶ 17; *Dye* at 326.\n*Compare State v. Schaim*, 65 Ohio St.3d 51 (1992), paragraph one of the syllabus.\n\n{¶ 33} Thus, evidence of a defendant's prior acts of violence may demonstrate why\na victim's will was overcome by their fear of the defendant, and thereby establish the force\nelement of a rape charge. *See State v. Williamson*, 8th Dist. No. 80982, 2002-Ohio-6503,\n¶ 23 (noting the \"evidence of the physical violence that occurred in the household [was]\nrelevant to and probative of the method of control used by defendant to rape and sexually\nabuse the victim\"); *State v. Jordan*, 2d Dist. No. 26163, 2016-Ohio-603, ¶ 21 (holding that\nthe \"other-acts evidence\" of the defendant's violent acts was \"relevant to the element of\nforce\"); *State v. Scott*, 5th Dist. No. 11CA80, 2012-Ohio-3482, ¶ 28-29 (noting the evidence\nindicating that the defendant killed the victim's baby sister \"was offered to show the victim's\nstate of mind; * * * and why she was in fear of [defendant],\" and thus was not \"improper\npropensity evidence, but instead tend[ed] to show an element of the crime [of rape], force\").\n\n{¶ 34} N.F. explained he did not want to engage in the sexual acts with appellant,\nbut stated he \"never questioned what\" appellant told him to do, because if he questioned\nappellant that \"results to physical violence or physical abuse.\" (Tr. Vol. II 108.) Thus, the physical abuse evidence demonstrated N.F.'s will was overcome by his fear of appellant, and explained why N.F. did not resist appellant's demands for sexual activity.\n\n{¶ 35} Additionally, during N.F.'s testimony, the court provided the jury with the following limiting instruction:\n\nLet me just advise you that I have permitted testimony on the direct examination of this witness dealing with alleged prior bad acts on behalf of the [appellant] in this case. I did not admit that evidence to show that [appellant], if he did commit a bad act before, he acted in conformance with that action with respect to [N.F.] and the matters that you are to decide, the sexual-related offenses.\n\nBut I have permitted that to be introduced for the purpose of showing [N.F.'s] state of mind and whether he was fearful of [appellant]. So you can only consider it for that purpose and that purpose only.\n\n(Tr. Vol. II at 69-70.)\n\n{¶ 36} We presume the jury followed the court's instruction. State v. Jones, 135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, ¶ 194. Appellant argues the trial court's failure to reiterate the limiting instruction when other witnesses testified to the physical abuse, or to reiterate the instruction in the final jury instructions, amounts to plain error. Although \" 'the failure to give any limiting instruction constitutes plain error,' \" here the trial court did provide the jury with a limiting instruction the first time the other-acts evidence was presented. State v. Shaw, 2d Dist. No. 21880, 2008-Ohio-1317, ¶ 13, quoting State v. Tisdale, 2d Dist. No. 19346, 2003-Ohio-4209, ¶ 47 (noting that \" '[t]he limiting instruction should be given at the time the \"other acts\" evidence is received' \"). Accordingly, we do not find plain error.\n\n{¶ 37} The evidence of physical abuse was relevant to a fact of consequence, as it established the force element of the rape charges. Williams at ¶ 20. The evidence was not presented to prove appellant acted in conformity therewith, and the court instructed the jury the evidence was not to be used for that purpose. Id. The probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, and any danger of unfair prejudice was reduced by the court's limiting instruction. Id. at ¶ 24.\nAppellant further argues that, even if N.F.'s testimony of the physical abuse was admissible, the additional evidence from L.A., C.A.W., and children services caseworkers regarding the physical abuse deprived him of a fair trial. However, appellant testified N.F. had lied about all of the sexual abuse allegations. The testimony from the other witnesses corroborated N.F.'s testimony regarding the physical abuse and, thus, served to bolster N.F.'s credibility. Evidence which impeaches or bolsters witness credibility \"is of consequence to the action because it might determine whether the jury believes a particular witness.\" State v. Moore, 40 Ohio St.3d 63, 65 (1988).\n\nMoreover, appellant admitted his methods of disciplining N.F. constituted physical abuse. In closing, defense counsel relied on the fact that appellant \"freely told\" the jury that \"his methods of disciplining [N.F.] were not good,\" to bolster appellant's credibility. (Tr. Vol. V at 94.) The defense also argued the years of physical abuse, coupled with appellant cutting N.F. off financially, provided N.F. with the motivation to fabricate the sexual abuse allegations against appellant. (See Tr. Vol. V at 94-95.)\n\nTo the extent that some of the physical abuse evidence may have been unnecessarily cumulative, the admission of such evidence amounts to harmless error. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not a perfect one. State v. Williams, 38 Ohio St.3d 346, 349 (1988). \"The harmless-error doctrine recognizes the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant's guilt or innocence,\" and thus focuses \"on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.\" Id. An error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt when the remaining evidence, standing alone, constitutes overwhelming proof of defendant's guilt. Id. See also State v. Tucker, 10th Dist. No. 00AP-670, 2002-Ohio-3274, ¶ 44; Morris at ¶ 32; Crim.R. 52(A).\n\nThe evidence of the crimes for which the jury returned guilty verdicts was considerable. In addition to N.F.'s detailed description of each sexual act, L.A. testified to the sexual activity that occurred between herself, N.F., and appellant, and C.A.W. provided circumstantial evidence that sexual activity occurred between appellant, L.A., and N.F. Accordingly, as the record contains overwhelming evidence of appellant's guilt on the sex crimes, any error in the admission of physical abuse evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."}

Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 89 (1986), the Supreme Court of the United States held that a prosecutor’s racially motivated exercise of preemptory challenges violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. State v. Holder, 11th Dist. Geauga Nos. 2001-G-2345 & 2001-G-2350, 2002-Ohio-7124, ¶40, citing Batson at 89. Batson has also been extended to prohibit preemptory strikes based on gender. Id., citing J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127(1994), at syllabus. As the Fourteenth Amendment protects the rights of prospective jurors to be free from discriminatory challenges, the exercise of even one peremptory challenge in a purposefully discriminatory manner violates equal protection. *Id.*, citing *State v. Gowdy*, 88 Ohio St.3d 387, 393 (2000). A trial court’s findings of no discriminatory intent will not be reversed on appeal absent a determination that it was clearly erroneous. (Citation omitted.) *Id.*\n\n{¶50} There is a three-part process for proving a *Batson* violation. *Id.* at ¶41. First, a party must establish a prima facie case of discriminatory purpose, which can be done by pointing to a pattern of challenges against a particular race or gender. *Id.* Second, if a prima facie case is established, the burden of production then shifts to the proponent of the strike to come forward with a race or gender-neutral explanation. *Id.* Third, and finally, if a race or gender-neutral explanation is tendered, the trial court must decide whether the opponent of the strike has proved purposeful discrimination. *Id.*, citing *Gowdy* at 392-93.\n\n{¶51} A review of the transcript reveals that the state used only two of its four peremptory challenges, electing to strike first, a male, and then second, the female juror at issue. Immediately upon exercising its second challenge on the female juror, defense counsel asked the state “to provide a gender neutral reason for excusing her.” After disagreeing about the analysis of *Batson*, the state provided a gender neutral reason for striking the potential female juror: “Frankly – and I’ll be very frank. The reason for the State’s peremptory is because we believe [the juror] was not truthful in the courtroom. Because on her application she indicated she suffered from rheumatoid arthritis. And when we asked her in open court what medical conditions, if there’s anybody that had some serious medical conditions, that she didn’t note that. So we were concerned frankly for her - -.”\n\n{¶52} After inquiring if defense counsel wished to be heard further on their objection, the court determined: “Okay. I’m looking down the list. So currently there are three women I think on the panel. And the only other woman who was on the panel who’s been excused was excused by the Defense. So I’m gonna overrule this objection to the challenge. I think the State can fairly excuse [the juror] on a peremptory challenge.”\n\n{¶53} After this female juror was excused, the final jury included three women and two female alternates. Prior to the peremptory challenges, the record reflects the state raised approximately 13 jurors to strike for cause, with approximately half male and half female. All of the state’s explanations were gender neutral on their faces and otherwise supported by the transcript.\n\n{¶54} Ms. McEndree cites the Seventh District Court of Appeals’ holding in State v. Barker, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 05-JE-21, 2006-Ohio-1472, in support of the proposition that “the use of a peremptory challenge to exclude a single prospective juror, without more, can establish a prima facie cause of discrimination.” While this is an accurate statement of the law, it has no bearing on the present case.\n\n{¶55} In Barker, the Seventh District found that the appellant, who was African American, had met his burden of making a prima facie case of discrimination in that the state wished to exercise its peremptory challenge to excuse the only African-American juror, and as such, the prosecutor’s use of a peremptory challenge to excuse the juror could be viewed as discriminatory. Id. at ¶18. As in the present case, however, the prosecutor put forth a valid, neutral explanation for excusing the juror that was reasonable\nand understandable. *Id.* at ¶19-20. For similar reasons, we cannot conclude that the trial court’s finding of no discrimination was clearly erroneous.\n\n¶56 Ms. McEndree’s second assignment of error is without merit."}

{"index": "357- Mcendree", "allegation_num": "allegation_4", "allegation": "The trial court erred in precluding a finding on involuntary manslaughter.", "extracted_text": "Ms. McEndree argues her trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter. This case, however, does not support an acquittal on the aggravated murder charge and a conviction of voluntary manslaughter. R.C. 2903.03(A), which defines 'voluntary manslaughter,' states 'no person, while under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which is brought on by serious provocation occasioned by the victim that is reasonably sufficient to incite the person into using deadly force, shall knowingly cause the death of another * * *.' Voluntary manslaughter is considered an inferior-degree offense to aggravated murder. 'Before giving an instruction on voluntary manslaughter in a murder case, the trial court must determine 'whether evidence of reasonably sufficient provocation occasioned by the victim has been presented to warrant such an instruction.' In making that determination, trial courts must apply an objective standard: 'For provocation to be reasonably sufficient, it must be sufficient to arouse the passions of an ordinary person beyond the power of his or her control.' Ms. McEndree’s trial counsel could not have been deficient in failing to request a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter when there was no evidence of provocation. In her recorded confession with the police, Ms. McEndree was asked if she took the gun in anger. Ms. McEndree replied she did not; she just wanted to end it. She also told the police the victim had pulled her hair and wanted to do drugs. Mr. McCann’s actions did not provide sufficient provocation to warrant an instruction on voluntary manslaughter. Further, there was no evidence that Mr. McCann was the aggressor. Ms. McEndree told the police that she stole the gun from her neighbor because she had 'had enough;' she was not angry but was 'used to' the abuse. She then rode her bicycle back to the house and shot Mr. McCann on sight. Thus, the evidence shows that when Ms. McEndree killed Mr. McCann, she was not under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage. Thus, in Elmore, supra, similarly to Ms. McEndree, the appellant did not provide sufficient provocation to warrant an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, and there was no evidence that the victim was the aggressor. Likewise in State v. Lee, trial counsel was not deficient in failing to request a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter, considering that the evidence at trial did not support a finding that defendant acted under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage. In State v. Handwork, we found the jury’s verdict convicting appellant of murder rather than voluntary manslaughter was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because appellant told investigators, when asked if he was angry, that he was 'not angry, but scared.' The Fifth District aptly explained in State v. Byerly that the interval between the provocation and the fatal blow must be so close in time that the defendant had no time to 'cool off.' Because there was absolutely no evidence that the defendant was under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, there was no evidence adduced at trial which would allow the jury to reasonably reject the greater offense of aggravated murder and find defendant guilty of the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter. Furthermore, the Supreme Court of Ohio has stated that the 'failure to request instructions on lesser-included offenses is a matter of trial strategy and does not establish ineffective assistance of counsel,' especially where, as here, the evidence does not support such an instruction."}

Hope at ¶132. The focus is ‘the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.’ (Citations omitted.) Thus, prosecutorial misconduct is not grounds for reversal unless it so taints the proceedings that a defendant is deprived of a fair trial. (Citation omitted.) Id.\n\nFirst, as noted above, pursuant to R.C. 2945.392(B), the defendant may introduce expert testimony that he or she suffered from BWS as evidence to establish the ‘requisite impairment at the time of the offense.’ Thus, as previously noted, the Supreme Court of Ohio ‘[did] not establish a new defense or justification’ in allowing the admission of expert testimony regarding battered-woman syndrome for the first time in State v. Koss[,] [supra] * * *. Rather, [the Supreme Court of Ohio] held that expert testimony on battered-woman syndrome is admissible as evidence to prove one element of self-defense.’ State v. Goff[,] 128 Ohio St.3d 169, 2010-Ohio-6317, ¶35. Thus, such evidence is equally admissible to support an insanity defense.\n\nSecond, the state was permitted to have their own expert testify as to BWS and whether Ms. McEndree suffered from BWS at the time of the offense. In Goff, the Supreme Court of Ohio went on to hold that ‘[b]y putting her mental state directly at issue and introducing expert testimony based upon her own statements to the expert, the defendant opens the door to a limited examination by the state’s expert concerning battered-woman syndrome and its effect on the defendant’s behavior. Courts have the inherent authority to preserve fairness in the trial process, and allowing the defendant to present expert testimony on the specific effects of battered-woman syndrome on the defendant while denying the prosecution the ability to introduce such evidence would unfairly handicap the prosecution and prevent the trier of fact from making an informed decision.’ Id. at ¶58.\nA review of the testimony of the state’s expert, Dr. Gazley, reveals he explained BWS, stating that it was a legally recognized syndrome in the state of Ohio, but that it is not recognized ‘in the clinical psychology classification.’ He also opined one can be a battered woman but not suffer from BWS. He explained whether an individual suffers from BWS depends on the individual and the traumatic series of events. It does not always end in the ‘syndrome cluster’ known as BWS. Although Dr. Gazley believed Ms. McEndree was a ‘severely abused woman,’ he did not feel she exhibited the characteristics BWS because she did not demonstrate learned helplessness and she still had the capacity to think rationally, make informed decisions, and utilize her rational thinking.\n\nThe state was permitted to present their expert testimony on BWS and whether it affected Ms. McEndree and her sanity at the time of the offense. ‘The paramount concern of fairness of the trial requires only that the state be given the same opportunity to present testimony on battered-woman syndrome as the defendant.’ Goff at ¶59."}

The issue of whether the trial court prejudiced Makin by not granting a continuance to secure the appearance of an expert witness was already addressed through the second assignment of error as raised on direct appeal. This court held that: In the second assignment of error, Makin argues the trial court abused its discretion when it denied defense counsel’s request for a continuance in order to secure the appearance of Melvin Robertson (“Robertson”) — a witness for the defense. The decision to grant or deny a motion for continuance is left to the broad and sound discretion of the trial judge, and an appellate court may not disturb the trial court’s ruling absent an abuse of discretion. *Cleveland v.

In the instant case, defense counsel asked for a continuance, after the state rested its case, so two witnesses — Robertson and Jeff White (“White”) — could be brought into court to testify for Makin. Defense counsel noted that he had subpoenas issued for both individuals the day before, but his efforts to contact them have been unsuccessful. Robertson was the individual Makin was meeting with on Noble Road. White is an expert on auto mechanics repair and damage. With respect to Robertson, defense counsel stated: I will say from the nature of the testimony, I don’t know that Mr. Robertson being here or not for that purpose caused him any significant damage, because both from the State’s side and from my client, there seems to be testimony that my client was meeting with a person in a parking lot.

Here, defense counsel stated that Robertson’s absence did not cause Makin any prejudice because both Makin and the state essentially agreed that Makin was meeting someone in a parking lot. This testimony would have been more cumulative than substantially favorable to Makin.

Since the entire issue before the jury was whether minors were ‘likely to view’ Mr. Fornshell’s conduct—a video from the same day, in a bookstore, showing him engaged in likely inappropriate activity with children in sight poses a substantial ‘danger of unfair prejudice.’\n\n{¶19} The problem for Mr. Fornshell, however, is that the video in question was stipulated to by the parties, which limits Mr. Fornshell’s challenge to plain error. State v. Gross, 97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, ¶ 49 (“In fact, on one of the transcript pages Gross cites, his counsel stipulates to the admission of the nine photographs in question. Consequently, Gross has forfeited all but plain error.”), modified on other grounds, State v.

Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002) (“[Defendant] failed to object * * * at trial and thereby forfeited all but plain error.”). To demonstrate plain error, he must show that (1) there was an error, i.e., the court broke a legal rule, (2) the error was plain, i.e., obvious in the course of the proceedings, and (3) the error affected substantial rights, i.e., it clearly determined the trial’s outcome. Id. at 27. See State v. Sanders, 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 263, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001) (“Plain error exists only when it is clear that the verdict would have been otherwise but for the error.”); State v.

Webster, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-120452, 2013-Ohio-4142, ¶ 41 (quoting Long).\n\n{¶21} The first two prongs of this test are easily met by our preceding Evid.R. 403 analysis and the trial court’s own belated recognition of its mistake. Where Mr. Fornshell comes up short, however, is the extent to which the video determined his conviction. His trial counsel admitted Mr. Fornshell’s guilt of the misdemeanor offense of public indecency described in R.C. 2907.09(A)(2)—the trial strategy sought to avoid conviction for a felony by challenging the ‘likely to view’ requirement. We must ask whether, without the Mason video, the jury still would have found that a minor was likely to view and be affronted by the conduct.\n\n{¶22} As should be apparent from our discussion of the Madeira video footage and evidence, ample evidence supported Mr. Fornshell’s conviction.\nMultiple witnesses testified to the presence of children in the store, and to the proximity of the children's book section to where Mr. Fornshell lingered too long in the self-help section. Against the backdrop of this evidence, Mr. Fornshell cannot show that the admission of the Mason video tipped the balance at trial. Because Mr. Fornshell cannot show that admission of the Mason video impacted the outcome of the trial, he cannot succeed on a plain-error challenge. See, e.g., State v. McKelton, 148 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-Ohio-5735, 70 N.E.3d 508, ¶ 196-197, quoting State v. Mammone, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942, 13 N.E.3d 1051, ¶ 69 (“[A]ny minimal probative value that [the evidence] may have had was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Nevertheless, given the overwhelming evidence of [the defendant’s] guilt, we are unpersuaded that but for these photos, ‘the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.’ ”). We accordingly find no plain error here and overrule the second assignment of error.\n\n{¶23} In tandem with the above, Mr. Fornshell utilizes the failure to object to this video as a springboard for questioning his counsel’s effectiveness. To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel, Mr. Fornshell must demonstrate (1) that his counsel's ineffectiveness was ‘so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment’ and (2) that his counsel’s errors were ‘so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.’ Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).\n\n{¶24} In this case, we conclude that the second prong of this analysis is the functional equivalent to the third prong of the plain-error analysis. Short of affecting the outcome of his trial, which—due to the wealth of photographic, video, and testimonial evidence discussed above, it did not—Mr. Fornshell's trial counsel's errors did not operate to deprive Mr. Fornshell of a fair trial. We accordingly overrule his third assignment of error."}

{"index": "367-Fornshell", "allegation_num": "allegation_6", "allegation": "The record does not support the prison sentence imposed.", "extracted_text": "Mr. Fornshell asserts that the record does not support the prison sentence imposed. We may reduce or otherwise modify this sentence only if we find, clearly and convincingly, that his sentence is not supported by the record or is contrary to law. R.C. 2953.08(G)(2).\n\n{¶30} Initially, the state contends that this aspect of the appeal is moot because Mr. Fornshell has completed his sentence. The fact that a sentence has run its course does not necessarily moot the appeal of a felony conviction. State v. Golston, 71 Ohio St.3d 224, 227, 643 N.E.2d 109 (1994) (“[A]n appeal challenging a felony conviction is not moot even if the entire sentence has been satisfied before the matter is heard on appeal.”). However, the principle from the Golston case—that the collateral consequences of a felony conviction give rise to the right to challenge it—“is not served, and thus an appeal is moot, when, as here, the appellant challenges only his sentence, and his completion of his sentence leaves him without a remedy affecting his conviction.” (Citations omitted.) State v. Ysrael, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-140148, 2015-Ohio-332, ¶ 13. Here, Mr. Fornshell does not challenge any of the collateral effects of his sentence, but only the fact of the prison sentence itself. Although this may well be moot, we have no substantiation in the record to establish that Mr. Fornshell has completed his sentence, and thus we turn to the merits of his sentencing challenge.\n\n{¶31} Mr. Fornshell points to the failure of the trial court to order a court clinic evaluation or to impose community control as the basis for overturning his sentence. Yet he identifies no authority obligating a trial court to allow the court clinic evaluation to go forward. Relatedly, while he cites R.C. 2929.13(B)(1)(a), which compels courts to use a community-control sanction or a combination of\ncommunity-control sanctions in certain instances of fourth- and fifth-degree felonies, he overlooks the exception in (B)(1)(b): “The court has discretion to impose a prison term upon an offender who is convicted of * * * a felony of the * * * fifth degree that is not an offense of violence or that is a qualifying assault offense if any of the following apply: * * * (v) The offense is a sex offense that is a * * * fifth degree felony violation of any provision of Chapter 2907 of the Revised Code.” That exception applies here. Nevertheless, the trial court did consider a particular community-control sanction, but Mr. Fornshell had already completed it. It did not consider lesser sanctions in light of his past history of similar offenses in Ohio, Kentucky, and California.\n\n{¶32} Mr. Fornshell also challenges the trial court’s alleged failure to consider the purposes and principles of sentencing in R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12. But our review of the transcript shows to the contrary. The trial court considered his evidence of mitigation at sentencing, during which he discussed his bipolar disorder, total disability, and nervous breakdowns. The judge evaluated this and described the sentencing purposes and principles, and Mr. Fornshell has not adequately demonstrated any potential flaws in the court’s analysis. We accordingly overrule his sixth assignment of error."}

Manifest Weight and Sufficiency of Evidence", "extracted_text": "Miller argues in his first two assignments of error that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence and were not supported by sufficient evidence.\n\nWhen reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a criminal conviction, an appellate court examines the evidence to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would support a conviction. State v. Gross, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2018-01-001, 2018-Ohio-4557, ¶ 15. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Baikov, 12th Dist. Fayette No. CA2019-11-023, 2020-Ohio-4876, ¶ 13.\n\nA manifest weight of the evidence challenge examines the \"inclination of the greater amount of credible evidence, offered at a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.\" State v. Barnett, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-09-177, 2012-Ohio-2372, ¶ 14. To determine whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the reviewing court must look at the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether in resolving the conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.

{"index": "372-Miller", "allegation_num": "allegation_2", "allegation": "II. Motion for a New Trial", "extracted_text": "Miller argues in his third assignment of error that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial.\n\nAccording to Crim.R. 33, a defendant may be granted a new trial for various causes materially affecting his or her substantial rights. Those causes include,\n\n(1) Irregularity in the proceedings, or in any order or ruling of the court, or abuse of discretion by the court, because of which the defendant was prevented from having a fair trial;\n\n(2) Misconduct of the jury, prosecuting attorney, or the witnesses for the state;\n\n(3) Accident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not have guarded against;\n\n(4) That the verdict is not sustained by sufficient evidence or is contrary to law. If the evidence shows the defendant is not guilty of the degree of crime for which he was convicted, but guilty of a lesser degree thereof, or of a lesser crime included therein, the court may modify the verdict or finding accordingly, without granting or ordering a new trial, and shall pass sentence on such verdict or finding as modified;\n\n(5) Error of law occurring at the trial;\n(6) When new evidence material to the defense is discovered *\n\nAn appellate court may not disturb a trial court's decision denying a motion for a new trial absent an abuse of discretion. State v. Vore, 12th Dist. Warren Nos. CA2012-06-049 and CA2012-10-106, 2013-Ohio-1490, ¶ 39. An abuse of discretion implies that the court's attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. State v. Widmer, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2012-02-008, 2013-Ohio-62, ¶ 170.\n\n\"The discretionary decision to grant a motion for a new trial is an extraordinary measure which should be used only when the evidence presented weighs heavily in favor of the moving party.\" State v. Apanovitch, 155 Ohio St.3d 358, 2018-Ohio-4744, ¶ 53. \"The deference shown to the trial court in such matters is premised in large part upon the familiarity of the trial court with the details of the case as a result of having presided over the actual trial.\" Id.\n\nMiller filed a motion for a new trial, using each of the grounds provided for in Crim.R. 33.\n\nA. Jury Instructions and Indictment\n\nFirst, Miller argued that a new trial was warranted because the indictment and jury instructions regarding inducing panic were insufficient for not identifying the underlying offense.\n\nFor jury instructions to be considered reversible error, it must be clear that such instructions constituted prejudicial error to the defendant. State v. Grimm, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2018-10-071, 2019-Ohio-2961, ¶ 26. Thus, the relevant question is whether the trial court's jury instructions, taken in their entirety, \"fairly and correctly state the law applicable to the evidence presented at trial.\" State v. Sexton, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2018-08-100, 2020-Ohio-153, ¶ 7.\nMiller did not object to the jury instructions or inform the trial court that the inducing panic section did not list an underlying offense. Even so, the trial court found, and we agree, the jury was instructed on each of the underlying offenses including endangering children, abduction, and domestic violence within the jury instructions. The jury was thus aware of the charges constituting the predicate offenses Miller allegedly committed while inducing panic. Thus, when read as a whole, the instructions fairly and correctly stated the law and what charges were pending against Miller.\n\nMiller also alleges that the indictment was insufficient for not listing the underlying offense to support the inducing panic charge. However, challenges to the sufficiency of the indictment are not proper grounds for a new trial and must, instead, be raised before trial. Crim.R. 12(C)(2); State v. Frazier, 73 Ohio St.3d 323, 332 (1995). While Miller could have also challenged the indictment on appeal using a plain error standard, he did not raise an assignment of error regarding the indictment and thus failed to challenge that issue on appeal.3\n\nEven had Miller properly raised such an error on appeal or had he objected at trial, such would not have been a proper basis for a new trial. The record reveals that Miller was charged with crimes that would support predicate offenses for the inducing panic charge. The indictment and jury instructions specifically listed child endangering, abduction, and domestic violence as the other crimes with which Miller was charged. Miller was thus given clear notice of the state's theory of the case and the facts and circumstances that supported the predicate charges. At no point was Miller confused or surprised by the fact that child endangering, a crime for which the jury found Miller guilty, was charged by the state and acted as an underlying offense to Miller's inducing panic charge.\n\nB. Jury Issues\n\nMiller also alleged that a new trial was warranted because there was not an alternate juror during his trial. According to Crim.R. 24(G)(1), a trial court \"may,\" but is not required to impanel alternate jurors. \"Despite the advantage of having alternate jurors available to serve in case one or more of the regular jurors becomes unable to perform their duties, alternate jurors are not constitutionally required.\" State v. Wright, 2d Dist. Clark No. 99CA0011, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 2239, at *22 (May 26, 2000).\n\nBefore trial, a jury was seated after the parties each exercised their four peremptory challenges and the proposed alternate juror was excused for cause. However, at no time did Miller move for a mistrial or object because an alternate juror had not been designated, and at no time did Miller assert during trial that disqualification of a sitting juror was necessary. Instead, the matter proceeded from the presentation of evidence to jury deliberations without the need to seat an alternate juror. Thus, the absence of an alternate juror had no effect on the trial or the jury's verdict.\n\nMiller also alleges juror misconduct based on his assertion that a juror fell asleep during the trial and that a juror asked a question about the pending charges. In criminal trials, the accused has the constitutional right to be tried before a fair and impartial jury. State v. Villarreal, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2004-02-035, 2005-Ohio-1924, ¶ 37. A deviation from this standard constitutes juror misconduct. State v. Shaner, 12th Dist. Preble No. CA2018-09-013, 2019-Ohio-2867, ¶ 29.\n\nThe determination of juror misconduct requires a two-part analysis. Id. First, the court must determine if juror misconduct occurred. Id. Second, the court must determine whether the misconduct materially prejudiced the defendant's substantial rights. Id. Juror misconduct must be affirmatively demonstrated, not presumed. State v. Kent, 12th Dist. Warren Nos. CA98-08-094, CA98-10-140 and CA98-12-152, 1999 Ohio App. LEXIS 2667, *16 (June 14, 1999).\n\nAs noted above, Miller alleged that a juror fell asleep during trial. However, Miller did not raise the issue with the trial court. The suggestion that a juror's eyes were shut does not necessarily mean the juror was asleep. We cannot presume that any prejudice occurred, especially where the record does not demonstrate that a juror fell asleep.\n\nThe allegation that a juror fell asleep was only raised for the first time in Miller's motion for a new trial, not at the time it allegedly occurred. At trial, no one noted the possibility that a juror might be asleep and we do not presume that Miller was in any way prejudiced.\n\nRegarding the juror's question, the record shows that a juror did ask a question during trial regarding the charges against Miller. Asking a question was not misconduct where the juror simply inquired if the jury could be refreshed on the charges against Miller. The trial court reminded the jury that it would receive instructions on the charges before deliberation. The jury did, in fact, receive such instructions that clearly addressed each of the charges against Miller. Thus, the juror's question did not impact the trial's result nor was there any prejudice to Miller in any manner.\n\nC. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\nMiller asserted that he was entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor committed misconduct. In order to demonstrate prosecutorial misconduct, a defendant must prove the prosecutor's acts were improper and that they prejudicially affected the defendant's substantial rights. *State v. Harner*, 12th Dist. Clinton No. CA2019-05-011, 2020-Ohio-1184, ¶ 29. \"To demonstrate prejudice, a defendant must show that the improper acts were so prejudicial that the outcome of the trial would clearly have been different had those improper acts not occurred.\" *State v. Kaufhold*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2019-09-148, 2020-Ohio-3835, ¶ 42.\n\n\"The focus of an inquiry into allegations of prosecutorial misconduct is upon the fairness of the trial, not upon the culpability of the prosecutor.\" *State v. Combs*, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2020-01-004, 2020-Ohio-5397, ¶ 18. Prosecutorial misconduct is not grounds for error unless the defendant has been denied a fair trial because the accused is guaranteed a fair trial, not a perfect one. *State v. Kaaz*, 12th Dist. Clinton No. CA2016-05-010, 2017-Ohio-5669, ¶ 102.\n\nFirst, Miller asserts that the prosecutor essentially lied to Sara when the prosecutor allegedly told Sara that the state was not pursuing a firearm specification. However, what the prosecutor did or did not tell the alleged victim regarding what charges or specifications would be brought lacks pertinence to what occurred at trial and whether Miller was denied a fair trial. The state was free to charge Miller with the crimes and specifications that emerged from Miller's conduct. Any alleged representation to Sara after the incident had occurred had no impact on the evidence presented at trial.\n\nMoreover, regardless of what the state may have told Sara, there is no indication in the record that Miller was improperly charged with a firearm specification. Furthermore, Miller examined and cross-examined Sara at length regarding the firearm, and the jury was free to gauge the credibility of her testimony regarding the firearm. This is true regardless of any conversations regarding the firearm specification that may have occurred before trial.\n\nNext, Miller alleged prosecutorial misconduct because the state, during closing arguments, relied upon a photograph of the firearm located next to the table where Miller had at one time hidden during the standoff. Miller argues that the firearm was not at the ready because when he finally left the house, he did so through the attic and the firearm was not near him at the time.\n\nHowever, based on the evidence and testimony presented, including Miller's own admission to police after the standoff ended, Miller was in control of the firearm at various times throughout the time that Sara and the child were in the house and during the standoff. Where the firearm was located at the exact moment of Miller's exit from the house does not change the fact of his possession and control at other times when the child was present in the house.\n\nMiller also alleged prosecutorial misconduct because the prosecutor stated during closing arguments that officers pointed weapons toward Sara and the child when they exited the house, thus endangering the child, when no such evidence had been offered at trial. However, the trial court specifically instructed the jury that the statements from the attorneys was not evidence. We presume that the jury followed the instructions from the trial court, unless it is demonstrated otherwise. State v. Tucker, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2017-12-172, 2019-Ohio-911, ¶ 38.\n\nThe state presented evidence that the child was endangered at times other than when she exited the house. The jury had ample evidence upon which to base its verdict, and there is no indication in the record that Miller would have been acquitted of child endangering absent the prosecutor's statement in closing. The prosecutor argued what she thought evidence showed and a misstatement in closing argument does not necessarily rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct. State v. McKelton, 148 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-\nD. Evidentiary Issues\n\nMiller also alleged that a new trial was required because of errors made by the trial court when ruling upon several evidentiary matters. \"As we previously noted, trial courts have broad discretion in the admission of evidence.\" State v. Kincer, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2004-06-048, 2005-Ohio-5626, ¶ 39. This court will not disturb the decision of the trial court absent an abuse of discretion and a showing that defendant has been materially prejudiced. Id.\n\nFirst, Miller argues the state did not provide the defense with certain evidence during discovery that the trial court should have required the state to produce. Miller argues that he was denied a fair trial because the state failed to produce a copy of a recorded phone call that occurred between a detective and Sara after Miller was arrested. However, Miller did not establish that the phone call occurred or that it was recorded. We note that Miller had the opportunity to challenge Sara and the detective about the alleged phone call because they appeared at trial as witnesses and Miller was able to cross-examine them regarding any phone calls that occurred.\n\nMiller also argued that he was entitled to a new trial because the landlord was permitted to present evidence at trial regarding the damage caused to the rental house. As addressed in our previous discussion of Miller's first and second assignments of error, the trial court properly allowed evidence related to the damage caused to the rental house in support of the calculation for economic harm. The state was entitled to present evidence of law enforcement's efforts to force Miller out of the house.\n\nMiller also alleges he is entitled to a new trial because the trial court denied his request to admit certain exhibits into evidence. However, the record indicates that the materials constituted hearsay and were used only for impeachment purposes, not as\nsubstantive evidence. Nor was the admission of the transcript of an interview with Sara necessary where the actual recording was published to the jury. The transcript need not have been given to the jury where such would have been cumulative evidence. State v. Bai, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2010-05-116, 2011-Ohio-2206. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in these evidentiary matters and a new trial was not warranted.\n\nE. Challenges to the Convictions\n\nMiller also argued that his convictions were not supported by the evidence. However, and as addressed above, we have already determined that Miller's convictions were supported by the manifest weight of the evidence and by sufficient evidence. As such, Miller's motion for a new trial on these grounds was properly denied.\n\nAfter reviewing the record, including each of Miller's arguments raised in his motion for a new trial, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Miller's motion for a new trial.6 Miller's third assignment of error is thus overruled.\n\n{¶58} Judgment affirmed.\n\nHENDRICKSON, P.J., and S. POWELL, J., concur.\n\n---\n\n6. We have considered each of Miller's arguments within his Motion for a New Trial, and for efficiency sake, have attempted to group his arguments for ease of discussion. However, the absence of an isolated discussion does not indicate our failure to consider the argument."}

{"index": "376-Hymes", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "The trial court erred in permitting the State to introduce other acts evidence.", "extracted_text": "The state filed a notice of intent to use evidence with a motion in limine asking the court to admit evidence of Appellant’s prior violent history with the victim. The motion said the evidence demonstrated absence of mistake or accident and was relevant to his identity as the cause of death (as opposed to a fall causing the death). In arguing the motion before trial, the state emphasized Appellant’s claim to the police that the victim’s death was caused by a slip and fall and urged his history of violence toward the victim was relevant to show the lack of accident or mistake and to show his conduct was purposeful. (Tr. 188-189, 196-197). The defense argued the other acts evidence could not be considered unless the defense opened the door by presenting Appellant’s testimony and argued the evidence was unfairly prejudicial. (Tr. 187, 194).\n\nThe trial court ruled the defendant’s claim of accident did not have to be elicited from the stand in order for the other acts evidence to be admitted and found the evidence could be admitted to show lack of accident or mistake as to how the victim died.\nDefense counsel asked the court to note a continuing objection to the evidence, and the court said it would. (Tr. 200).\n\nStill, the court indicated the matter would be further judged during trial. The decision was a preliminary ruling before the actual presentation of the evidence during the trial testimony where it could be adjudged in context upon proper objection. The preliminary issue presented in a motion in limine must be renewed at trial when the evidence is actually presented or the argument made therein is waived for purposes of appeal. State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 202-203, 661 N.E.2d 1068 (1996).\n\nOn appeal, Appellant claims the court improperly allowed the state to present other acts evidence to demonstrate his propensity for assaulting his wife and to show he acted in conformity with his character. He says the state used the evidence to paint a picture that it was only a matter of time before he killed his wife. He contests the following testimony on other acts.\n\nAppellant’s sister-in-law was asked about the relationship between Appellant and the victim. She said it was sometimes loving but they would argue and fight, answering in the affirmative when asked if the relationship ever got physical. (Tr. 278). There was no objection entered. If a timely objection was lacking, then the appellant must not only show an error occurred and the error was obvious, but he must also show it affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Graham, __ Ohio St.3d __, 2020-Ohio-6700 at ¶ 93 (finding error in admitting other acts evidence but refusing to find plain error as the error did not affect the outcome of trial), citing State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002). The general, non-specific testimony of Appellant’s sister-in-law would not have affected Appellant’s substantial rights under the circumstances of this case. The real focus is on the other acts testimony of the victim’s sister, the victim’s child, and on statements Appellant made to the detective.\n\nThe victim’s sister testified she first realized Appellant was abusive when she looked out her door and saw the victim “fly across the street, like her body.” She did not see the actual physical motion by which Appellant caused this to occur, but she yelled at him not to put his hands on her sister and he apologized. (Tr. 231-232). Another time, she intervened when Appellant was “dragging [the victim] up and down the street.” (Tr. 231-232). In the past, she observed the victim with injuries such as a broken nose, teeth, and fingers. (Tr. 232). Over objection, the victim’s sister testified: the victim told her\nAppellant caused these injuries; the victim told the hospital staff she was injured in a fall; and the staff said the victim’s body could not take much more. (Tr. 232-233, 236).\n\nThe victim’s child testified: she asked Appellant if he would stop hitting her mother months before the victim’s death; he said he would; and the situation got worse. (Tr. 307-308). She stated she witnessed Appellant’s prior acts of punching, hitting, throwing, and kicking the victim; she associated the behavior as occurring after Appellant drank liquor. (Tr. 304). The child said he would threaten the victim by stating: “I’m gonna hurt you if you don’t stop talking.” (Tr. 306). The child mentioned calling her step-brother on the night at issue because “his mom went through it, so obviously I think he would know what to do” (not necessarily referring to Appellant). (Tr. 314). There were no objections during these portions of the child’s testimony.\n\nThe detective testified he asked Appellant about past violence in the relationship. Over objection, the detective said Appellant “initially downplayed it, but ultimately admitted to having some physical altercations” with the victim in the past. (Tr. 491). Appellant said one such altercation resulted in “a cut over her eye” which occurred when he “grabbed her and she slipped and fell and hit her eye”; Appellant also acknowledged the victim “has lied for him in the past when they have gone to the hospital.” (Tr. 491-492)."}

R.C. 2903.02(A). Appellant claims the state failed to present sufficient evidence of his purposeful intent. Alternatively, he contends the jury’s decision on the element of purpose was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n¶62 Whether the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain a conviction is a question of law dealing with adequacy. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). The standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction on appeal is the same as the standard used to review the denial of a motion for acquittal. See State v. Williams, 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 576, 660 N.E.2d 724 (1996); Crim.R. 29(A) (motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficient evidence).\n\n¶63 In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, the court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution to ascertain whether any rational juror could have found the elements of the offense proven beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Goff,\n\n---\n\n3 We note even if Appellant’s contention on purpose had merit, a remand would involve the activation or un-merging of the count two murder (proximately causing the death as a result of committing felony of violence of the first or second degree) which was merged with the count one murder and which could be viewed as dissimilar and separate from the felonious assault charge as there was more than one episode of felonious assault, as discussed in the final assignment of error (finding the felonious assault did not merge with the count one murder). The sentence of fifteen years to life applies to both types of murder in R.C. 2903.02. See R.C. 2909.02(B)(1).\n82 Ohio St.3d 123, 138, 694 N.E.2d 916 (1998). The rational inferences to be drawn from the evidence are also evaluated in the light most favorable to the state. See State v. Filiaggi, 86 Ohio St.3d 230, 247, 714 N.E.2d 867 (1999).\n\n¶64 An evaluation of witness credibility is not involved in a sufficiency review as the question is whether the evidence is sufficient if it is believed. State v. Yarbrough, 95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, ¶ 79, 82; State v. Murphy, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 543, 747 N.E.2d 765 (2001). In other words, sufficiency involves the state’s burden of production rather than its burden of persuasion. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at 390 (Cook, J., concurring). If the court finds insufficient evidence to support a conviction, then a retrial is barred. State v. Brewer, 121 Ohio St.3d 202, 2009-Ohio-593, 903 N.E.2d 284, ¶ 16-20. Evidence presented by the state that was erroneously admitted by the trial court can be considered in the sufficiency evaluation because the remedy for the erroneous admission of prejudicial evidence is a new trial. See id.\n\n¶65 “A person acts purposely when it is the person's specific intention to cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature.” R.C. 2901.22(A). The specific intent to cause death “may be presumed where the natural and probable consequence of the wrongful act done is to produce death.” In re A.J.S., 120 Ohio St.3d 185, 2008-Ohio-5307, 897 N.E.2d 629, ¶ 53. See also State v. Reddy, 192 Ohio App.3d 108, 2010-Ohio-5759, 948 N.E.2d 454, ¶ 37 (8th Dist.) (where the defendant claimed he pressed his hands around his mother's neck with intent to render her unconscious, there was sufficient evidence of a specific intent to cause death as this was a natural and probable consequence of his act).\n\n¶66 “Based on the surrounding circumstances, which include the vulnerability of the victim and the force with which the victim was struck, a blow to the head may be probative of intent to kill.” State v. Heckathorn, 7th Dist. Columbiana No. 17 CO 0011, 2019-Ohio-1086, ¶ 42, quoting State v. Clay, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 99AP-404 (Mar. 28, 2000). A greater height, weight, and strength of the defendant compared to the victim is pertinent in evaluating purpose in inflicting blows to the victim. Id. at ¶ 42. See also State v. Powell, 75 Ohio Law Abs. 33, 142 N.E.2d 244 (7th Dist.1955) (considering the relative\nsize and strength of the parties, the manner of attack, and the wounds to determine whether the defendant intended to kill the victim).\n\n{¶67} The detective pointed out the “big size difference” in height and weight between Appellant and the victim. (Tr. 520). Appellant’s brother described the victim as petite and small while describing Appellant as tall and having a “nice build.” (Tr. 255). Appellant’s sister-in-law described the victim as “real tiny.” (Tr. 277). Photographs of the victim were introduced, and the coroner’s report showed she weighed 115 pounds. The video from the bar showed Appellant’s size relative to the victim. At the bar, Appellant dragged her on the ground by a scarf around her neck, caused her head to slam against the truck’s door frame, and hit her in the face at least twice; her broken nose bled in the truck after they left the bar. The victim was already injured and fragile when she arrived home after the felonious assault at the bar.\n\n¶68 Appellant entered the house apparently acting extremely agitated and left to retrieve the victim from an unknown location so he could assault her again. Appellant descended to the basement with the limping victim. The victim’s child heard banging and booming from the basement while Appellant was yelling about stopping the victim’s “smart mouth” and the victim was screaming for him to stop. The child was frightened and decided to leave the house. Appellant was clearly still experiencing the extreme anger witnessed by his brother in the bar’s parking lot and depicted on the video. Before leaving her home, the child saw Appellant punch the victim in the face. She then ran across the street to a relative’s house in a panic and called 911 twice. The police briefly investigated and left. The child called the victim, who said she was okay and did not need to go to the hospital.\n\n¶69 However, a rational juror could find by circumstantial evidence that the abuse was not over yet for the victim. Appellant indicated to the child over the phone he was upset about the 911 call. The victim indicated to the child she was okay and was going to sleep. Yet, Appellant’s own statements to various witnesses suggested he was still fighting with the victim seconds before she ended up on the bedroom floor as he essentially said she threatened to pack her bags and leave the house, she ran from him, and he heard a big boom in the bedroom.\n\n¶70 The forensic pathologist opined the cause of death was blunt force “injuries” causing blunt force trauma to the head. (Tr. 470). Although a single severe enough\nimpact could theoretically cause the condition to the brain, he could not comment on the number of impacts here. (Tr. 472). He was viewing the victim's head only after the emergency surgery which included the removal of clots and the removal of bone from the sides of the skull to relieve pressure. As the neurosurgeon pointed out, the victim's head suffered a lot of trauma; the acute subdural hematoma occurred bilaterally (on both sides of her head), caused large clots, and was unlikely to have been caused by a fall from standing height. A rational juror could find Appellant concocted the story that the victim slipped and fell while running in an attempt to explain her final head injuries.\n\n¶71 As Appellant acknowledges, this court held a defendant's fists “become most deadly by blows often repeated, long continued, and applied to vital and delicate parts of the body of a defenseless, unresisting man on the ground.” Powell, 142 N.E.2d at 247, quoting A.L.R., quoting M'Whirt's Case, 44 Va. 594 (1846). Furthermore, the Supreme Court has since ruled circumstantial evidence inherently possesses the same probative value as direct evidence. State v. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 485, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001); State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 273, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991) (overturning the rule that circumstantial evidence must be irreconcilable with any reasonable theory of innocence). See also State v. Franklin, 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 124, 580 N.E.2d 1 (1991) (“A conviction can be sustained based on circumstantial evidence alone.”).\n\n¶72 This is especially relevant to the element of intent. Because a defendant's intent dwells in his mind, the surrounding facts, circumstances, and resulting inferences are the traditional indicators of a defendant's intent. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d at 485. In speaking of the totality of the circumstances used to determine purpose to cause a death, it is often stated: “The intent of an accused person dwells in his mind. Not being ascertainable by the exercise of any or all of the senses, it can never be proved by the direct testimony of a third person, and it need not be.” In re Washington, 81 Ohio St.3d 337, 340, 691 N.E.2d 285 (1998).\n\n¶73 Appellant emphasizes the neurosurgeon's testimony about “the family” wanting him to do everything he could for the victim. He was not asked to identify who the family entailed, but as Appellant was the victim's husband, it could be presumed he was involved in the decision-making and this seemed to have occurred prior to the police arriving at the hospital. We note the neurosurgeon also told the family before surgery the chances of recovery were “very, very small.” A person who wishes to deflect blame for\nlife-threatening injuries would wish to be publicly seen hoping for the victim’s recovery. Also, a person who purposely kills his wife while in a rage throughout the night could be expected to regret his impulses thereafter for one reason or another and hope his wife can be saved.\n\n¶74 On the topic of Appellant claiming he wanted to do all he could to save the victim, it is remarkable that Appellant did not call 911 despite the victim’s obviously critical condition. He called his brother instead and waited for him to arrive. Appellant was in the kitchen when his brother arrived while the victim was lying on the floor in the bedroom dying. His brother said the victim was shaking as if having a seizure, her eyes were open but she did not seem to be aware, and she was unresponsive. Appellant’s sister-in-law happened to accompany her husband to Appellant’s house (as she had just accompanied her husband to the hospital to be treated for the injury Appellant caused him). She took it upon herself to call 911 after viewing the victim’s dire condition. Appellant told her “they gonna come take me to jail.” After his arrest for felonious assault, he suggested someone should destroy the video evidence. He also later apologized to the victim’s sister and child, claiming to the child that he “didn’t mean to do it.”\n\n¶75 For a sufficiency review, the question is merely whether “any” rational juror could have found the contested element satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Getsy, 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 193, 702 N.E.2d 866 (1998), quoting Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Viewing all of the evidence and rational inferences in the light most favorable to the prosecution, some rational juror could find that Appellant had the requisite mental state and purposely caused the victim’s death by his continued purposeful assault on her head. Accordingly, his sufficiency argument is overruled.\n\n¶76 Weight of the evidence concerns “the inclination of the greater amount of credible evidence, offered in a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.” Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387. Although the effect of the evidence in inducing belief is evaluated, weight of the evidence is not a question of mathematics. Id. A weight of the evidence review considers whether the state met its burden of persuasion. See id. at 390 (Cook, J., concurring) (as opposed to the burden of production involved in a sufficiency review).\nWhen a defendant claims the conviction is contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, the appellate court is to review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. *State v. Lang*, 129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, ¶ 220, citing *Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387. “[T]he weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.” *State v. Hunter*, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 118, quoting *State v. DeHass*, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212 (1967), paragraph one of the syllabus. The trier of fact occupies the best position from which to weigh the evidence and judge the witnesses' credibility by observing their gestures, voice inflections, and demeanor. *Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland*, 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 461 N.E.2d 1273 (1984).\n\nAlthough only two of the three appellate judges on the panel must vote to reverse a conviction on the grounds of sufficiency of the evidence, the situation is different when a defendant asks for reversal of a jury verdict on weight of the evidence grounds. Where a case was tried by a jury, only a unanimous appellate court can reverse on manifest weight of the evidence grounds. *Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d at 389, citing Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 3(B)(3). The power of the court of appeals to sit as the “thirteenth juror” is limited in order to preserve the jury's primary function of weighing the evidence. *Id.*\n\nOur review of the entire record does not indicate this is the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction and requires the exercise of our limited “thirteenth juror” discretion to grant a new trial. *See Lang*, 129 Ohio St.3d 512 at ¶ 220. Appellant’s brother’s testimony was enlightening but also appeared slanted in Appellant’s favor. The video showed the initial assault and indicated Appellant’s rage and the victim’s condition. Appellant’s failure to call 911 was revealing. The testimony of the victim’s twelve-year-old child was highly credible. Appellant claims a mere three punches to the head would be unlikely to cause death; however, he is speaking of only the witnessed punches to the head (at two different locations) prior to victim’s later loss of consciousness. A purposeful death does not require an eyewitness to be believable.\nAppellant’s claims about a slip and fall lacked credibility. We additionally incorporate our review of the evidence in our Statement of the Case and sufficiency analysis above.\n\n¶80 The evidence and inferences relied upon by the jury were not unbelievable. “When more than one competing interpretation of the evidence is available and the one chosen by the jury is not unbelievable, we do not choose which theory we believe is more credible and impose our view over that of the jury.” State v. Baker, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 19 MA 0080, 2020-Ohio-7023, ¶ 148, citing State v. Gore, 131 Ohio App.3d 197, 201, 722 N.E.2d 125 (7th Dist.1999). Appellant’s conviction of murder by purposely causing the victim’s death was not contrary to the manifest weigh of the evidence. Appellant’s assignment of error is overruled."}
{"index": "376-Hymes", "allegation_num": "allegation_3", "allegation": "The Prosecutor engaged in prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments, thus depriving Appellant of his right to a fair trial.", "extracted_text": "Appellant criticizes the state’s rebuttal portion of closing arguments and notes there was no corrective instruction (just instructions before and after closing which explained closing arguments were not evidence.) However, there was no objection to the prosecutor’s remarks and no request for a curative instruction. “A claim of prosecutorial misconduct is waived unless raised at trial, and if so waived, can serve as the basis for relief only if the conduct constitutes plain error.” State v. Franklin, 97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, ¶ 24. Plain error is a discretionary doctrine to be used with utmost care by the appellate court in exceptional circumstances to avoid a manifest miscarriage of justice where an obvious error affected substantial rights, meaning it was outcome determinative.  *State v. Noling*, 98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, ¶ 62, applying Crim.R. 52(B).\n\nFirst, Appellant says the prosecution denigrated defense counsel by describing counsel’s reference to the lack of injuries to Appellant’s hands as: “Smoke and mirrors, ladies and gentlemen. It’s that witch in the window. They are trying to put doubt where there is no doubt.” (Tr. 583-584).\n\nAppellant points out the prosecutor shall not denigrate or impute insincerity to defense counsel in the jury’s presence.  *See State v. Davis*, 116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, ¶ 301 (but finding the improper comments did not result in plain error as they “did not pervade the closing argument, let alone the entire trial. Moreover, there is no reasonable basis to conclude that the result of the trial would have been different absent these improper comments”). Contrary to Appellant’s contention, the prosecutor’s “smoke and mirrors” remark is not akin to a case where the prosecutor made remarks unsubstantiated by the evidence and suggested defense counsel suborned perjury and the Supreme Court upheld the remand for a new trial.  *See State v. Smith*, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984). Merely because the *Smith* case involved the word “smokescreen” did not make it similar.  *See State v. Bedford*, 39 Ohio St.3d 122, 127, 529 N.E.2d 913 (1988) (finding no prejudice when prosecutor called the defense a “smokescreen” and called the defendant a “demon”). Also, *Smith* did not involve the plain error doctrine (nor did *Bedford* where the conviction was affirmed).\n\nAppellant also relies on a case finding it was improper for the prosecutor to say defense counsel had no defense to present and when “you have no defense you attack the police, you attack the prosecutor, you attack everybody. * * * You want to look at things that aren’t important to this particular case, you want to deflect, you want to look for something that doesn’t exist, you want smoke so he can’t be seen.”  *State v. Getsy*, 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 194, 702 N.E.2d 866 (1998). However, the Court concluded the remarks “occurred only during closing argument and did not rise to the level of plain error.”  *Id.*  *See also State v. Ahmed*, 103 Ohio St.3d 27, 2004-Ohio-4190, 813 N.E.2d 637, ¶ 126 (derogatory statements about defense trial tactics did not constitute plain error).\nFinally, in the contested comment on smoke and mirrors, the prosecutor was discussing the portion of defense counsel’s closing argument claiming Appellant had no damage to his hands. Notably, there was no evidence that he suffered no injury; a photograph of Appellant at the police station was admitted, but his hands were facing to the sides. As the prosecutor pointed out, not every punch (or incident of grabbing to slam) must cause an injury to the hand of the assailant. Comments in the rebuttal portion of closing arguments in direct response to arguments advanced by opposing counsel are given more latitude. *State v. Miller*, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 17 MA 0120, 2018-Ohio-5127, ¶ 25.\n\nAppellant also argues the prosecution improperly appealed to the jurors’ sense of moral or civic duty rather than the evidence and law or made emotional arguments to inflame the jurors’ sensibilities. He believes it was improper for the prosecutor to say he was raised to respect the principle that “under no circumstances do you put your hands on a woman.” He also complains the prosecutor encouraged the jury to punish Appellant for lying to the police by stating: “while we are holding this defendant accountable for what he did to Ryan that night, let’s also hold him accountable for the multiple times he lied to police in his interview * * *.” (Tr. 587). Comments about the interview may have been supported by the record, but the phraseology about holding him accountable for lying was irregular since he was not charged with an offense containing that element.\n\nFinally, the prosecutor said: “it brings to mind a specific quote. And that is, the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing. Ladies and gentlemen, this defendant is evil. What he did to Ryan is unadulterated, pure evil. So do something. Stop that evil.” (Tr. 611). This started in the context of discussing items in the record: how Appellant’s performance of certain acts in public allows them to infer what he could do in the privacy of their home and the observation that it was unfortunate no one saved the victim at the bar or when the police arrived at the house. Calling an act evil can be expected hyperbole in the ardor of the moment, but it has been said the prosecutor should not apply these types of derogatory terms to the defendant personally. *See State v. Liberatore*, 69 Ohio St.3d 583, 433 N.E.2d 561 (1982), fn. 9 (where the case was already being reversed for a new trial on unrelated grounds, the Court found extensive prosecutorial misconduct for many reasons, including the\nprosecutor’s characterization of the defendant “in derogatory terms clearly designed to inflame the jury”).\n\n{¶90} Assuming the contested statements were improper, there was no plain error. Even when there is objection, “[n]ot every intemperate remark by counsel can be a basis for reversal.” State v. Landrum, 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 112, 559 N.E.2d 710 (1990). The question is the fairness of trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor. Id. Again, this was the rebuttal portion of closing argument, and no issue is taken with the initial closing argument presented by the state.\n\n{¶91} Based on our review of the entire case, the contested remarks were not outcome determinative and did not deny Appellant a fair trial. Accord State v. Lundgren, 11th Dist. Lake No. 90-L-15-140 (Sept. 14, 1993) (no plain error where prosecutor paraphrased from the bible, “you have an opportunity to put this evil from the midst of us”), aff’d 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 488, 653 N.E.2d 304 (1995) (improper comment but no plain error in guilt phase of death penalty case); State v. Jefferson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 15828 (Mar. 14, 1997) (no reasonable probability outcome was affected by the prosecutor’s characterization of the defendant as “an evil man” during closing argument); State v. Smith, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-860865 (Mar. 16, 1988) (even though the appellate court was already reversing on various other grounds, it found no plain error where the prosecutor called the defendant “evil,” “vicious,” “cruel,” and a “piranha”), rev’d on other grounds, State v. Smith, 49 Ohio St.3d 137, 146, 551 N.E.2d 190 (1990) (upholding the convictions). As Appellant’s substantial rights were not affected, there is no reason to consider exercising our discretion to recognize plain error. This assignment of error is overruled."}

When pointing out the punches to the victim’s head and the victim’s head hitting the truck, an unidentified speaker said, ‘Why don’t you come do that to me, punk?’ A deputy said, ‘Okay, stop. Stop. Enough.’ The court reporter then typed, ‘there was an untranscribable outburst from the gallery.’ Outside the presence of the jury, the court noted the spectator seemed to issue a threat to the defendant with words such as ‘I will get you.’ Defense counsel asked for a mistrial. The court said it would provide a cautionary instruction to the jury about the incident. (Tr. 603-604). Defense counsel indicated he would still object. (Tr. 606). The court then instructed the jury: the disturbance was unacceptable and dealt with quickly by the deputies; the occupants of the courtroom were in no danger; and more deputies were added ‘to make sure that everyone has calmed down and that emotions are not going to cause a disturbance.’ (Tr. 607). The court reminded the jury their decision must be based on whether the state met its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element and not based on bias, sympathy, prejudice and emotion. (Tr. 608). The court continued, ‘what happened in here, in the courtroom, can in no way have any bearing on your decision in this case.’ The jury was told to disregard the outburst, put it aside, and not let it affect the decision, reminding them the constitution requires the decision to be ‘based solely upon facts, not upon other outside influences or factors.’ (Tr. 609).

We review the entire record, weigh the evidence and any reasonable inferences, consider the creditability of witnesses, and determine whether the jury lost its way in resolving conflicts in the evidence, creating such a manifest miscarriage of justice that reversal and a new trial is necessary. *Thompkins* at 387, citing *State v. Martin*, 20 Ohio App.3d. 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist. 1983). Reversal on manifest weight grounds is for only the exceptional case ‘in which the evidence weighs heavily against convictions.’ *Thompkins* at 387, quoting *Martin* at 175.\n\nUtilizing this standard, the court must ‘give great deference to the fact finder’s determination of the witnesses’ creditability.’ *State v. Covington*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 02AP-5, 2002-Ohio-7037, ¶ 16. The jury is able to ‘view the demeanor, voice inflections, and gestures of witnesses testifying before it.’ *Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland*, 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 461 N.E.2d 1273 (1994). Hence, the jury is in the ‘best position to weigh the evidence and judge the creditability of witnesses.’ *State v. DeHass*, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 231, 227 N.E.2d 212 (1967).\n\nThe evidence introduced at trial against appellant included L.Y.’s testimony of the sexual conduct. She explained one instance by noting that appellant told her to change into a nightgown so he could give her a massage, she felt his stomach against her back, she felt his finger insert into her vagina, and she felt pain. It is undisputed that L.Y. was less than thirteen years of age. L.Y. testified that appellant used his other hand to expose his penis, was breathing heavily and sweating, licking his fingers, touching his penis and inserting a finger into her vagina. Appellant’s DNA were also found on, the interior back panel, interior crotch, interior front panel, exterior back panel, and exterior front panel to mid crotch of the underwear.\n\nWhile appellant’s trial counsel vigorously cross examined witnesses, including the S.A.N.E nurse during cross-examination, which arguably revealed some inconsistencies in her testimony, the jury’s resolution of factual and credibility disputes in this case against appellant does not equate to a finding that the jury’s verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. ‘When there exists two fairly reasonable views of the evidence or two conflicting versions of events, neither of which is unbelievable, it is not our province to choose which one should be believed.’ State v. Gore, 131 Ohio App.3d 197, 201, 722 N.E.2d 125 (7th Dist.1999). A mere inconsistency cannot be said to cast doubt on the sufficiency of the jury’s verdict given the ample opportunity to cross-examine the witness and the remaining admissible evidence. A credibility determination of this nature is precisely what the trier of fact intends to resolve."}

Appellant objected to this line of questioning on the grounds that this opinion had not been disclosed in the report to defense counsel pursuant to Crim.R. 16(K) prior to trial.\n\nIn this appeal, the appellee argues that this testimony was admissible as the testimony of a lay witness as she was never formally qualified as an expert witness. However, at trial, counsel for the state of Ohio asked all of the foundational questions necessary for qualification regarding her experience as a nurse and level of specialized training in sexual assault care and her employment at the Nord Center in Lorain County. The prosecutor stopped short just at the point of asking the trial court that she be qualified as an expert. The nurse testified, without objection, regarding her educational background as well as her training and experience. In fact, in overruling this specific objection the trial court referred to her as an expert qualified to continue her testimony. From this record, therefore, Ms. McCall was properly qualified as an expert.\n\nMs. McCall’s opinion about the likelihood or unlikelihood of finding physical evidence of a sexual assault through photographs or trauma was clearly related to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons.

Slagle, 65 Ohio St.3d at 604, 605 N.E.2d 916.

First, the trial court informed the jury that opening statements are not evidence and what defense counsel said ‘may or may not be true.’ Later, the trial court sustained the state’s objection on grounds that evidence of the officer’s research into defendant’s criminal history was not relevant to whether the defendant committed the sex offense. We are mindful that ‘appellate courts must not disturb trial court rulings on character evidence unless there is a clear showing of prejudicial abuse of discretion.’ United States v. Hewitt, 634 F.2d 277, 280 (5th Cir.1981). See State v. Jackson, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-19-83, 2020-Ohio-5224, ¶ 28 (a court applies an abuse of discretion standard to evidentiary decisions regarding Evid.R. 404 matters). In Sidney v. Little, the court held that because character was not at issue in the case, Evid.R. 404 may apply. City of Sidney v. Little, 119 Ohio App.3d 193, 198, 694 N.E.2d 1386 (3d Dist.1997). The general rule is that ‘[e]vidence of a person’s character or trait of his character is not admissible for the purpose of proving that he acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion,’ with the exception that ‘evidence of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused, or by the prosecution to rebut the same is admissible * * *.’ Evid.R. 404(A)(1). ‘Pertinent’ has been deemed synonymous with ‘relevant.’ United States v. Angelini, 678 F.2d 380 (1st Cir.1982). Here, whether appellant had a criminal history was not relevant to establishing a complete defense nor would it aide the jury’s determination of a fact of consequence in a sexual assault case. Appellant’s defense was that the victim fabricated the allegations, therefore, whether appellant had a criminal history, again, was irrelevant to establishing a complete defense. Instead, it appears that appellant was offering evidence of his lack of prior criminal convictions as evidence of proof of ‘other acts’ lawful behavior, i.e., since he had no prior criminal history, he did not commit the current sexual assault of L.Y. We cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to permit evidence of the lack of appellant’s prior criminal history."}

V, VI and XIV and Ohio Const. art. 1 § 10 when the prosecutor engaged in misconduct throughout the trial and during closing statements, which substantially prejudiced the appellant and misled the jury.", "extracted_text": "Appellant identifies several instances in his Ninth Assignment of Error which he asserts arise to prosecutorial misconduct and otherwise deprived him of his due process rights due to: (1) improper burden shifting; (2) inadequate curative instruction, (3) improper and prejudicial hearsay and demeanor testimony throughout the case-in-chief; (4) intentionally misstating testimony; (5) denigration of defense counsel; and (6) inappropriate sympathy ploys or emotional pleas during closing statements.\n\nTo address these arguments, we must first determine: (1) whether the prosecutor’s conduct was improper and (2) if so, whether it prejudicially affected appellant’s substantial rights. State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984). The inquiry is guided by four factors: (1) the nature of the remarks; (2) whether an objection was made by counsel; (3) whether corrective instructions were given by the\ncourt; and (4) the strength of the evidence against the defendant. *Sidney v. Walters*, 118 Ohio App.3d 825, 829, 694 N.E.2d 132 (3d Dist.1997).\n\nMoreover, to the extent defendant did not object to allegedly improper statements, all error is waived but for plain error. *Slagle*, 65 Ohio St.3d at 604, 605 N.E.2d 916. Reversal is warranted where the improper statements “pervade the trial to such a degree that there was a denial of due process.” *State v. Keenan*, 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 410, 613 N.E.2d 203 (1993). When making this determination, we must consider the effect of any misconduct in the context of the entire trial. *Id.* “The touchstone of this analysis is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.” *Smith v. Phillips*, 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982).\n\nAs explained in our analysis of appellant’s Sixth and Seventh Assignments of Error, the alleged hearsay of the officers arriving on the scene, was in fact not hearsay. And the “demeanor” testimony of Wheeler regarding the lack of non-truthfulness indicators relating to her interview of L.Y. was not prejudicial.\n\n(A) The trial court’s curative instruction on burden shifting\n\nWe begin our analysis with the appellant’s allegations that the trial court failed to give an adequate curative instruction as promised for the improper burden shift that occurred in Nelson-Rausch’s testimony. On cross examination, defense counsel raised the issue of whether samples containing unknown male DNA could have been sent to the Y-STR DNA London Laboratory, which specialized in sexual assault cases, to\ndetermine the male profile. On redirect, the state asked whether there were samples remaining so defense counsel could test them if they wanted to. The trial court sustained defense counsel’s objection, accepting that it was an attempt to improperly shift the burden of proof to the defense to bring in an independent expert and instructed the jury accordingly. The curative instruction provided:\n\nThe Defendant had no burden of proof here. The burden of proving that the sexual assault occurred is upon the State of Ohio beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant has no burden to conduct additional testing. It’s the State’s burden, so you’re instructed to forget, if you can, the line of questioning from the Prosecutor regarding the availability of additional underwear or --- or places upon the underwear for testing.\n\nThe jury is presumed to have followed the court’s instructions. State v. Jones, 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 344, 744 N.E.2d 1163 (2001). The relevant inquiry is “whether the ailing instruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.” Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U.S. 141, 147, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973).\n\nUpon review, we find the trial court provided a curative instruction correctly instructing the jury that the burden was on the state to show that appellant committed the sexual assault and that appellant had no obligation or burden to conduct additional testing. We do not find that the presumption that the jury followed the curative\ninstruction has been rebutted. Thus, appellant’s challenge to the trial court’s curative instruction is found not well-taken.\n\n(B) Failure to provide promised curative instructions\n\nAlthough the record is clear that the trial court agreed to provide a curative instruction after sustaining defense counsel’s objection to Wheeler’s testimony regarding the lack of non-truthful indicators in her interview of L.Y., for whatever reason, and despite a second request from defense counsel prior to deliberations, the trial court failed to provide the curative instruction.\n\nA similar situation arose in U.S. v. Resnick, wherein the district court, for reasons entirely unknown, failed to give a promised curative instruction. U.S. v. Resnick, 488 F.2d 1165, 1168 (5th Cir.1974). On appeal, the court determined that the failure to give the instruction was harmless error. Id.\n\nAs in Resnick, we determine that the trial court’s failure to provide the promised curative instruction was harmless error in this case and we have detailed the additional, substantial non-error evidence, including the DNA evidence, which supported the jury’s finding that appellant committed the assault of L.Y.\n\n(C) The prosecutor’s statements\n\nAppellant next challenges the prosecutor’s statement in closing argument that “defendants DNA was inside and outside her underwear in several places” in his first closing argument. Prosecutors are accorded “wide latitude” and may comment in closing argument on testimony of defense witnesses, “including the defendant, and conclusions\nto be drawn therefrom.” State v. Draughn, 76 Ohio App.3d 664, 670, 602 N.E.2d 790 (5th Dist.1992). On review, we note that the testimony presented was that appellant’s DNA was found in the interior and exterior panels of L.Y.’s underwear. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor’s statements in closing argument amount to prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n(D) Alleged denigration of defense counsel\n\nNext, appellant’s trial counsel objected to a statement by the prosecutor in his final rebuttal closing arguments that suggested defense counsel’s closing argument to the jury was “an appeal to you to consider outside of that very narrow focus of the instructions, testimony, exhibits is an inappropriate appeal to you to … violate your oath.” The trial judge overruled the objection on the basis that the state was explaining to the jury that they are to consider only the evidence that was presented, rather than closing statements.\n\nWe have held that comments that degrade defense counsel for doing his job inherently denigrate the defendant and are improper. State v. Taylor, 6th Dist No. L-12-1037, 2013-Ohio-3066, ¶ 21.\n\nWhile a prosecutor must zealously advocate his position, he must do so within the boundaries of acceptable argument and must refrain from the desire to make outlandish remarks, misstate evidence, or confuse legal concepts. State v. Tenace, 6th Dist. L-00-1002, 2003-Ohio-3458, ¶ 102, aff’d in part, rev’d in part, 2006-Ohio-2417,, 109 Ohio St. 3d 255, 847 N.E.2d 386, ¶ 102, citing State v. Fear, 86 Ohio St.3d\n329, 336, 715 N.E.2d 136 (1999), certiorari denied, 529 U.S. 1039, 123 S.Ct. 2254, 146 L.Ed.2d 349 (2000).\n\nUpon review of the record, we disagree with appellant about the prejudicial nature of the prosecutor’s conduct in this instance. The misconduct cited did not pervade the trial to such a degree that there was a denial of due process. See State v. Keenan, 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 410, 613 N.E.2d 203 (1993). We have no reason to believe that the outcome of the trial was affected by the prosecutor’s improper comments. See State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, ¶ 149. Such prejudice is not shown when, after consideration of the entire trial, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found the defendant guilty even without the improper prosecutorial actions or comments.\n\nFor these reasons, we find appellant’s complaints regarding prosecutorial misconduct not well-taken."}

The court found that the officer’s alleged vouching error was in fact non-hearsay testimony offered to explain the officers’ investigative actions once they arrived on the scene.

Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In order to demonstrate prejudice, Patton must establish that, but for counsel’s errors, there is a reasonable probability that the result of trial would have been different. *State v. Burke*, 97 Ohio St.3d 55, 2002-Ohio-5310, 776 N.E.2d 79, ¶ 6. The failure to make an adequate showing on either prong is fatal to an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. *See Strickland* at 697.\n\nGenerally, the decision not to call an expert witness does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel because that decision is solely a matter of trial strategy. See State v. Coleman, 45 Ohio St.3d 298, 307-308, 544 N.E.2d 622 (1989). Because the decision not to present expert testimony may be tactical, the decision of trial counsel to rely on cross-examination of the state’s expert does not equate to ineffective assistance of counsel. See State v. McRae, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180669, 2020-Ohio-773, ¶ 19.\n\nPatton argues that even though his counsel cross-examined the state’s crime scene investigator, his own expert could have highlighted that Searcy was the shooter and that Patton did not have the requisite mens rea to commit the crime. However, any testimony that a crime scene reconstructionist would have provided is purely speculative. See State v. Madrigal, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 390, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000). Because Patton cannot demonstrate that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different had his counsel hired an expert, we cannot conclude that his counsel was ineffective. See State v.

Detective Nawman testified that he did not see drugs being exchanged, but he did observe one of the individuals give money to Phifer. Based upon his experience as a narcotics detective and law enforcement officer for many years, Detective Nawman believed that he had just witnessed the sale of illegal drugs. Detective Nawman testified that, a short time later, he observed another individual exit a nearby residence, walk over to Phifer’s residence, enter Phifer’s residence, and then exit approximately one or two minutes later. Detective Nawman testified that the incidents he observed while surveilling Phifer’s residence were consistent with the illegal sale of narcotics. APA Starkey and the other APA officers then arrived at Phifer’s residence and went inside without the detectives; Starkey testified that she encountered several individuals, including Phifer and a young child, inside the residence. Starkey testified that she and the other APA officers observed an open black duffel bag on a recliner in the front room that contained a baggie containing a white substance; the substance was later identified as crack cocaine. Starkey also testified that she and the APA officers discovered another baggie containing a white substance and pills underneath a black sofa in the front room; this substance was later identified as over 15 grams of methamphetamine, over five times the bulk limit. Starkey testified that she and the other APA officers also found a “burner” cellphone under the cushions of the sofa, a baggie containing marijuana, and various other drug paraphernalia during their search of the house. After placing all of the contraband and paraphernalia in a pile in the front room of Phifer’s residence, the APA officers contacted the detectives and asked for their assistance. They told the detectives where they had found the various items. The detectives then obtained a search warrant for the burner cellphone and the rest of the residence. Upon searching the contents of the cellphone, the detectives found evidence that indicated drug trafficking in the following text messages/conversations: 1) Incoming Text: “Can you bring me a 10 at all?” 2) Incoming Text: “This Vinz?” Reply: “Yea.” 3) Incoming Text: “You got a gram?” Reply: “Yea.” 4) Incoming Text: Will you bring it down?” Reply: “Got u [sic].” One reply sent from the cellphone, ostensibly from Phifer, also mentioned payment for drugs using cellphone cash applications such as Venmo and Paypal. As previously stated, Detectives Snyder and Nawman testified that they believed “Vinz” was a nickname for Phifer, whose first name is “Venzer,” which supported an inference that the cellphone belonged to Phifer, who used it for drug transactions. Both detectives also testified that they were unaware of any other individuals in the illegal drug trade in Springfield, Ohio, with the nickname “Vinz.” Hagans, Phifer’s girlfriend, testified on his behalf at trial. While Hagans testified that the burner cellphone belonged to Browning, she also testified that Phifer slept and kept his belongings on the sofa under which the cellphone and baggie of methamphetamine were found.

Pursuant to R.C. 2913.61(C)(1), the state aggregated all individual thefts that had been committed against each bank into a single count of theft relating to that bank. R.C. 2913.61(C)(1) provides that:\n\nWhen a series of offenses under section 2913.02 of the Revised Code, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of division (A)(1) of section 1716.14, section 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, division (B)(1) or (2) of section 2913.21, or section 2913.31 or 2913.43 of the Revised Code involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a series of offenses under section 2913.02 of the Revised Code, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of section 2913.02 or 2913.43 of the Revised Code involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by\ndivision (A) of this section is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the series.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nPettus argues that R.C. 2913.61(C)(1) only permits aggregation when the victim of theft offenses is an elderly person, disabled adult, or military person. He relies on State v. Phillips, 12th Dist. Clinton No. CA2009-001, 2010-Ohio-2711, to support his argument. In Phillips, the defendant had stolen 18 different items from 13 different victims, but was only indicted for a single theft offense in which the value of all stolen items was aggregated. Id. at ¶ 67-68. The Twelfth District held that R.C. 2913.61(C)(1) did not allow for aggregation of the theft offenses because it “is limited to thefts involving elderly or disabled victims, through the offender’s employment, capacity, or relationship with another.” Id. at ¶ 72.\n\nBut the Eighth District has applied R.C. 2913.61(C)(1) to allow aggregation of theft offenses in situations not involving elderly persons or disabled adults. State v. Williams, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 91167, 2009-Ohio-732, ¶ 11 (holding that aggregation under R.C. 2913.61(C)(1) was proper where the defendant had stolen multiple items from the same store over a period of several days).\n\nR.C. 2913.61(C)(1) is not ambiguous. A plain reading of the statute, based on the legislature’s use of commas separating the clause concerning elderly persons or disabled adults that is emphasized above, clearly indicates that theft offenses under R.C. 2913.02 committed by an offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to another shall be aggregated. The clause requiring that the victim of the offenses be an elderly person or disabled adult is limited to violations of R.C. 2913.31 and 2913.43.\n\nThe legislative history of R.C. 2913.61 supports our interpretation. The language in R.C. 2913.61(C)(1) pertaining to victims who are elderly persons or disabled adults was added to the statute in 1999 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 2. Prior to the inclusion of that language, the statute read “[w]hen a series of offenses under section\n2913.02 of the Revised Code is committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single offense.” The statute thus permitted aggregation of theft offenses under R.C. 2913.02 before it permitted aggregation of violations of R.C. 2913.31 and 2913.43 involving victims who were elderly persons or disabled adults.\n\nThe language in R.C. 2913.61(C)(1) permitting aggregation of certain offenses involving victims who are military persons was subsequently added to the statute in 2014 Am.Sub.H.B. 488, and it does not detract from the requirement that a series of theft offenses under R.C. 2913.02, committed in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or relationship to another, shall be aggregated.\n\nWe hold that R.C. 2913.61(C)(1) does not limit the aggregation of theft offenses under R.C. 2913.02 to theft offenses involving victims who are elderly persons, disabled adults, or military persons, and that the trial court did not err in denying Pettus’s motion to dismiss."}

Because this was a bench trial, we presume that the trial court only considered relevant evidence and did not consider improper evidence. The trial court’s initial ruling on Pettus’s motion in limine, which was limited to prohibiting the state from using Pettus’s lies in one part of the day to show that he lied in another part of the day, was a tentative, interlocutory, precautionary ruling by the trial court reflecting its anticipatory treatment of the evidentiary issue. The propriety of a court’s ruling on a motion in limine need not be reviewed on appeal unless the claimed error was preserved by a timely objection when the issue was reached during trial. Here, Pettus never objected at trial to any testimony offered by Minelli. Consequently, we review for plain error. Contrary to Pettus’s argument, Minelli never testified that Pettus had been on transitional control or that he had prior felony convictions. She explained that she was Pettus’s case manager while he resided at the Talbert House, and her testimony focused on explaining when Pettus had been given permission to leave the Talbert House and what reason he had provided for doing so. This testimony was used to establish Pettus’s identity as the perpetrator of the offenses, and not for the purpose that the trial court had previously prohibited. Minelli’s testimony did not deprive Pettus of a fair trial and its admission was not plain error."}

The record demonstrates that the state’s violation of its duty to disclose material evidence effectively precluded Mr. Campbell from gaining access to that evidence, and thus learning of the proposed grounds for a new trial, until the evidence surfaced in habeas discovery and expert analysis revealed its significance. Thus, his motion for leave demonstrates that the evidence upon which his new-trial motion depends could not have been discovered within the time prescribed by Crim.R. 33. We, therefore, hold that the trial court erred in denying him leave to move for a new trial based on that evidence.

She’s the only African American on the panel and Mr. Singer is an African American.\n\nTHE COURT: [Prosecutor?]\n\n[PROSECUTOR]: Judge, I don’t know whether or not she’s African-American or not. Her complexion is certainly not that that’s absolutely definitive. Regardless, the State is excusing her because of her age.\n\nTHE COURT: Okay.\n\n¹ The bill of particulars was later amended to include a reference to appellant’s conviction for attempted robbery from January 1993.\n\n² Prior to trial, on August 7, 2017, appellant was indicted on one count of intimidation of a witness in violation of R.C. 2921.03(A) and (B), a felony of the third degree, in case No. CR0201702350. That case was joined with the present case for purposes of trial. The intimidation charge was subsequently dismissed by the trial court at the close of the state’s case-in-chief under Crim.R. 29.\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I don’t believe there [were] any questions regarding her age.\n\n[PROSECUTOR]: It’s pretty obvious that she’s very young.\n\nTHE COURT: Well, then whether she’s African-American or not, might be open to some debate, but it appears that perhaps she’s a light-skinned African-American. [Defense counsel is] correct that there was not a direct question regarding her age, but she certainly looks to all appearances as if she’s on the younger age of the spectrum or younger side of the spectrum. Do you have any other – and Mr. Singer is an African-American gentleman. So they are of the same race.\n\nAny other reason you can provide to the court for that strike other than her apparent youthful appearance?\n\n[PROSECUTOR]: I think her youthful appearance is more apparent than her race and in this particular matter, the color hair, her youthful appearance and her seemingly lack of education based upon her employment as a custodian at [the University of Toledo Medical Center] are all race neutral reasons for excusing [juror No. 5].\n\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, I would just indicate, you know, her occupation has nothing to do with her level of education, even though she might appear to be young. There are a lot of people with college degrees that are working in janitorial positions nowadays due to the\neconomy. She was asked no questions. She’s qualified to be a juror, she was obviously old enough to be on the voting rolls to be selected for jury.\n\nTHE COURT: Uh-huh. Okay. Thank you. Well, the court’s certainly reviewed Batson and aware of the test. It does appear that as I said [juror No. 5] is perhaps at some degree African-American. Again, she’s a lighter-skinned young lady.\n\nI don’t believe we have any other African-Americans currently on the panel. However, the gallery, we still have at least one or two.\n\n* * *\n\nTHE COURT: So I have not yet seen any pattern of dismissal of African-American jurors.

Thomas maintains that the testimony regarding prior conduct lacked corroboration, and was factually and temporally unrelated to the conduct on trial.\n\n¶ 25 Evidence of other acts or crimes is not admissible to prove “a defendant’s character as to criminal propensity.” State v. Clinton, 153 Ohio St.3d 422, 2017-Ohio-9423, 108 N.E.3d 1, ¶ 96, citing Evid.R. 404(B). Such evidence, however, is “admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,\nknowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” Evid.R. 404(B); see also R.C. 2945.59 (permitting other acts evidence to demonstrate motive or intent, mistake or accident, or a scheme, plan, or system in committing the offense at issue). “The language of Evid.R. 404(B) indicates that the list of purposes for which evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admitted is not an exhaustive listing.” State v. Morris, 132 Ohio St.3d 337, 2012-Ohio-2407, 972 N.E.2d 528, ¶ 18.\n\n¶ 26 In considering the admissibility of 404(B) evidence, a court must consider whether the evidence is relevant, whether it is offered for a legitimate purpose, and whether the probative value substantially outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice. State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, ¶ 20. We review a decision to permit 404(B) evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. Morris at ¶ 19. To find an abuse of discretion, we must find more than an error of law or judgment, and that the admission of other-acts evidence was “unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.” Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140 (1983).\n\n¶ 27 At trial, the court precluded some of the intended other-acts testimony as unrelated to the crimes charged, but permitted testimony regarding Thomas’s prior acts of domestic violence against R.I. At trial, R.I. and others testified regarding past incidents of physical abuse and injury, including a burn to R.I.’s hand with a hot knife, a head injury resulting from a strike with a pistol butt, and a black eye. R.I. also testified that Thomas choked her on numerous occasions, sometimes until she lost consciousness, with\nher attempts to resist only prolonging the abuse. On the date at issue, R.I. testified that she did not want to have sex with Thomas, but knew that he would stay and persist until she gave in, and she wanted the abuse to end and for Thomas to leave.\n\n{¶ 28} This testimony was relevant, because it provided context for the rape and tended to explain R.I.’s lack of resistance by demonstrating Thomas’s use of physical abuse, past and present, to force her compliance. “It is a well-known rule that, while consent negatives rape, where a woman is affected by terror or is in fear of great bodily injury and harm, brought into being by an accused, who has placed his victim within his power and control, intercourse under such circumstances without consent is rape, even though the victim might have used greater physical resistance or cried out, when it is shown that her will was overcome by the fear or duress.” State v. Rupp, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 05MA166, 2007-Ohio-1561, ¶ 26, quoting State v. Martin, 77 Ohio App.553, 554, 68 N.E.2d 807 (9th Dist.1946).\n\n{¶ 29} Based on this relevance, the trial court correctly permitted this evidence for a legitimate purpose, and not merely to impugn Thomas’s character. The other-acts evidence admitted by the trial court, furthermore, did not pertain to incidents so remote in time and circumstance to render that testimony irrelevant to the intended purpose. “While other acts evidence may be admissible, its probative value becomes attenuated as the distance in time and the nature of the act become more remote.” State v. Moran, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD-11-042, 2013-Ohio-724, ¶ 18. In this case, the evidence pertained\nto similar conduct toward R.I. during the course of their relationship, and therefore was neither remote nor attenuated.\n\n¶ 30 Finally, the other-acts evidence was not unduly prejudicial. All evidence that tended to prove the state’s case was prejudicial to Thomas, but exclusion was only required for evidence that was unfairly prejudicial. State v. Crotts, 104 Ohio St.3d 432, 2004-Ohio-6550, 820 N.E.2d 302, ¶ 23. “Unfair prejudice is that quality of evidence which might result in an improper basis for a jury decision.” Crotts at ¶ 24. Therefore, if the danger of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of other-acts evidence, the trial court should have ruled that evidence inadmissible. Williams, 2012-Ohio-5695, ¶ 24.\n\n¶ 31 Here, Thomas argues that evidence of prior conduct was unduly prejudicial, without addressing either the relevance of this evidence or the purpose for which the state proffered the evidence. The trial court gave limiting instructions to the jury following testimony, and again at the close of the state’s case in chief as follows:\n\nNow that [other-acts] evidence was received for a very limited purpose, it was not received and you may not consider it to prove the character of the [Thomas] in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character. If you find that the evidence of other wrongs is true and that [Thomas] committed them, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves that [R.I.’s] will was overcome by fear and may explain her lack of resistance to the sexual assault.\nTherefore, evidence that may or may not be relevant regarding the element of force, that’s an essential element of the charge of Rape that you will have further instructions on when we get to that point in the trial. So that evidence can not be considered by you for any other purpose.\n\n¶ 32 Thomas dismisses the trial court’s limiting instruction as ineffective, with no argument or authority offered in support of this conclusion. Contrary to Thomas’s position, the trial court properly gave a limiting instruction, and “[i]t is presumed that the jury followed the instructions of the court.” State v. Williams, 73 Ohio St.3d 153, 159, 652 N.E.2d 821 (1995), citing State v. Murphy, 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 584, 605 N.E.2d 884 (1992).\n\n¶ 33 Considering the record, the trial court properly considered the relevance of proffered evidence, as well as the purpose for which the state sought to introduce that evidence, and weighed the probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice. In admitting some of that evidence, the trial court also cautioned the jury regarding the limited purpose for which they might consider that evidence. Therefore, we do not find that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence of prior acts, pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B), and Thomas’s first assignment of error is not well-taken."}

Prejudice is demonstrated by showing “that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 142, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), quoting Strickland at 694. We presume a properly licensed attorney is competent, so “[j]udicial scrutiny of counsel’s performance must be highly deferential.” Strickland at 689.\n\n¶ 36 Thomas first argues deficiency based on his counsel’s failure to challenge the authenticity of text messages offered by the state, suggesting counsel should have addressed the possibility that text messages were altered in some manner. Thomas presents this argument without any claim that text messages were, in fact, altered, and with no reasoning regarding the impact altered text messages had on the result of his trial. “Given the tentative and interlocutory nature of all in-limine motions, an ineffective-assistance claim based on the decision not to file one bears a stringent burden of demonstrating prejudice.” (Citations omitted.) State v. Swiergosz, 197 Ohio App.3d 40, 2012-Ohio-830, 965 N.E.2d 1070, ¶ 22 (6th Dist.)\n\n¶ 37 It is Thomas’s burden to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel by showing a violation of the attorney’s duty to the client as well as a reasonable probability of a different result, but for this violation. State v. Wright, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-15-044, 2017-Ohio-1479, ¶ 17. Despite bearing the burden, Thomas articulates no basis to find any prejudice resulting from the introduction of the text messages he now claims, without support, might have been altered. Instead, the record demonstrates that Thomas addressed the content of these text messages in his own testimony on direct, acknowledging the exchange regarding damage to R.I.’s door, with no challenge to the authenticity of these texts.\n\n¶ 38 Next, Thomas argues his trial counsel was deficient by failing to object to a brief, in-court demonstration of the strangulation. At the prosecutor’s request, R.I. briefly placed the prosecutor’s hands on her neck to demonstrate the manner in which Thomas held her neck. This brief demonstration accompanied the following testimony:\n\n¶ 39 MS. LIPTACK-WILSON: Judge, I’d like to approach the witness and demonstrate with her, the position of [Thomas’s] hands.\n\nTHE COURT: Go ahead.\n\nMS. LIPTACK-WILSON: Thank you.\n\nQ. Can you stand up, please. If I am [Thomas], can you explain, taking my hands where his hands were on your body?\nA. His right hand was around my neck like that.\n\nQ. Anything –\n\nA. This was on and off.\n\nQ. With the left hand?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Okay. Were you standing or laying down when that occurred?\n\nA. Laying.\n\nQ. Was he saying anything when his hands were around your neck?\n\nA. That I was his.\n\nIn arguing that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to this evidence, Thomas contends that the demonstration was highly inflammatory and prejudicial, without any reasoning offered in support of this conclusion.\n\n¶ 40 A court has discretion to permit an in-court demonstration to aid the trier of fact. (Citations omitted.) State v. Jones, 135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, 984 N.E.2d 948, ¶ 82. “Demonstrative evidence is admissible if it satisfies the general standard of relevance set forth in Evid.R. 401 and if it is substantially similar to the object or occurrence that it is intended to represent.” Jones at ¶ 82, citing State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, ¶ 90; State v. Palmer, 80 Ohio St.3d 543, 566, 687 N.E.2d 685 (1997). Despite relevance, a court may exclude evidence that is unduly prejudicial, pursuant to Evid.R. 403. Jones at ¶ 82, citing Evid.R. 403(A).\n¶ 41 Here, a female prosecutor asked R.I. to place her hands around R.I.’s neck, to demonstrate the placement of Thomas’s hands on the date in question. Thomas points to nothing in the record indicating the demonstration could have misled the jury, or that the demonstration was not similar to the conduct it was intended to represent. Thomas, furthermore, identifies no unduly prejudicial aspect of this demonstration. He does not argue, for example, that the prosecutor appeared more threatening than he would have appeared. Furthermore, the state presented other evidence of the choking described by R.I., presented by the SANE nurse and Jesse Garcia.\n\n¶ 42 Thomas also argues that trial counsel was deficient in failing to timely provide certain discovery, resulting in exclusion of defense exhibits at trial. His counsel sought, unsuccessfully, to introduce a video recording depicting consensual intercourse with R.I., screenshots from R.I.’s Facebook account, and records of various phone calls and text messages between Thomas and R.I. Thomas identifies no basis, however, to find the necessary prejudice to reverse the verdict based on ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n¶ 43 As to the video, the trial court addressed this evidence out of the presence of the jury, just before the cross-examination of R.I., as follows:\n\nIt’s been expressed to the Court that there may in fact be a video of the sexual interaction between [Thomas] and [R.I.] who is out of the presence of the courtroom as well. I should reflect that. No witnesses are present.\nThat has been in the possession of the Defense on [Thomas’s] phone. He purportedly videotaped this interaction himself. This was not disclosed to the State and it was expressed that depending on the way the testimony comes forth from the victim, both through cross examination by defense counsel and perhaps even on redirect, that defense may want to play this video. It would be clearly within the Court’s discretion to rule that this video cannot be played purely on a basis of a discovery violation, that this should have been disclosed to the State prior to trial so that they would have an opportunity to review it and deal with whatever might be displayed on this video.\n\nAnd even to this point, the State has still not been able to see this recording. * * *\n\nIt’s the Court’s position that we’ll allow cross examination to go forward. I will instruct defense counsel not to reference this recording. That if there comes a point in time during the cross examination that defense, through counsel, feels that it may be pertinent to their case, that this recording be played for the Jury. We will recess. I’ll hear arguments. One – I’ll let the State view it. Then I’ll hear arguments in case the State would care to object. And I’ll make my ruling at that time. * * *\n\n¶ 44 Contrary to Thomas’s position, the trial court never ruled on admissibility of the video, but instead, indicated that should his counsel deem the video relevant during the course of R.I.’s cross-examination, the trial court could call a recess in order to provide the prosecutor an opportunity to view the video, followed by hearing outside the presence of the jury regarding admissibility. Thomas’s counsel did not seek to admit the video at trial, and in arguing that the jury should have viewed the video, Thomas fails to demonstrate the relevance or the admissibility of that video, and offers no support for his assertion that, had the jury viewed his video, the outcome of his trial would have been different.\n\n¶ 45 Similarly, Thomas fails to identify how the exclusion of Facebook posts or phone records changed the outcome of his trial. Trial counsel sought to introduce two pages of R.I.’s Facebook posts to show that R.I. communicated with others using an account with a different name. R.I. acknowledged, in her testimony, that she used the name depicted on her Facebook account, and the trial court found “no real purpose” in introducing this evidence. As to phone records, Thomas testified regarding the content of those records at trial, reading text messages and testifying regarding the content of phone conversations. Accordingly, without some argument referencing what the trial court excluded, relative to these records, Thomas fails to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n¶ 46 Next, Thomas fails to identify any prejudice resulting from the improper questions posed during the cross-examination of Alex Zilba. At trial, Zilba testified that he drove Thomas to R.I.’s house, spent the night sleeping on the living room floor, and heard nothing all night. On cross-examination, the prosecutor inquired into Zilba’s misdemeanor license suspension out of Toledo Municipal Court, and his court date the day before the incident.\n\n{¶ 47} The state argues that Zilba placed the conviction at issue by testifying that he drove Thomas. However, the prosecutor was not seeking to discredit Zilba’s claim that he drove Thomas. Instead, the fact that Zilba drove Thomas to R.I.’s home was never in dispute, and it was Zilba’s loud engine that R.I. described in her testimony. The mere fact that Zilba testified he drove Thomas did not make his prior conviction for driving without a valid license relevant to the matters on trial, and even if the parties disputed whether Zilba drove that night, prior convictions were inadmissible to attack Zilba’s credibility on this subject. See, e.g., State v. Perry, 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT-91-004, 1991 Ohio App. LEXIS 5912 (Dec. 13, 1991) (where issue on trial was whether Perry was driving the night of the incident, evidence of previous arrests for driving without a license was irrelevant and, pursuant to Evid.R. 609(A), inadmissible).\n\n{¶ 48} “Pursuant to Evid.R. 609(A), prior convictions that are either felonies or those offenses involving dishonesty or false statement are admissible into evidence for the purpose of attacking the credibility of [a witness].” State v. Carpenter, 6th Dist. Erie No. E-00-033, 2002-Ohio-2266, ¶ 57. Thus, the prosecutor improperly questioned Zilba regarding his prior misdemeanor conviction, as driving without a license is neither a felony nor an offense involving dishonesty or a false statement. However, while trial counsel failed to object to this line of questioning, Thomas fails to identify any prejudicial error. While admission of such testimony was contrary to Evid.R. 609(A),\nsuch error was merely harmless error, as Zilba’s prior misdemeanor conviction could not have contributed to Thomas’s conviction. (Citations omitted.) State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 28; Crim.R. 52(A).\n\n¶ 49 Finally, Thomas argues his trial counsel failed to preserve various errors for appeal by proffering exhibits that the trial court excluded. In support of this error, Thomas indicates there is no record of proffer of Exhibit E or “any other exhibits that were denied admission by the court, to preserve the record for appeal.” He provides no argument in support of any error based on a lack of proffer, and the record on appeal includes an Exhibit E. Furthermore, we can only guess what Thomas means by “any other exhibits,” as he fails to identify this evidence, and presents no argument regarding any deficiency or prejudice, relative to this evidence. “App.R. 16(A)(7) requires appellate briefs to contain ‘an argument containing the contentions of the appellant with respect to each assignment of error presented for review and the reasons in support of the contentions, with citations to the authorities, statutes, and parts of the record on which appellant relies.” State v. Ritter, 6th Dist. Fulton No. F-05-003, 2005-Ohio-6526, ¶ 79. With no argument or reasoning, we need not attempt to create an argument out of thin air, and may disregard this claimed error. Id.\n\n¶ 50 As with each of the errors attributed to trial counsel, Thomas must do more than demonstrate deficient performance. He must also demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the deficient performance, “so as to deprive [him] of a fair trial.” State v. Skatzes, 104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, ¶ 190, citing Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 687. In seeking to reverse his conviction based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel, Thomas only argues the deficiency of his trial counsel, with no reasoning, and therefore no demonstration of prejudice. Accordingly, we find Thomas’s second assignment of error not well-taken."}

After the trial court charged the jury, Thomas indicated he did not waive his presence should the jury submit any questions during deliberations. While the jury did not have any questions, after they reached a verdict and the parties assembled in court outside the jury’s presence, the trial court disclosed a previous communication with the jury regarding scheduling. Only the trial court, his criminal bailiff, and the jury were present for the scheduling inquiry.\n\n¶ 52 The trial court acknowledged the prior contact, describing the content of communication as procedural, not substantive. In response, trial counsel objected to the communications between judge and jury, citing Sup.R. Appx B, Standard 16, which provides in pertinent part:\n\nAll communications between the judge and members of the jury panel from the time of reporting to the courtroom for voir dire until dismissal shall be in writing or on the record in open court. Counsel for\neach party shall be informed of such communication and given the opportunity to be heard.\n\nTrial counsel made no further inquiry into the nature of the communications, however, accepting the trial court’s characterization of the contact as procedural, or concerning only the schedule.\n\n¶ 53 ‘[A] trial court’s ex parte communication with the jury is not necessarily prejudicial error.’ State v. Hill, 73 Ohio St.3d 433, 444, 653 N.E.2d 271 (1995), citing State v. Williams, 6 Ohio St.3d 281, 286, 452 N.E.2d 1323 (1983). In order to find prejudicial error, Thomas ‘‘must first produce some evidence that a private contact, without full knowledge of the parties, occurred between the judge and jurors which involved substantive matters.’’ Hill at 444, quoting State v. Jenkins, 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 474 N.E.2d 264 (1984), at paragraph thirteen of the syllabus.\n\n¶ 54 The applicable rule required all communications between the trial court and the jury to be in writing or on the record. Therefore, the trial court’s contact with the jury was improper. But even with this improper contact, the record fails to demonstrate that the trial court’s interaction with the jury pertained to substantive matters. Thomas, moreover, does not argue that the court discussed substantive matters with the jury, off the record. Thus, despite improper communications, Thomas fails to satisfy the standard for demonstrating prejudicial error, and Thomas’s third assignment of error is not well-taken."}

{"index": "619-Thomas", "allegation_num": "allegation_5", "allegation": "The jury’s verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence presented at trial.", "extracted_text": "¶ 66 In his fifth and final assignment of error, Thomas argues the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Unlike a sufficiency inquiry, which assesses the adequacy of evidence, a manifest weight challenge requires the court to review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving any conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and thereby created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial must be ordered. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), citing State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\n\n¶ 67 “When a court of appeals reverses a judgment of a trial court on the basis that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, the appellate court sits as a ‘thirteenth juror’ and disagrees with the fact finder’s resolution of the conflicting testimony.” State v. Wilson, 113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264,\n¶ 25, quoting *Thompkins* at 387. Reversal is appropriate in only “the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.” *Thompkins* at 387, quoting *Martin* at 175.\n\n{¶ 68} In weighing the credibility of the witnesses, we extend deference to the jury’s credibility determination, as the jury observed the witnesses’ testimony, noting facial expressions, body language, and voice inflections, and had the opportunity to “discern qualities such as hesitancy, equivocation, or candor (or the lack of it).” *State v. Fell*, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-10-1162, 2012-Ohio-616, ¶ 14.\n\n{¶ 69} In this case, the conflicting evidence argued by Thomas is his own, self-serving testimony. Thomas’s other witnesses either were not present at R.I.’s house, or slept through the night and heard nothing. Thomas argues that the jury completely discounted his testimony and viewed him as a bad person, based on 404(B) evidence and his admitted infidelity to both R.I. and Kayla Smith. Reversal is not required based solely on Thomas’s contradictory testimony, however. *State v. Welninski*, 2018-Ohio-778, 108 N.E.3d 185, ¶ 65 (6th Dist.). Instead, the jury was free to disbelieve Thomas’s testimony, and free to find the state’s witnesses more credible. *State v. Holmes*, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-17-1111, 2019-Ohio-896, ¶ 88.\n\n{¶ 70} Upon review of the evidence and weighing the conflicting testimony, we are not convinced the evidence weighs heavily against conviction, or that the jury clearly lost its way, resulting in a miscarriage of justice. Therefore, we find Thomas’s fifth assignment of error not well-taken."}
{"index": "620-Williams", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "Defendant-appellant’s conviction[s] must be reversed because his waiver of counsel was not knowingly and voluntarily made, and therefore it was ineffective.", "extracted_text": "In his first assigned error, Suells argues that his waiver of counsel was ‘ineffective,’ because the court did not adequately ‘discuss the charges against him.’\n\nPursuant to Crim.R. 44(A) and (C), a defendant, ‘after being fully advised of his right to assigned counsel, [may] knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive * * * his right to counsel. * * * Waiver of counsel shall be in open court and the advice and waiver shall be recorded as provided in Rule 22. In addition, in serious offense cases the waiver shall be in writing.’\n\nHowever, ‘courts are to indulge in every reasonable presumption against the waiver of * * * the right to be represented by counsel.’ State v. Dyer, 117 Ohio App.3d 92, 95, 689 N.E.2d 1034 (2d Dist.1996). For a waiver of counsel to be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, it ‘must be made with an apprehension of the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses included within them, the range of allowable punishments thereunder, possible defenses to the charges and circumstances in mitigation thereof, and all other facts essential to a broad understanding of the whole matter.’ Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948).\n\nIn the case at hand, Suells made it clear to the court throughout these proceedings that, although he knew he was not a lawyer, he wanted to represent himself and he wanted a trial. The court — in painstaking detail at times — made it clear to Suells that, although defending himself was his right, ‘I can only give you my most strongest [sic] opinion on how foolish that would be.’\n\n¶ 35 At his court proceeding on June 21, 2018, Suells reiterated that he wanted to represent himself. At that time, he was being represented by his second court-appointed attorney, and the court asked him, ‘Are you still on board with Mr. Schlachet representing you?’ Suells replied, ‘No, I want to be my own lawyer.’ The court reviewed the written waiver of counsel with Suells at this proceeding. The court and defense counsel also discussed the sexually violent predator specifications that Suells was charged with and how convictions of these specifications result in life imprisonment. Suells’s attorney at the time gave him a copy of the Ohio Revised Code, the Ohio Jury instruction, and case annotations on sexually violent predator specifications.\n\n¶ 36 The court also reviewed the alternative of a plea bargain with Suells, although Suells told the court that a ‘plea bargain is out of the question * * *.’ The court nonetheless informed Suells of this option, stating that he was facing ‘a very lengthy prison sentence,’ and a plea bargain would likely result in ‘lesser prison time.’\n\n¶ 37 The court held another hearing on the record on July 26, 2018, at which Suells was represented by his third attorney. Suells continued to maintain that he wanted to represent himself, although he had not yet sign the written waiver of counsel. Another hearing was held on August 2, 2018, to ‘formalize for the record’ Suells’s intent to waive his right to counsel and proceed pro se. The court reviewed the written waiver with Suells again. The court asked Suells if he had any questions about what constitutional rights he was giving up. Suells replied, ‘No, I do not.’ The court reviewed Suells’s indictment, including each charge, the degree of each felony, and each specification. The court particularly focused on the sexually violent predator specifications, each of which included a ‘life tail’ of imprisonment with the court making ‘a determination as to the eligibility of parole. It could be ten, 20, 30, 40 years to life at this point in time.’\n\n¶ 38 The court, the prosecutor, and the defense attorney explained to Suells that the sexually violent predator specifications would have to run consecutively, but the prison sentences for convictions of other offenses could be run consecutively or concurrently, at the court’s discretion. The court explained that some of the counts, particularly kidnapping, could merge for sentencing, but that other counts, particularly having a weapon while under disability, would not merge for sentencing. The court also talked about the three-year sentence for the firearm specifications running consecutive and prior to the underlying sentences, using the following example: ‘[L]et’s just assume for the sake of argument that he’s found guilty on Count 1 alone as it was indicted. So am I to understand that it would be a — the sentence would be 13 to life?’ The state and defense attorney agreed that this was correct.\n\n¶ 39 The court explained the sexual motivation specification and how, if Suells was found guilty of this, it would require sexual offender ‘reporting’ upon his\npotential release from prison. The court continued to explain the charges and sentencing to Suells: ‘Counts 1, 3, and 6 are all counts of rape and they are all punishable by a potential term of incarceration of ten to life, but with the three-year firearm specification, you have to serve three years prior to and consecutive to the imposition of that ten to life sentence which would effectively be 13 to life.’ The court then explained the details about the kidnapping charges in Counts 2, 4, and 7; the weapons charges in Counts 5 and 10; and the aggravated burglary charges in Counts 8 and 9. The court concluded that Suells was facing a maximum stated sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility after 92 years.\n\n¶ 40 The court explained that, if Suells represented himself at trial, he was entitled to have ‘standby’ or advisory counsel, but that Ohio law prohibited hybrid representation. The court inquired into whether Suells was aware of the ‘facts and evidence that the State intends to introduce at trial’ and made sure that Suells had received the state’s discovery materials. The court also reviewed with Suells the ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ burden of proof under which the state must present its case against him.\n\n¶ 41 The court next reviewed with Suells the ‘potential legal defenses’ that he may raise on his behalf, and the court instructed Suells that it was his burden to raise these defenses should they apply. The court detailed the following: failure to produce evidence; impeachment testimony; motions to suppress (both evidence and statements); state and federal constitutional violations; motions in limine; affirmative defenses, including self-defense, alibi, and speedy trial; motions to\ndismiss; and suppression of evidence. The court also reviewed with Suells that he would be responsible, just as an attorney would be, for complying with the rules of evidence and criminal procedure.\n\n¶ 42 The court accepted the written waiver of counsel that Suells signed and reminded him that his trial was set for August 13, 2018. At Suells’s request, the court authorized funds for a defense investigator and, to the extent of its authority, made ‘the appropriate advisement’ that Suells could use the jail’s law library to prepare for his case.\n\n¶ 43 In reviewing waivers of counsel at the trial-court level, this court has held the following:\n\nAlthough there is no prescribed colloquy in which the trial court and a pro se defendant must engage before a defendant may waive his right to counsel, the court must ensure that the defendant is voluntarily electing to proceed pro se and that the defendant is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waiving the right to counsel. Given the presumption against waiving a constitutional right, the trial court must ensure the defendant is aware of ‘the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation’ and that he is making the decision with his ‘eyes open.’\n\n(Citation omitted.) State v. Buchanon, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 80098, 2003-Ohio-6851, ¶ 16. See also State v. Gibson, 45 Ohio St.2d 366, 378, 345 N.E.2d 399 (1976) (holding the following regarding waiver of counsel: ‘And while, in retrospection we may question the wisdom of such a decision, as indeed the defendant has, we are satisfied that it was validly made. The trial court conducted a complete inquiry which did comport with the accepted standards of laying a foundation to accept a waiver of counsel and the defendant knowingly and intelligently exercised his rights’).\nIn the instant case, the court held multiple hearings regarding Suells’s request to represent himself at trial. The court appointed a series of three defense attorneys and urged Suells, repeatedly, to allow one of these attorneys to represent him, cautioning Suells of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. For example, the court stated the following to Suells:\n\nI know I shared this with you last time, you wouldn’t be your own dentist, pull your own tooth. You wouldn’t be your own surgeon to take care of a health issue. You go to the expert to do that for you.\n\nSo while you may think that you and only you would be in the best position to represent yourself, again, all I can do — and I think I have the obligation to suggest to you in the strongest way possible that that’s a terrible idea; but if that’s what you choose to do, I can’t stop you from doing it.\n\nUpon review, we find that Suells unambiguously asserted his right to self-representation. The record shows that Suells was literate, competent, and acting under his own free will. The court complied with its duty to inform Suells about, and inquire into Suells’s understanding of, the nature of the charges, the statutory offenses, the potential penalties, and the possible defenses. Suells has failed to show that his waiver of counsel was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made. Accordingly, the court did not err in granting Suells’s request to represent himself at trial, and his first assigned error is overruled."}
{"index": "620-Williams", "allegation_num": "allegation_2", "allegation": "Defendant-appellant’s conviction[s] must be reversed due to prosecutorial misconduct.", "extracted_text": "In his second assigned error, Suells argues that various incidents of inadmissible testimony were elicited from the prosecutor ‘which rose to the level of depriving [Suells] of his right to a fair trial.’ Specifically, Suells points to the prosecutor asking a detective about the word ‘murder’ tattooed on Suells’s chest. Suells further argues that this same detective improperly testified as to his opinion that ‘Suells’s rendition of events was so close to that of the victim, with the exception of the issue of consent, it was almost as if he had used a cheat sheet, and that it was not credible for that reason.’ Finally, Suells argues it was improper for the prosecutor to ask a witness ‘whether the witness wanted to come to court.’ Suells concedes that, at trial, he did not object to the testimony which he is now challenging on appeal."}

Over Suells’s objection, the court granted another one-day continuance so the state could investigate these alleged threats. The court reconvened on August 15, 2018, and trial commenced. The first witness to testify for the state was C.H. It is apparent from the record that C.H. was uncomfortable during her testimony. The state asked for a five-minute recess, and when the prosecutor came back into the courtroom, she notified the court that the witness refused to continue testifying.

Thus, when the trial court determines that certain evidence will be admitted or excluded from trial, it is well established that the order or ruling of the court will not be reversed unless there has been a clear and prejudicial abuse of discretion.\n\nAlthough not fully explained in Suells’s brief, it appears that his argument on appeal is that he should have been allowed to impeach C.H. Furthermore, it was not entirely clear during trial what Suells was attempting to establish with this line of questioning. He failed to lay a foundation of why he asked C.H. this question, he failed to identify a specific ‘instance of conduct’ regarding C.H.’s truthfulness, and he failed to identify to whom or when she allegedly made this statement. The court inquired of Suells, ‘Where are you going with this, Mr. Suells? * * * What evidence do you have of that?’ Suells consulted with his advisory counsel and resumed his cross-examination of C.H. with questions about a different topic.\nUpon review, we find that Suells has failed to show a clear and prejudicial abuse of discretion regarding the court’s decision to sustain the state’s objection. Accordingly, Suells’s fourth assigned error is overruled."}

State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 482, 2012-Ohio-5699, 983 N.E.2d 1245, & 28. Pursuant to R.C. 2941.25(A), ‘[w]here the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, *** the defendant may be convicted of only one.’\n\n¶ 76 In State v. Ruff, 143 Ohio St.3d 114, 2015-Ohio-995, 34 N.E.3d 896, & 30-31, the Ohio Supreme Court detailed the allied offenses analysis:\n\nRather than compare the elements of two offenses to determine whether they are allied offenses of similar import, the analysis must focus on the defendant’s conduct to determine whether one or more convictions may result because an offense may be committed in a variety of ways and the offenses committed may have different import. No bright-line rule can govern every situation.\n\nAs a practical matter, when determining whether offenses are allied offenses of similar import within the meaning of R.C. 2941.25, courts must ask three questions when defendant’s conduct supports multiple offenses: (1) Were the offenses dissimilar in import or significance? (2) Were they committed separately? And (3) Were they committed with separate animus or motivation? An affirmative answer to any of the above will permit separate convictions. The conduct, the animus, and the import must all be considered.\n\n¶ 77 Suells was convicted of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), which states that ‘[n]o person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other to submit by force or threat of force.’ Suells was also convicted of kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4), which states that ‘[n]o person, by force, threat, or deception *** shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person *** [t]o engage in sexual activity *** with the victim against the victim's will ***.’\n\n¶ 78 Ohio courts still apply the test found in State v. Logan, 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 135, 397 N.E.2d 1345 (1979), to determine whether rape and kidnapping convictions merge for sentencing, despite that this test predates Ruff. ‘The primary issue *** is whether the restraint or movement of the victim is merely incidental to a separate underlying crime or, instead, whether it has a significance independent of the other offense.’ Id. Put another way, courts must ask ‘whether the victim, by such limited asportation or restraint, was subjected to a substantial increase in the risk of harm separate from that involved in the underlying crime.’ Id.\n\n¶ 79 C.H. testified that Suells held her at gun point outside of her home, forced her into her house, and raped her in the kitchen. Upon review, we find that moving C.H. from outside in public view to inside her home was more than incidental. Indeed, it substantially increased the risk of harm by taking C.H. from a public place, where exposure could limit the damage, to the confines of her home, where Suells could commit the offense unimpeded. The purpose of asportation was to avoid the possibility of detection. See State v. Zanders, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99146, 2013-Ohio-3619, ¶ 29 (‘the restraint and force used to drag the victim to a secluded location was separate and distinct from the force exercised during the acts of rape’)."}

Shanklin further contends that the jury’s findings are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nSTANDARD OF APPELLATE REVIEW.\n\n1). Sufficiency of the Evidence.\n\n{¶52} The Sixth Amendment provides: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury....” This right, in conjunction with the Due Process Clause, requires that each of the material elements of a crime be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. __, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013); Hurst v. Florida, 136 S.Ct. 616, 621, 193 L.Ed.2d 504 (2016). The test for the sufficiency of the evidence involves a question of law for resolution by the appellate court. State v. Walker, 150 Ohio St.3d 409, 2016-Ohio-8295, 82 N.E.3d 1124, ¶30. “This naturally entails a review of the elements\nof the charged offense and a review of the state's evidence.” State v. Richardson, 150 Ohio St.3d 554, 2016-Ohio-8448, 84 N.E.3d 993, ¶13.\n\n¶53 When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court does not ask whether the evidence should be believed. State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus: Walker, at ¶30. “The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jenks at paragraph two of the syllabus. State v. Poutney, 153 Ohio St.3d 474, 2018-Ohio-22, 97 N.E.3d 478, ¶19. Thus, “on review for evidentiary sufficiency we do not second-guess the jury's credibility determinations; rather, we ask whether, 'if believed, [the evidence] would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.'” State v. Murphy, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 543, 747 N.E.2d 765 (2001), quoting Jenks at paragraph two of the syllabus (emphasis added); Walker at ¶31. We will not “disturb a verdict on appeal on sufficiency grounds unless'reasonable minds could not reach the conclusion reached by the trier-of-fact.'” State v. Ketterer, 111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, ¶ 94, quoting State v. Dennis, 79 Ohio St.3d 421, 430, 683 N.E.2d 1096 (1997); State v. Montgomery, 148 Ohio St.3d 347, 2016-Ohio-5487, 71 N.E.3d 180, ¶74.\n\nISSUE FOR APPEAL\n\na. Whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence, “if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt on each element of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.”\nThere is no dispute in the case at bar that Ivan Munford was shot to death as alleged in the indictment. Shanklin's main argument is that there was insufficient evidence to identify him as the perpetrator of the crimes.\n\nAs we have noted the evidence presented during trial established White drove to Burns' house and purchased marijuana from Munford. White left the house at approximately 12:15 A.M. Shortly after White left, Munford walked out of the front of the house, got cologne and other belongings from his truck. When he went back up the hill to meet Burns he was shot multiple times with a Sig Sauer firearm. The shots were fired within a distance of 6-12 inches. The coroner testified that the fatal head wound would result in immediate unconsciousness and loss of mobility. Munford's cell phone, truck keys and cologne were found at the top of the hill in the grass in front of the house. The tracks in the grass indicate that after Munford was shot, he dropped and rolled down the hill and onto the sidewalk.\n\nShanklin, a felon on parole in Illinois for attempted murder, traveled south from Springfield, Illinois to an area near Motel 6 in North Canton off I-77. At the time of the murder, Shanklin's cell phone was near the cell phone tower closest to the murder scene (i.e. within 2.5 miles) and there were at least two phone calls between Walker and Shanklin at or near the time of the murder. One call occurred at 11:56 P.M. and the other occurred at 12:17 P.M.\n\nEric Thomsen testified that he found a pair of sandals placed at the entrance to his home. Thomsen's home is directly across the street from the murder. Thomsen had arrived home at 9 P.M. and the sandals were not there. He testified that the sandals had to be placed there sometime after 9:00 P.M. Further, sometime around midnight,\nThomsen heard two people talking, looked and saw two dark shadows, heard a shot and saw a flash. Thomsen found the suspicious sandals when he went downstairs to find out what was going on across the street. Forensic analysis established that Shanklin was the major contributor of the DNA recovered from the sandals. In fact forensics established that this DNA match occurred in one out of seven billion possible contributors.\n\n¶58 In addition, the two black socks pointed to Shanklin. One sock contained DNA consistent with Shanklin. Forensics established that the match was consistent with Shanklin within one and one trillion possible contributors.\n\n¶59 Within nine hours of the murder, at around 8:30 A.M. Shanklin's phone left the vicinity of Motel 6 and traveled via I-77 south back to Springfield, Illinois. The next day the cell phone account was terminated.\n\n¶60 A Stark County Deputy recovered the murder weapon under an I-77 overpass near Belden Village and on the same route traveled by Shanklin's phone. A forensic investigator from BCI compared the seven cartridge casings recovered from the scene and the bullet recovered from Munford's body with the Sig Sauer. The scientist testified that the bullet casings and bullet had been fired from the Sig Sauer to the exclusion of all other guns.\n\n¶61 At the time of the murder, Allen Walker's phone was near Meyer's Lake. All effort to find Allen Walker for further questioning has been unsuccessful. No plausible explanation was given for the presence of Shanklin's cell phone and DNA at the murder scene.\n\n¶62 Viewing the evidence in the case at bar in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that a reasonable person could have found beyond a\nreasonable doubt that Shanklin shot Munford. We hold, therefore, that the state met its burden of production regarding the identification of the shooter as Shanklin and accordingly, there was sufficient evidence to support Shanklin’s convictions.\n\n2). Manifest Weight of the Evidence.\n\n{¶63} When an appellate court considers a claim that a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the court must dutifully examine the entire record, weigh the evidence, and consider the credibility of witnesses. State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386–387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), superseded by constitutional amendment on other grounds as stated by State v. Smith, 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 684 N.E.2d 668, 1997–Ohio–355. The reviewing court must bear in mind, however, that credibility generally is an issue for the trier of fact to resolve. State v. Issa, 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 67, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001); State v. Murphy, 4th Dist. Ross No. 07CA2953, 2008–Ohio–1744, ¶ 31. Because the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses and is particularly competent to decide whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses, the appellate court must afford substantial deference to its determinations of credibility. Barberton v. Jenney, 126 Ohio St.3d 5, 2010–Ohio–2420, 929 N.E.2d 1047, ¶ 20, superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in In re Z.E.N., 4th Dist. Scioto No. 18CA3826, 2018-Ohio-2208, ¶27.\n\n“[I]n determining whether the judgment below is manifestly against the weight of the evidence, every reasonable intendment and every reasonable presumption must be made in favor of the judgment and the finding of facts.\n\n***\n“If the evidence is susceptible of more than one construction, the reviewing court is bound to give it that interpretation which is consistent with the verdict and judgment, most favorable to sustaining the verdict and judgment.”\n\nSeasons Coal Co., Inc. v. Cleveland, 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 461 N.E.2d 1273 (1984), fn. 3, quoting 5 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d, Appellate Review, Section 60, at 191–192 (1978). Thus, an appellate court will leave the issues of weight and credibility of the evidence to the fact finder, as long as a rational basis exists in the record for its decision. State v. Picklesimer, 4th Dist. Pickaway No. 11CA9, 2012–Ohio–1282, ¶ 24.\n\n{¶64} Once the reviewing court finishes its examination, an appellate court may not merely substitute its view for that of the jury, but must find that “the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.” State v. Thompkins, supra, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387, quoting State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717, 720–721(1st Dist. 1983). Accordingly, reversal on manifest weight grounds is reserved for “the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.” Id.\n\nISSUE FOR APPEAL\n\nb. Whether the trier of fact court clearly lost her way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\n\n{¶65} The jury as the trier of fact was free to accept or reject any and all of the evidence offered by the parties and assess the witness's credibility. “While the trier of fact may take note of the inconsistencies and resolve or discount them accordingly * * * such inconsistencies do not render defendant's conviction against the manifest weight or\nsufficiency of the evidence.” State v. Craig, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 99AP–739, 1999 WL 29752 (Mar 23, 2000) citing State v. Nivens, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 95APA09–1236, 1996 WL 284714 (May 28, 1996). Indeed, the trier of fact need not believe all of a witness’ testimony, but may accept only portions of it as true. State v. Raver, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 02AP–604, 2003–Ohio–958, ¶ 21, citing State v. Antill, 176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 197 N.E.2d 548 (1964); State v. Burke, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 02AP–1238, 2003–Ohio–2889, citing State v. Caldwell, 79 Ohio App.3d 667, 607 N.E.2d 1096 (4th Dist. 1992). Although the evidence may have been circumstantial, we note that circumstantial evidence has the same probative value as direct evidence. State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 272, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph one of the syllabus, superseded by State constitutional amendment on other grounds as stated in State v. Smith, 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 102 at n.4, 684 N.E.2d 668 (1997).\n\n¶66 In the case at bar, the jury heard the witnesses, viewed the evidence and heard Shanklin’s statement to the police as well as his attorney’s arguments and explanations about his actions. Thus, a rational basis exists in the record for the jury’s decision.\n\n¶67 We find that this is not an “‘exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.’” State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386–387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), quoting Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 485 N.E.2d 717. Based upon the foregoing and the entire record in this matter we find Shanklin’s convictions are not against the sufficiency or the manifest weight of the evidence. To the contrary, the jury appears to have fairly and impartially decided the matters before them. The jury heard the witnesses, evaluated the evidence, and was convinced of Shanklin’s guilt.\nThe jury neither lost his way nor created a miscarriage of justice in convicting Shanklin.\n\nFinally, upon careful consideration of the record in its entirety, we find that there is substantial evidence presented which if believed, proves all the elements of the crimes for which Shanklin was convicted.\n\nShanklin’s Second Assignment of Error is overruled."}

B, Sheriff Pickenpaugh’s recorded conversation with Officer Stoney, was impermissible hearsay which should have been excluded. The admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and the court’s decision will only be reversed upon a showing of abuse of discretion. But when no objection to evidence is raised at trial, all but plain error is waived. Hearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Ex. B was played in its entirety at trial. In this recording, Officer Stoney informed Sheriff Pickenpaugh of all of the details of his two previous conversations with appellant. The conversations were about events between A.B. and appellant and appellant’s interview with the Noble County Sheriff’s Office. Ex. B contained out of court statements by Officer Stoney. These statements were offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matters asserted. Namely, that A.B. told appellant they were not going to have sex and appellant began having sex with A.B. when she was asleep and after A.B. told appellant no. But the state argues that Ex. B is not hearsay under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b). A statement is not hearsay if “[t]he declarant testifies at trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is * * * consistent with declarant’s testimony and is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive[.]” Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b). The state argues that appellant made a charge of recent fabrication against Officer Stoney during opening statements. During opening statements, appellant’s counsel told the jury: “[C]losely listen to the testimony of Mr. Stoney, and you will find out about his inner relationship not only with Mr. Hayes, but with the sheriff’s department, and what the inconsistencies are in his statement. What he told the sheriff’s department was never recorded. The evidence that he will testify to is that Mr. Hayes admitted committing the crime. However, when Mr. Hayes is clandestinely recorded, he doesn’t know they are wired up so to speak, they are having a phone call, and he doesn’t say any of the things that he told the sheriff’s department * * *.” (Tr. 11). The comments during appellant’s opening statement are an implied charge of recent fabrication against Officer Stoney. Officer Stoney testified at trial about the conversations he had with appellant concerning A.B. According to Officer Stoney, when appellant arrived at A.B.’s home, A.B. told appellant “nothing’s happening.” (Tr. 105). He testified that appellant told him “[t]hey were in bed, and he said that she falls asleep. He says - - he said I pulled her pants down and stuck it in her, he said, but I can’t say that; I didn’t say that to them.” (Tr. 105). Appellant also asked Officer Stoney how to beat a polygraph test. After this testimony, the state played Ex. B in its entirety. Officer Stoney’s testimony at trial and his statements in Ex. B were consistent. Appellant’s opening statement implied that Officer Stoney’s recollection about what appellant told him happened regarding A.B. was a recent fabrication. Ex. B was offered to rebut that charge. Therefore, it was not hearsay pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b)."}

Despite the trial court instructing the jury to disregard any mention of polygraphs, counsel for the prosecutor made one reference to a polygraph test near the end of its closing argument. The state concedes that this reference was error. Proceeding under a plain error analysis, we must now address whether, but for this statement, the outcome of the trial would have been otherwise. The single polygraph reference in the state’s closing argument did not prejudice appellant. First, polygraphs were mentioned throughout the trial, including by appellant’s trial counsel. Second, the trial court instructed the jury not to consider polygraphs for any reason. Third, the context of the state’s reference is not that appellant failed a polygraph or refused to take a polygraph. The state was arguing that appellant’s version of events was subject to change.

Appellant also argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel failed to object to testimony that indicated that he was jailed during his trial.\n\nThe state argues that all of the prosecutor’s comments were proper. As such, trial counsel could not be ineffective for failing to object. The state also notes that the jail comment was a single reference made during the victim’s testimony. As it is unreasonable to assume that a jury would believe that a person facing a criminal trial would not likely be incarcerated at some point during the proceedings, such a comment cannot be prejudicial.\n\nIn order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an appellant must show that his counsel’s performance was deficient and that he was prejudiced by the deficiency. State v. White, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 13 JE 33, 2014-Ohio-4153, ¶ 18, citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d\nIn order to demonstrate prejudice, “[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” State v. Lyons, 7th Dist. Belmont No. 14 BE 28, 2015-Ohio-3325, ¶ 11, citing Strickland at 694.\n\nAs to the state’s comments regarding Appellant and the victim’s credibility, as previously discussed, neither of these comments were improper. Thus, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object.\n\nThe reference to Appellant’s incarceration arose during the victim’s testimony. On direct examination, the state asked the victim whether she was afraid after the incident, to which she replied: “I mean, I’m not fearful, because I know he’s in jail, but I mean, that whole summer, when he was not, I didn’t leave my house except to go to work.” (Tr., p. 284.)\n\n“Courts have held that verbal references to the jail status of a defendant are improper and potentially prejudicial because they erode the presumption of innocence, for the same reason that wearing prison or jail clothing does.” State v. Stroermer, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2017-CA-93, 2018-Ohio-4522, ¶ 35, citing State v. Watters, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 82451, 2004-Ohio-2405, ¶ 15-16.\n\nHowever, Ohio courts have held that a single isolated comment that defendant is jailed is not enough to demonstrate prejudice. Stroermer, supra, at ¶ 35, citing State v. Sharp, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2009-09-236, 2010-Ohio-3470; State v. Gaona, 5th Dist. Licking No. 11 CA 61, 2012-Ohio-3622. Where there is no reasonable\npossibility that unlawful testimony contributed to a conviction, the error is harmless and therefore will not be grounds for reversal. *State v. Howard-Ross*, 2015-Ohio-4810, 44 N.E.3d 304 (7th Dist.), citing *State v. Lytle*, 48 Ohio St.2d 391, 358 N.E.2d 623 (1976), paragraph three of the syllabus, vacated on other grounds in *Lytle v. Ohio*, 438 U.S. 910, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1978).\n\n{¶37} Here, the reference to Appellant's incarceration was a single isolated reference within the victim's lengthy testimony. Further, the comment was an innocent response to a question which was designed only to determine if the victim was afraid of Appellant.\n\n{¶38} The Ohio Supreme Court has noted that “experienced trial counsel learn that objections to each potentially objectionable event could actually act to their party's detriment.” *State v. Johnson*, 112 Ohio St.3d 210, 2006-Ohio-6404, 858 N.E.2d 1144, ¶ 140, citing *Lundgren v. Mitchell*, 440 F.3d 754, 774 (6th Cir.2006). As such, defense counsel's decision not to move to strike an answer can be a trial tactic to prevent emphasizing the information inadvertently elicited. *State v. Fuller*, 7th Dist.

A trial court has broad discretion in dealing with the juror contact and determining whether to declare a mistrial; the granting of a mistrial is necessary only when a fair trial is no longer possible. Id.\n\n¶16 Appellant’s application for reopening states: a juror was approached during trial; he tainted other jurors by discussing the encounter; some jurors felt intimidated and unsure of whether they could be impartial; and defense counsel unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial on these grounds. The trial court conducted a hearing on the matter. The reporting juror said he walked past a person who “very lightly” said, “You’re on the jury? You gotta be fair.” (Tr. 1035). This juror said he could be impartial and had no concerns, adding, “I did not take it severely at all.” (Tr. 1036- 1037). Other jurors overheard him mentioning the event to another jury member.\n\n¶17 The court individually questioned the other jurors and informed them their addresses were not public, no photographs or cell phones were allowed in the courtroom, and deputies would escort them to their vehicles. In seeking a mistrial, defense counsel pointed to reservations expressed by two jurors on whether they could be fair and impartial. (Tr. 1091-1092). For instance, one juror was concerned that courtroom spectators stared at her in the parking lot. All jurors ultimately answered they could render a verdict solely on the evidence and be impartial. The court declared its satisfaction that the jury could be fair and impartial based on its evaluation of them during the independent questioning. (Tr. 1091). The trial judge was in the best position to observe the jurors as they were being questioned and was permitted to rely on the jurors’ answers to the court\nin determining impartiality.

R. 43 AND DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS RIGHT TO BE PRESENT FOR ALL CRITICAL PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, AND ARTICLE I, SECTION 10 OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION.", "extracted_text": "In his third assignment of error, Appellant contends that his exclusion from the proceedings involving responses to the jury’s questions violated Crim.R. 43, which governs the presence of defendants at every stage of the criminal proceedings and at trial, with certain exceptions. He also contends he was deprived of his constitutional right to be present for all critical stages of the proceedings. ‘An accused has a fundamental right to be present at all critical stages of his criminal trial.’ State v. Hale, 119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008–Ohio–3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, ¶100. ‘An accused's absence, however, does not necessarily result in prejudicial or constitutional error.’ State v. Davis, 116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008–Ohio–2, 880 N.E.2d 31, ¶90. ‘[T]he presence of a defendant is a condition of due process to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence, and to that extent only.’ Hale at ¶100; quoting Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 107–108, 54 S.Ct. 330 (1934), overruled on other grounds by Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 17, 84 S.Ct. 1489, (1964). The question is whether his presence has a ‘reasonably substantial’ relationship to ‘the fullness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.’ Id.; quoting Snyder at 105–106. In his brief, Appellant appears to contend that neither he, nor his counsel were present when the trial court considered and responded in writing to written questions submitted by the jury during their deliberations. For instance, Appellant argues that Volume 4 of the trial transcript indicates there were no proceedings held in open court in which he was present during the time in between the jury being released for deliberations and the announcement of the verdict nearly five hours later. A review of the transcript indicates no proceedings were held in open court during that time. However, the State represents that the written questions submitted by the jury were reviewed by the court and counsel, and then ‘returned to the jury following an agreed upon answer by all parties.’ Further, our review of the record indicates Appellant’s trial counsel filed a post-trial motion for a new trial in which he referenced the fact that he was surprised by a statement contained in one of the jury’s questions. Thus, contrary to Appellant’s suggestion on appeal, it appears counsel was present and participated in a review of the jury’s questions and may have even approved the answers provided to the jury by the trial court. We are unable to confirm this, however, as there is no reference to the jury’s questions other than the fact that the jury’s handwritten notes, along with the trial court’s written answers, are taped onto a paper in the trial transcript. What is clear, however, is that there were no proceedings held in open court in response to the jury’s submission of questions. Instead, it appears the trial court simply communicated with the jury via written answers to their written questions."}

The trial transcript includes the handwritten notes from the jury containing questions for the trial court. The first question asked by the jury contained two parts and stated as follows:\n\n“1. If found not guilty on Aggravated Murder Count 1, do we continue to counts 2-4 and Involuntary Manslaughter or just stop at counts 1-4?\n2. If found not guilty on count one, do counts 2-4 still apply?”\n\nThe trial court provided the following response to those questions:\n\n“First proceed through counts 1-4. Then, read the Involuntary Manslaughter instructions on the Involuntary Manslaughter verdict form and use those as a guide to decide if Involuntary Manslaughter should be considered.”\n\nAppellant argues the question posed by the jury indicated “the juror’s confusion over its authority to consider mitigating circumstances as laid out in voluntary manslaughter.” Appellant further argues the answer provided by the trial court “contributed to the confusion and was, therefore, prejudicial error.” However, as we explained in our analysis of Appellant’s second assignment of error, even assuming the trial court erred in instructing the jury on voluntary manslaughter, because Appellant was not entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter we found no prejudice and therefore determined the error was harmless. The same reasoning applies to this argument. Because Appellant was not entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, and the trial court’s response also used the term “Involuntary” as opposed to voluntary. Whether the use of the term “involuntary” stemmed from a substantive misunderstanding by the jury or was simply a transcription error is unknown. However, in light of our disposition of this assignment of error, we find this mistaken reference to be harmless.\nmanslaughter, it cannot be argued that any error in the original instruction or in the trial court’s answer to the jury’s question was prejudicial. Thus, the error does not constitute reversible error.\n\nNext, Appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the jury’s request for a copy of a portion of the transcript containing the testimony of Dwight Haddox. The record indicates the jury sent a written question to the trial court as follows:\n\n“Can we see the transcript of where Dwight Haddox (sp?) said that Justin admitted he emptied the clip?”\n\nThe trial court provided the following response to the request:\n\n“No. You will have to use your collective memories on this issue.”\n\nAppellant argues the trial court abused its discretion in not providing a transcript of Haddox’s testimony to the jury.\n\nIn State v. Carter, the Supreme Court of Ohio considered an argument that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to provide the jury with a transcript of the testimony of a trial witness. State v. Carter, 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 560, 651 N.E.2d 965 (1995). In reaching its decision, the Court noted that because trial counsel did not object to the trial court’s refusal to provide the transcript, reversal would require a finding of plain error. *Id.* The *Carter* Court ultimately found neither plain error nor an abuse of discretion in the trial court’s denial of the transcript to the jury. *Id.*\n\nFurther, in *State v. Dingus*, 26 Ohio App.2d 131, 269 N.E.2d 923 (4th Dist. 1970), this Court was presented with an argument that the trial court erred in refusing to allow the testimony of a witness to be read to the jury, as requested by the jury during deliberations. *Id.* at 132. It appears that the court did not have the requested testimony and did not state its recollection of the witness’s testimony for jury. *Id.* at 134. Instead, the court instructed the jury “to apply testimony from its recollection.” Finding no mandatory or statutory requirement that testimony be read to a jury, this Court found no abuse of discretion. *Id.* at 135.\n\nAgain, as set forth above, the State has represented to this Court that both counsel and the court reviewed the jury’s questions and agreed upon answers to be provided to the jury. Further, post-trial filings by Appellant’s trial counsel indicate counsel was aware of the questions posed by the jury. Additionally, Appellant’s motion for a new trial does not reference any objection to the answers provided by the trial court to the jury. Thus, in line with *Carter*, only a finding of plain error will result in reversal on this assigned error.\nHere, a review of the record reveals that Haddox testified at trial regarding contact he had with Appellant in the days after the offenses at issue herein were committed. Haddox testified that while Appellant was riding in the car with him on the afternoon after the victim was murdered, Appellant stated he had killed the victim. He further testified that Appellant was in the car with him again the next day and was talking with his sister. The following exchange appears in the transcript:\n\n“Q: Did he [Appellant] tell you anything about pulling the trigger?\nA: Something I heard, I don’t know the exact words, but something about emptied the gun.”\n\nQ: Did he tell you anything about being on the run?\nA: I kind of figured after that that he was on the run. I didn’t know. I mean like I said, after all that, and I was by myself, like I say, after it all happened, then it sinks in and started thinking about everything and I thought well, I think that I better go to the Sheriff’s station.”\n\nThere were no follow-up questions on direct examination and no cross-examination regarding this testimony. Subsequently, during closing arguments, the prosecutor made the following statement in reference to Haddox’s testimony:\n\n“Now the next day the defendant finally returned to Pickaway County when he asked Dwight Haddox for a ride to Hagerty Road. And he again had his head down in the car saying, “I emptied the clip. I killed him.”\n\nAppellant contends this statement by the prosecutor was a misstatement and exaggeration of the Haddox’s testimony and the trial court had a duty to give the jury instructions to neutralize the prejudice caused by the prosecutor’s conduct. We initially note that, in our view, the statement by the prosecutor was similar to the testimony of Haddox and did not constitute a misrepresentation or an exaggeration of his testimony. Further, the jury heard the testimony in full and was also instructed that statements by counsel during opening and closing arguments are not evidence. Moreover, reviewing Haddox’s testimony as a whole, we find no substantive distinction between Haddox’s testimony that Appellant said something to the effect that he “emptied the gun” versus the State’s comment in closing that he “emptied the clip.” Thus, based upon the facts presently before us as well as our prior reasoning in Dingus, supra, we cannot conclude the trial court plainly erred or abused its discretion in denying the jury’s request for the transcript and instead instructing them that they must rely on their collective memories."}

Defense counsel’s inept cross-examination of the lead detective regarding his theory of the case resulted in the jury hearing his opinion that Blevins is guilty of murder.”\n\n“3. Defense counsel failed to object to blatantly inadmissible ‘other acts’ testimony that portrayed Blevins as an individual having a propensity for violence involving the use of firearms.”\n\n“4. Defense counsel failed to effectively impeach Dwight Haddox’s testimony regarding his recollection of statements relating to the shooting, failed to object to the prosecutor’s misrepresentation of his testimony, and failed to object to the trial judge’s inadequate response to the jury’s questions regarding the testimony.”\n\n“5. Defense counsel failed to object to a defective voluntary manslaughter instructions [sic] and to the judge’s erroneous response to the jury’s questions expressing confusion regarding the instructions.”\n\nAppellant’s first and second allegations of ineffective assistance both claim that his trial counsel ineptly cross-examined Detective George. First, Appellant argues his trial counsel’s inept cross examination of Detective George led to the jury learning about his post-arrest exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination. A review of the record reveals the following exchange during trial between defense counsel and the detective:\n\n“Q: Were you aware of the fact that my client went to Bret Taylor’s immediately after this murder?\n\nA: I was not aware of that. No.\n\nQ: You weren’t aware of that until today?\n\nA: Today is the first I heard that your client – your client nor Bret Taylor would not speak with me.\n\nQ: Okay. So Bret wouldn’t cooperate?\n\nA: No. He asked for a lawyer.”\n\nAnother exchange took place during later cross-examination as follows:\n\n“Q: Were you present when Mr. Blevins was arrested?\n\nA: Yes, I was.\n\nQ: And what was he wearing?\n\nA: I don’t remember.\n\nQ: He wasn’t wearing red basketball shorts, was he?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: So do you have an explanation of how a guy that wears red basketball shorts – when did you arrest him?\nA: It was like a week later after the murder.\n\nQ: After the murder, a week?\n\nA: Yea. Approximately a couple days to a week.\n\nQ: All right. Do you know where my client went?\n\nA: No. Again, your client wouldn’t speak with me.\n\nQ: Well, I understand that. But in the end here you’ve never investigated where Mr. Blevins ended up within an hour or so after the shooting?\n\nA: Right after the shooting, no. All I know is he had went to McArthur after that.\n\nQ: Well that’s the point I’m making. Do you have any indication that my client left the Arnett apartment driving Bret – do you know if Bret Taylor’s car was there?\n\nA: That I do not know.”\n\nThus, two different times, in response to two different questions, the detective referenced the fact that Appellant would not speak with him, and thus had exercised his constitutional right against self-incrimination.\n\nAppellant concedes that the detective’s answers were not responsive to the questions asked by counsel, but he argues the open-ended manner in which counsel framed his questions allowed the detective to slip his post-arrest silence into his answers. Appellant cites this Court’s prior reasoning in State v. Harper, 4th Dist. Vinton No. 11CA684, 2012-Ohio-4527, for the proposition that an attorney’s failure to take measures to prevent the jury from hearing testimony regarding his client’s post-arrest silence may constitute deficient performance. We noted in Harper as follows at ¶16:\n\n“‘An accused who asserts his Fifth Amendment right to silence should not have the assertion of that constitutional right used against him.’ *State v. Treesh*, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 479, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001), citing *Doyle v. Ohio*, 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). ‘[E]vidence introduced by the state during its case in chief regarding the defendant's exercise of his right to remain silent during interrogation violates the Due Process Clause of both the state and federal constitutions.’ *State v. Perez*, 3d Dist. No. 4–03–49, 2004–Ohio–4007, ¶10, citing *Leach*, 102 Ohio St.3d 135, 2004–Ohio–2147, 807 N.E.2d 335, at ¶16–18. ‘This rule enforces one of the underlying policies of the Fifth Amendment, which is to avoid having the jury assume that a defendant's silence equates with guilt.’ *Id.*, citing *Leach*, 2004–Ohio–2147, at ¶30; *Murphy v.*\nHarper involved an allegation that defense counsel failed to object to repeated instances of the State eliciting testimony that the defendant had invoked his right against self-incrimination. *Id.* at ¶28. Here, however, it was not the State that elicited the problematic testimony, it was defense counsel while cross-examining the State’s witness. Further, the case at bar does not involve a situation where the State was attempting to use Appellant’s silence against him. As noted by Appellant in his brief, the detective’s answers were not responsive to the question asked by defense counsel. Moreover, Harper involved repeated instances of the State drawing the juror’s attention to the defendant’s post-arrest silence, constitutional violations which this Court stated “pervaded the entire trial.” *Id.* at ¶33. Here, there were two quick references to Appellant’s post-arrest silence that were unintentionally elicited during cross-examination, which can hardly be described as pervading the entire trial. Thus, we cannot conclude, based upon the facts before us, that defense counsel should have anticipated the detective’s answer to the question would have included a reference to Appellant’s post-arrest silence. As such, Appellant has not demonstrated deficient performance by his counsel in this regard and, as a result, we find no merit to this portion of Appellant’s argument.\n\nAppellant’s second allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel argues defense counsel failed to object to blatantly inadmissible ‘other acts’ testimony that portrayed him as an individual having a propensity for violence involving the use of firearms. More specifically, Appellant argues that defense counsel failed to object to testimony from Chloe Brady indicating she stopped living with Appellant because she “overheard him behind a closed door and he said he was going to put a bullet in [her] head.” The State does not respond to this allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel in its appellate brief.\nAgain, Appellant admitted at trial that he went to the victim’s house armed with a loaded gun and shot the victim multiple times. Further, he does not dispute that he caused the victim’s death, but only that he acted in self-defense. The State introduced evidence that the victim died from multiple gun shot wounds. Additionally, expert testimony indicated several of the gunshot wounds were sustained while the victim was in a defensive position with his arms up trying to shield himself, and in a downward trajectory, contrary to Appellant’s argument that he shot the victim after the victim knocked him to the floor. Other evidence demonstrated all of the bullet holes and recovered bullets were on the side of the room where the victim was found deceased, and none were found anywhere else, indicating the victim did not shoot first or shoot back. Finally, Appellant admitted he sent a message stating he needed to “take care of some b.s” along with a photo of his gun to a friend, thus demonstrating a propensity for violence by his own actions and testimony. In light of the foregoing, even assuming there was no sound trial strategy that permitted defense counsel’s failure to object, and to instead to ask further questions about Appellant’s alleged statements on cross examination, Appellant cannot demonstrate the result of the trial would have been different. Therefore, he cannot establish\nineffective assistance of counsel in this regard and we find no merit to this portion of his argument.\n\nAppellant’s fourth allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel claims trial counsel 1) failed to effectively impeach Dwight Haddox’s testimony regarding his recollection of statements relating to the shooting; 2) failed to object to the prosecutor’s misrepresentation of his testimony; and 3) failed to object to the trial judge’s inadequate response to the jury’s question.\n\nAppellant first argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to effectively impeach Dwight Haddox in response to the following testimony:\n\n“Q: Did he [Appellant] tell you anything about pulling the trigger?\nA: Something I heard, I don’t know the exact words, but something about emptied the gun.”\n\nQ: Did he tell you anything about being on the run?\nA: I kind of figured after that that he was on the run. I didn’t know. I mean like I said, after all that, and I was by myself, like I say, after it all happened, then it sinks in and started thinking about everything and I thought well, I think that I better go to the Sheriff’s station.”\nAppellant argues his trial counsel admitted in a motion for new trial that had he heard the statement by Haddox about the gun being emptied that he would have objected and then impeached the witness with a recording of his police interview and also called Appellant’s mother to testify to contradict Haddox. Appellant points to the affidavit of Appellant’s mother that was attached in support of the motion for new trial, in which Mrs. Blevins avers that she and Haddox had a falling out and that he made threats that her son would “[go] down.”\n\nConsidering Appellant’s trial counsel represented to the trial court that his failure to object was not trial strategy, and that he would have objected to Haddox’s testimony had he heard it, we conclude Appellant has demonstrated deficient performance by his trial counsel. However, in light of the fact that Appellant admitted to shooting the victim multiple times, as well as testimony from Special Agent Todd Fortner that when Appellant’s gun was found it was kicked back and open, indicating the gun was “completely expended,” we cannot conclude trial counsel’s failure to object to Haddox’s testimony affected the outcome of the trial. Thus, because Appellant cannot demonstrate prejudice, he has failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.\nTurning our attention now to Appellant’s second and third claims, which allege trial counsel failed to make proper objections, we observe that “[a] trial counsel's failure to object is generally viewed as trial strategy and does not establish ineffective assistance.” State v. Teets, 4th Dist. Pickaway No. 16CA3, 2017-Ohio-7372, ¶71; citing State v. Roby, 3rd Dist. Putnam No. 12–09–09, 2010–Ohio–1498, ¶44 (additional internal citations omitted). Appellant notes that in a post-trial motion for new trial filed by Appellant’s trial counsel, counsel stated the failure to object here was not trial strategy. Trial counsel instead attributed his failure to object to “physical inattention.” However, we have already determined under Appellant’s fourth assignment of error that the prosecutor’s reference to Haddox’s statement during closing arguments was generally consistent with Haddox’s testimony and was not a gross exaggeration or misrepresentation. We also determined under Appellant’s fourth assignment of error that the trial court did not plainly err or abuse its discretion in responding to the jury’s request for a transcript of Haddox’s trial testimony with a denial and an instruction that the jury must rely on its collective memories regarding the testimony. Thus, assuming arguendo Appellant has demonstrated deficient performance, we cannot conclude he has demonstrated he has\nsuffered any prejudice as a result. Thus, we find no merit to this portion of Appellant’s argument.\n\nFinally, in light of our determination that Appellant was not entitled to a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter, we summarily reject Appellant’s fifth claim of ineffective of counsel, which alleges trial counsel was ineffective based upon his failure to object to defective voluntary manslaughter instructions."}

The State contends the evidence taken as a whole clearly pointed to the jury’s finding of guilt on all counts, and that there is nothing in the record to suggest the jury lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. We begin with a look at the proper standard of review for manifest weight challenges.\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nWhen an appellate court considers a claim that a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the court must dutifully examine the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, and consider the witness credibility. *State v. Dean*, 146 Ohio St.3d 106, 2015–Ohio–4347, 54 N.E.3d 80, ¶151; citing *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). A reviewing court must bear in mind, however, that credibility generally is an issue for the trier of fact to resolve. *State v. Issa*, 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 67, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001); *State v. Murphy*, 4th Dist. Ross No. 07CA2953, 2008–Ohio–1744, ¶31. “‘Because the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses and is particularly competent to decide “whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses,” we must afford substantial deference to its determinations of credibility.’” *Barberton v. Jenney*, 126 Ohio St.3d 5, 2010–Ohio–2420, 929 N.E.2d 1047, ¶20; quoting *State v. Konya*, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 21434, 2006–Ohio–6312, ¶6; quoting *State v. Lawson*, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684 (Aug. 22, 1997). As the court explained in *Eastley v. Volkman*, 132 Ohio St.3d 328, 2012–Ohio–2179, 972 N.E.2d 517, at ¶21:\n\n“‘[I]n determining whether the judgment below is manifestly against the weight of the evidence, every reasonable intendment must be made in favor of the judgment and the finding of facts.\n\n* * *\nIf the evidence is susceptible of more than one construction, the reviewing court is bound to give it that interpretation which is consistent with the verdict and judgment, most favorable to sustaining the verdict and judgment.’ *Id.* at ¶21, 972 N.E.2d 517, quoting 5 Ohio Jurisprudence 3d, Appellate Review, Section 60, at 191–192 (1978).”\n\nThus, an appellate court will leave the issues of weight and credibility of the evidence to the fact-finder, as long as a rational basis exists in the record for its decision. *State v. Picklesimer*, 4th Dist. Pickaway No. 11CA9, 2012–Ohio–1282, ¶24; accord *State v. Howard*, 4th Dist. Ross No. 07CA2948, 2007–Ohio–6331, ¶6 (“We will not intercede as long as the trier of fact has some factual and rational basis for its determination of credibility and weight.”).\n\n{¶72} Once the reviewing court finishes its examination, the court may reverse the judgment of conviction only if it appears that the fact-finder, when resolving the conflicts in evidence, “‘clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.’” *Thompkins* at 387; quoting *State v. Martin*, 20\nOhio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983). If the prosecution presented substantial credible evidence upon which the trier of fact reasonably could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the essential elements of the offense had been established, the judgment of conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. *E.g.*, *State v. Eley*, 56 Ohio St.3d 169, 383 N.E.2d 132, syllabus (1978), superseded by state constitutional amendment on other grounds in *State v. Smith*, 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 684 N.E.2d 668 (1997). *Accord Eastley* at ¶12; quoting *Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387; quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1594 (6th ed.1990) (explaining that a judgment is not against the manifest weight of the evidence when “‘the greater amount of credible evidence’” supports it).\n\nThus, “‘[w]hen conflicting evidence is presented at trial, a conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence simply because the jury believed the prosecution testimony.’” *State v. Cooper*, 170 Ohio App.3d 418, 2007–Ohio–1186, 867 N.E.2d 493, ¶17; quoting *State v. Mason*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 21397, 2003–Ohio–5785, ¶17; quoting *State v. Gilliam*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 97CA006757 (Aug. 12, 1998). Instead, a reviewing court should find a conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence only in the “‘exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the\nconviction.”” *Thompkins* at 387; quoting *Martin* at 175. *Accord State v. Lindsey*, 87 Ohio St.3d 479, 483, 721 N.E.2d 995 (2000).\n\n{¶73} In the case presently before us, Appellant has disputed the jury’s determination he murdered the victim with prior calculation and design. However, we have already rejected Appellant’s argument that the finding of prior calculation and design was not supported by sufficient evidence. Further, Appellant does not dispute that he purposely killed the victim, which serves as the basis for his aggravated murder, murder and felonious assault convictions. Instead, he argues that the jury committed a manifest miscarriage of justice by rejecting his claim of self-defense. He also argues the jury created a manifest miscarriage of justice by rejecting his argument that he acted in a fit of sudden passion or rage as a result of provocation. However, as set forth above, we have already determined that Appellant was not entitled to a voluntary manslaughter instruction, even based upon his own version of events. Thus, we limit our review to whether the jury committed a manifest miscarriage of justice by rejecting his claim of self-defense.\n\n**SELF-DEFENSE**\n\n{¶74} “Self-defense is an affirmative defense that, if proved, relieves a defendant of criminal liability for the force that the defendant used.” *State\nv. Kozlosky, 195 Ohio App.3d 343, 2011–Ohio–4814, 959 N.E.2d 1097, ¶22.\n\n“‘The burden of going forward with the evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, for an affirmative defense, is upon the accused.’” State v. Nucklos, 121 Ohio St.3d 332, 2009–Ohio–792, 904 N.E.2d 512, ¶7; quoting R.C. 2901.05(A). We observe that affirmative defenses such as self-defense “‘do not seek to negate any of the elements of the offense which the State is required to prove’ but rather they ‘admit[ ] the facts claimed by the prosecution and then rely on independent facts or circumstances which the defendant claims exempt him from liability.’” State v. Smith, 3rd Dist. Logan No. 8–12–05, 2013–Ohio–746, ¶32; quoting State v. Martin, 21 Ohio St.3d 91, 94, 488 N.E.2d 166 (1986).\n\n{¶75} To establish self-defense, a defendant must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the following three circumstances:\n\n“(1) the defendant was not at fault in creating the violent situation, (2) the defendant had a bona fide belief that she was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that her only means of escape was the use of force, and (3) that the defendant did not violate any duty to retreat or avoid the danger.” State v. Goff, 128 Ohio St.3d 169, 2010–Ohio–6317,\n942 N.E.2d 1075, ¶36; quoting State v. Thomas, 77 Ohio St.3d 323, 326, 673 N.E.2d 1339 (1997).\n\nThe “elements of self-defense are cumulative. * * * [Thus, i]f the defendant fails to prove any one of these elements by a preponderance of the evidence he has failed to demonstrate that he acted in self-defense.” State v. Jackson, 22 Ohio St.3d 281, 284, 490 N.E.2d 893 (1986). Accord State v. Cassano, 96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002–Ohio–3751, 772 N.E.2d 81, ¶73; State v. Hargrave, 4th Dist. Adams No. 11CA907, 2012–Ohio–798, ¶16.\n\nLEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n{¶76} With regard to the first element, which considers whether Appellant was at fault in creating the violent situation, the State’s theory at trial was that Appellant entered the victim’s residence by force and shot him to death with prior calculation and design. In support of its theory the State relied upon evidence of prior text messages sent by Appellant that included a photo of a gun in his possession, which was later identified as the murder weapon. We have already determined the jury’s finding of prior calculation and design was supported by sufficient evidence. Appellant contends, on the other hand, that he simply went to the victim’s residence at 5:00 in the morning to pay him $700.00 worth of money he owed, armed with a gun he usually carried for his own protection, and that the victim initiated a physical\nconfrontation and pushed Appellant to the ground. Believing the victim to be armed, based upon prior threats made by the victim, Appellant claims he shot first lest he be shot. Appellant argues the text messages and witness testimony introduced at trial “affirmatively established threatening, provocative behavior on the part of the decedent” towards Appellant. He also alleged the text messages that included the photo of his gun were sent in reference to a disagreement with someone else, not the victim, and thus had no bearing on the actions he took on the night in question. Appellant settles upon an argument that the “real issue” is whether the shooting was fully justified as an act of self-defense or partially justified as an act committed in a sudden fit of rage due to provocation.”\n\n¶77 We initially note that Appellant’s arguments that he acted both 1) in self-defense out of fear; and 2) in a sudden fit of rage due to provocation, seem to be somewhat contradictory, as the underlying motivations for actions resulting from fear versus provocation differ. Other courts have reasoned that, at a minimum, fear is insufficient to demonstrate the emotional states of passion or sudden fit of rage. See State v. Ramey, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 27636, 2018-Ohio-3072, ¶36 (concluding the appellant was not overcome by sudden passion or a sudden fit of rage, based upon the testimony, because “fear is insufficient to demonstrate the\nemotional states of sudden passion or a fit of rage.”); quoting State v. Williams, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 11 JE 7, 2012-Ohio-5256, ¶24; Accord State v. Beatty-Jones, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24245, 2011-Ohio-3719, ¶30. Further, this Court has held that “evidence supporting the privilege of self-defense, i.e., that the defendant feared for [her] own and [others’] personal safety, does not constitute sudden passion or a fit of rage as contemplated by the voluntary manslaughter statute.” State v. Goff, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 11CA20, 2013-Ohio-42, ¶52; citing State v. Harris, 129 Ohio App.3d 527, 535, 718 N.E.2d 488 (10th Dist.1998). As further explained in Goff, “‘While self-defense requires a showing of fear, voluntary manslaughter requires a showing of rage, with emotions of “anger, hatred, jealously, and/or furious resentment.”’” Goff at ¶52; quoting State v. Levett, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C–040537, 2006–Ohio–2222, ¶29; in turn quoting State v. Perdue, 153 Ohio App.3d 213, 2003–Ohio–3481, 792 N.E.2d 747, ¶12 (7th Dist.); in turn quoting Harris at 535 (additional internal citations omitted).\n\n¶78 Again, as we have already concluded Appellant was not entitled to a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter, we limit our analysis to his self-defense argument. We do not believe, based upon the evidence in the record, that Appellant demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that he was not at fault in creating the violent situation.\n\nAccepting Appellant’s testimony as true, Appellant went to the victim’s residence in what was essentially the middle of the night, armed with a gun and anticipating a shootout. Considering the evidence presented at trial, and interpreting that evidence in favor of the guilty, as we are required to do when considering a manifest weight of the evidence argument, the evidence reveals that Appellant went to the victim’s residence after texting a photograph of his gun, along with a comment that he needed to go “take care of some b.s.,” to various other individuals, where he proceeded to shoot the victim multiple times, resulting in his death. Based upon the foregoing, we cannot conclude Appellant has met his burden with respect to the first element of self-defense.\n\n{¶79} However, assuming arguendo that Appellant demonstrated the first element of the affirmative defense of self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence, we move on to a review of the second, cumulative element required to be proven. In a deadly force case, the second element of self-defense requires a defendant to show that the defendant had a bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that his only means of escape was the use of deadly force. See State v. Cassano, 96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002–Ohio–3751, 772 N.E.2d 81, ¶76; quoting State v.\nRobbins, 58 Ohio St.3d 74, 388 N.E.2d 755, paragraph two of the syllabus (1979) (determining that defendant had “no basis for a ‘bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm’ and could ‘escape from such danger’ only by using deadly force”). This second element “is a combined subjective and objective test.” Thomas at 330. The defendant's belief must be objectively reasonable under the circumstances, and he must subjectively believe he needed to resort to deadly force to defend himself. Id. at 330–331. “Thus, the jury first must consider the defendant's situation objectively, that is, whether, considering all of the defendant's particular characteristics, knowledge, or lack of knowledge, circumstances, history, and conditions at the time of the attack, she reasonably believed she was in imminent danger.” Id. at 330; accord State v. Hendrickson, 4th Dist. Athens No. 08CA12, 2009–Ohio–4416, 2009 WL 2682158, ¶30. “Then, if the objective standard is met, the jury must determine if, subjectively, this particular defendant had an honest belief that she was in imminent danger.” Thomas at 331.\n\nAnother component contained within the second element is the defendant's bona fide belief that the use of force was “reasonably necessary to repel the attack.” Hendrickson at ¶29; citing State v. Williford, 49 Ohio St.3d 247, 249, 551 N.E.2d 1279 (1990); citing State v. McLeod, 82 Ohio\nApp. 155, 157, 80 N.E.2d 699 (9th Dist.1948). In other words, a defendant must show that “that the degree of force used was ‘warranted’ under the circumstances and ‘proportionate’ to the perceived threat.” Hendrickson at ¶31; citing State v. Palmer, 80 Ohio St.3d 543, 564, 687 N.E.2d 685 (1997).\n\n“If * * * the amount of force used is so disproportionate that it shows an ‘unreasonable purpose to injure,’ the defense of self-defense is unavailable.” State v. Macklin, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94482, 2011–Ohio–87, ¶27; quoting State v. Speakman, 4th Dist. Pickaway No. 00CA035, 2001 WL 315198 (Mar. 27, 2001). Accord State v. Kimmell, 3rd Dist. Wyandot No. 16–10–06, 2011–Ohio–660, ¶20; quoting Hendrickson at ¶33 (“Self-defense * * * is inappropriate if the force used is ‘so grossly disproportionate as to show revenge or as [a] criminal purpose.’”). “[I]t is only when one uses a greater degree of force than is necessary under all the circumstances that it is not justifiable on the ground of self-defense.” McLeod at 157. As we explained in State v. Bundy, 2012–Ohio–3934, 974 N.E.2d 139, 156–58, ¶56:\n\n“‘Any civilized system of law recognizes the supreme value of human life, and excuses or justifies its taking only in cases of apparent absolute necessity. ‘‘[State v.] Pellegrino, 577 N.W.2d [590,] 596, quoting People v. Jones, 191 Cal.App.2d 478,\n12 Cal.Rptr. 777, 780 (1961). Thus, when “‘the character and manner of the [attack] do not reasonably create a fear of great bodily harm, there is no cause for the exaction of human life.’”\n\nId., quoting People v. Ceballos, 12 Cal.3d 470, 116 Cal.Rptr. 233, 238, 526 P.2d 241, 246 (1974).\n\n¶81 As set forth above, we believe Appellant’s claims that he both acted in self-defense out of fear, but also acted in a fit of rage or sudden passion as a result of provocation are somewhat incompatible from a logical standpoint. Although we are limiting our analysis to the question of whether Appellant demonstrated he acted in self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence, we take this opportunity to note that case law tells us, at least with regard to the mitigating claim of provocation, that a “‘victim [is] within his rights in using reasonable force to repel [a] defendant from his home. Thus, his act of [shoving] the defendant could not provide the “serious provocation” to reduce the defendant's conduct from [murder] to manslaughter.’” State v. Ramey, supra, at ¶35; quoting State v. Johnston, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 19019, 2002 WL 1393988, *3 (June 28, 2002).\n\n¶82 Here, the State introduced evidence at trial indicating the victim received multiple gunshot wounds to his arms which were received in a defensive position, with his arms up trying to shield himself. Additionally,\nthe State introduced evidence that the victim sustained multiple gunshot wounds that entered his body from the back and at close range, indicating he was not the aggressor. Further, evidence introduced at trial demonstrated that all of the bullet holes and recovered bullets were found on the side of the apartment where the victim was found, and none were found in any other area of the apartment, permitting an inference that the victim was shot at, but did not shoot first or shoot back.\n\n{¶83} After a review of the record we conclude that here, the jury could have justifiably determined that the character and manner of the victim's attack upon Appellant did not warrant the use of deadly force. Although Appellant may have anticipated the victim intended to eventually use deadly force upon him, Appellant’s own version of events fails to demonstrate that the victim actually used such force upon him that it threatened Appellant's life or placed him in danger of great bodily harm. Instead, even accepting Appellant’s own version of events as true, the evidence shows that the victim pushed, or shoved Appellant to the ground, which led Appellant to fire multiple shots, not just one shot to injure.\n\n{¶84} Further, rejecting Appellant’s version of the events and instead accepting the State’s version of events, which the jury was free to do, the evidence demonstrated Appellant murdered the victim with prior calculation\nand design, with the victim sustaining multiple lethal gunshot wounds, some even from behind. Thus, we do not believe Appellant has proven the second, cumulative element of the affirmative defense of self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence, and as such he has failed to demonstrate that he acted in self-defense. See State v. Jackson, supra, at 284. Accordingly, the jury had a sound basis to reject Appellant’s claim of self-defense.\n\n{¶85} In light of our conclusion that the evidence supports a finding that Appellant used more force than necessary to “repel the attack,” any argument concerning the remaining element of self-defense has been rendered moot. See Jackson, supra (explaining that failure on any element means defendant did not act in self-defense). Therefore, we do not address it. See App.R. 12(A)(1)(c). Further, after our review, based upon the totality of the evidence contained in the record, we are unable to conclude that Appellant's convictions for aggravated murder, murder and felonious assault are against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we hereby overrule Appellant's sixth assignment of error."}

The testimonial evidence that the victim was punched in the nose satisfied the aggravating factor under R.C. 2911.11(A)(1).

State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387 (1997). In doing so, this Court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all of the reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses and determine whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the factfinder ‘clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.’ Id. Nevertheless, a reviewing court must allow the trier of fact appropriate discretion on matters relating to the credibility of the witnesses. State v. DeHass, 10 Ohio St.2d 230 (1967). When applying the manifest-weight standard, ‘[o]nly in exceptional cases, where the evidence ‘weighs heavily against the conviction,’ should an appellate court overturn the trial court’s judgment.’ State v.\nEvidence Presented at Trial\n\n¶12 Kaitlan Jones testified that on April 9, 2017, she was working as a front desk clerk at the Best Western Hotel in Celina, Ohio. Ms. Jones testified that at approximately 4:00 p.m., a man whom she identified as Junod, walked into the lobby and asked for an employment application. Junod then asked Ms. Jones where the restroom was located and she directed Junod to its location. Upon returning to the lobby from the restroom, Junod sat on the couch in the lobby. Ms. Jones recalled watching Junod on the cameras in the lobby while in the office behind the front desk. Ms. Jones observed strange behavior from Junod; specifically that he continued to look in different directions to see if anyone else was present. Upon observing Junod stand up from the couch and approach the area, Ms. Jones met Junod at the front desk.\n\n¶13 Ms. Jones recalled inquiring if Junod had completed the employment application. As she reached out to take the application, Junod aggressively grabbed her wrist, held it down on the desk, and brandished a gun. Ms. Jones testified that the gun was sitting on the counter pointed at her stomach, which especially alarmed her being that she was four and half months pregnant. Junod asked Ms. Jones if anyone else was present. Ms. Jones responded that she was the only employee on\nthe shift, but guests were in the hotel. Junod then demanded money, which prompted Ms. Jones to give him $134.00 from the cash drawer behind the desk. Junod asked Ms. Jones if she knew anything about the two cars in the parking lot and whether there was money inside. Ms. Jones replied that she did not know about either car and Junod left the hotel.\n\n¶14 Ms. Jones recalled being terrified for her life and the life of her unborn child. After Junod left, she grabbed the hotel keys, ran to the employee bathroom, locked herself inside, and called the Celina Police Department. She gave a detailed description of Junod to the dispatcher.\n\n¶15 Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Colin Fuelling of the Celina Police Department arrived at the hotel. He encountered Ms. Jones in the bathroom. He recalled that she was very shaken and quivering in fear. Ms. Jones recounted the details of the incident and gave a description of the suspect to Sgt. Fuelling, who asked to see the footage from the hotel’s surveillance cameras. Ms. Jones contacted Muhammed Khokar, the owner of the hotel, who provided Sgt. Fuelling with the surveillance footage. Mr. Khokar also authenticated the video surveillance footage that was played for the jury and admitted as Exhibit 2 at trial. This footage depicts the events from two vantage points: one from behind the clerk’s desk where Ms. Jones was located during the robbery, and the other from the lobby where both the front entrance and the customer side of the clerk’s desk can be viewed.\nThe video footage shows a man, dressed in jeans, a white and green striped polo shirt, black hooded jacket, and sun glasses on top of his head, approaching Ms. Jones and grabbing her right wrist with his left hand as she takes a piece of paper from him. At the same time, the man brandishes what appears to be a black pistol in his right hand and points the gun at her. The video footage shows that the man continues to hold Ms. Jones’ wrist down on the counter and lowers the gun, eventually concealing it under his coat, while speaking to her. He then releases Ms. Jones’ hand and she walks to the cash register to take out the money. Once given the money, the man walks out the front entrance.\n\nSgt. Fuelling testified that he immediately recognized Junod upon viewing the surveillance footage. He explained that he had encounters with Junod in the past and was familiar with him. While Sgt. Fuelling gathered evidence at the hotel, Officer Gabriel Bartlett with Celina Police Department secured the area and began tracking Junod with his K-9 partner, Peng. While tracking, Officer Bartlett received a call about an unidentified male walking through a nearby residential yard. Michael Staugler was the person who informed law enforcement about this suspicious activity.\n\nMr. Staugler testified that he lives approximately four blocks from the hotel, and on the afternoon of April 9, 2017, he observed a male walking on his property line, which according to him was unusual. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Staugler’s wife received a phone call from a friend regarding an armed robbery in the vicinity and was instructed to stay indoors. At approximately 4:30 p.m., Mr. Staugler recalled looking into his yard where he had seen the person walking, and noticed something white laying on the lawn. He went into the yard to inspect the object and found a shirt and a pair of sunglasses. He explained that he had just been working in the yard prior to seeing the individual and knew the items had not been there before. Mr. Staugler gathered the items and drove them to one of the Sheriff’s Deputies who was investigating nearby.\n\nAlthough he was not able to identify the individual he saw walking on his property, Mr. Staugler was able to give a general description of the person, which matched Junod, and he was also able to identify at trial the green and white striped polo shirt and sunglasses that he found in his yard. The items, as well as pictures of them, were admitted as exhibits at trial, and were similar to those items worn by the man on the surveillance footage. Officer Bartlett further testified that he and Peng were unsuccessful in tracking the suspect that afternoon.\n\nOfficer Ronald Waltmire of the Celina Police Department testified that he arrived at the hotel and observed a ‘very traumatized’ Ms. Jones and recalled that it took her some time to calm down. (Trial Tr. 379). He viewed the surveillance footage and also recognized Junod. Officer Waltmire explained that he encountered Junod on a prior complaint concerning a separate incident on the same stretch of\nroad two months before in February 2017. Officer Waltmire asked other officers to confirm Junod’s identification from photos and then contacted the prosecutor’s office. The decision was made to obtain a warrant for Junod’s arrest. Once the warrant was obtained, Officer Waltmire entered the information regarding the offense into the LEADS-NCIC law enforcement database. In the meantime, Celina Police continued to look for Junod.\n\n{¶21} The next day, on April 10, 2017, Officer Chad Kunkleman of the Lima Police Department was on bicycle patrol when he observed suspicious conduct in the parking lot of a local hotel in Lima known for illicit drug activity. Officer Kunkleman approached a red SUV with out-of-county plates and spoke to the two females seated inside. Officer Kunkleman observed a rolled marijuana cigarette in the driver’s hand. Officer Kunkleman obtained consent to search the vehicle and found a man curled up in the back of the SUV facing the back seat. Officer Kunkleman ordered the man out of the vehicle. He patted the man down and found an Ohio Driver’s License identifying the man as Junod. Officer Kunkleman then learned of the outstanding warrant for Junod’s arrest. Officer Kunkleman returned to the vehicle and found a gun and two cellphones laying where Junod had been situated in the back of the SUV. When Officer Kunkleman picked up the gun and examined it, he realized it was a BB gun. Junod was taken into custody by Lima Police and extradited to Mercer County. The evidence found in Lima was also\nturned over to Celina Police. The BB gun and a photo of the gun were admitted as exhibits and identified by Officer Kunkleman at trial.\n\nDiscussion\n\n¶22 On appeal, Junod claims that his conviction for Aggravated Robbery is against the manifest weight of the evidence because the State failed to demonstrate that the BB gun used during the commission of the offense is a deadly weapon.\n\n¶23 Junod was convicted of Aggravated Robbery, in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), which states:\n\n(A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense, as defined in section 2913.01 of the Revised Code, or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following:\n\n(1) Have a deadly weapon on or about the offender’s person or under the offender’s control and either display the weapon, brandish it, indicate that the offender possesses it, or use it ***.\n\n¶24 Section 2923.11(A) of the Revised Code defines a ‘Deadly Weapon’ as ‘any instrument, device, or thing capable of inflicting death, and designed or specially adapted for use as a weapon, or possessed, carried, or used as a weapon.’ ‘An instrument, no matter how innocuous when not in use, is a deadly weapon if it is of sufficient size and weight to inflict death upon a person, when the instrument is wielded against the body of the victim or threatened to be so wielded.’ State v.\nCase No. 10-18-08\n\nClark, 5th Dist. Muskingum No. CT2018-0006, 2018-Ohio-4789, ¶ 58, citing State v. Deboe, 62 Ohio App.2d 192, 193-94 (6th Dist.1977). ‘The manner of use of the instrument, its threatened use, and its nature determine its capability to inflict death.’ Id. A factfinder may ‘infer the deadly nature of an instrument from the facts and circumstances of its use.’ State v. Vondenberg, 61 Ohio St.2d 285, 289 (1980).\n\n{¶25} Although not a firearm, a BB gun can be a deadly weapon if the BB’s are expelled at a sufficient rate of speed. State v. Johnson, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014CA00189, 2015-Ohio-3113, ¶ 49. Even if the BB’s are not powerful enough to cause death, a BB gun can be a deadly weapon if used as a bludgeon. State v. Bitting, 9th Dist. Summit No. 2017-Ohio-2955, ¶ 13. See State v. Smith, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94167, 2011-Ohio-306, ¶ 25 (finding that whether a ‘real’ looking toy gun or a real gun was used to commit aggravated robbery was not dispositive because the evidence established that the fear of the victims was of such a nature that they were induced to part with their property against their will). If no evidence is presented to show that a BB gun can be lethal in its use, it cannot be presumed to be capable of inflicting death. Johnson, supra, 2015-Ohio-3113, ¶ 50 citing State v. Brown, 101 Ohio App.3d 784 (1st Dist.1995).\n\n{¶26} Here, the State presented testimony from Officer Kunkleman, the Lima law enforcement officer who found the black BB gun in the SUV where Junod\nhad been hiding. Officer Kunkleman stated that first he thought the gun was the same type of weapon he carries on duty, a Sig Sauer P226 9 millimeter. It was not until he picked up the gun, did he then realize that it was in fact a BB gun because it had a CO2 cartridge instead of a magazine. He further explained that the BB gun was not as heavy as his pistol, but it also was not light. Officer Kunkleman testified that based on his experience and training ‘[a] BB gun can inflict physical serious [sic] harm at close range by shooting an eye out, puncture your skin, it can cause physical harm to you.’ (Trial Tr. at 280). He further stated that a BB gun could indeed cause death.\n\n{¶27} Officer Kunkleman testified that a BB gun could be used in a manner other than shooting, ‘you could use it to hit somebody, just like you would a bat or anything else like that.’ (Trial Tr. at 280-81). In addition, Officer Waltmire testified that the specific BB gun found in the SUV was ‘a Powerline pellet gun.177 range.’ (Id. at 408). He further stated that he was familiar with cases in which a similar gun has caused death. He explained that the BB gun can be ‘used to fire, using air cartridge to fire pellets that would cause serious injury or death, could be used as a blunt force object, it could be used for many different ways.’ (Id.).\n\n{¶28} There was also a considerable amount of evidence presented establishing that Ms. Jones believed the gun Junod used during the robbery was a ‘real’ firearm. Aside from Ms. Jones’ testimony stating that she was terrified and\nfelt like her life was being threatened, the 9-1-1 call Ms. Jones made after the robbery was also admitted as an exhibit. On this recording, her voice is shaky and she is clearly overwhelmed by fear. Testimony from the law enforcement officers who encountered Ms. Jones at the scene described her as ‘very shaken,’ ‘quivering,’ ‘very traumatized,’ ‘nervous,’ and ‘it took a while for her to get to the point of calming down.’ (Trial Tr. at 331, 379-80).\n\nBased on the foregoing discussion, we find that the testimony along with the exhibits presented at trial constitute ample evidence to support the jury’s finding that the BB gun used by Junod during the commission of the Aggravated Robbery is a deadly weapon as defined by R.C. 2923.11(A). Accordingly, we conclude that Junod’s conviction for Aggravated Robbery is not against the manifest weight and the fourth assignment of error is overruled."}

Specifically, Junod’s counsel argued that the Junod’s conduct of grabbing and holding down Ms. Jones’ wrist, which constituted the Kidnapping was merely incidental to the Aggravated Robbery. The trial court disagreed and concluded that the Junod’s commission of the offenses were of dissimilar import. Notably in this regard, we observe that the Aggravated Robbery as charged in the indictment only required a theft offense and the possession, use or brandishment of the gun and did not require the use of any force. Moreover, the record demonstrates there were two separate victims in this case, Best Western and Ms. Jones. Both were identified as victims of the Aggravated Robbery offense in the indictment, while Ms. Jones was the sole victim of the Kidnapping offense. We agree with the trial court that these offenses were of dissimilar import not only because there were two separate victims, but also because Junod’s commission of the offenses caused separate and distinct harms; the psychological, mental, or emotional harm to Ms. Jones and the economic harm to Best Western. See e.g., State v. Potts, 3d Dist. Hancock No. 5-16-03, 2016-Ohio-5555, ¶ 98 (separate victims); State v. Johnson, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-16-41, 2017-Ohio-6930, ¶ 18 (separate and distinct harms). Given the facts and circumstances of the case, we find that Junod separately committed Aggravated Robbery and Kidnapping and such are not crimes of similar import under the facts presented. As such, the trial court’s determination that the two convictions were not subject to merger for sentencing purposes was supported by the record, and Junod’s fifth assignment of error is overruled."}

A guilty verdict will not be disturbed on appeal unless “reasonable minds could not reach the conclusion reached by the trier-of-fact.” Id.\n\n¶ 45 In contrast, when reviewing an argument challenging the weight of the evidence, an appellate court reviews the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses, and determines whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the finder of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. Thompkins at 387, quoting State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\nBecause the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses at trial, we must defer to the factfinder's decisions whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses. *State v. Lawson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684 (Aug. 22, 1997). The fact that the evidence is subject to different interpretations does not render the conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence. *Wilson* at ¶ 14. A judgment of conviction should be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence only in exceptional circumstances. *Martin* at 175.\n\nIn reviewing challenges based on the sufficiency and/or manifest weight of the evidence, we are required to consider all of the evidence admitted at trial, regardless of whether it was admitted erroneously. *State v.

Numerous other witnesses, including several police officers, testified that they attempted to contact St. John and to convince him to talk to the police, but that St. John avoided the police until the early morning hours of February 14, 2017. Chelsie and Tyler’s testimony regarding similar statements to St. John were generally cumulative evidence of St. John’s unwillingness to talk to the police. Upon review of the evidence as a whole, there is no reasonable probability that these statements by Chelsie and Tyler affected the outcome of St. John’s trial. In addition, in testifying about their communication with St. John, both Chelsie and Tyler testified that St. John denied any wrongdoing, which was beneficial to St. John.\n\nSecond, trial counsel did not act deficiently when he failed to offer evidence that Brayden had suffered a prior skull fracture in November 2015.\n\n{¶ 85} On November 13, 2017, defense counsel filed a motion in limine, asking the court to prohibit the introduction of evidence of an incident concerning Brayden in November 2015. Counsel argued that the incident was not admissible under Evid.R. 404(B) and should be excluded under Evid.R. 403, because any probative value was substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice. The motion provided the following facts regarding the incident.\n\nOn November 19, 2015, Brayden [ ], the victim in this case, was taken to Children’s Hospital with bruising. He was examined and found to have a subacute skull fracture along with bruising to his face and neck. The doctor stated that his injuries were consistent with abuse. Brayden’s mother was interviewed and told the police she found Brayden behind his playpen when she woke up that morning. It was then that she noticed the bruises on his face and neck. She and the Defendant had slept in the same room with Brayden that previous night. The Defendant was arrested and questioned by detectives. He told them he had got up with Brayden in the middle of the night, changed his diaper and fed him. When Brayden fell asleep, the Defendant put him back in his playpen. He also saw him out of the playpen the next morning when he awoke. The Defendant denied hurting Brayden. The interview of the Defendant with the detectives cannot be located. * * * The Defendant was never charged for injuring Brayden.\n\n{¶ 86} In the motion in limine, St. John’s counsel noted that the State might argue that the November 2015 incident was proof of the identity of the perpetrator or of evidence of a scheme, plan, or system of St. John's causing harm to Brayden. Counsel argued against these possible arguments, noting that the prior skull fracture was subacute, meaning that it was already healing, that it was unknown when the prior fracture occurred, and it was never proven that St. John had caused Brayden's prior injury.\n\n{¶ 87} The trial court apparently granted the motion in limine, as no evidence of the 2015 incident was presented at trial.\n\n{¶ 88} On appeal, St. John claims that the outcome of his trial would have been different had the jury been told about Brayden's complete medical history and the fact that no one was charged for the prior skull fracture. St. John states that Brayden's medical history showed that he was underweight and had lost weight and height between 2015 and 2017, that Brayden always had some injuries and was ‘clumsy,’ and that he was still having occupational therapy for walking and coordination problems stemming from his prior viral infection. St. John claims that ‘just like in 2015, it is more than likely that with this additional medical evidence, the jury could have believed that [Brayden] could have suffered a second skull fracture with no fault on anyone, just like before.’\n\n{¶ 89} Defense counsel did not act deficiently when he failed to offer evidence of the 2015 incident, for several reasons. First, although no one was charged for Brayden's November 2015 injuries, Brayden's medical records clearly indicated a medical conclusion that the November 2015 skull fracture and additional injuries resulted from physical abuse. Had defense counsel attempted to introduce evidence of the 2015 skull fracture and to present it as an accidental injury, the State might have sought to introduce evidence that the November 2015 injury was also from physical abuse and that St. John was suspected of causing that prior skull fracture. Dr. Kamian’s summary of the November 19, 2015 CT scan noted that there were signs of healing in the fracture line at that time and that it was ‘impossible to say the exact time of trauma but fracture usually shows the healing about 2-3 weeks after the trauma.’ The State could have argued that no one was charged in November 2015 simply because the exact timing of the injury could not be ascertained. Evidence of a pattern of physical abuse to Brayden would have been more prejudicial than helpful to St. John’s current case.\n\n¶ 90 Second, there was no evidence at trial to support St. John’s contention that Brayden suffered an accidental injury on February 13, 2017. Dr. Shott and Dr. Vavul-Roediger testified that the skull fracture resulted from the application of ‘significant’ force and described the fracture as ‘massive.’ Both Dr. Vavul-Roediger and Dr. Shott indicated that the skull fracture would more typically be seen with a high-speed motor vehicle accident or a fall from a very significant height/tall building (four or five stories). Dr. Vavul-Roediger concluded that Brayden ‘had a severe brain trauma and that this was the result of inflicted head trauma and physical maltreatment,’ i.e. physical abuse. (Tr. at 740.) Dr. Negin, St. John’s medical expert, agreed that Brayden’s injuries were indicative of inflicted, as opposed to accidental, trauma. (Tr. at 1043.) He stated that Brayden’s injuries were ‘due to direct blunt force trauma of the head being slammed against something and causing the skull to break.’ (Tr. at 1044.)\n\n¶ 91 Third, the record indicates that Brayden’s death was unrelated to his prior head injury. Brayden’s medical records indicated that the 2015 skull fracture had completely healed by February 2017. Dr. Kamian’s supplemental report from December 2017 indicated his opinion that ‘[t]he skull fracture that he observed back in 2015 played no role in the fracture seen in 2017.’ Accordingly, the record suggests that defense counsel could not have reasonably argued that Brayden’s prior skull fracture was relevant to Brayden’s February 2017 injuries.\n\n¶ 92 Trial counsel’s strategy at trial was to demonstrate that Brayden’s injuries could have occurred while both St. John and Kelsie were alone with Brayden and that it was Kelsie who actually harmed her child. This trial strategy was reasonable, and counsel did not act deficiently in electing not to assert that Brayden incurred accidental injuries in February 2017.\n\nC. Failure to Play Entire Phone Call\n\n¶ 93 St. John further argues that his trial counsel acted deficiently when he failed to play an entire telephone conversation between St. John and family members that occurred in December 2017, while St. John was jailed pending trial.\n\n¶ 94 During Detective Bruss’s testimony, the State played a portion of a recorded telephone call that St. John made from the Montgomery County Jail to family members on December 3, 2017. In the excerpt of the call that was played for the jury, St. John told his brother that Middleton ‘knows a lot of details, that’s because I f***ing told him, like a ret**d. That was my fault.’ (State’s Ex. 91 at 14:25-14:33.) St. John argues that his counsel should have played the entire conversation for the jury ‘so that it would be known to the jury that [St. John] never admitted guilt, but only admitted to speaking with Middleton and only told him about the evidence in the case.’\n\n¶ 95 St. John’s entire phone call with family members is approximately 21 minutes long. (State’s Ex. 91.) The initial portion of St. John’s phone call seems to be with his mother, and they discuss the custody of St. John’s child and St. John’s pending case. Approximately 9 minutes into the call, St. John began to speak with one of his brothers. They also talked about different witnesses' statements and the strength of St. John's case.\n\n{¶ 96} After hearing the entire telephone call, we conclude defense counsel did not perform deficiently in failing to play the entire recording. The vast majority of the conversation concerned St. John's and his family's opinions about specific witnesses and the case as a whole, none of which was relevant or admissible.\n\n{¶ 97} During the phone call, St. John did not expressly admit to confessing to Middleton, and he claims that Middleton told ‘lies’ to the police. Defense counsel elicited this information during his cross-examination of Detective Bruss. He asked:\n\nQ: * * * Isn’t it true in that phone call Luke [St. John] disputes some of the things that Mr. Middleton says about the accuracy where the injury occurred and that type – and that fact?\nA: I – I believe so.\n\n***\n\nQ: Detective, isn’t it true that in regards to that telephone conversation and – and Mr. Middleton's testimony that he gave that all Luke [St. John] does is – is admit that he talked to Dustin Middleton?\nA: He admits talking to Dustin Middleton, yes.\n\nQ: Right, but that's it as far as the – that's all he does is just say, I – yeah, I talked to him, was my bad, whatever, correct?\nA: Yes.\n\n(Tr. at 861, 862-863.) Defense counsel acted reasonably in clarifying St. John's\nstatements during the telephone call in this manner.\n\n¶ 98 St. John’s third assignment of error is overruled."}

(See Tr. at 1144, indicating that the parties agreed to the written jury instructions.) Accordingly, St. John has forfeited all but plain error with respect to the jury instructions. In order to constitute plain error, the error must be an obvious defect in the trial proceedings, and the error must have affected St. John’s substantial rights. State v. Norris, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26147, 2015-Ohio-624, ¶ 22; Crim.R. 52(B). Plain error should be noticed “with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” State v.

State v. Grissom, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25750, 2014-Ohio-857, ¶ 31.\n\n“Flight means some escape or affirmative attempt to avoid apprehension. It can take the form of fleeing from the police or eyewitnesses to changing or disguising one's physical characteristics after the fact.” Id., quoting State v. Wesley, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 80684, 2002-Ohio-4429, ¶ 19. Evidence of flight is admissible as tending to show consciousness of guilt. E.g., id.; State v. Wood, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2010 CA 42, 2011-Ohio-2314, ¶ 30. However, “[e]vidence of flight to support an inference of guilt should generally be limited to situations when the activities associated with flight occur at a time and place near the criminal activity for which the defendant is on trial.” State v. Frock, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2004 CA 76, 2006-Ohio-1254, ¶ 57.\n\n¶ 103 At the State’s request, the trial court gave the following instruction on flight:\n\nTestimony has been admitted indicating that the Defendant fled the scene. You are instructed that the Defendant’s conduct alone does not raise a presumption of guilt, but may tend to indicate the Defendant’s consciousness or awareness of guilt. If you find that the facts do not support that the Defendant fled the scene or if you find that some other motive prompted the Defendant's conduct or if you are unable to decide what the Defendant’s motivation was, then you should not consider this evidence for any purpose. However, if you find that the facts support that the Defendant fled the scene and if you decide that the Defendant was motivated by a consciousness or awareness of guilt, then you may but are not required to consider that evidence in deciding whether the Defendant is\nguilty of the crimes charged. You alone will determine what weight, if any, to give this evidence.\n\n(Tr. at 1114; Court's Ex. V; see also 2 Ohio Jury Instruction 409.13.)\n\n¶ 104 St. John argues that the flight instruction was inappropriate, because he could not explain at trial why he was scared to talk to the police without raising an uncharged prior accusation that he had physically abused Brayden.\n\n¶ 105 We find no error, let alone plain error, in the trial court's decision to provide a flight instruction. There was substantial evidence that St. John was present in his apartment when Brayden was found to be unresponsive and not breathing, that he remained in the apartment until Brayden was taken by medics to the hospital, and that he left the apartment – while the others stayed – as police officers responded to the apartment. In addition, multiple law enforcement officers and family members testified that they attempted to contact St. John or actually spoke with St. John in an effort to convince St. John to speak with the police. St. John twice failed to show when he had arranged to meet with officers at different locations. St. John was found at Zack's apartment approximately 13 hours after Brayden was taken to the hospital; St. John was escorted out of Zack's apartment and to the police by his father. The jury could have reasonably concluded that St. John's actions in leaving the apartment and avoiding the police constituted flight.\n\n¶ 106 Moreover, we have commented that an instruction on flight is “all but innocuous.” State v. White, 2015-Ohio-3512, 37 N.E.3d 1271, ¶ 51 (2d Dist.). We reasoned: “[The flight instruction] explains the limited use of the flight evidence and clearly says that the jury may consider [the defendant's] flight only if it finds that he was\n‘motivated by a consciousness or awareness of guilt.’ And even if the jury finds that this motivated him, the instruction says that it still is not required to consider the flight evidence. We do not believe that giving the jury this particular instruction could have affected the outcome of the trial.”  *Id.*\n\n¶ 107 St. John’s fourth assignment of error is overruled."}
{"index": "631-St. John", "allegation_num": "allegation_5", "allegation": "St. John's fifth assignment of error is that the prosecutors engaged in misconduct by asking for an instruction on flight, by presenting testimony of a jailhouse informant, by 'not play[ing] fair' with the medical expert testimony regarding when the injury occurred, and by failing to point out that Brayden had a prior head injury.", "extracted_text": "¶ 108 In his fifth assignment of error, St. John claims that the prosecutors engaged in misconduct by asking for an instruction on flight, by presenting testimony of a jailhouse informant, by 'not play[ing] fair' with the medical expert testimony regarding when the injury occurred, and by failing to point out that Brayden had a prior head injury.\n\n¶ 109 The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the prosecutor’s conduct was improper and, if so, whether that conduct prejudicially affected substantial rights of the accused. *State v. Martin*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22744, 2009-Ohio-5303, ¶ 15. A prosecutor’s conduct during trial cannot be grounds for error unless the conduct deprives the defendant of a fair trial. *State v. Williams*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24548, 2012-Ohio-4179, ¶ 51, citing *State v. Apanovitch*, 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 24, 514 N.E.2d 394 (1987). The focus of the inquiry is on the fairness of the trial, not on the culpability of the prosecutor. *State v. Bey*, 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 496, 709 N.E.2d 484 (1999).\n\n¶ 110 Where it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the trier of fact would have found the defendant guilty, even absent the alleged misconduct, the defendant has not been prejudiced, and his conviction will not be reversed. *See State v. Underwood*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24186, 2011-Ohio-5418, ¶ 21. We review allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in the context of the entire trial. *State v. Stevenson*, 2d Dist.\nFirst, we conclude that the prosecutors did not engage in misconduct when they requested an instruction on flight. As discussed above, the evidence at trial supported an inference that, after Brayden was taken to the hospital, St. John fled from the apartment to avoid the police. St. John may have had a motivation other than consciousness of guilt for leaving the apartment and not wanting to talk with the police. Nevertheless, because the evidence at trial reasonably raised an inference that St. John's actions were based on consciousness of guilty, the prosecutors did not act improperly in requesting a jury instruction on flight.\n\nSecond, we find nothing improper in the prosecutor's calling Middleton, a jailhouse informant, to testify at trial. The record does not indicate that the prosecutors knowingly or recklessly offered untruthful testimony by Middleton. Middleton testified in detail about what allegedly occurred on the morning of February 13, 2017, while Kelsie was at traffic court and the Bureau of Motor Vehicles. His testimony included details regarding the incident that had not been released to the public, and his testimony was generally consistent with other witnesses' testimony. By way of example, Middleton testified that St. John indicated that he put on Finding Dory or Finding Nemo for Brayden; Kelsie testified that she showed of those movies for Brayden and that those were Brayden's favorite movies; Brayden's bedroom was decorated in a Finding Nemo theme. Significantly, St. John admitted to his brother that he (St. John) had spoken with Middleton about the incident and that Middleton “knows a lot of details, that's because I f***ing told him, like a ret**d. That was my fault.”\nThird, the record does not support St. John’s contention that the prosecutors engaged in misconduct with respect to Dr. Kamian’s medical opinion about the timing of Brayden’s injury. As discussed above, St. John had received a report from the prosecution in December 2017, indicating Dr. Kamian’s opinion that Brayden’s injuries occurred between 3 and 6 hours before his surgery. Moreover, as discussed above, we agree with the trial court that Dr. Kamian’s summary of medical findings, which was provided to defense counsel, adequately placed St. John on notice of the basis for his opinion that Brayden’s injuries were caused within that time frame.\n\nFinally, we find no prosecutorial misconduct in the prosecutor’s decision not to inform the jury that Brayden had previously suffered a head injury. To the contrary, the absence of evidence regarding Brayden’s prior skull fracture appears to have been beneficial, rather than prejudicial, to St. John’s case."}

Lester concedes that he did not object on this basis, either before trial or during trial, and is therefore limited to a review for plain error. Pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B), \"[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\" Plain error exists where there is an obvious deviation from a legal rule that affected the defendant's substantial rights by influencing the outcome of the proceedings. State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27 (2002). \"Plain error does not exist unless it can be said that but for the error, the outcome of the trial would clearly have been otherwise.\" State v. Biros, 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 436 (1997). This court should notice plain error with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a miscarriage of justice. State v. Widmer, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2011-03-027, 2012-Ohio-4342, ¶ 84.\n\nJoinder of defendants and the avoidance of multiple trials is favored in the law. State v. Thomas, 61 Ohio St.2d 223, 225 (1980). Joinder conserves judicial and prosecutorial time, lessens the considerable expense of multiple trials, diminishes inconvenience to witnesses, and minimizes the possibility of incongruous results in successive trials before different juries. Id. \"[J]oinder of defendants is proper so long as all defendants participated in the same series of transactions leading to the charges even though not all defendants participated in every act. *** Not all defendants need be charged in each count *** nor would differing levels of culpability among defendants necessarily justify severance.\" State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 88-89 (1990).\n\nCrim.R. 14 permits a trial court to grant separate trials if joinder has a prejudicial effect on the accused. However, the accused bears the burden of proving that prejudice. State v. Coley, 93 Ohio St.3d 253, 259 (2001). \"The test is 'whether a joint trial is so manifestly prejudicial that the trial judge is required to exercise his or her discretion in only one way – by severing the trial. * * * A defendant must show clear, manifest and undue prejudice and violation of a substantive right resulting from failure to sever.'\" Schiebel at 89, quoting United States v. Castro, 887 F.2d 988, 996 (9th Cir.1989).\n\nLester argues that his joint trial deprived him of a fair trial because jurors could have been confused or misled by prejudicial evidence that was only relevant to William's convictions. Lester also argues that his defense was prejudiced because William was permitted to \"leap frog\" Lester's defense case with one of William's witnesses. Finally, Lester argues that jurors may have found him guilty merely by his familial association with William.\n\nThis case involved a conspiracy to commit arson that resulted in a homicide. The state necessarily had to submit evidence of Lester's and William's individual actions in furtherance of the conspiracy to establish its case. Accordingly, much of the evidence that would have been relevant and admissible in a stand-alone trial against William would also have been relevant and admissible in a stand-alone trial against Lester.\n\nTo the extent there was some evidence solely related to William's charges, there is no evidence in the record to support Lester's argument that the jurors were unable to differentiate that evidence from evidence solely attributable to Lester. In this regard, the court specifically instructed the jury on the concept of separate evidence and that it should only consider evidence as it relates to each defendant. This court presumes that jurors\nfollow the instructions provided by the trial court. State v. Vunda, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2012-07-130 and CA2013-07-113, 2014-Ohio-3449, ¶ 73.\n\nThere is no merit to the assertion that jurors may have found Lester guilty simply because of a familial association. As will be addressed in the next assignment of error, the jury convicted Lester on substantial circumstantial evidence.\n\nFinally, there is no support in the record for the argument that jurors could have been confused by the presentation of William's witness, Kim Brooks, before Lester's defense case. Kim was one of William's girlfriends and was with him on the day of the fire. The record indicates that Kim was a reluctant witness and William's counsel had to expend considerable effort to obtain her appearance.\n\nKim did appear on the sixth day of the trial and after the state had closed its case. Although Lester was entitled to present his defense case before William, the parties and court agreed that William could call Kim before Lester's defense case to ensure that she testified. After Kim testified, Lester requested that William continue his defense case. The state objected to that request and the court denied it.\n\nLester does not articulate how Kim's out-of-turn appearance prejudiced him other than to argue that it \"compounded the conflation of issues.\" It is unclear how Kim's out-of-turn testimony could have prejudiced Lester's defense case or deprived him of a fair trial. Kim had no direct knowledge of Lester's involvement in the conspiracy. On this record, Lester has not demonstrated that his joint trial was manifestly prejudicial, nor has he established plain error. This court overrules Lester's first assignment of error."}

Lester had $500 in two checking accounts, was 65 years old, and had been unemployed since 1986. His household income was $1,440 in social security income and $50 in food assistance. However, Lester regularly filled a prescription for 180 tablets of 30 milligrams of Roxicet, which is oxycodone. The evidence was that the street value of Roxicet could be as much as $30 per tablet.\nThe evidence indicated that William, then living in Richmond, Kentucky, was a roofer. He also sold pain pills. He was known to Lester’s daughter, Melissa Jones, as someone who you would look to to accomplish \"dirty deeds.\"\n\nWilliam did not regularly possess a cellular phone. He would instead use the phones of his friends and family, including his brother Stacy’s cellular phone. On December 20, 2015 – eight days before the fire – Lester’s cellular phone records indicated that he called Stacy’s cellular phone. The call lasted 35 minutes. Stacy testified that he rarely spoke with Lester.\n\nTwo days later, William sent Facebook messages to one of his girlfriends, Kim Brooks, a Hamilton resident, stating that he would have \"plenty of pain pills\" the following Monday, or December 28, 2015. In other Facebook messages, William alluded to coming to Hamilton to take care of \"something\" \"very important.\" William arranged through Kim to obtain a ride to Hamilton.\n\nImmediately before Christmas Eve 2015, Lester began moving various items out of his home and into the detached garage structure next to his home. These items included a handmade miniature log cabin, Lester's and his wife Bertha's framed carrying concealed weapon permits, and a decorative butler statue.\n\nLinda Rose testified that she dated William. She did not know Lester or Bertha. However, on December 27, 2015, at 1:38 p.m., a cellular phone associated with Linda Rose contacted Lester's cellular phone. The call lasted 27 seconds.\n\nCheryl Sullivan, Lester's daughter, testified that she and her husband were at Lester's home, 1310 Pater Avenue, on December 27, 2015, helping Lester and his wife, Bertha, get ready for a planned trip to Las Vegas beginning December 27 and returning December 31, 2015.\nOddly, Lester handed Cheryl bills to hold while he was away, including bills for ADT home security, the home mortgage, insurance, and taxes. While they were walking around the home, both Cheryl and her husband noted that various items were missing from their usual locations in the home, including framed photographs of Cheryl and her sister and a cabinet containing various items that was \"mostly empty.\" They had also noticed missing items when they were at the home a few days earlier on Christmas Eve.\n\nCheryl recalled that Lester had packed a Nascar-branded duffel bag and took it with him to the airport. Cheryl also observed that the cellar doors were closed and padlocked with a small \"goldish\" lock. Later that day, Lester called Cheryl and told her that \"in case anything happened\" his \"important stuff\" was located in the detached garage next door to the home.\n\nCourtney Basinger testified that on December 27, 2015, Kim Brooks asked her to drive to from Hamilton to Richmond, Kentucky to retrieve William. For her services, Courtney would be compensated with gas money and oxycodone tablets. She understood that William was traveling to Hamilton to obtain the tablets. That evening, Courtney and Kim drove for two hours to Richmond and retrieved William. William had a gym bag with him when he entered the car. They then drove back to Hamilton.\n\nOnce in Hamilton, William directed Courtney where to park. At approximately 12:41 a.m. on December 28, 2015, the vehicle was parked on Grand Boulevard near Allstatter Avenue and Pater Avenue. A detective estimated a distance of 541 feet between where Courtney stated she parked and the cellar doors to 1310 Pater Avenue. Courtney testified that William left the vehicle and walked by himself towards Pater Avenue. He turned onto the street and disappeared from her view. Courtney estimated that William was gone for approximately 20 minutes, however Courtney's cellular phone records indicated that she was stationary for approximately 11 minutes. When William returned he was breathing\nheavily and was holding a metal gas can, something metal that looked like a padlock, and the gym bag. He gave Courtney the agreed upon number of Roxicet pills and they drove off.\n\n{¶ 36} At 12:56 a.m. an ADT motion detector alarm was triggered at 1310 Pater Avenue. At 1:02 a.m., ADT dispatch contacted Hamilton police to notify them of the alarm. At 1:05 a.m., a Hamilton police officer was dispatched to the home. When the officer arrived he observed smoke coming from the home. He walked around the perimeter of the home and noted that the cellar doors were open. Investigators would later inspect the doors and find that it appeared that the fastening hardware had been pried off.\n\n{¶ 37} Truck 25 of the Hamilton Fire Department subsequently arrived on scene. Patrick Wolterman was part of the Truck 25 crew. The crew, including Wolterman, made their initial entry into the home through the front door. Wolterman perished after the first floor of the home collapsed from fire damage and Wolterman fell through to the basement.\n\n{¶ 38} At 3:15 a.m., William sent Linda Rose a Facebook message stating, \"Babydoll, done with the job. Got to get some rest and call you tomorrow. Love you.\"\n\n{¶ 39} Lester's daughter, Melissa Jones, saw a report of the fire on television and eventually arrived on the fire scene. She called Lester to alert him to the fire and he indicated he was aware of the fire and knew that a firefighter had been hurt. Melissa said he was angry with her for being there and told her to get away from the scene.\n\n{¶ 40} From Las Vegas, Lester contacted his insurance agency to initiate a claim before the office had opened for the day. Lester also contacted fire and police officials and indicated he would attempt to return home early from Las Vegas. He called his travel agent to inquire about booking a return trip. When the agent informed Lester he could book an\n\n---\n\n1. Lester's insurer paid him approximately $72,000 on expenses related to his loss claim before they ceased payments and sued him, asking a court to declare him in breach of his insurance contract for failure to cooperate with their loss investigation.\nearly flight for him and his wife for $375, Lester responded that the tickets were too expensive, and he did not book the flight. Lester later told his daughter Cheryl it would have cost him $2,700 to fly home early. Lester and Bertha continued their Las Vegas vacation and continued gambling, losing approximately $1,700 playing slot machines.\n\n¶ 41 Following the fire, and while still in Las Vegas, Lester made and received numerous telephone calls to various numbers associated with William's use including Stacy's cellular phone, William's mother's phone, and a pay phone that was located within walking distance of the Cove Motel in Hamilton on December 30, 2015. Since the fire, William and Kim had spent several days at various motels in the area and had stayed at the Cove Motel on December 29 and checked out December 30, 2015. Lester made some of these calls with an unregistered, pre-paid, cellular phone that he purchased at a pawn shop in Las Vegas on December 28, 2015.\n\n¶ 42 Lester and Bertha returned as planned on December 31, 2015. They temporarily moved into another residence. Cheryl visited them at this residence and noted the Nascar duffel bag that Lester had taken to the airport still had the airport baggage band attached and securing the handles. She opened the bag and found that it contained the framed photographs which she remembered had previously been on display prominently at 1310 Pater Avenue but had disappeared prior to the fire. During his testimony, Lester accused Cheryl of lying about the Nascar bag.\n\n¶ 43 Melissa testified that she was in jail several months after the fire and Lester visited her on at least one occasion. While discussing the death of Patrick Wolterman during his visit, Lester told her \"I did not mean for that to happen.\" During his testimony, Lester claimed that Melissa lied concerning this confession.\n\n¶ 44 An ex-boyfriend of Melissa testified that in June 2015 he was helping Lester attach siding to the garage next to 1310 Pater Avenue and asked Lester about some\nrenovations that had occurred at 1310 Pater Avenue. Lester then told him that the renovations had occurred because there had been a fire and that he and his nephew had set the fire for insurance reasons.\n\n{¶ 45} The lead investigator, Detective Fishwick, testified concerning his investigation. He was informed that Lester may have taken interior photographs of the home shortly before the fire. He asked Lester whether this was true; coincidentally, Lester said that he found some photographs of the interior of the home on his SD card and that he had taken the card to CVS to have the photographs developed. When the detective asked for the card, Lester provided it but said that the photographs had been deleted while at CVS. However, the detective confirmed that you could not delete images from an SD card using the CVS photograph-developing kiosk.\n\n{¶ 46} The detective provided the SD card to a specialist who was able to recover the deleted photographs. These photographs depicted the interior living spaces of 1310 Pater Avenue and some were dated December 2015. By reviewing the photographs and comparing the items depicted to those items found after the fire and outside of the home, the detective was able to identify multiple unique items that had been removed from 1310 Pater Avenue prior to the fire.\n\n{¶ 47} Another investigating detective testified that he interviewed William after the fire. William denied any involvement in setting the fire and specifically denied that he was in Hamilton at the time of the fire.\n\n{¶ 48} Eventually, Lester and his wife moved into 1304 Pater Avenue, which was previously Lester's rental property. When police executed a search warrant at the property, they found multiple items and mementos that had been in 1310 Pater Avenue prior to the fire and were now on display at 1304 Pater Avenue.\nBased upon the foregoing, and when viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the state provided sufficient evidence to allow reasonable factfinders to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that Lester planned the arson and conspired with William to accomplish the arson, with the purpose of collecting insurance proceeds."}

Lester further argues that because arson under R.C. 2909.03 is at most a third-degree felony and could not support a count of felony murder, the court should have instructed the jury on the lesser offense of involuntary manslaughter.2\n\nIn considering whether to instruct a jury on lesser offenses, a trial court must first determine whether an offense is a lesser included offense of the crime charged. State v. Evans, 122 Ohio St.3d 381, 2009-Ohio-2974, ¶ 13. If that inquiry is answered affirmatively, then the court must proceed to determine whether the evidence in the case supports an instruction on the lesser included offense. Id.\n\nThe test for determining if an offense is a lesser included offense of another crime is “whether one offense carries a greater penalty than the other, whether some element of the greater offense is not required to prove commission of the lesser offense, and\n\n---\n\n2. Felony murder pursuant to R.C. 2903.02(B) requires an underlying offence of violence that is a felony of the first or second degree.\nwhether the greater offense as statutorily defined cannot be committed without the lesser offense as statutorily defined also being committed.\" *Id.* at ¶ 26. The state concedes that the first two prongs of the test are met in this case. This court will therefore review whether aggravated arson, pursuant to R.C. 2909.02(A)(1) and (A)(2) cannot be committed without also committing arson as defined by R.C. 2909.03(A)(2) and (A)(4).\n\n¶ 55 Aggravated arson as defined by R.C. 2909.02 provides:\n\n(A) No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly do any of the following:\n\n(1) Create a substantial risk of serious physical harm to any person other than the offender;\n\n(2) Cause physical harm to any occupied structure;\n\nArson as defined by R.C. 2909.03 provides:\n\n(A) No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly do any of the following:\n\n(2) Cause, or create a substantial risk of, physical harm to any property of the offender or another, with purpose to defraud;\n\n***\n\n(4) Cause, or create a substantial risk of, physical harm, through the offer or the acceptance of an agreement for hire or other consideration, to any property of another without the other person’s consent or to any property of the offender or another with purpose to defraud;\n\n¶ 56 To prove subsection (A)(1) of the aggravated arson statute, the state must demonstrate that the offender caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm to another person. However, the state does not also need to prove that the offender caused or created a substantial risk of physical harm to any property with purpose to defraud, which is required of an arson conviction under the (A)(2) or (A)(4) subsections. Accordingly, aggravated arson\nunder R.C. 2909.02(A)(1) can be committed without also committing arson under either R.C. 2909.03(A)(2) or (A)(4).\n\n¶ 57 To prove subsection (A)(2) of the aggravated arson statute, the state must prove that the offender caused physical harm to any occupied structure. However, the state is not also required to prove a purpose to defraud, as required to obtain a conviction for arson under R.C. 2909.03(A)(2) or (A)(4). Thus, an offender could commit a violation of aggravated arson under R.C. 2909.02(A)(2) but do so without a purpose to defraud and therefore not violate R.C. 2909.03(A)(2) or (A)(4). Therefore, aggravated arson under R.C. 2909.02(A)(2) could be committed while not also committing arson under either R.C. 2909.03(A)(3) or (A)(4). In sum, arson offenses under R.C. 2909.03(A)(2) or (A)(4) are not lesser included offenses of aggravated arson offenses under either R.C. 2909.02(A)(1) or (A)(2).\n\n¶ 58 In addition, a defendant is only entitled to a lesser included offense instruction if the evidence submitted at trial would support an acquittal on the offense charged and support a conviction on the lesser included offense. Stated otherwise, a lesser included offense instruction is only warranted \"[i]f the trier of fact could reasonably find against the state and for the accused upon one or more of the elements of the crime charged and for the state on the remaining elements, which by themselves would sustain a conviction on a lesser-included offense * * *.\" State v. Kilby, 50 Ohio St.2d 21, 24-25 (1977).\n\n¶ 59 For the violation of R.C. 2909.02(A)(1), the state had to prove that the fire caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm to any person. In this regard, the evidence was undisputed that Patrick Wolterman died from the effects of the fire and thus suffered serious physical harm. For the violation of R.C. 2909.02(A)(2), the state had to prove physical harm to any occupied structure. It was also undisputed that the fire caused\nconsiderable physical damage to Lester's home. Thus, the evidence submitted at trial would not support an acquittal on the counts of aggravated arson."}

In the context of this assignment of error, Lester claims two additional errors in the admission of evidence. The admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. *State v. Meredith*, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2004-06-062, 2005-Ohio-2664, ¶ 26. Absent an abuse of discretion, this court will not reverse the trial court’s decision to admit or exclude relevant evidence. *Id.*\n\nLester claims that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing Melissa’s ex-boyfriend’s testimony concerning Lester admitting that he had previously set a fire to collect insurance money. Over objection, the trial court permitted the testimony, finding that it was admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B). This court finds that the trial court acted within its discretion. The statement was admissible as non-hearsay pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(2) and relevant to modus operandi and admissible under Evid.R. 404(B).\n\nLester also claims that the court erred in admitting evidence of his gambling history while in Las Vegas.

Tucker further argues that his convictions were against the weight of the evidence.\n\nThe concept of legal sufficiency of the evidence refers to whether the conviction can be supported as a matter of law. State v. Everitt, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2002-07-070, 2003-Ohio-2554, ¶ 10. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus.

Notice of plain error is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances, and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice. Crim.R. 52(B); State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 164 (1990).\n\nCrim.R. 8(B) allows for joinder of defendants in the same indictment. Joinder of defendants and the avoidance of multiple trials is favored in the law. State v. Thomas, 61 Ohio St.2d 223, 225 (1980). Joinder conserves judicial and prosecutorial time, lessens the considerable expense of multiple trials, diminishes inconvenience to witnesses, and minimizes the possibility of incongruous results in successive trials before different juries. Id. \"[J]oinder of defendants is proper so long as all defendants participated in the same series of transactions leading to the charges even though not all defendants participated in every act. * * * Not all defendants need be charged in each count * * * nor would differing levels of culpability among defendants necessarily justify severance.\" State v. Schiebel, 55 Ohio St.3d 71, 88-89 (1990).\n\nCrim.R. 14 permits a trial court to sever a joint trial and grant separate trials if joinder has a prejudicial effect on the accused. However, the accused bears the burden of proving prejudice. State v. Coley, 93 Ohio St.3d 253, 259 (2001). \"The test is 'whether a joint trial is so manifestly prejudicial that the trial judge is required to exercise his or her discretion in only one way — by severing the trial. * * * A defendant must show clear, manifest and undue prejudice and violation of a substantive right resulting from failure to sever.'\" Schiebel at 89, quoting United States v. Castro, 887 F.2d 988, 996 (9th Cir.1989).\n\nA defendant may establish prejudice sufficient to warrant severance \"'when evidence that the jury should not consider against a defendant and that would not be\nadmissible if a defendant were tried alone is admitted against a codefendant.\" State v. Walters, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 06AP-693, 2007-Ohio-5554, ¶ 25, quoting Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539, 113 S. Ct. 933 (1993). Defendants \"are not entitled to severance merely because they have a better chance of acquittal in separate trials.\" Zafiro at 540.\n\nTucker argues that substantial evidence that was only relevant to Parker's charges could have erroneously and prejudicially implicated him in the conspiracy. Specifically, Tucker points to the evidence of Parker's financial distress, Parker's removal of items from the home before the fire, Parker's continued gambling in Las Vegas after the fire, and other evidence circumstantially implicating Parker in the arson. Tucker argues that because it was undisputed that Parker was in Las Vegas at the time of the fire then jurors may have concluded that the Tucker must have set the fire simply because he was the only other codefendant who was available to accomplish the task.\n\nHowever, there is \"no resulting prejudicial effect when the evidence of each crime as alleged against each defendant is simple and distinct.\" State v. Wyche, 10th Dist. Franklin No. No. 87AP-878, 1989 Ohio App. LEXIS 647, *9 (July 19, 1989). \"In such cases, the jury is capable of separating the proof required for each charge as to the individual defendants.\" Id., citing State v. Roberts, 62 Ohio St.2d 170, 175 (1980).\n\nThe evidence related to Parker's motivation to commit arson and his preparations for the arson are simple and distinct from the evidence related to Tucker's involvement in the conspiracy and there is no indication in the record that the jurors would have had any difficulty in separating the evidence as it related to each codefendant. And because this was a conspiracy, much of the evidence inculpating Parker in the offense was relevant and admissible against Tucker to establish the conspiracy.\n\nAt oral argument, appellate counsel specifically argued the inadmissibility and resulting prejudice from James Parker's testimony. Parker testified that Parker told him that he and an unidentified nephew had earlier set a fire for insurance reasons. This court agrees that this testimony may not have been admissible in a stand-alone trial against Tucker. However, this court does not find that the court plainly erred in failing to, sua sponte, sever Tucker's trial following this testimony. As discussed in the prior assignment of error, the jurors convicted Tucker on ample circumstantial evidence of his role in the arson. Given the substantial evidence, this court cannot clearly find that jurors would have found Tucker not guilty in a stand-alone trial that excluded this testimony.\n\nIn addition, the court properly instructed the jury on the rules concerning the consideration of separate evidence in a joint trial and this court presumes that jurors follow the trial court's admonitions. State v. Loza, 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 75 (1994). Tucker has established neither error nor plain error."}

At trial, Parker's daughter, Cheryl Sullivan, testified that she was at Parker's home on December 27, 2015, helping Parker and Bertha prepare for their Las Vegas trip. She recalled seeing that the cellar doors were closed and locked with a little \"goldish\" color lock. However, when first responders arrived on scene, they found that the cellar doors were open. Detective Fishwick testified that in his inspection of the cellar doors he noted that the base of the original fastening mechanism was still attached to the door. However, it appeared to be missing an eyelet. Additionally, the hasp, i.e., the flat metal piece that fits over the eyelet, which would then allow a padlock to secure the door, was missing. Detectives searched the area and did not recover any of the missing hardware or the padlock. Detective Fishwick further testified that it appeared that the base exhibited evidence of tool marks. Based on these observations, Detective Fishwick opined that the hasp lock was removed with a pry tool, such as a pry bar, to break the lock and open the cellar doors. Detective Fishwick testified that the police subsequently removed the cellar doors from the residence and kept them as evidence. Detectives then decided to attempt to recreate the cellar door break-in. At a local hardware store, they purchased a pry bar and a hasp lock, which consisted of a base, eyelet, and hasp. The base of the purchased hasp lock appears similar, if not identical, to the original base on the cellar door. The detectives then removed the original base and installed the new hasp lock through the original bolt holes. They secured the lock with a padlock, and a detective used the pry bar to quickly break the lock, which was recorded on video. Over objection, the state was permitted to publish the 30-second video demonstrating the state's theory on how the arsonist broke into 1310 Pater Avenue. Tucker contends that the admission of the video was erroneous because there was no evidence indicating the presence of any pry tool or that the fastening mechanism or hasp lock was substantially similar to what was originally on the cellar doors."}

Moreover, this court notes that Linda Rose's anticipated testimony that Tucker was referring to a roofing job would be inconsistent with Tucker's testimony that the \"job\" he ostensibly completed was buying oxycodone tablets from Melissa Jones to sell in Hamilton.\nobjected and the trial court sustained the objection, instructing jurors to disregard the statement. This court does not find that the comment deprived Tucker of a fair trial. As discussed above, the jury convicted Tucker on substantial evidence of his guilt. Moreover, this court presumes that jurors followed the trial court's instructions to disregard the comment. *Loza*, 71 Ohio St.3d at 75.\n\n¶ 62 Next, Tucker argues that the state committed misconduct when the prosecutor encouraged the jury to engage in \"experiments\" with regard to the passage of time. The prosecutor encouraged jurors to \"take out your watches\" and allow 27 seconds to elapse, which was the length of the call between Linda Rose's cellular phone and Parker's cellular phone on the day before the fire. The prosecutor argued that this would demonstrate that 27 seconds was sufficient time for Tucker and Parker to confirm that they were proceeding with the arson plan.\n\n¶ 63 Later, the state recommended that the jurors \"take out a stopwatch and have an 11-minute moment of silence,\" i.e., the time that Basinger's phone remained stationary while she was parked on Grand Boulevard. Tucker objected, and the court indicated that it did not want the prosecutor encouraging jurors to count the passage of time, off the record, and during deliberations. Instead, the court permitted the prosecutor to make his point by holding a five-minute moment of silence during closing argument.\n\n¶ 64 Jurors are obligated to decide a case based only upon the evidence and arguments presented during the trial. *State v. Villarreal*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2004-02-035, 2005-Ohio-1924, ¶ 37, citing *State v. Taylor*, 73 Ohio App.3d 827, 831 (4th Dist.1991). It is therefore misconduct for a juror to engage in any independent inquiry or experimentation concerning the matter at trial. *Taylor* at 831. Juror misconduct is only grounds for reversal if it results in prejudice to the defendant. *Id.*, citing *Armleder v. Lieberman*, 33 Ohio St. 77 (1877).\n¶ 65 This court does not find that juror misconduct occurred or that the prosecutor encouraged juror misconduct. Juror misconduct cases involving experimentation typically involve a juror using extraneous tools, procedures, or methods to test a hypothesis, outside of jury deliberations. See, e.g., State v. Doan, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-940330, 1995 Ohio App. LEXIS 4395 (juror conducted lighting experiment by putting lipstick on her arm to simulate a bruise and tried to see it in a darkened room); State v. Hubbard, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92033, 2009-Ohio-5817 (juror used binoculars to determine how much she could observe from 50 feet away).\n\n¶ 66 Out-of-court experimentation by a juror is improper for various reasons, including that the variables that might affect the outcome are not known or controlled by the court or parties and could differ from the facts in evidence. However, the passage of time is a constant and is also a common experience of everyday life. Therefore, the risks inherent in jurors conducting experiments are not present when asking jurors to consider the passage of time as it relates to the theory of the case. This court overrules Tucker's fifth assignment of error."}
{"index": "634-Gomez", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "The trial court erred to the prejudice of Appellant in denying his motion to suppress in violation of his rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 10 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.", "extracted_text": "¶ 43 In his first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress. As he did in the trial court below, appellant urges that the statements he made to Colwell at the March 15, 2016 interview should have been suppressed because they were either (a) uttered while he was subject to custodial interrogation without having been informed of his *Miranda* rights, or (b) solicited after appellant was informed of his *Miranda* rights and had invoked his right to counsel.\n\n¶ 44 “Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question of law and fact.” *State v. Burnside*, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, ¶ 8. When the trial court considers a motion to suppress, it acts as the factfinder and is in the best position to resolve factual questions and to evaluate the credibility of witnesses. *Id.* We accept the trial court’s findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence, but we must independently determine whether the facts satisfy the applicable legal standard without deferring to the trial court’s legal conclusions. *Id.*\n\n¶ 45 “It is well-settled that when police take a suspect into custody, they are required to give *Miranda* warnings before subjecting the suspect to interrogation.” *State v. Edwards*, 2018-Ohio-1739, 110 N.E.3d 1042, ¶ 8 (6th Dist.), citing *State v. Gumm*, 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 429, 653 N.E.2d 253 (1995). When police elicit statements while conducting a custodial interrogation without first informing the defendant of his *Miranda* rights, the statements must be suppressed and therefore cannot be introduced at trial as evidence of the defendant’s guilt. *Berkemer v. McCarty*, 468 U.S. 420, 428, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984).\n\n¶ 46 “Where a custodial interrogation exists, the State bears the burden of establishing compliance with *Miranda* and a waiver of the defendant’s *Miranda* rights. But the threshold burden of demonstrating the existence of a custodial interrogation rests\nwith the defendant.” (Citation omitted.) State v. Muncy, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21563, 2007-Ohio-1675, fn. 1.\n\n¶ 47 In determining whether a person is in custody, we consider whether a reasonable person would have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave. We consider all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation in order to determine whether the defendant would have felt free to leave. Howes v. Fields, 565 U.S. 499, 509, 132 S.Ct. 1181, 182 L.Ed.2d 17 (2012). Relevant factors in this analysis include the location of the questioning, its duration, statements made during the interview, the presence or absence of physical restraints during the questioning, and the release of the interviewee at the end of the questioning. Id.\n\n¶ 48 Here, appellant argues that he was in custody from the moment he arrived at the police station and was placed in an interview room with an automatically locking door. Appellant asserts that the locked door “completely restricted” his freedom, especially because he was a suspect and was interviewed in an “extremely coercive environment.”\n\n¶ 49 Upon review of the recorded interview that is part of the record, we find that appellant was not in custody during the entirety of the interview. Although the interview took place at the police station, which would weigh in appellant’s favor, it is noteworthy that appellant appeared at the police station of his own volition. The interview was relatively short, lasting approximately 14 minutes. Throughout the interview, Colwell informed appellant that he was not under arrest and was free to leave\nat any time. While the state concedes that the door to the interview room automatically locked, there is no evidence that appellant was aware of that fact, and appellant was not handcuffed or physically restrained in any manner. Additionally, Colwell did not hesitate to permit appellant to leave the interview room as soon as he expressed a desire to terminate the interview.\n\n¶ 50 Taken together, we find that the foregoing facts would lead a reasonable person in appellant’s position to feel free to leave upon request. As such, we conclude that appellant’s statements were not elicited in violation of his *Miranda* rights, and are thus not subject to suppression.\n\n¶ 51 Moreover, we reject appellant’s contention that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to suppress his post-*Miranda* statements elicited after he indicated that he “probably” needed an attorney. In *Davis v. United States*, 512 U.S. 452, 459, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 129 L.Ed.2d 362 (1994), the United States Supreme Court held that the invocation of a defendant’s right to counsel must be clear and unambiguous such that a reasonable police officer would understand the statement as a request for an attorney. “If the statement fails to meet the requisite level of clarity, [*Edwards v. Arizona*, 451 U.S. 477, 68 L. Ed. 2d 378, 101 S.Ct. 1880 (1981),] does not require that the officers stop questioning the suspect.” *Id.*, citing *Moran v. Burbine*, 475 U.S. 412, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986).\n\n¶ 52 In this case, the state contends that appellant failed to clearly and unambiguously invoke his right to counsel when he indicated to Colwell that he probably\nneeded an attorney. As such, the state asserts that Colwell’s continued questioning was permissible, and his post-\nMiranda statements were not subject to suppression. We need not reach the issue of whether appellant’s statement amounted to an invocation of his right to counsel, because we find that the trial court’s denial of appellant’s motion to suppress, even if erroneous, did not prejudice appellant and was therefore harmless.\n\n¶ 53 In State v. Durham, 2016-Ohio-691, 60 N.E.3d 552, ¶ 172 (8th Dist.), the Eighth District articulated the harmless error doctrine in connection with an alleged Miranda violation:\n\n“An error in the admission of evidence is harmless when there is no reasonable possibility that the testimony contributed to the accused’s conviction. State v. Lytle, 48 Ohio St. 2d 391, 358 N.E.2d 623 (1976), at paragraph three of the syllabus. ‘Where constitutional error in the admission of evidence is extant, such error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if the remaining evidence, standing alone, constitutes overwhelming proof of defendant’s guilt.’ State v. Williams (1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 281, 452 N.E.2d 1323, paragraph six of the syllabus.” Id., quoting State v. Jeffries, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 76905, 2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 3834, *9-10 (Aug. 24, 2000).\n\n¶ 54 As articulated below in our analysis of appellant’s third and fourth assignments of error, the state introduced overwhelming evidence establishing appellant’s guilt in this case. As such, we find that there is no reasonable possibility that the\ninformation provided by appellant following his statement that he probably needed an attorney contributed to his conviction.\n\n¶ 55 In this case, Colwell posed two questions to appellant after appellant allegedly invoked his right to counsel. First, Colwell asked appellant where he worked. Appellant’s response to this question had no bearing on his guilt in this case and was therefore not incriminating. After appellant indicated his desire to end the interview, Colwell asked his second question in which he requested appellant’s contact information. The phone number provided by appellant in response to Colwell’s inquiry matched the number associated with the messages that were sent to M.D., which contained incriminating statements that were sexual in nature. While perhaps incriminating, appellant’s contact information was acknowledged throughout these proceedings, and appellant confirmed that the phone number associated with the messages that were sent to M.D. was his own during his testimony at trial.\n\n¶ 56 Because the statements made by appellant following his alleged invocation of his right to counsel were inconsequential to his conviction in this case, and in light of the overwhelming proof of appellant’s guilt established by the remaining evidence that was introduced by the state, we find that any error in the trial court’s denial of appellant’s motion to suppress his post-Miranda statements was harmless. Having already concluded that appellant was not subject to custodial interrogation prior to being informed of his Miranda rights, we find no reversible error in the trial court’s denial of appellant’s motion to suppress."}

An order directing the “exclusion” or “separation” of witnesses or the like, in general terms without specification of other or additional limitations, is effective only to require the exclusion of witnesses from the hearing during the testimony of other witnesses.\n\n¶ 62 The separation of witnesses under Evid.R. 615 is designed to ensure that a witness’s testimony is based upon his or her personal knowledge rather than being influenced by what he or she hears from another witness’s testimony. *State v. Waddy*, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 87AP-1159 and 87AP-1160, 1989 Ohio App. LEXIS 4137, *64 (Nov. 2, 1989). “The spirit of the separation order is violated if counsel or a spectator briefs a witness upon other witnesses’ testimony.” *Id.*, citing *State v. Snowden*, 7 Ohio App.3d 358, 455 N.E.2d 1058 (10th Dist.1982).\n\n¶ 63 During the trial in this case, the state acknowledged having informed Schlievert that the SANE nurse did a good job testifying, particularly with respect to her explanation of the hymen. While this inadvisable discussion arguably violated the separation of witnesses order, there is no indication that the information the state shared\nwith Schlievert prior to his testimony had any impact on the testimony he provided thereafter. As noted by the state in its brief, Schlievert’s testimony at trial was consistent with his expert report that was authored on July 31, 2014, several years prior to the trial. Further, appellant had an opportunity to explore the impact of Schlievert’s discussion with the prosecutor during his cross-examination of Schlievert, but failed to do so. Notably, Schlievert was asked on redirect examination whether the information he learned as a result of his discussion with the state impacted his testimony in any manner, and he responded in the negative.\n\n¶ 64 In light of the foregoing, we conclude that appellant has failed to demonstrate how the state’s discussion with Schlievert prevented him from receiving a fair trial. Absent such a showing, we find that the trial court properly denied appellant’s motion for a mistrial."}

The state asserted that Ohio courts do not permit expert testimony to bolster a claim of self-defense except when the defendant is a battered woman or battered child. Defense counsel responded in support of the use of its expert in establishing Hamad's claim of self-defense. It was their position that while an expert may not provide an opinion about the propriety of the use of self-defense, he may establish the mindset of a defendant which explains why the defendant perceived the danger as he did. Whether this perception is subjectively reasonable, is for the jury to determine. Defense counsel proffered that Dr. Reardon would testify, in sum, that because of the constant threats of death from some of the attackers over a period of approximately six months, and the beating Hamad suffered from those who unlawfully entered onto his property on February 25, [2017,] he was suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Hamad’s action[s] were consistent with a person who was suffering from those symptoms. The defense argued that to preclude such testimony would violate Hamad’s constitutional rights to present a defense and to equal protection under the law. The trial court found the issue was raised prematurely and reserved ruling until an appropriate time during the trial. The court additionally stated that 'there is a very thin line separating the battered women’s syndrome, wherein expert testimony is admissible, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), where the field of precedent is minimal. The Court further finds that even if it were to allow the expert testimony, it would be limited to establish a diagnosis only. The expert would not be permitted to offer an opinion as to the self-defense claim.' At the conclusion of the state’s case-in-chief, defense counsel filed a supplement to their motion to present the expert testimony of Dr. Reardon. The trial court ruled that Hamad was not permitted to introduce the testimony during the initial phase of the trial, as it is not permissible under current Ohio law. The court held: 'Although * * * Ohio has in certain instances permitted expert testimony to aid the trier of fact in a self-defense analysis, the Court finds those instances are both rare and inapplicable to the facts here. The analysis of a self-defense claim does require a certain element of subjective considerations. However, the testimony of a mental health expert is typically not required in order to conduct said analysis. The Court finds the evidence presented thus far is distinguishable and distinct from the facts in State v. Koss (1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 213, the origin for the use of mental health expert in a self-defense analysis.' Appellant argues the trial court’s prohibition of Dr. Reardon’s testimony was an abuse of discretion and a violation of Hamad’s constitutional right to present a complete defense. 'The Ohio Rules of Evidence establish adequate preconditions for admissibility of expert testimony * * *. It is within the sound discretion of the state’s judiciary, on a case by case basis, to decide whether such testimony is relevant and will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.' State v. Williams, 4 Ohio St.3d 53 (1983), syllabus. Accordingly, we review a trial court's decision regarding whether to admit expert testimony for an abuse of discretion. State v. Clinton, 153 Ohio St.3d 422, 2017-Ohio-9423, ¶155, citing Evid.R. 104(A). Moreover, 'the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants 'a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.’' Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 683, 690 (1986), quoting California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 485 (1984). Evidence is relevant when it has 'any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.' Evid.R. 401. 'Evidence that would support a defendant's explanation of the events at issue and would provide evidence as to his possible state of mind at the time of the incident is clearly relevant to his or her defense.' State v. Nemeth, 82 Ohio St.3d 202, 207 (1998). Relevant expert testimony, to be admissible, must also meet the criteria of Evid.R. 702. Id. An expert may testify if all of the following apply: (A) The witness' testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons; (B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony; (C) The witness' testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information. To the extent that the testimony reports the result of a procedure, test, or experiment, the testimony is reliable only if all of the following apply: (1) The theory upon which the procedure, test, or experiment is based is objectively verifiable or is validly derived from widely accepted knowledge, facts, or principles; (2) The design of the procedure, test, or experiment reliably implements the theory; (3) The particular procedure, test, or experiment was conducted in a way that will yield an accurate result. The disagreement between the parties on appeal centers on whether the expert testimony would have aided the jury in evaluating Hamad's state of mind at the time of the shooting. Appellant asserts testimony regarding Hamad's PTSD diagnosis was relevant not only to his claim of self-defense, but also to whether he acted with prior calculation and design and whether he acted in a sudden fit of rage after being provoked, because each determination rests in whole or in part on Hamad's state of mind. Appellant further asserts the proffered expert report meets the requirements of Evid.R. 702, to wit: (a) the specific characteristics and symptoms experienced by a person with PTSD are facts beyond the knowledge of laypersons; (b) Dr. Reardon's curriculum vitae reflects his specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, and education in psychology and PTSD; and (c) Dr. Reardon applied his expertise using extensive, recognized scientific testing specifically conducted upon Hamad to diagnose him with PTSD with dissociative symptoms, according to the DSM-5. The state responds that expert testimony is not ordinarily admitted to establish a self-defense claim, because whether a defendant had a reasonable belief that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm is not beyond the comprehension of the average juror. Thus, expert testimony would invade the province of the jury, with notable exceptions in cases that involve the insanity defense or battered woman syndrome. The expert report proffered by defense counsel indicates that Dr. Reardon performed a battery of psychological tests on Hamad, which resulted in a DSM-5 diagnosis of 'post-traumatic stress disorder with dissociative symptoms.' According to Dr. Reardon's report, 'dissociation is defined as a largely unconscious, defensive alteration in awareness, that develops as an avoidance to overwhelming – often post-traumatic – psychological distress.' Notably, however, Dr. Reardon determined that the onset of PTSD occurred during the events of February 25, not prior to: 'While [Hamad] certainly appeared to be experiencing significant anxiety, hypervigilance, sleep disruption, and other psychological symptoms prior to the assault, beating, and shooting incident of 02/25/17, the examination and testing evidence appears to confirm strongly that the vast majority of his current psychological symptoms are experienced in the context of his assault and being beaten on 02/25/17 and the subsequent shooting incident. There is strong evidence that he experienced a dissociative episode within the context of a post-traumatic reaction to that situation on 02/25/17. [Emphasis added.]' Dr. Reardon concluded his report with the following summary and opinion: 'It is my opinion that Mr. Hamad was experiencing significant symptoms of anxiety, worry, sleep deprivation, and stress prior to the events of 02/25/17. It is my opinion to reasonable psychological certainty that he is experiencing a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder condition with significant dissociative symptoms, including depersonalization and derealization in response to the stressor of the assault, beating, and shooting on 02/25/17. The assault, beating, and shooting entailed a significant exposure to actual or threatened death and serious injury and was directly experienced by Mr. Hamad on 02/25/17. In addition to this severe trauma exposure, he experiences characteristic intrusion symptoms, avoidance symptoms, alterations in cognitions and mood associated with the traumatic events, and alterations in arousal and reactivity associated with traumatic events. He has experienced this disturbance since the date of 02/25/17. This disturbance causes clinically significant stress for him, and it is not attributable to the effects of a substance or any other medical condition. [Emphasis added.]' We find this situation vastly distinguishable from those cases cited by appellant wherein expert testimony was found admissible to assist the jury with a defendant's self-defense claim. In State v. Koss, 49 Ohio St.3d 213 (1990), the Supreme Court of Ohio held that, 'where the evidence establishes that a woman is a battered woman, and when an expert is qualified to testify about the battered woman syndrome, expert testimony concerning the syndrome may be admitted to assist the trier of fact in determining whether the defendant acted in self-defense.' *Id.* at 218. 'A history of physical abuse alone does not justify the killing of the abuser. Having been physically assaulted by the abuser in the past is pertinent to such cases only as it contributes to the defendant’s state of mind at the time the killing occurred; e.g., in that it formed the basis for the woman’s perception of being in imminent danger of severe bodily harm or death at the hands of her partner.' *Id.* at 217, quoting Browne, *When Battered Women Kill* (1987) 175 (emphasis sic). Similarly, expert testimony on battered child syndrome was deemed admissible in the prosecution of a defendant for the murder of his mother. *State v. Nemeth*, 82 Ohio St.3d 202 (1998). Here, there is no history of physical abuse between the victims and Hamad that would have formed the basis for Hamad’s perception of being in imminent danger of death or severe bodily harm at the hands of the victims. Until the assault and shooting took place on February 25, only verbal threats and harassing behavior had been exchanged between them. In *State v. Warner*, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2006-P-0048, 2007-Ohio-3016, this court held that expert testimony of PTSD is relevant when a defendant seeks a Voluntary Manslaughter instruction because it may assist the jury in determining the defendant’s subjective state of mind. *Id.* at ¶44. The facts in *Warner* are not comparable to Hamad’s defense. First, the defendant in *Warner* was a Vietnam War veteran who had suffered from PTSD for at least twenty years prior to the homicide. Second, even if Dr. Reardon’s testimony would have assisted the jury in determining whether the victims' conduct caused Hamad to act in a sudden fit of rage, he still would not have been entitled to a Voluntary Manslaughter instruction. As we held under the first assignment of error, the jury could not have reasonably found that the victims’ provocation was reasonably sufficient to have incited Hamad to use deadly force. We conclude the trial court’s exclusion of Dr. Reardon’s expert testimony was neither an abuse of discretion nor a violation of Hamad’s constitutional right to present a complete defense."}

Martin*, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175 (1st Dist.1983). ‘When a court of appeals reverses a judgment of a trial court on the basis that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, the appellate court sits as a “‘thirteenth juror’” and disagrees with\nthe factfinder’s resolution of the conflicting testimony.’\n\n*Id.*, quoting *Tibbs v. Florida*, 457 U.S. 31, 42 (1982).\n\n¶104 To convict Hamad of Aggravated Murder and Attempted Aggravated Murder, the jury had to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he “purposely, and with prior calculation and design,” caused the deaths of Haber and Williams and attempted to cause the deaths of the other three victims. R.C. 2903.01(A) and R.C. 2923.02(A).\n\n¶105 Appellant first asserts the jury lost its way because the greater weight of the evidence demonstrates that Hamad did not act with “prior calculation and design.” He asserts, rather, that the evidence demonstrates Hamad acted with “an uncalculated reaction to the events as they unfolded before him.”\n\n¶106 A finding by the trier of fact of “prior calculation and design” is justified when the “evidence adduced at trial reveals the presence of sufficient time and opportunity for the planning of an act of homicide to constitute prior calculation, and the circumstances surrounding the homicide show a scheme designed to implement the calculated decision to kill.” *State v. Cotton*, 56 Ohio St.2d 8 (1978), paragraph three of the syllabus. ‘Neither the degree of care nor the length of time the offender takes to ponder the crime beforehand are critical factors in themselves,’ but ‘momentary deliberation’ is insufficient.” *State v. Taylor*, 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 22 (1997), quoting Committee Comment to Am.Sub.H.B. No. 511, R.C. 2903.01; *Cotton, supra*, at paragraph two of the syllabus (“instantaneous deliberation is not sufficient”).\n\n¶107 In line with the case law, the jury received the following instruction:\n\nPrior calculation and design means that the purpose to cause the death was reached by a definite process of reasoning in advance of the homicide, which process of reasoning must have included a mental plan involving studied consideration of the method and the means and instrument with which to cause the death. To constitute\nprior calculation, there must have been sufficient time and opportunity for the planning of an act of homicide, and the circumstances surrounding the homicide must show a scheme designed to carry out the calculated decision to cause the death. No definite period of time must elapse and no particular amount of consideration must be given, but acting on the spur of the moment or after momentary consideration of the purpose to cause the death is not sufficient.\n\n¶108 ‘While the Ohio Supreme Court has declined to uphold findings of prior calculation and design in ‘explosive, short-duration situations,’ the court nonetheless has upheld some ‘short-lived emotional situations’ that do not fit the classic mold of a ‘planned, cold-blooded killing.’” State v. Trewartha, 165 Ohio App.3d 91, 2005-Ohio-5697, ¶18 (10th Dist.), citing Taylor, supra, at 19-20. The determination in each case necessarily depends on the facts and evidence presented at trial. Id., citing Taylor, supra, at 20.\n\n¶109 Three factors are traditionally considered on judicial review in determining whether a defendant acted with “prior calculation and design”: “(1) Did the accused and victim know each other, and if so, was that relationship strained? (2) Did the accused give thought or preparation to choosing the murder weapon or murder site? and (3) Was the act drawn out or “an almost instantaneous eruption of events?”” State v. Walker, 150 Ohio St.3d 409, 2016-Ohio-8295, ¶20, quoting Taylor, supra, at 19, quoting State v. Jenkins, 48 Ohio App.2d 99, 102 (8th Dist.1976); see also State v. Whisenant, 127 Ohio App.3d 75, 92-93 (11th Dist.1998). More specifically, strong indications of “prior calculation and design” have been found when a defendant pursued and killed “a fleeing or incapacitated victim after an initial confrontation” and when a defendant carried out a prior threat to obtain a weapon and kill the victim. Id. at ¶21-22 (collecting cases).\nThe evidence presented to the jury demonstrated multiple facts in support of a finding that Hamad acted with “prior calculation and design.” First, there was a severely strained relationship between Hamad and the victims.\n\nSecond, the decision to shoot the victims was not made after a “momentary” deliberation. Hamad walked from the van, across his yard, into the house, obtained the firearm from the bedroom, walked outside, began shooting, walked across his yard, and shot directly into the van. Then he did it all a second time. This was not an “instantaneous eruption of events”; there was sufficient time and opportunity for Hamad to plan the acts of homicide.\n\nThird, the circumstances demonstrate Hamad was determined to implement a decision to kill. Hamad began shooting almost immediately upon leaving the house and then walked closer to shoot the victims at close range. Hamad reloaded and shot the victims several times after they were already wounded, and even as they were attempting to flee. Further, there was testimony that, after he was handcuffed, Hamad yelled to Bryce something to the effect of, “This is what you deserve. I’m not done with you, you little bitch”; or “That’s what you get, you little bitch. How do you like that?” In his police interview, Hamad also stated that—after he heard one person say, “grab the gun,” saw that another had a knife out, and noted the driver would not stop moving—“I was already close to the van. I just started firing. I got tired of this shit. They been fucking with me for a long time.”\n\nAlthough the entire altercation lasted mere minutes, the evidence of Hamad’s actions during that time weighs strongly in favor of a determination that he was carrying out a calculated decision to kill his victims. Perhaps this decision was not conceived prior to the victims arriving on Hamad’s property, but it was also not\n“instantaneous.” Appellant’s argument that a finding of “prior calculation and design” is against the manifest weight of the evidence is not well taken.\n\n¶114 Appellant next asserts the jury lost its way because the greater weight of the evidence demonstrates that Hamad’s use of deadly force was in self-defense. He maintains the facts adduced at trial demonstrate Hamad was not at fault in creating the confrontation, he had a bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger, and his only means of escape was to utilize deadly force.\n\n¶115 At the time of Hamad’s trial, R.C. 2901.05(A) provided, in relevant part, that “the burden of going forward with the evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, for an affirmative defense, is upon the accused.”\n\n¶116 “In Ohio, the affirmative defense of self-defense has three elements: (1) the defendant was not at fault in creating the violent situation, (2) the defendant had a bona fide belief that [he] was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that [his] only means of escape was the use of force, and (3) that the defendant did not violate any duty to retreat or avoid the danger.” State v. Thomas, 77 Ohio St.3d 323, 326 (1997), citing State v. Williford, 49 Ohio St.3d 247, 249 (1990) and State v. Robbins, 58 Ohio St.2d 74 (1979), paragraph two of the syllabus. The second element is a combined subjective and objective test: “self-defense ‘is placed on the grounds of the bona fides of defendant’s belief, and reasonableness therefor, and whether, under the circumstances, he exercised a careful and proper use of his own faculties.’” Id. at 330, quoting State v. Sheets, 115 Ohio St. 308, 310 (1926).\n\n¶117 Over the state’s objection, the trial court instructed the jury on self-defense, stating “the Defendant must prove by the greater weight of the evidence that:\nA. He was not at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the circumstances;\n\nB. He had reasonable grounds to believe and an honest belief, even if mistaken, that he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm, and that his only reasonable means of retreat from such danger was by the use of deadly force; and\n\nC. He had not violated any duty to retreat to avoid the danger.\n\nBased on all of the evidence presented at trial, as outlined throughout this opinion, nothing suggests the jury lost its way by rejecting Hamad’s claim of self-defense. Regardless of Hamad’s subjective belief as to the danger he faced, the circumstances surrounding the homicides do not demonstrate that his only reasonable means of retreat from that danger was by the use of deadly force.\n\nHamad's convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence."}

This right is applicable to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment. See Turner v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 466 (1965).

Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 727 (1992) (citations omitted).\n\n'[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.' Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209 (1982), syllabus. Accordingly, prosecutorial misconduct alone does not require a new trial. See id. at 220. 'The conduct of a prosecuting attorney during trial cannot be made a ground of error unless the conduct deprives defendant of a fair trial.' State v. Apanovitch, 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 24 (1987) (emphasis added), citing State v. Maurer, 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 266 (1984); see also State v. Fears, 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 332 (1999).\n\nAppellant argues a comment made by the prosecutor during Tracy’s cross-examination deprived Hamad of a fair trial. Tracy was called as a court’s witness. The following exchange occurred between Tracy and the prosecutor:\n\nQ: But once you and the defendant went back in the house after the fistfight is over, after the beating him and kicking him and pushing him down, you never looked out to see where that van went?\n\nA: I went behind the fireplace.\n\nQ: But you never told anybody that until – when you came and saw me, you never said that in your written statement, right?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: You never said that in your recorded statement that we reviewed?\n\nA: No, I did not.\n\nQ: It’s only after – the defense has talked to you numerous times; correct?\n\nA: Well, yes, I’ve talked to them.\n\nQ: You’ve talked to me once?\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: And now we have an idea of what our defense would be, that you should hide behind that fireplace?\n\n[Defense Counsel 1]: Objection.\n\n[Defense Counsel 2]: Objection, Your Honor.\n\nThe Court: Hold on. Basis of your objection?\n\n[Defense Counsel 1]: The implication that the defense has done anything improper, suggesting what her testimony would be.\n\n[Defense Counsel 2]: We have a motion for the Court, too.\n\n[Prosecutor]: I will withdraw that question.\n\n[Defense Counsel 2]: We still have a motion for the Court.\n\nThe Court: The jury is to disregard the question.\n\n[Defense Counsel 2]: Your Honor, may I?\n\nThe Court: Side bar.\n\n(Whereupon, the following side-bar discussion was held on the record.)\n\nThe Court: Your motion.\n\n[Defense Counsel 2]: Your Honor, that was a direct allegation, without any question whatsoever, not veiled in any way that the defense got together with her – I’m sorry – that the defense somehow got together and manufactured testimony with her. That is absolutely false. And I think this prosecutor, while willing to switch the questioning, he knows that that was an improper question. We move for a mistrial.\n\nThe Court: Would you like to respond?\n\n[Prosecutor]: Yeah. I will withdraw the question. I probably misstated what I wanted to say. And I apologize for that,\nbecause I do know these gentlemen and I'm not trying to imply that. In fact, I'll even say I am not implying that. If you want me to, I will stress that, that that's not what I'm implying.\n\nThe Court: Well, hold on.\n\n[Prosecutor]: I don't think it's grounds for a mistrial.\n\nThe Court: It was totally improper. I'm going to give an instruction right now to the jury to disregard what your – your questioning and any reference to the defense of any question to the defense. Do not go there in any way, shape or form. And you need to tone it back because you're being way too aggressive. Okay. Motion for a new trial is denied.\n\n(End side bar.)\n\nThe Court: Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, the question by the prosecutor as to any correspondence or any discussion between this witness and the defense is to be disregarded as it was never asked [sic]. This witness is well within her rights to speak to either side at any time. There is not any reference or any – anything to be drawn from that in any way, shape or form. You may continue, counsel.\n\n[Prosecutor]: Thank you, Your Honor. And, again, I apologize to defense counsel and this witness. I did not mean that question to come out the way it did.\n\nWe do not condone the prosecutor's decision to ask the question. The question insinuated that defense counsel had suborned perjury, that the witness had manufactured her testimony based on her sympathies for the defendant, or both. No evidence existed to substantiate either scenario. It was clearly improper. See, e.g., Smith, supra, at 14 (citation omitted) ('the prosecution must avoid insinuations and assertions which are calculated to mislead the jury').\n\nWe conclude, however, that the trial court properly instructed the jury not to draw any reference from the question and to disregard the prosecutor's question as though it had not been asked. Nothing in the record rebuts the presumption that the jury followed the curative instruction. See State v. Raglan, 83 Ohio St.3d 253, 264 (1998),\nciting State v. Goff, 82 Ohio St.3d 123, 135 (1998). Further, the prosecutor was admonished by the court in the jury’s presence, and the prosecutor apologized to Tracy and defense counsel in the jury’s presence. The prosecutor then completely abandoned that line of questioning. Tracy’s testimony was highly relevant: she was Hamad’s girlfriend and Bryce’s mother, and she had firsthand knowledge of the events that led up to the physical altercation and the shooting. She was not, however, the only eyewitness to the events of February 25, 2017.\n\nWe conclude the prosecutor’s question of Tracy on cross-examination did not deprive Hamad of his constitutional right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. The prosecutor apologized and explained it was a misstatement, the trial court gave an appropriate curative instruction, and the jury’s verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. It is clear to us beyond a reasonable doubt that, absent the question, the jury would have returned the same verdict. See, e.g., State v. Martin, 21 Ohio St.3d 91, 96 (1986); State v. Benge, 75 Ohio St.3d 136 (1996).\n\nThus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to grant a mistrial on that basis. See State v. Sage, 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 182 (1987) (granting or denying a mistrial under Crim.R. 33 rests within the sound discretion of the trial court)."}

Appellant again refers to the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin that recounts Fletcher's statements, reference to Fletcher's statements by the state during closing argument, and the state's decision to call Fletcher's attorney as a rebuttal witness in this case.\n\nRegarding the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin, Appellant contends both officers improperly vouched for Fletcher's credibility. During this testimony the state asked both whether the statements made by Fletcher were corroborated by the findings of the medical examiner and were corroborated by other information regarding the scene of the incident. (1/3/17 Tr., pp. 320, 418-419.)\n\nIn determining whether prosecutorial misconduct has occurred, we must determine whether the comments or questions were improper and, if they were, whether they prejudiced Appellant's substantial rights. State v. Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 480, 2001-Ohio-4, citing State v. Lott, 5 Ohio St.3d 160, 165, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). The\nbenchmark of this analysis is “the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.” Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 212, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982). Vouching for a witness occurs when, “the prosecutor implies knowledge of facts outside the record or places his or her personal credibility in issue.” State v. Davis, 116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, ¶ 232.\n\nIn State v. Huff, 145 Ohio App.3d 555, 763 N.E.2d 695 (1st Dist.2001), relied on by Appellant, the First District reversed a conviction for felonious assault and concluded a defendant was denied a fair trial when the prosecutor elicited testimony from a detective about whether he thought the victims in the matter were credible. The prosecutor in Huff asked the detective whether he thought there was any doubt about the victims’ identification of the shooter. There was no objection by defense counsel and the detective responded that he absolutely found the victims credible and that they were telling the truth.\n\nAs in Huff, defense counsel did not object to the testimony of Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin regarding Fletcher’s statements, thus waiving all but plain error. State v. Childs, 14 Ohio St.2d 56, 236 N.E.2d 883 (1968), paragraph three of the syllabus. As earlier discussed, Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin testified that the statements made by Fletcher corroborated the findings already made in their investigation as well as those of Marzullo, who had investigated the scene, and of Dr. Ohr, the medical examiner. Testifying about whether witness statements match other findings of an investigation is not akin to vouching for that witness’ credibility. No improper vouching occurs so long as the prosecutor or the witness does not express any personal belief about another witness’ credibility. Davis, at ¶ 241. While improper on other grounds, there was no improper\nvouching for the credibility of the declarant, here. Neither Det./Sgts. Spotleson nor Martin testified that they found Fletcher credible. Simply because information she gave was consistent with another witness’ findings is not improper vouching.\n\nAppellant also contends the prosecutor relied on Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin’s testimony and their allegedly vouching for Fletcher’s credibility during closing argument by stating:\n\nThere were three people there that afternoon. Three people in that stairwell. Unfortunately, probably the best person of the three isn’t here to tell us what happened, the other two are. Jasmin Fletcher and Michael Paige both told the police what happened. They both said where everybody was standing and they both said who fired the shots.\n\n(1/3/17 Tr., pp. 444-445.)\n\nAgain, while the statements of Fletcher were improperly submitted on other grounds, no vouching occurred here. The state was recounting the testimony at trial, including that Appellant’s version of the incident in his admission matched what Fletcher told the officers. However, the prosecutor neither implied knowledge of facts outside of the record nor placed his personal credibility at issue by making such argument and again, if we remove any reference to Fletcher and her statements, as we must, the state’s observation that Appellant’s confession contained all the relevant information necessary to find guilt appears accurate. Further, since the jury could actually witness Appellant confessing to the crime and could accurately judge his credibility for themselves, mention of the improperly admitted Fletcher statements cannot be error in this instance. State v. Keene, 81 Ohio St.3d 646, 666, 693 N.E.2d 246. Thus, no plain error is present.\nFinally, Appellant alleges prosecutorial misconduct when the state called Fletcher's counsel, Attorney Kivlighan, as a rebuttal witness in relation to Fletcher's assertion of her Fifth Amendment privilege. The admission of rebuttal testimony is left to the discretion of the court. *State v. Finnerty*, 45 Ohio St.3d 104, 106, 543 N.E.2d 1233 (1989). The purpose of a rebuttal witness is to allow the state to refute new evidence offered by the defendant in the presentation of his case. *State v. Talley*, 7th Dist. No. 97 CA 72, 1998 WL 811347, *5, citing *State v. Grinnell*, 112 Ohio App.3d 124, 146, 678 N.E.2d 231 (10th Dist.1996). Evidence that is merely cumulative and that does not contradict or refute evidence presented in the opposing party's case-in-chief is not proper rebuttal evidence. *State v. Hawn*, 138 Ohio App.3d 449, 470, 741 N.E.2d 594 (2nd Dist.2000) citing *State v. Wood*, 11th Dist. No. 95-P-0009, 1996 WL 649132. However, when the evidence contradicts the opposing party and also happens to bolster the state's case-in-chief it is not inappropriate. *State v. Owens*, 2nd Dist. Nos. 14068, 93-CR-214, 1994 WL 683395 (1994) *7.\n\nThe matter of whether Fletcher was able to assert her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when called as a defense witness in this case was discussed at length on the record before the jury. While Fletcher initially failed to appear in this matter, Appellant called Fletcher as a witness after she appeared pursuant to a material witness warrant issued for her. Once Fletcher refused to testify, invoking the Fifth Amendment, defense counsel requested the court to instruct Fletcher to respond, arguing that she had no basis for invoking the privilege. (1/3/17 Tr., p. 389.) The court inquired as to the state's position, but the prosecutor left the matter to the trial court's discretion. The court then inquired of Fletcher's attorney, Attorney Kivlighan, who was\npresent in the courtroom, about the basis of Fletcher’s claims to privilege. Citing *Mitchell v. United States*, 526 U.S. 314, 119 S.Ct. 1307 (1998), paragraph one of the syllabus, Kivlighan responded that although Fletcher had pleaded guilty to her role in the matter, she had not been sentenced. Therefore, absent sentencing pursuant to her plea, her incrimination was not complete. (1/3/17 Tr., p. 390.) The trial court ruled that Fletcher could assert her Fifth Amendment rights and refuse to testify. (1/3/17 Tr., pp. 390-391.) As the matter appeared to be settled, the defense called its next witness. At the close of the defense’s case, the trial court asked the state to call their rebuttal witness and Atty. Kivlighan testified, in pertinent part:\n\nQ  Through your practice, do you represent a woman by the name of Jasmin Fletcher?\nA  I do.\n\nQ  And you were present this morning when she came in and took the Fifth Amendment when she was called to testify, correct?\nA  That's correct.\n\nQ  You're representing her in the criminal matters that occurred out of this incident, correct?\nA  That's correct.\n\n***\n\nQ  Okay. Are you aware that she has entered pleas of guilty to tampering with evidence and obstructing justice?\nA  I'm aware of that, yes.\nQ And have you, on her behalf, filed a motion to vacate those pleas, or that plea?\nA Yes, that motion was filed.\nQ Okay. And the effect of that, if that motion was granted, would mean she has not been found guilty, she would sit here, her case could go to trial, another plea agreement could be reached, it could be dismissed, but basically we are starting over from square one, basically?\nA Yes, if the motion was granted.\nQ Okay. Based on the fact that that motion had been filed, the motion to vacate the plea, did you discuss with her -- and I am not asking what you discussed -- did you discuss with her the prospect of her testifying in this matter?\nA In conjunction with filing the motion, we did discuss whether or not she would testify in this matter.\n\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL] Judge, I'm going to object and can we approach the bench?\n\n(1/3/17 Tr., pp. 437-439.)\n\n{¶50} At this point, a discussion was had off the record and the trial court then sustained defense counsel's objection and the witness was excused.\n\n{¶51} Citing State v. Dinsio, 176 Ohio St. 460, 469, 200 N.E.2d 467 (1964), Appellant contends the testimony of Atty. Kivlighan as a rebuttal witness was highly prejudicial and that the state was prevented from calling the rebuttal witness when it knew that Fletcher would assert her Fifth Amendment privilege. In essence, Appellant contends\nthe state used Kivlighan’s testimony as a way to get highly prejudicial testimony before the jury when it could not get that direct testimony to the jury through Fletcher. In *Dinsio*, the Ohio Supreme Court held that a witness who has indicated he will not testify because he was invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination cannot be called to testify and be subjected to continued questioning that goes unanswered in order to get evidence before a jury using innuendo or inferences. *Id.* at paragraph one of the syllabus. If such an attempt occurs, the trial court may instruct the jury to draw no conclusion from the witness’ decision to invoke the privilege. *State v. Abdi*, 4th Dist. No. 09CA35, 2011-Ohio-3550, at ¶ 88.\n\nContrary to Appellant’s assertion, we do not find the rebuttal witness’ testimony prejudicial to Appellant. If anything, placing Attorney Kivilighan on the stand as a witness could only serve to hurt the state’s case. Fletcher invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege in front of the jury. This resulted in the codefendant in the case appearing to admit to a degree of culpability in the matter. By placing her attorney on the stand, the state now reminded the jury that Appellant’s codefendant in the case invoked her privilege against self-incrimination. This scenario has the opposite effect of creating prejudice to Appellant, because it appears that it should only serve to create doubt as to Appellant’s guilt.\n\nThe state did not call Fletcher to testify although both parties had subpoenaed her as a witness. It was when the defense called her to testify that she invoked the privilege not to testify. It is not apparent from the record that the state had any prior knowledge that Fletcher would invoke her privilege. Regardless, defense counsel elected to call her as a witness and it was Appellant’s counsel who questioned\nher ability to invoke the privilege. Therefore, the issue of whether Fletcher was able to invoke a Fifth Amendment privilege was raised by the defense and the state offered no objection or argument on the matter. It appears a discussion was had off the record after Fletcher was dismissed. There may have been a discussion concerning the use of a rebuttal witness, but as it was held off the record, this is purely speculation. The trial court asked the state to proceed with its rebuttal witness without any prior reference to such a witness in the record. Moreover, there was no initial objection to the state calling Fletcher’s counsel on rebuttal. Counsel objected to the testimony only when questioning progressed to the issue of whether Fletcher would testify in the instant case. Atty. Kivlghan’s testimony could be construed as cumulative as the issue of Fletcher’s guilty pleas had been raised at the time she invoked her privilege. However, as his testimony also raised the status of those guilty pleas and the potential for her to go to trial on the offense charged, if it was error to allow this witness to testify, the testimony itself had no prejudicial effect on Appellant’s trial. In fact, if it caused any harm this harm could only be on the state which had elected not to call Fletcher as a witness. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the rebuttal testimony nor did any prosecutorial misconduct occur. Appellant’s second assignment of error is without merit and is overruled."}
{"index": "636-Paige", "allegation_num": "allegation_3", "allegation": "The Appellant received ineffective assistance of trial counsel when his trial attorney failed to object to numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct and the admission of clearly inadmissible hearsay statements and failed to file a motion to suppress statements made by Appellant, to his girlfriend, that were surreptitiously recorded by the police.", "extracted_text": "In his third assignment of error, Appellant claims he received ineffective assistance of counsel when trial counsel failed to object to prosecutorial misconduct and the admission of hearsay, and failed to file a motion to suppress the conversation recorded between Appellant and his girlfriend after he admitted to being the shooter. In a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, a reviewing court is highly deferential to trial counsel's strategy and must indulge in a strong presumption that counsel's performance fell within a wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of professional competence. If successful in demonstrating that counsel committed professional error, the appellant must then demonstrate he was prejudiced by that deficiency. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \"Deficient performance\" means performance falling below an objective standard of reasonable representation. Strickland at 687-688. \"Prejudice\" in this context, means a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Id. at 694. Reversal as a result of prejudice from defective representation is justified only where the results are unreliable or the proceeding was clearly fundamentally unfair due to counsel’s performance. State v. Carter, 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 558, 651 N.E.2d 965 (1995). \"An ineffectiveness claim * * * is an attack on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding whose result is challenged.\" Id. at 697. An appellant’s burden when challenging the effectiveness of counsel is to demonstrate that some action or inaction by counsel operated to undermine or call into question the integrity of the process that resulted in conviction. State v. Calhoun, 86 Ohio St.3d 279, 289, 714 N.E.2d 905 (1999). The testimony of both Det./Sgts. Spotleson and Martin was reviewed in Appellant’s first assignment of error. The admission of the testimony was error, but resulted in no prejudice to Appellant, as the overwhelming evidence at trial supported Appellant’s convictions. It is not enough that any error by counsel can be shown to have \"some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\" Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 142, 538 N.E.2d 373, at fn. 1, quoting Strickland, at 693. Although an objection to the testimony may have been appropriate, we cannot conclude that the failure to do so resulted in prejudice that undermined the \"fundamental fairness\" of the proceedings. Strickland, at 697. Again, the jury had before it the videotaped confession by Appellant that he shot Blake. Standing alone, this was sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, allowing the officers to testify about what Fletcher told them does reveal a potential trial strategy, as Fletcher was the prime suspect and Appellant’s involvement was not known to the police until Fletcher raised it. Potentially, trial counsel wanted to show that Fletcher was the shooter and that she implicated Appellant only to shift the focus from her own guilt. Regardless, there is no ineffective assistance shown, here. Appellant also asserts counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress the recorded conversation between Appellant and his girlfriend for \"invasion of privacy.\" According to the record, the conversation took place after Appellant’s second interview where he confessed he was the shooter. Following his confession, his girlfriend was allowed to visit him in the interview room. Det./Sgt. Spotleson testified on cross-examination that the recording equipment was still on and that the camera was hidden. (1/3/17 Tr., p. 366.) Det./Sgt. Spotleson also testified that Appellant was not told he was being recorded while speaking with his girlfriend. Id. The conversation between Appellant and his girlfriend is brief. In this portion of the video, the jury could see Appellant apologizing to his girlfriend and clearly stating \"I told them I shot him,\" and \"I pulled the trigger.\" (State’s Exh. 66.) No actual testimony was elicited from any witness regarding Appellant’s conversation with his girlfriend and there was no indication that any new information was gleaned by law enforcement during the conversation. In fact, contrary to Appellant’s assertion that the state \"heavily relied\" on the conversation in its closing argument, other than being raised in the briefs before us, the only reference is in the state’s closing where the prosecutor stated, \"[b]ut in the end, he still says, I pulled the trigger. And he tells his girlfriend that outside the presence of the police.\" (1/3/17 Tr., pp. 457-458.) The \"failure to file a suppression motion does not constitute per se ineffective assistance of counsel.\" State v. Madrigal, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 389, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000) citing Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. 365, 384, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d. 305 (1986). Under the two-part test for assessing whether trial counsel was ineffective, we look first to whether trial counsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable competence. This portion of the video was played to the jury after they had already seen Appellant’s videotaped confession to the detectives. The only other reference at trial to the conversation was briefly in the state's closing argument. It is clear counsel could not be deemed ineffective for failing to seek suppression of the recording. As Appellant had just admitted to the detectives that he was the shooter, the same admission by Appellant to his girlfriend would be only cumulative evidence for the state. The video itself shows Appellant and his girlfriend embracing and crying as he informed her that he shot the victim."}

(Appellant’s Brf., p. 40.) The issue of speedy trial cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. The failure to file an appropriately timed motion on speedy trial grounds constitutes a waiver of the issue on appeal. State v. Hergenroder, 7th Dist. No. 07 CO 17, 2008-Ohio-2410, ¶ 13 citing State v. Trummer, 114 Ohio App.3d 456, 470-471, 683 N.E.2d 392 (7th Dist.1996); State v. Turner, 168 Ohio App.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-3786, 858 N.E.2d 1249, ¶ 21 (5th Dist.).\nHowever, even if Appellant had not waived this issue for purposes of appeal, a review of this record indicates no speedy trial violation. Appellant’s time calculation for speedy trial purposes is two-fold. First, he contends that as his charges were felonies, his speedy trial time under R.C. 2945.71(C) was 270 days. Second, Appellant urges that as he was being held solely on these charges, he was entitled to the triple-count provision enumerated under R.C. 2945.71(D), bringing his speedy trial time to 90 days. Although Appellant references R.C. 2945.71(D), the triple-count provision is set forth in R.C. 2945.71(E).\n\nAppellant’s calculation is as follows. He was arrested on March 3, 2012 and indicted on March 8, 2012. He executed a waiver of speedy trial on April 25, 2012. He executed an unlimited waiver on September 13, 2012. Appellant filed a pro se revocation of his speedy trial waiver which was never ruled on by the trial court. Finally, he was not brought to trial until January 3, 2017. He contends he was held for 54 days when he initially executed his limited waiver and his unlimited waiver was effective until June 9, 2015, when he filed his pro se revocation of that unlimited waiver. Appellant concedes that in the 18 months between filing his pro se revocation and the time the third trial commenced, some time was tolled for his competency evaluation and for the trial court’s sua sponte declaration of a mistrial based on his federal habeas petition, but Appellant still contends that the state still failed to bring him to trial within a reasonable time period.\n\nThe state responds that no speedy trial violation occurred because when utilizing the proper standard and accounting for tolling, Appellant was brought to trial within a reasonable time period.\nR.C. 2945.71(C) provides, “[a] person against whom a charge of felony is pending: * * * (2) [s]hall be brought to trial within two hundred seventy days after the person’s arrest.”\n\nThe triple-count provision asserted by Appellant provides, in pertinent part:\n\nFor purposes of computing time under divisions (A), (B), (C)(2), and (D) of this section, each day during which the accused is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charge shall be counted as three days.\n\nR.C. 2945.71(E).\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court has held that the triple-count provision of R.C. 2945.71(E) does not apply to retrials after a jury was unable to reach a verdict. State v. Fanning, 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 21, 437 N.E.2d 583 (1982). The Fanning Court noted that the statute was “not applicable to retrials” and “the standard to be applied” is “basically reasonableness under federal and state constitutions.” Id. That holding was restated in State v Hull, 110 Ohio St.3d 183, 2006-Ohio-4252, ¶ 14. In Hull the Court also concluded that R.C. 2945.71 did not apply to criminal convictions overturned on appeal. Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. The Court has reasoned that as the statute does not refer to retrials, it is only to be applied to an original trial. Id., at ¶ 21. The Hull Court concluded that 149 days is reasonable under the federal and state constitutions for speedy trial purposes after a matter has been remanded by an appellate court. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\nHere, Appellant executed an unlimited waiver on April 25, 2012. The first trial commenced on February 25, 2014. That jury found him not guilty of the aggravated murder charge but was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the other charges. A\nmistrial was declared by the trial court in a judgment entry dated March 4, 2014. Appellant's second trial on the remaining charges began on January 11, 2016. This also resulted in a mistrial, as Appellant had filed a federal habeas petition relating to the matter on October 7, 2015. The habeas was not dismissed until September 16, 2016. Appellant's third trial commenced on January 3, 2017 and the jury found him guilty of the remaining charges. Doing a calculation of the time periods here and considering all tolling events, Appellant was brought to trial within 109 days. We conclude that 109 days is reasonable under the federal and state constitutions. Therefore, Appellant's right to a speedy trial was not violated."}

Burton reiterates that residents testified they did not hear gunshots at the property, and they told police that Burton collected rent at the property, performed maintenance and repair services, but that he did not reside there. The shooting victim identified Burton from the single cellphone photograph displayed to him at the hospital by ECPD Officer Nevels. Burton was arrested at the scene and said that he ‘was booked in with all of the property that I had and the only key I had was a Chevy Cruze key’ to his car that was parked in the lot next door to the house. (Tr. 391.) Burton argues that the police used the key to illegally search the Chevy and place the contents in the third-floor unit. Officer Nevels testified that Officer Kaleal inventoried the Chevy. Thus, Burton offers that the New Tow Evidence confirms that the ECPD towed the vehicle the night of the incident and the Trial Tow Evidence falsely indicated that Burton’s vehicle was not towed until August 25, 2017."}

He contends there was no evidence that paddling a fully clothed child created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. He also argues the abrasion on the victim's buttocks does not amount to serious physical harm.\n\n{¶16} The analysis begins with whether there was sufficient evidence produced by the state to show the administration of corporal punishment was excessive under the circumstances. This is an element of the second-degree felony child endangering crime.\n\n{¶17} It is undisputed in this case that the injury was caused by the administering of a paddle board on the victim's clothed buttocks. The victim confirmed this admission.\n\n{¶18} We have previously stated that in corporal discipline cases, the state must prove the corporal discipline was improper in light of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances. State v. Rosa, 7th Dist. No. 12 MA 60, 2013-Ohio-5867, 6 N.E.3d 57, ¶ 41. The factors to be considered are: “(1) the child's age; (2) the child's behavior leading up to the discipline; (3) the child's response to prior non-corporal punishment; (4) the location and severity of the punishment; and (5) the parent's state of mind while administering the punishment.” Id., quoting State v. Luke, 3d Dist. No. 14-10-26, 2011-Ohio-4330, ¶ 23; State v. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d 250, 255–56, 673 N.E.2d 992 (3d Dist.1996) (“The propriety and reasonableness of corporal punishment in each case must be judged in light of the totality of the circumstances.”).\n\n{¶19} In the case at hand, the victim was 11 years old. The victim was not correctly completing a math problem and this led to the paddling; Appellant admitted the victim was not a behavioral problem. Trial Tr. 322, 324. Appellant testified he used fear and discipline to get his students to focus. Trial Tr. 320. Appellant testified he gave the victim the opportunity to get the math problems correct, but the victim would not carry the digit correctly and kept getting the problems wrong. Trial Tr. 325. Testimony indicated Appellant yelled and scared his students prior to paddling them. Trial Tr. 284; 320. It is undisputed the victim was paddled on his clothed buttocks five times during\none tutoring session. Trial Tr. 326. The victim’s aunt, who was the first person the victim showed the injury, described it as follows:\n\nIt was – his skin was reddish and purplish and it had a scab. You could see like the where the pores of his skin was so open that they were bleeding, you know, it was bleeding out, and it was like holes. You could actually see holes in it. And I asked him, I said, does it hurt? He said, yes, it hurts to sit and everything. So I put gauze, and I put Neosporin on it, and I bandaged it up and tried to cushion it as much as possible. But I had to – I sent a text to his mom and showed her the picture.\n\nTrial Tr. 216.\n\n{¶20} Dr. John Melville from the CAC testified at trial. Trial Tr. 241-242. He saw the victim the day after the injury was shown to the aunt. He described the injury as a crescent shaped abrasion about 6cm by 1cm. Trial Tr. 255. It was dark red and there was evidence of some healing. Trial Tr. 255. At the two week follow up visit there was evidence of healing, but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5.\n\n{¶21} Appellant testified he did not want to hurt the victim. Trial Tr. 328. He explained he taught in a fear induced learning environment. Trial Tr. 320. He stated it was “like an exorcism” to get the victim to carry the number correctly in doing a three digit math problem. Trial Tr. 325.\n\n{¶22} Considering these facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution the punishment was improper and excessive.\n\n{¶23} As to the felonious assault and third-degree felony child endangering convictions, the question is whether there was serious physical harm to the child. As there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, the analysis for the second-degree felony child endangering conviction is whether there was a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child.\n\n{¶24} “Serious physical harm to persons” is defined as:\n(a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment;\n(b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death;\n(c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity;\n(d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement;\n(e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.\n\nR.C. 2901.01(A)(5).\n\n{¶25} “Substantial risk” is defined as “a strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.” R.C. 2901.01(A)(8).\n\n{¶26} Appellant cites this court to a case where the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm or substantial risk of serious physical harm. He contends the cases cited by him are examples of worse conduct by an offender and the appellate court found there was not sufficient evidence of the crimes. Three of the cases - Ivey, Wright, and Enovitch - are from the Eighth Appellate District and are from the mid to late 1990s. In Ivey, the child had welts and bruises on his buttocks and legs from being beat with a belt for disciplinary reasons. State v. Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d 249, 648 N.E.2d 519 (8th Dist.1994). In reversing the conviction, the Eighth Appellate District court stated:\n\nAlthough the punishment may have been excessive, the state produced no evidence that the bruises and welts caused by the strapping resulted in serious physical harm or created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. On the contrary, the evidence showed the boy went to school, without incident, the next day. There was no evidence he was in great pain or that he had trouble sitting or walking. The treating physician did not find it necessary to hospitalize the boy, order any type of pain killer (even aspirin), or to schedule another medical exam to check on his progress.\nThe evidence presented in the record shows the injuries sustained by the child were the result of the imposition of corporal punishment by a father who judged his son's school conduct and acts of deception warranted a strong physical disciplinary response. The state failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child.\n\nId. at 524.\n\n{¶27} Similarly in the other two Eighth Appellate District cases the court found there was not sufficient evidence of serious physical harm. City of Shaker Hts. v. Wright, 8th Dist. No. 69517, 1996 WL 355309 (June 27, 1996); State v. Enovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827, 1998 WL 518163 (Aug. 20, 1998). Wright was a child endangering case and in that case the court explained:\n\nThis conclusion, that the element of seriousness was lacking, is buttressed by the following: (1) the marks were small and were receding over time; (2) the emergency room physician testified that he thought that there was no scarring at the site of the marks and did not feel there had been any abuse; (3) the emergency room report identified the marks as bruises or contusions, not scars; (4) while the injury site was sore the evening it was inflicted, the injury did not prevent the boy from sleeping and the victim experienced no pain at the site of the injury the morning after the injury was inflicted and thereafter enjoyed his normal activities without pain or difficulty; (5) the injury required no follow-up medical care or physical therapy; and, (6) the treating physician did not hospitalize the boy. Accordingly, the City failed to prove by sufficient evidence that this type of whipping resulted in serious physical harm or could result in a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child.\n\nWright, 8th Dist. No. 69517.\n\n{¶28} Enovitch was a felonious assault case and in that case the court explained:\nOther than Gartman's statement, there was no evidence at trial that the scar above his eye was permanent. There is no evidence as to who told him the scar would not go away or that the person was qualified to make such a determination. The hospital records described his injury as just over 1.5 centimeters in length and as a “burst-type injury, clean, shallow, not particularly jagged.” The hospital discharge instructions characterized the injury as “minor.” Based upon the evidence presented, we conclude that Gartman's injury did not constitute the serious physical harm required for a felonious assault conviction. Accordingly, Enovitch's second assignment of error is well taken.\n\nEnovitch, 8th Dist. No. 72827.\n\n{¶29} Appellant also cites In re L.J., 176 Ohio App.3d 186, 2008-Ohio-1488, 891 N.E.2d 778 (3d Dist.). In that case, the appellate court found the trial court erred as a matter of law when it concluded the child was “abused” under R.C. 2151.031(C) because of corporal punishment. Id. at ¶ 45. The appellate court explained the evidence was insufficient to show the corporal punishment was excessive and to show that it created a substantial risk of serious physical harm:\n\nWhile we certainly share the trial court's sentiment that striking a child with a belt on back of the legs supports a finding that the punishment was excessive, this court has stated that corporal punishment on parts of the body other than the buttocks may be proper and reasonable. Hart, 110 Ohio App.3d at 255, 673 N.E.2d 992. In addition, Skinner testified that she had intended to strike J.L. on the butt; however, J.L. moved, which is why she missed. As to the severity, the marks were red but also appeared to be fading and healing within three to four days after the incident, which indicates that the discipline may not have been excessive. Skinner also testified that she did not observe bruises on J.L. after the incident. The record lacks any medical evidence, which would lead one to conclude that the discipline was excessive. No physician testified at the hearing, nor was any medical report admitted into evidence showing that J.L. required\nmedical attention as a result of the discipline. In fact, on the day the caseworker discovered the bruises, J.L. was outside playing with his brother.\n\n* * *\n\nWe also cannot conclude that the punishment created a substantial risk of serious physical harm as those terms are defined. The evidence presented consisted of Core’s testimony and the photographs, which, for the most part, revealed that J.L. was bruised. Our review of the admitted photographic evidence confirms that J.L. was bruised, but bruising alone is not sufficient to constitute serious physical harm. In re Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532, 599 N.E.2d 728 (trial court could reasonably infer that severe bruising on the buttocks, thighs, and ankles from punishment that was inflicted multiple times for the same misbehavior with a wooden paddle or belt on an eight-year-old girl created a substantial risk of serious physical harm). Other courts have found that punishment much more severe than J.L.’s did not constitute serious physical harm. See, e.g., Ivey, 98 Ohio App.3d at 255–256, 648 N.E.2d 519 (bruised left eyelid, bruises, welts, and lacerations caused by a belt whipping on the buttocks and lower legs and a swollen hand was not “serious physical harm”). Again, notably missing from the record is any medical evidence or reports to show that J.L.’s injuries amounted to serious physical harm. On the basis of this record, we cannot conclude that the corporal punishment caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm.\n\nId. at ¶ 41, 44.\n\n{¶30} Appellant also cites a biting case where the parents used biting as a means to punish a nine year old child who bit his brother. In re Miles, 9th Dist. No. 01CA0054, 2002-Ohio-2438. In finding insufficient evidence of serious physical harm, the appellate court explained:\n\nAdditionally, appellee argues that the bruising is an indication of serious physical harm. In this case, the alleged serious physical harm was “any\nphysical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering, or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.” See R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(e). However, the record does not contain any evidence that acute pain resulted of any lasting duration to result in substantial suffering, or that it lasted for an extended period of time or was intractable.\n\nAlthough this act may be inappropriate and unwarranted, it did not rise to the level of being an offense of child abuse.\n\nId. at ¶ 12-13.\n\n¶31 These cases are distinguishable from the case at hand; in this case there is evidence of treatment, pain caused from the paddling that lasted over a period of time, and medical testimony from the treating doctor. In all of the cases cited by Appellant the court notes the lack of evidence. However, there is evidence in this case.\n\n¶32 The victim’s mother testified it took the wound on the victim’s buttocks over two weeks to heal. Trial Tr. 183. The child victim testified it hurt when the Appellant hit him with the paddle board. Trial Tr. 202. As stated above the victim’s aunt described the injury as open, bleeding, and scabby. Trial Tr. 216. The victim told her it “hurt to sit and everything.” Trial Tr. 216. The picture the aunt took was shown to the jury. Trial Tr. 216; State’s Exhibit 1.\n\n¶33 Dr. John Melville from the CAC, whose entire professional career is devoted to child abuse pediatrics, indicated that at a two week follow-up visit, there was evidence of healing but the injury was not gone. Trial Tr. 245, 256-257. After one month of healing, the doctor testified there was further healing but the mark was still present. Trial Tr. 257. Pictures taken at the CAC were admitted into evidence. Trial Tr. 254; State’s Exhibit 2-5.\n\n¶34 The doctor was asked what are reasonable physical disciplinary measures. Trial Tr. 260. He explained nobody is opposed to physical discipline in general, but if it is to be administered then it is recommended to be hand to buttocks and that it not leave any marks that would persist for more than 4 to 5 minutes. Trial Tr.\nBased on what he observed in this case he opined that the victim's injury was the result of unreasonable physical discipline. Trial Tr. 261.\n\nIn determining whether admittedly excessive corporal punishment caused substantial risk of serious physical harm to the child, the Fourth Appellate District has explained:\n\n“Discipline methods on a child which leave recognizable bruising and cause pain which lasts beyond the time immediately following an altercation between parent and the child may establish a finding of substantial risk of serious harm.” In re Kristen V., 6th Dist. Ottawa No. OT–07–031, 2008–Ohio–2994, ¶ 69. Bruising alone, however, is not sufficient to show that the discipline method created a substantial risk of serious physical harm. Schuerman, 74 Ohio App.3d at 532 (stating that “bruising alone is insufficient to establish abuse”).\n\nState v. Neal, 4th Dist. Nos. 14CA31, 14CA32, 2015-Ohio-5452, ¶ 45.\n\nConsidering the testimony and viewing it in the light most favorable to the state, there was sufficient evidence of serious physical harm and substantial risk of serious physical harm.\n\nWe note the state cites this court to cases upholding child endangering convictions where the victim had extensive bruising on the buttocks, legs and back and where that bruising lasted more than 3 days and up to 7 to 10 days. State v. Royster, 2d Dist. No. 25870, 2015-Ohio-3608, ¶ 30-31; In re Horton, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1181, 2004-Ohio-6249, ¶ 27; State v. Krull, 154 Ohio App.3d 219, 2003-Ohio-4611, ¶ 20-23 (12th Dist.); State v. Burdine-Justice, 125 Ohio App.3d 707, 714-715, 709 N.E.2d 551 (12th Dist.1998). Admittedly, those cases are different from the case at hand in the type of injury sustained. Also, in some of the cases a belt was used instead of a paddle board. However, the abrasion caused by the paddling lasted over two weeks and there is testimony it caused the victim pain over an extended period of time. Furthermore, as the Twelfth Appellate District stated, “The force necessary to create such bruising must have been great, and was not accidental on the part of the perpetrator. Clearly, this amount of corporal punishment was unnecessary and unwarranted.” Burdine-Justice,\n125 Ohio App.3d at 715. Consequently, although the cases upholding conviction vary from the one before us, the reasoning and the evidence presented in this case indicate they are more akin to the case sub judice than the ones cited by Appellant.\n\n{¶38} This court concludes there was sufficient evidence of excessive corporal punishment, serious physical harm, and substantial risk of serious physical harm. This assignment of error is meritless."}

State v. Shane, 63 Ohio St.3d 630, 632, 590 N.E.2d 272 (1992). Lesser included and/or inferior degree offense instructions are not warranted every time “some evidence” is offered to support the lesser offense. Shane, 63 Ohio St.3d at 632. Furthermore, a trial counsel's failure to request instructions on lesser included offenses is often a matter of trial strategy and does not per se establish ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Griffie, 74 Ohio St.3d 332, 658 N.E.2d 764 (1996), citing State v. Clayton, 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 402 N.E.2d 1189 (1980). Defense counsel's decision to forego an instruction on lesser included offenses, and instead seek an acquittal rather than inviting conviction on a lesser offense, can constitute trial strategy. Debatable strategic and tactical decisions may not form the basis of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, even if, in hindsight, it looks as if a better strategy had been available. State v. Cook, 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 524, 605 N.E.2d 70 (1992). In this case, it appears it was trial strategy for counsel to not request an instruction on the lesser included/inferior degree offenses.

A guilty plea, if coerced or induced by promises or threats renders the plea involuntary. Appellant contends coercion is demonstrated in eight different ways. Each will be discussed in turn. First, he asserts his proffer was induced by promises of a certain punishment, but following the proffer the prosecutor improperly refused to recommend that punishment. Attached to Appellant’s sentencing memorandum is a record from the FBI - a February 11, 2015 interview with Appellant. Present at the interview were Appellant, FBI agents, detectives from the Canfield Police Department, and two prosecutors from the Mahoning County Prosecutor’s Office. The second paragraph of the report states: Panezich was advised he was being interviewed under proffered protection. Panezich agreed to plead guilty to the State of Ohio charges, further agreeing to a sentencing range of 3 to 7 years. As a condition to Panezich’s plea, Mahoning County Prosecutor’s Office would not oppose judicial release for Rose Panezich (Panezich’s mother) after 6 month incarceration. In addition, the Mahoning County Prosecutor’s Office would not charge Panezich’s grandmother or father. Also, included in the trial court records was a letter from one of the Mahoning County Prosecutors that was present at the February 2015 interview. The letter indicated Mahoning County was in the process of presenting the matter to the grand jury and the potential charges would include but would not be limited to the engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity charge. The letter indicated some of the other charges would be telecommunications fraud, theft, identify fraud, money laundering, and forgery. However, instead of obtaining a grand jury indictment, if Appellant pled guilty to the information charging Appellant with one count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, then Mahoning County would recommend a sentence of “five (5) to seven (7) years.” The letter is dated March 25, 2015. The letter gave Appellant until April 10, 2015 to decide. As can be seen, the statement in the FBI report regarding the sentence the Mahoning County Prosecutor’s office would recommend at sentencing to a guilty plea does not match the statement made in the March 2015 letter. The record is devoid of what communication occurred between the prosecutor’s office and Panezich from the receipt of the March 2015 letter until the grand jury indictment in October 2016. The record does indicate a plea hearing was scheduled for September 26, 2016, but it was cancelled; Appellant indicated this in his October 2016 Motion to Modify Bond. The motion to modify bond indicates, due to concerns of the terms of the agreement, Appellant entered a not guilty plea on that date. The record, however, does not contain a judgment entry concerning this alleged September 26, 2016 pretrial/plea hearing. Thus, it is unclear whether the five year recommendation instead of three years in the letter was a typographical error or if the prosecutor was altering the offer. There is no indication that between the letter and the indictment, the discrepancy between the five and three year minimum recommendation was fixed. Appellant did eventually plead guilty to the indictment as amended and the prosecutor agreed to recommend an aggregate three to seven year sentence. Admittedly, the indictment contained seven additional charges not in the information – telecommunications fraud, aggravated theft, money laundering, three counts of forgery, and identity fraud. However, the agreement for the recommended three to seven year sentence was the same as the agreement made in February 2015. Given that the recommended sentencing range is the same as what was stated in February 2015 and what was recommended at the sentencing hearing in April 2017, it is unclear how any misstatement or alteration on the part of the prosecutor to the February 2015 agreement coerced him into pleading guilty in April 2017."}

The assistant prosecuting attorney argued that the combination of the medicine T.B. took with the alcohol impaired her; he also noted her Asperger’s diagnosis.... The assistant prosecuting attorney’s statement neither deprived Morton of a fair trial nor prejudiced him. Defense counsel was not ineffective for not objecting.... The assistant prosecuting attorney argued as follows in regard to T.B.’s testimony: ‘When you are deciding whether or not you believe what she told you, think about did she have a motivation to lie to you? She told her friends what Jeremiah Morton did to her. She told the police. She told the detective what Jeremiah Morton did to her. She went to the hospital. She submitted herself to an invasive medical procedure. She came in here and sat and told 12 complete strangers in open court what he did to her. What does she stand to gain from that? What motivation does she have to lie about what he did to her in the bathroom?’... The assistant prosecuting attorney made a similar statement about another one of the state’s witnesses arguing ‘what motive did she have to lie?’... The assistant prosecuting attorney argued that T.B. ‘wince[d] out in pain,’ and that when her friend saw T.B. after, T.B. was ‘shaking,’ she was ‘trying to cope.’... The assistant prosecuting attorney stated, in reference to the indictment, the following: ‘We are not here by accident. We are not here because nothing happened * * * so the indictment is more than just notice to Jeremiah Morton what he is being charged with. This is also our contract with the community that we can prove each and every element of each charge contained in this indictment.’... The assistant prosecuting attorney told the jury that trial court was allowing an instruction on the lesser-included offense of sexual battery ‘because the evidence shows it.’... Morton next contends that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to properly cross-examine some of the state’s witnesses. Specifically, Morton complains that his trial counsel failed to cross-examine T.B. and her friends about their disabilities and memory-recollection issues.... The record demonstrates that counsel’s strategy was to portray T.B. and her friends as ‘high functioning’ despite their disabilities.... The record reflects that counsel questioned T.B. on cross-examination about how her trial testimony differed from what she initially told the police during her second encounter with them that day. Counsel got her to admit the most relevant inconsistency: that she told the police on the scene that she did not believe Morton had raped her."}

In his Third Assignment of Error, Groesser contends his conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence produced by the state at trial.\n\nSTANDARD OF APPELLATE REVIEW.\n\nA. Sufficiency of the Evidence.\n\nThe Sixth Amendment provides: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury....” This right, in conjunction with the Due Process Clause, requires that each of the material elements of a crime be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.S. __, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2156, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013); Hurst v. Florida, 136 S.Ct. 616, 621, 193 L.Ed.2d 504 (2016). The test for the sufficiency of the evidence involves a question of law for resolution by the appellate court. State v. Walker, 150 Ohio St.3d 409, 2016-Ohio-8295, 82 N.E.3d 1124, ¶30. “This naturally entails a review of the elements of the charged offense and a review of the state’s evidence.” State v. Richardson, 150 Ohio St.3d 554, 2016-Ohio-8448, 84 N.E.3d 993, ¶13.\nWhen reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court does not ask whether the evidence should be believed. *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus; *Walker*, at ¶30. “The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.” *Jenks* at paragraph two of the syllabus. *State v. Poutney*, Oh. Sup. Ct. No. 2016-1255, 2018-Ohio-22, 2018 WL 328882 (Jan. 4, 2018), ¶19. Thus, “on review for evidentiary sufficiency we do not second-guess the jury's credibility determinations; rather, we ask whether, ‘if believed, [the evidence] would convince the average mind of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.’” *State v. Murphy*, 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 543, 747 N.E.2d 765 (2001), quoting *Jenks* at paragraph two of the syllabus (emphasis added); *Walker* at ¶31.

R.C. 2901.22(A).\n\n¶41 The term \"knowingly,\" as used in the requirement of \"knowingly obtain or exert control,\" means that a person, regardless of purpose, is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist. R.C. 2901.22(B).\n\n¶42 Because intent lies within the privacy of a person's own thoughts and is therefore not susceptible to objective proof, intent is determined from the surrounding facts and circumstances, and persons are presumed to have intended the natural, reasonable and probable consequences of their voluntary acts. State v. Garner, 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 60, 1995-Ohio-168, 656 N.E.2d 623.\n\n¶43 \"[U]nder the combination of R.C. 2913.02(A)(3) and 2913.01(A), the state, in order to prove theft by deception, must establish: (1) that the accused knowingly obtained or exerted control over property or services; (2) that the accused obtained or exerted such control with purpose to deprive; (3) that the accused obtained or exerted such control by knowing deception; and (4) that such knowing deception was the result of misrepresentation or other conduct creating a false impression in another.\" State v.\nGraven (1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 114, 126, 374 N.E.2d 1370, 1377. (J. Brown, dissenting), reversed on other grounds, State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492(1991). Accord, State v. Snyder, 5th Dist. Licking No. 2008-CA-25, 2080-Ohio-6709, 2008 WL 5265826, ¶ 25.\n\n¶44 In the case at bar, Groesser met Mr. Lake at Lowe's to pick out materials for the renovation. Groesser told Mr. Lake to give him a check for $25,000.00 and he would purchase the materials and begin the Lake house renovation. After completing the demolition, Groesser and his co-workers appeared sporadically to work on the project. Groesser also received additional money to perform services for change orders. Eventually, Groesser abandoned the project leaving behind his tools and an uninhabitable home. Mr. Lake was forced to hire new contractors to repair half-finished or shoddy work and complete the renovation project. The cost of the new contractors alone was more than $35,000.00. In addition, Mr. Lake had to purchase the materials, such as cabinets, appliances and fixtures that Groesser never delivered to the site. Groesser never refunded any of the Lakes money for the materials or unperformed services.\n\n¶45 If the state relies on circumstantial evidence to prove an essential element of an offense, it is not necessary for “such evidence to be irreconcilable with any reasonable theory of innocence in order to support a conviction.” State v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 272, 574 N.E. 2d 492(1991), paragraph one of the syllabus, superseded by State constitutional amendment on other grounds as stated in State v. Smith, 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 684 N.E.2d 668(1997). “Circumstantial evidence and direct evidence inherently possess the same probative value [.]” Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d at paragraph one of the syllabus. Furthermore, “[s]ince circumstantial evidence and direct evidence are\nindistinguishable so far as the jury’s fact-finding function is concerned, all that is required of the jury is that it weigh all of the evidence, direct and circumstantial, against the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d at 272, 574 N.E. 2d 492. While inferences cannot be based on inferences, a number of conclusions can result from the same set of facts. State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 168, 555 N.E.2d 293(1990), citing Hurt v. Charles J. Rogers Transp. Co, 164 Ohio St. 329, 331, 130 N.E.2d 820(1955). Moreover, a series of facts and circumstances can be employed by a jury as the basis for its ultimate conclusions in a case. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d at 168, 555 N.E.2d 293, citing Hurt, 164 Ohio St. at 331, 130 N.E.2d 820.\n\n{¶46} Viewing the evidence in the case at bar in a light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that a reasonable person could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Groesser committed theft by deception. We hold therefore that the state met its burden of production regarding theft by deception and, accordingly, there was sufficient evidence to support Groesser’s conviction."}

THE JURY FUNDAMENTALLY LOST ITS WAY AND RENDERED A VERDICT THAT WAS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE.", "extracted_text": "In the case at bar, Groesser’s defense centered upon his suggestion that he may be a poor bookkeeper, some of his work may not have been executed in a workmanlike manner, and that his business is perhaps poorly managed, there was no evidence that he had any intent to not complete the work he was retained to do.\n\nThe jury as the trier of fact was free to accept or reject any and all of the evidence offered by the parties and assess the witness’s credibility. ‘While the trier of fact may take note of the inconsistencies and resolve or discount them accordingly * * * such inconsistencies do not render defendant’s conviction against the manifest weight or sufficiency of the evidence.’ State v.

The jury was able to see for themselves Groesser subject to cross-examination. Thus, a rational basis exists in the record for the jury's decision.\n\n{¶53} We find that this is not an \"'exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.'\" State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386–387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), quoting Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 485 N.E.2d 717.

{"index": "188-Evans", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "The trial court erred as a matter of law by allowing Ebony Brown to testify to prior incidents during which Greg Evans had physically harmed her and by allowing the state to impeach Evans's credibility with his prior misdemeanor conviction for assault.", "extracted_text": "Ebony Brown testified that in September 2016, she had been in a relationship with Evans for about a year. Although they had lived together in the past, they were not then living together. Evans would come over to her apartment and leave when she went to work. At that time, Brown was working third shift, from 11:00 p.m. to 9:30 a.m., at a group home that provided care to individuals with disabilities, located about a half-mile from her apartment.\n\nOn the evening of September 4, 2016, Evans was at Brown’s apartment. They began arguing over a Facebook posting of Brown with another man. Brown testified that Evans had accused her of cheating on him, had screamed at her, had choked her, and had slammed her to the floor, but that he had not punched her. After the argument, Brown went to work. Evans came to the group home shortly thereafter, and they argued outside. Evans pushed Brown and then left. Evans remained angry. He repeatedly called Brown and sent her messages through Facebook, but Brown did not respond. At trial, the state introduced into evidence the Facebook messages, as well as evidence of phone calls between Brown and Evans during that evening and the following morning.\n\nAround 6:30 a.m. on September 5, 2016, Evans showed up at the group home where Brown worked. He began banging on the front door and yelling at her. Concerned for her safety, Brown called 911. While Brown was on the phone with the 911 dispatcher, Evans kicked in the sidelight window next to the front door. He reached through the broken window, unlocked the door, and entered the group home. Evans yelled at Brown, and Brown screamed at Evans to stop. She asked the dispatcher to tell the police to hurry. Evans came to the kitchen where Brown was located. He grabbed the phone from her hand, hung up the phone, and then punched her in the face four times. Brown fell to the ground.\n\nBrown testified that the 911 dispatcher had called her back. On the second 911 call, which was played at trial, Brown told the dispatcher that Evans had kicked out the sidelight to the front door and punched her in the face. Prior to leaving, Evans threatened to kill her if she gave anyone his name. He then left the premises. Brown told the dispatcher that she did not know where Evans had gone. The dispatcher told Brown that an officer would be responding shortly to the group home.\n\nBrown testified that after she had been interviewed by police, she drove herself to the emergency room, where she was treated for a nasal bone fracture. Photographs of Brown’s injuries and her emergency room records were admitted into evidence at the trial. The emergency room records established that Brown had suffered a nasal bone fracture of indeterminate age.\n\nBrown further testified that following Evans’s arrest, Evans and his ex-girlfriend had called her from jail and asked her not to testify against Evans. The state played recordings of jail phone calls between Evans and Brown, which corroborated Brown's testimony.\n\nThe responding police officer testified that the sidelight to the front door had been shattered. He interviewed Brown. She told him that she and her ex-boyfriend had “gotten into it and he [had] busted through the front door and punched her in the face.” He testified that Brown's lip and nose were swollen and her face was scratched. He stated that the injuries appeared to be “fresh” and that she had refused medical treatment.\n\nBrown's supervisor, Charmaine Smith, testified that the group home was a locked facility. When Smith arrived at the group home on September 5, 2016, the sidelight to the front door had been shattered. She had observed injuries to Brown's face that appeared to be “fresh.” She further stated that she had seen Brown the day before, and that Brown had no injuries at that time.\n\nEvans's ex-girlfriend, Santana Benton, testified on Evans's behalf. Benton testified that on the morning of September 5, 2016, Evans had called her and asked her to give him a ride to Brown's workplace so he could get the keys to his car. When they got to the group home, Benton stayed in the car while Evans went to the door. She could hear Evans yelling for ten to 15 minutes. She stated that she had seen him break a window next to the front door with his foot, but that he had never entered the group home. Instead, according to Benton, he stayed at the front door, yelling profanities for about five minutes before coming back to the car.\nDuring cross-examination, Benton admitted that she was pregnant with Evans’s child. She further admitted that during a jail-house phone call with Evans, Evans had told her that he had hit Brown in the nose, and that she had called and texted Brown on Evans’s behalf so that Evans could try to dissuade Brown from testifying before the grand jury.\n\nEvans testified that on September 5, 2016, he and Brown were in a volatile relationship. They would fight frequently, but ultimately make up. He recently had given Brown $450 for a down payment on a car, with the agreement that he could use the car to drive to and from work. Evans testified that on the evening of September 4, 2016, he and Brown had been arguing about a Facebook post of her with another man and about his relationship with Benton.\n\nBrown drove the car to work that night to prevent him from visiting Benton, but she agreed that Evans could come to her work the following morning to pick up the car so he could drive himself to work. Evans went to the group home two times on the evening of September 4, 2016, to confront Brown about the Facebook post. They argued. On the second occasion, Brown grabbed him by the shirt and hit him. He then punched her in the face, causing her to fall to the ground. Evans then left and went back to Brown’s apartment.\n\nLike Benton, Evans testified that Benton had then driven him to the group home around 6:20 a.m. to collect the keys to the car. Once there, Benton beeped the car’s horn. He and Benton waited for Brown to come outside. When she did not, Evans walked to the front door. He saw Brown through the window. He asked her for the car keys so he could take the car to work, but she would not give them to him.\nHe then saw Brown make a phone call. He heard Brown tell the person on the phone that her boyfriend was there and would not leave. He started banging on the door. He then became so frustrated that he kicked the sidelight window next to the front door, and it shattered. Brown screamed and dropped the phone on a cabinet. Evans denied entering the group home. He testified that he had stood outside the door and had told Brown that she was blowing things out of proportion. He then left, and Benton drove him to work.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Evans admitted that he and Brown had been physical with one another, but he testified that the first time that he had actually hit her with his fist had been the night before. He testified that he would typically restrain Brown, who would often try to hit him with “anything she could put her hands on.” He also admitted that after his arrest, he had contacted Brown through Benton to try to work things out with her. Evans further admitted that he had been convicted of assaulting Benton."}

White*, 82 Ohio St.3d 16, 22, 693 N.E.2d 772 (1998) (“Since defense counsel failed to object to the alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct, the alleged improprieties are waived, absent plain error.”)\n\n¶ 9 “Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.” Civ.R. 52(B). “A forfeited error is not reversible error unless it affected the outcome of the proceedings and reversal is necessary to correct a manifest miscarriage of justice.” *State v. Thomas*, 2018-Ohio-1081, 109 N.E.3d 616, ¶ 50 (8th Dist.).\n\n¶ 10 Newman claims that the prosecutor went beyond the bounds of appropriate trial advocacy in numerous ways: (1) by phrasing a question to a witness that she was on “zero” PCP at the time of the shooting (tr. 512); (2) the prosecutor elicited perjured, or at the very least, unbelievable testimony from another witness; (3) the prosecutor committed misconduct during the testimony of a police officer that interviewed witnesses shortly after the shooting; and (4) the prosecutor went beyond the bounds of appropriate trial tactics when questioning another witness by badgering and harassing her.\nDuring the pretrial phase, the state requested that it be allowed to call Samantha Harrison (“Harrison”) as a hostile witness, or in the alternative, as a court’s witness because Harrison, a passenger in the car with Harris when he was shot, had provided a written statement retracting previous statements identifying Newman as the gunman. In her most recent statement she indicated that she was high on PCP at the time of the shooting and that’s why her former statements were incorrect. (Tr. 58-60.) At trial, Harrison testified that she smoked PCP the night of the shooting. (Tr. 495.) Through questioning, the state attempted to show that Harrison was not high on PCP that night.\n\nDuring the testimony of Dr. Aisha Violette, the physician who treated Harrison for the wounds she sustained as a result of the shooting, the state asked numerous questions about Harrison’s physical condition. Dr. Violette testified that Harrison did not appear to be under the influence of PCP while at the hospital and the “labs didn’t pick up any influence of drugs, correct, not the ones I recall.” (Tr. 453.) The state also highlighted the lack of PCP in lab results contained in Harrison’s medical records. (Tr. 503.)\n\nThis was not the prosecutor testifying, as Newman claims in support of his argument that the prosecutor acted improperly during trial. The line of questioning was appropriate given the recantation of prior statements and the stated reason for the recantation. “Prosecutors are entitled to latitude as to what the evidence has shown and what inferences can reasonably be drawn from the evidence.” State v. Mason, 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 162, 694 N.E.2d 932 (1998), quoting\nState v. Smith, 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 111, 684 N.E.2d 668 (1997). Further, “[a] prosecutor may state his opinion if it is based on the evidence presented at trial.” Id., quoting State v. Watson, 61 Ohio St.3d 1, 10, 572 N.E.2d 97 (1991).\n\n¶ 14 Newman next claims that the testimony of Harris was so incredible that to elicit it amounted to prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n¶ 15 Harris testified that a man approached his car as he was stopped. The man was holding a revolver and put the gun through Harris’s open window and said “run your pockets,” which Harris understood to mean he was being robbed. Harris struggled with the man and several shots were fired into the vehicle while the two fought over the firearm. During the struggle, Harris lifted the right sleeve of the gunman’s shirt, revealing a tattoo. Harris said that during the skirmish, he was trying to separate the gunman’s hand from the gun and he slid the gunman’s sleeve up. (Tr. 349.) Harris testified that the tattoo was of a skull with a flame on it and placed about midway up the gunman’s upper arm. (Tr. 350.) During trial, Newman was required to roll up his sleeve, and Harris was able to view Newman’s right bicep and found that the tattoo on Newman was the same as the one on the gunman that approached his vehicle and shot him. (Tr. 354.)\n\n¶ 16 “Prosecutorial misconduct via the presentation of perjured testimony requires the defendant to show that the prosecution knew the testimony was false.” State v. Clark, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 15, 2015-Ohio-2584, ¶ 24, citing State v. Iacona, 93 Ohio St.3d 83, 97, 752 N.E.2d 937 (2001).\n¶ 17 There is no evidence in the record that the prosecutor knew Harris’s testimony was false. Further, it is not so unbelievable that during a struggle for a firearm clothing would be displaced. There is no evidence that this testimony, even if unbelievable, was knowingly false and elicited by actions of the prosecutor. See State v. Hillman, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 06AP-1230 and 07AP-728, 2008-Ohio-2341, ¶ 29. Therefore, this does not amount to prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n¶ 18 Newman next claims that when questioning Victoria Bascon (“Bascon”), another passenger in the car that Harris was driving, the state badgered her, taunted her, and acted inappropriately.\n\n¶ 19 During Bascon’s testimony, the state asked that she be treated as hostile on the basis of surprise. The record discloses that just prior to her testimony, she spoke with the prosecutor and a Cuyahoga County sheriff’s deputy and stated that she could identify the individual that shot at the driver of the vehicle in which she was riding. However, during her testimony, she indicated that she could not identify the shooter and did not see his face.\n\n¶ 20 The questioning that followed was contentious, but did not stray beyond the bounds of proper questioning within the various rules of procedure. For instance, Newman claims that the prosecutor taunted the witness about the length of time she took to answer questions. However, even the trial court commented on the length of time it took for the witness to answer simple questions: “Ma’am, it’s clear during your testimony, it was stilted. It was long delays in questions that should have produced — are you under some type of threat — has someone\nthreatened you?” (Tr. 426.) The prosecutor’s questioning was not inappropriate under these circumstances.\n\nSimilarly, Newman points to the testimony of a police officer, Jacqueline Bennett (“Bennett”), regarding a witness identification of the shooter. (Tr. 370-382.) However, the solicitation of this testimony, to which no objection was raised, does not constitute prosecutorial misconduct. This argument does not present a reason to grant the application for reopening.\n\nPlain error does not exist in this record to establish that prosecutorial misconduct deprived Newman of a fair trial. There is no probability of a different outcome had appellate counsel raised prosecutorial misconduct on appeal. Therefore, Newman has not set forth a colorable claim that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this as an assignment of error."}

{"index": "188-NEWMAN", "allegation_num": "allegation_3", "allegation": "Defendant’s sentence is contrary to law because the record shows that the trial court crafted a cumulative sentence using “sentencing packaging” doctrine.", "extracted_text": "Newman asserts that the trial court treated the sentences in this case as a sentencing package, rather than imposing individual sentences.\n\nOhio has rejected the sentencing-packaging doctrine: “We specifically rejected the ‘sentencing package’ doctrine, which, as we explained, requires a ‘court to consider the sanctions imposed on multiple offenses as the\ncomponents of a single, comprehensive sentencing plan.” State v. Evans, 113 Ohio St.3d 100, 2007-Ohio-861, 863 N.E.2d 113, ¶ 11, quoting State v. Saxon, 109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, 846 N.E.2d 824, ¶ 5.\n\nThe sentence package doctrine provides that, when a defendant is sentenced under a multi-count indictment and the sentences imposed on those counts are interdependent, the trial court has the authority to reevaluate the entire aggregate sentence, including those on the unchallenged counts, on remand from a decision vacating one or more of the original counts. In the Matter of Fabiaen L. Mitchell (June 28, 2001), Franklin App. No. 01AP-74, 2001 Ohio App. LEXIS 2856. The underlying theory is that, in imposing a sentence in a multi-count conviction, the trial court typically looks to the bottom line, or the total number of years. Id. Thus, when part of a sentence is vacated, the entire sentencing package doctrine becomes ‘unbundled,’ and the trial judge is, therefore, entitled to resentence a defendant on all counts to effectuate its previous intent. Id.\n\nState v. Jackson, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 03AP-698, 2004-Ohio-1005, ¶ 5. The sentencing-package doctrine is a federal doctrine that is inapplicable to Ohio courts. Saxon at ¶ 10.\n\nIn Ohio, individual sentences are not interdependent. A sentencing judge has discretion to impose any individual sentence that complies with applicable sentencing statutes. State v. Franklin, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107482, 2019-Ohio-3760, ¶ 41. If a sentence falls within the statutory range for that offense, there is a presumption of validity if the court considered the applicable sentencing factors. Id., citing State v. Pavlina, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99207, 2013-Ohio-3620, ¶ 15, citing State v. Collier, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 95572, 2011-Ohio-2791, ¶ 15. However, the Saxon Court went on to note,\n[A] judge sentencing a defendant pursuant to Ohio law must consider each offense individually and impose a separate sentence for each offense. See R.C. 2929.11 through 2929.19. Only after the judge has imposed a separate prison term for each offense may the judge then consider in his discretion whether the offender should serve those terms concurrently or consecutively. See State v. Foster, 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, paragraph seven of the syllabus, ¶ 100, 102, 105; R.C. 2929.12(A); State v. Mathis, 109 Ohio St.3d 54, 2006-Ohio-855, 846 N.E.2d 1, paragraph three of the syllabus. Under the Ohio sentencing statutes, the judge lacks the authority to consider the offenses as a group and to impose only an omnibus sentence for the group of offenses.\n\nSaxon at ¶ 9.\n\n¶ 34 In the present case, the trial court imposed valid individual sentences that it felt were appropriate, and determined to run some of those sentences consecutive to each other to arrive at a 25-year aggregate sentence. While the trial court had difficulty in arriving at a 25-year sentence due to some mathematical errors, and adjusted a few of the individual sentences to correct those errors, the court did not impose only an omnibus sentence.\n\n¶ 35 The trial court imposed individual sentences that consisted of two three-year gun specifications to be served prior and consecutive to an 11-year sentence on Count 1, attempted murder, and consecutive to an eight-year sentence on Count 3, aggravated robbery. (Tr. 793-795.) The court imposed sentences for the other counts, which were ordered to be served concurrent to the above sentences. Id.\n\n¶ 36 Initially, the trial court mistakenly imposed a 14-year sentence on Count 1. (Tr. 790.) The maximum sentence for Count 1, a first-degree felony, was\nactually 11 years. After a discussion with counsel, the trial court imposed an 11-year sentence on Count 1, imposed other sentences, and maintained a 25-year aggregate sentence.\n\n{¶37} Trial courts are authorized to impose any individual sentence within the statutory range and are granted latitude to order those sentences be served consecutive to each other where the situation warrants.\n\n{¶38} The trial court’s statements at the sentencing hearing indicate that the court imposed individual sentences on each count and considered an overall sentence that was appropriate when factoring in proper considerations under R.C. 2929.11, 2929.12, and 2929.14(C)(4). This does not implicate the sentencing-package doctrine."}

A person is guilty of aggravated menacing in Ohio when they 'knowingly cause another to believe' they are at risk of serious physical harm. R.C. 2903.21(A). Essentially, Mr. Austin argues that because Ms. Bailey never uttered the word 'fear' while testifying, then no fear existed on her part. But circumstantial evidence may be used to prove one’s belief of serious physical harm. State v. Flannery, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-140426, 2015-Ohio-1360, ¶ 17 ('Circumstantial evidence also established [the victim’s] belief' that the defendant would cause physical harm.), citing State v. Heinze, 12th Dist. Brown No. CA99-04-008, 1999 WL 988792 (Nov. 1, 1999). Thus, the question is whether Ms. Bailey presented sufficient testimony that she feared for her safety despite not expressly saying so. The answer is surely yes. Ms. Bailey testified to a number of things which would instill fear in most people. Among these were allegations that Mr. Austin threatened to kill her while referencing his gun, that he later rubbed the gun against her face while conveying other threats, that she was screaming, that she attempted to call 911, that she was hysterical and having a panic attack, and that she ran away from him and to the hospital. Construed in a light most favorable to the state, that certainly paints a portrait of fear sufficient to convince the trial court that Ms. Bailey feared Mr. Austin would cause her serious physical harm."}
{"index": "192-Austin", "allegation_num": "allegation_3", "allegation": "The convictions for both domestic violence and aggravated menacing are against the manifest weight of the evidence.", "extracted_text": "In his final assignment of error, Mr. Austin asserts that his convictions for aggravated menacing and domestic violence were both against the manifest weight of the evidence. In reviewing whether Mr. Austin's convictions run counter to the manifest weight of the evidence, we sit as a 'thirteenth juror.' State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). In other words, we review the evidence, the credibility of witnesses, the entire record. Id. But we will only reverse if the trial court 'clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.' Id., quoting State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983). Here, Mr. Austin speculates that Ms. Bailey fabricated the physical conflict and her injuries in order to punish him for spending the previous night in the arms of another woman. While such a theory is possible, Mr. Austin fails to explain how the court lost its way in rejecting this interpretation of the record. Convictions do not run afoul of the manifest weight of the evidence simply because the trier of fact believed the state’s version. State v. Robinson, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2018-08-163, 2019-Ohio-3144, ¶ 29 ('When conflicting evidence is presented at trial, a conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence simply because the trier of fact believed the prosecution testimony.'), quoting State v. Lunsford, 12th Dist. Brown No. CA2010-10-021, 2011-Ohio-6529, ¶ 17. In any event, the trial court did more than just find one side slightly more credible. It pointedly declared Mr. Austin to be the teller of tall tales, not Ms. Bailey. Mr. Austin lied to police about removing weapons from the home after the incident in question. He failed to present corroborating evidence despite admitting such evidence would exist were he telling the truth. The record reflects the court’s determination that Mr. Austin 'demonstrate[d] his consciousness of guilt' by telling a web of lies. In contrast, the court found Ms. Bailey’s testimony to be credible and consistent. The 'credibility of witnesses [is] for the trier of fact to resolve.' State v. Ham, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170043, 2017-Ohio-9189, ¶ 21.

{"index": "196-Smith", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "The trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements that he had made to police investigators.", "extracted_text": "Smith argues in his initial assignment of error that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements that he had made to police investigators. Because of the serious nature of the offenses, the detectives made a visual recording of the entire interview. The video-recorded interview with the police investigators was played for the trial court and during the jury trial.\n\nSmith argues that, despite signing a waiver-of-rights form, he had not voluntarily and knowingly waived his right to remain silent under *Miranda v. Arizona*, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). He also argues that his subsequent inculpatory statements were not voluntarily made. Smith maintains that because he was suffering from the effects of his injuries and was under the influence of prescription narcotics at the time of questioning, he could not have knowingly and voluntarily waived his *Miranda* rights or made statements to the police.\n\nWe review a trial court’s ruling on a motion to suppress in a two-step process. First, we must accept the trial court’s findings of historical fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. *See State v. Burnside*, 100 Ohio St.3d\nThen this court must make an independent determination, as a matter of law, without deference to the trial court’s legal conclusions, whether those facts meet the applicable constitutional standards. *Id.*\n\n{¶17} The state bears the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence both that Smith’s waiver of rights was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, and that his subsequent statements were voluntary. *See State v. Barker,* 149 Ohio St.3d 1, 2016-Ohio-2708, 73 N.E.3d 365, ¶ 30; *see also State v. Leonard,* 104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, ¶ 32; *State v.

Hamilton No. C-170148, 2018-Ohio-2310, ¶ 21. The totality of the circumstances includes the age, mentality, and prior criminal experience of the accused; the length, intensity, and frequency of interrogation; the existence of physical deprivation or mistreatment; the existence of a police threat or inducement, and any other relevant factor. *State v. Lather,* 110 Ohio St.3d 270, 2006-Ohio-4477, 853 N.E.2d 279, ¶ 9. From the evidence available, the trial court must determine the defendant’s understanding, “which can be implied by his conduct and the situation.” *Id.*\n\n{¶19} At the motion-to-suppress hearing, the investigating officer, Detective Christopher Wharton of the Cincinnati police department, testified that he and another detective had interrogated Smith for about four hours on the evening after the murders. He testified that the video recording was an accurate record of the interview. Detective Wharton stated that he had advised Smith of his rights against self-incrimination, verbally and in written form, prior to questioning. Smith said, “All right,” signed the waiver form, and agreed to answer the detectives’ questions. Detective Wharton acknowledged that Smith had substantial injuries to his hand,\nhead, neck, and side. But the detective stated that Smith did not exhibit any side effects from any medication that he may have received. He answered questions appropriately and coherently. Smith was given snacks and a drink during the questioning.\n\n{¶20} At a suppression hearing, the evaluation of evidence and the credibility of witnesses are issues for the trial court to determine. See State v. Hill, 73 Ohio St.3d 433, 446, 653 N.E.2d 271 (1995). There was ample competent, credible evidence adduced at the hearing to support the trial court’s legal decision that Smith had been properly advised of his Miranda rights and that he understood those rights when he signed the waiver form and answered police questions.\n\n{¶21} Smith had executed a written waiver form. A signed waiver form is strong proof of the validity of the waiver. See State v. Nields, 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 19, 752 N.E.2d 859 (2001). And there was little evidence of police coercion or overreaching during the interrogation. Though the detectives had warned Smith that his girlfriend risked obstruction-of-justice charges if she lied on his behalf, a correct statement of the law about potential punishment of illegal behavior does not generally rise to the level of coercion necessary to render a confession involuntary. See State v. W., 2015-Ohio-627, 29 N.E.3d 245, ¶ 38 (2d Dist.). In light of all the other indications of voluntariness, this interrogation technique standing alone did not vitiate the interview.\n\n{¶22} Smith was 27 years old when interviewed. He did not exhibit any behavior that would have indicated that he was under the influence of his medications. Smith responded in a logical manner to the detectives’ questions. He had had extensive experience with the criminal justice system. Under the totality of the circumstances, we hold that the trial court was justified in finding that Smith had been properly advised of his rights prior to making his statements and that he had knowingly and voluntarily waived those rights.\nThe state sought to discharge its second burden—demonstrating that Smith’s statements were voluntarily made—by relying on the statutory presumption of voluntariness created by R.C. 2933.81(B). That statute provides that when the police make “an audio and visual recording that is an authentic, accurate, unaltered record” of an interrogation, the suspect’s statements made during the interrogation are “presumed to be voluntary.” See R.C. 2933.81(A)(3) and (B); see also Barker, 149 Ohio St.3d 1, 2016-Ohio-2708, 73 N.E.3d 365, at ¶ 30.\n\nAt the hearing before the trial court, Smith added little to support his principal contention that, under the pain of his injuries and the effect of medication, his statements were not voluntary. See R.C. 2933.81(B). Based upon the totality of the evidence presented to support the voluntariness of his rights waiver, we hold that the trial court was also justified in finding that Smith had voluntarily made his statements to the police."}

Kentucky.", "extracted_text": "In his second assignment of error, Smith asserts that his equal-protection rights were violated when the trial court permitted the state to exclude a potential juror based on race in violation of the rule of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).\n\nEvaluation of a Batson challenge occurs in three steps: (1) the opponent of the peremptory strike must make a prima facie case of racial discrimination; (2) the state then offers a racially neutral explanation for the challenge; and (3) the trial court must decide whether the opponent has proved purposeful racial discrimination. See State v. Were, 118 Ohio St.3d 448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, ¶ 61. The burden of persuasion remains with the opponent of the strike. A trial court’s determination that a challenge was not motivated by a discriminatory intent will not be reversed on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous. See State v. Herring, 94 Ohio St.3d 246, 257, 762 N.E.2d 940 (2002).\nHere, the state used a peremptory challenge to excuse an African-American prospective juror, and Smith objected on the basis of *Batson*. Although the objection took place during an unrecorded sidebar conference, the trial court recounted the gist of that conference for the record immediately after the jury was seated. The trial court determined that Smith had failed to make a prima facie case of racial discrimination. But it noted that the state had nonetheless offered a race-neutral reason for striking the prospective juror—that the prospective juror was too agreeable with Smith’s theory of self-defense. Smith did not contest the trial court’s description of the arguments made below.\n\nDuring voir dire, the prospective juror had stated his belief that if a person felt that his life was in danger, he was justified to take another’s life. When asked if the fact that Smith had survived the altercation with Owens and Jackson rendered him more or less credible, the prospective juror responded, “He was the survivor. You do what you have to do to survive ***.”\n\nIn light of the prospective juror’s statements, we cannot say that the trial court’s acceptance of the state’s race-neutral explanation was clearly erroneous. *See State v. Powers*, 92 Ohio App.3d 400, 406, 635 N.E.2d 1298 (10th Dist.1993) (upholding a peremptory strike challenged under *Batson* where a juror was “very much in favor of the defense of self defense”). Smith has not met his burden to show discriminatory intent, and we overrule his second assignment of error."}

At trial, Wynn testified that after the murders Smith had come to her apartment seeking assistance. He was agitated and bleeding from his wounds. Wynn told the jury that Smith had explained his injuries by stating only that 'I got jumped and they tried to kill me.' And he had given no further details of the incident. For the stated purpose of refreshing her recollection, the state then recounted to Wynn statements that she had made to police investigators on October 2, 2015, the day after the murders. Wynn had urged Smith to tell her what had happened. She told police that Smith had explained that he had been in a building in Evanston and had been with an 'older man' when he was attacked. Wynn recounted to police that she had asked Smith whether that was 'the older man who we always see out there.' Despite being informed of her prior statements, Wynn denied making them and challenged the state to produce her earlier comments. She declared, 'I never said no older man or no building,' and inquired 'don't they record us when we’re in a room on a tape?' The assistant prosecuting attorney then produced a video recording of the interview that was played to Wynn, and over Smith’s objection was played for the jury.

Prosecutorial misconduct will not provide a basis for overturning a criminal conviction, unless, on the record as a whole, the misconduct can be said to have deprived the appellant of a fair trial. The state’s comments made during the questioning of Robbins and the impeachment of Wynn and Smith were not improper and did not affect Smith’s substantial rights. Smith's remaining challenge is to remarks made by the state during closing argument. A prosecutor is entitled to a degree of latitude in closing argument as to what the evidence has shown and what inferences can be drawn from that evidence. Here, Smith did not object to the alleged improprieties in the state’s closing argument. To prevail on these claims, he must establish both that misconduct occurred and that but for the misconduct, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise. Smith asserts that the assistant prosecuting attorney improperly commented on the evidence adduced by Smith to support his self-defense claim, and called Smith a'monster.' The comments on the state of Smith’s self-defense claim were each based on the evidence presented at trial and were within the latitude afforded in closing argument. The prosecuting attorney’s characterization of Smith as a monster, while certainly intemperate, was arguably supported by the facts of the case. In any event, none of the challenged comments were so prejudicial or outcome-determinative as to constitute plain error and to deny Smith a fair trial."}

From the gruesome nature of the fatal wounds that Smith inflicted on his victims and the physical evidence of struggle, the jury was entitled to conclude that Smith had purposely caused their deaths. See, e.g., State v. Tibbs, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-100378, 2011-Ohio-6716, ¶ 28 (intent to kill may be inferred from the manner in which the offense was committed). The jury was also entitled to reject Smith's self-defense claim and his explanation that he had been attacked by Owens and then Jackson. There was no evidence establishing that Smith was not at fault in creating the violent situation. According to Smith's own trial testimony, he had brought a handgun with him when he visited Jackson. After viewing Owens talking with Nook outside the apartment, he brandished the gun and readied it for action by cocking the hammer. He told the jury that he had remained in the apartment even though Owens had confronted him and ordered him to leave. The record also contains no evidence, save Smith's own testimony, establishing that he was in danger of imminent death or great bodily harm. A defendant's belief of imminent death or harm must be objectively reasonable. See In re B.M., 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170103, 2018-Ohio-1733, ¶ 12; see also State v. Oates, 2013-Ohio-2609, 993 N.E.2d 846, ¶ 11 (3d Dist.). The substantially younger Smith employed brutal measures in response to Owens' alleged attack. No weapons were found on or near the victims' bodies. See State v. Clark, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150318, 2016-Ohio-948, ¶ 19. And his actions were hardly similar in nature to the force he claimed that Owens or Jackson had employed. Finally, no evidence establishes that Smith had not violated any duty to retreat or avoid the danger. From the coroner's testimony and the other physical evidence, it is clear that Smith had reasonable means to retreat and could have ended the altercation or fled at almost any point. See Thomas, 77 Ohio St.3d at 326, 673 N.E.2d 1339. Owens was clearly immobilized on the bed by Smith's first gunshots. And Smith's struggle with the 72-year old Jackson afforded him several opportunities to retreat from the confrontation rather than persist and inflict numerous, gruesome wounds on Jackson."}

Here, it is clear from the trial court’s remarks at the sentencing hearing that it considered the relevant provisions of R.C. Chapter 2929 in fashioning Smith’s sentences. The trial court engaged Smith in a meaningful discussion about the seriousness of his actions and noted that he had committed these offenses while he was on community control. The court clearly articulated its reasons why the prison terms were appropriate. Thus Smith cannot demonstrate that the trial court failed to consider the purposes and principles of sentencing. See State v. Taylor, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-150488, 2016-Ohio-4548, ¶ 3.\n\nSmith’s next argument, that the trial court erred as a matter of law by failing to notify him at sentencing that he would be required to submit to mandatory DNA testing, is similarly without merit. Any error resulting from the trial court’s failure to inform Smith about DNA testing was harmless and did not prejudice Smith. See Taylor at ¶ 6.\n\nFinally, Smith argues that the trial court failed to include its consecutive-sentencing findings in the sentencing entries. Here, the trial court made the findings to support the imposition of consecutive sentences on the record at the sentencing hearing. Those findings are amply supported in this record. See R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). But, as the state concedes, the court failed to make those findings a part of its sentencing entry as required by the Ohio Supreme Court’s decision in State v. Bonnell, 140 Ohio St.3d 209, 2014-Ohio-3177, 16 N.E.3d 659, syllabus. Thus we sustain the ninth assignment of error, in part."}

Of course, the doctrine only applies where we “find multiple instances of harmless error.” Garner at 64. But where multiple errors exist, we must inquire whether there is a ‘reasonable possibility that the evidence may have contributed to the accused’s conviction.’” State v. Echols, 128 Ohio App.3d 677, 700, 716 N.E.2d 728 (1st Dist.1998), quoting State v. DeMarco, 31 Ohio St.3d 191, 195, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987). In other words, ‘there must be overwhelming evidence of the accused’s guilt or some other indicia that the error did not contribute to the conviction.’” Leach at ¶ 57, quoting Echols at 700, quoting DeMarco at 195.\n\n{¶38} Although the cumulative error doctrine is necessarily case specific, the doctrine most often applies where the evidence is not overwhelming or when the outcome depends upon witness credibility. See, e.g., Leach at ¶ 58 (“[W]here the evidence of guilt was not overwhelming * * * * [w]e conclude that the cumulative effect of the errors identified by [the defendant] rendered his trial unfair.”); Echols at 700 (finding cumulative error ‘where the evidence of guilt for each incident was not overwhelming’); State v. Zimmerman, 2019-Ohio-721, 132 N.E.3d 1185, ¶ 34 (10th Dist.) (finding cumulative error where police improperly testified to bolster victim’s credibility and where the jury spent at least some time considering a photo of the defendant’s knife which had inadvertently been shown).\n\n{¶39} Here, we recognize three errors: (1) the inadequate justifications for witness nondisclosure; (2) the impermissible testimony regarding a muzzle flash; and (3) the court taking judicial notice of the date of the Facebook post. Even considering the aggregate impact of these errors, we fail to see how they command reversal. As explained above, any\nprejudicial impact of the nondisclosures is speculative—and we cannot indulge such speculation simply because we are peering through the cumulative error lens. That leaves us with the date of the Facebook post and the detective's inopportune comment about the muzzle flash. Any prejudicial impact of both errors is slight (for reasons we've discussed above), and adding them together does not yield a conclusion that these errors contributed to Mr. Baber's conviction. We also recognize that the trial court took immediate steps to minimize any prejudicial impact of the detective's comment.\n\n{¶40} When we measure these errors against the overall evidence, it only reinforces this conclusion. Although the state's evidence may not have been overwhelming, it was powerful, enhanced by the impact of the video evidence, the picture of Mr. Baber in similar attire as the presumptive shooter, and the testimony from the eyewitnesses. Evaluating the strength of this evidence against the effect of the two errors convinces us that the cumulative effect of these errors did not deprive Mr. Baber of a fair trial. We accordingly overrule this assignment of error."}

The jury was aware of Smith’s role in the robbery and her plea deal. In fact, the jury heard that Smith, at the time of trial, was in jail on a probation violation. She was handcuffed during her testimony. During cross-examination, Smith admitted she initially faced “significant prison time” for her participation in the robbery. Smith downplayed her role in the robbery, claiming that she was looking to purchase jewelry and was not “casing” the store for her cohorts to rob.

The motion was denied in February 2017. Zimpfer filed an appeal of that decision. However, as the appeal was not filed until July 2017, we dismissed it as untimely. No further motion was filed seeking the records from the Clerk’s Office. Therefore, this issue is not properly before us.\n\n¶ 27 We next address the claim that the trial court should have required the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office to provide Zimpfer with a complete, unabridged copy of its file. Zimpfer’s motion was styled as a Crim.R. 16 request for discovery. However, in it he also argues that he is entitled to his case file under the public records law.\n\n¶ 28 R.C. 149.43(B)(4) provides:\nA public office or person responsible for public records is not required to permit a person who is incarcerated pursuant to a criminal conviction or a juvenile adjudication to inspect or to obtain a copy of any public record concerning a criminal investigation or prosecution or concerning what would be a criminal investigation or prosecution if the subject of the investigation or prosecution were an adult, unless the request to inspect or to obtain a copy of the record is for the purpose of acquiring information that is subject to release as a public record under this section and the judge who imposed the sentence or made the adjudication with respect to the person, or the judge's successor in office, finds that the information sought in the public record is necessary to support what appears to be a justiciable claim of the person.\n\n¶ 29 “R.C. 149.43(B)(4) sets forth heightened requirements for inmates seeking public records, and requires an incarcerated criminal defendant to demonstrate that the information he is seeking pursuant to R.C. 149.43 is necessary to support a justiciable claim or defense.” State v. Gibson, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 06CA37, 2007-Ohio-7161, ¶ 13, citing State ex rel. Russell v. Thornton, 111 Ohio St.3d 409, 2006-Ohio-5858, 856 N.E.2d 966; State v. Lofton, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 20923, 2006-Ohio-4651. Zimpfer's motion failed to identify any claim, justiciable or otherwise, that would require the records he seeks as he has failed to demonstrate that there is any pending proceeding with respect to which the requested documents would be material. While he has stated in his appellate brief that he has potential future claims, he has not shown that any of them remain justiciable in his case, which already includes a direct appeal, a\npetition for post-conviction relief, and two applications for reopening. And as noted above, his claim that he has an ongoing federal habeas corpus action is not supported by this record. As a result, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the public records request.\n\n{¶ 30} To the extent that Zimpfer’s motion simply constituted a Crim.R. 16 motion seeking discovery, rather than a public records request, we note that his motion fails to establish that the State had not already complied with its discovery duties. Further, as noted by the State, Crim.R. 16, upon which Zimpfer's motion was premised, “contemplates motions for discovery before or during trial, not during post-conviction proceedings.” State v. Humphrey, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19243, 2002-Ohio-6525, ¶ 3. And, since no proceedings were pending, there was no showing of the necessity for such discovery.\n\n¶ 31 We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested discovery or records."}

Weaver additionally faults the trial court in connection with closing statements for sustaining the prosecutor’s objection to a remark made by his defense attorney. Prosecutors, in general, are entitled to considerable latitude in opening and closing arguments. To resolve a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, courts evaluate whether such remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the accused. The touchstone of this analysis ‘is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.’ Regarding opening statements, Weaver argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by telling the jury that it would ‘hear about the last 56 days of [S.T.’s] short life’ in which S.T. was ‘bruised [and] burned,’ suffered a skull fracture, and died. Weaver describes these remarks as misconduct because ‘the jury did not hear about the last 56 days’ of S.T.’s life, and because the jury would have been prejudiced against him by the prosecutor’s implication that he had ‘tortured [S.T.] for [those] 56 days.’ Regarding closing statements, Weaver charges the trial court with error for overruling his objection when the prosecutor commented that ‘there was no legal defense’ for the conduct of which Weaver stood accused. Weaver argues that the trial court erred because the comments amounted to an ‘attack [on him for his] failure to testify at trial’ in abrogation of his Fifth Amendment right. The context in which the prosecutor made the foregoing comment, however, undermines Weaver’s argument. Moments earlier, the prosecutor remarked that what had happened to S.T. ‘was not an accident,’ and the court sustained Weaver’s objection in response, reminding the parties and the jury that there would be ‘no instruction on accident.’"}

He also contends that Dr. Schlievert’s opinions were inadmissible because they were not stated to a reasonable degree of medical probability.\n\n1. Dr. Schlievert’s testimony exceeded the scope of his written report.\n\n¶ 17 Dr. Schlievert interviewed Me.W. and Mi.W. on August 1, 2013, and issued a report summarizing those interviews. The state produced this report to Walls well before trial, but in its opening statement, it became clear that it intended to elicit opinions that exceeded the scope of what was contained in the report. Defense counsel raised this issue with the court, and the state confirmed that it intended to question Dr. Schlievert about topics not included in the report, including delayed disclosure, grooming, and recantation. Walls objected and asked that Dr. Schlievert’s testimony be limited to what was disclosed in his report.\n\n¶ 18 After hearing argument from counsel and reviewing relevant case law, the trial court overruled Walls’ objection. The court admonished the state, however, that future Crim.R. 16(K) violations will result in exclusion of the expert’s testimony. It allowed the state to question Dr. Schlievert in the manner it had planned.\n\n¶ 19 Dr. Schlievert testified about his interviews of Me.W. and Mi.W. and the contents of his report. He also explained the concept of “grooming,” which he described as the process by which abusers progressively instill in a child the belief that it is “normal” or “not unusual” to engage in sexual conduct, and he discussed the reasons that victims delay in reporting or recant allegations of sexual abuse. In doing so, he cited a number of specific studies published in medical journals. He said that Me.W. showed signs of having been sexually traumatized and groomed, and he sensed that she was trying to protect her father. He described Me.W. as a “troubled young lady with some serious psychological issues” that “would fit with being sexually abused,” and he expressed his view that her behaviors and reactions were typical of children who are victims of multi-year incest. Dr. Schlievert’s written report does not contain any of these opinions.\n\n¶ 20 Dr. Schlievert acknowledged that these opinions were not set forth in his report. He claimed that while he believed sexual abuse was likely at the time of his interview, he could not make a diagnosis in his report because Me.W. did not disclose it to him. He said that his failure to note this impression in his report should by no means be interpreted that he did not have “grave concerns” of incest or sexual abuse. He said that he had a “gut feeling” and a “medical belief” that Me.W. was the victim of sexual abuse and incest, but he claimed that he was unable to make a diagnosis of sexual abuse for purposes of preparing a medical record that would one day be entered into evidence in legal proceedings. Dr. Schlievert nonetheless presented this diagnosis at trial through live testimony even though he conceded that he never saw the children after August 1, 2013, and he received no additional records pertinent to Me.W.’s case after that date.\n¶ 21 Crim.R. 16(K) provides:\n\nAn expert witness for either side shall prepare a written report summarizing the expert witness’s testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinion, and shall include a summary of the expert’s qualifications. The written report and summary of qualifications shall be subject to disclosure under this rule no later than twenty-one days prior to trial, which period may be modified by the court for good cause shown, which does not prejudice any other party. Failure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert’s testimony at trial. (Emphasis added.)\n\n¶ 22 The vast majority of Dr. Schlievert’s three-page report is dedicated to a factual summary of his interviews of the children, after which he states the following:\n\nForensic exams were deferred as there were no disclosures of sexual abuse. In addition, [Me.W.] has disclosure of masturbation/techniques would make it difficult to determine what caused a finding on her exam if we found one [sic]. Hence, there was no forensic usefulness to do an exam today.\n\nThere is no further medical care needed at our office. The kids should see a doctor for regular care as soon as possible. Thank you for referring [Me.W.] and [Mi.W.] to our program. If you have any questions, please call * * *.\nThe report does not set forth the findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinions about which he testified at trial, and it does not cite the studies and publications that he discussed during his testimony. When asked by the trial court whether Dr. Schlievert’s report summarized his testimony about such things as grooming and delayed reporting, the state conceded: “No, it does not, not regarding those specific topics * * *.”\n\n{¶ 23} We have reviewed both Dr. Schlievert’s written report and his trial testimony. Unquestionably, his testimony far exceeded the scope of his report. To the extent that the state did not disclose Dr. Schlievert’s testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, and opinions in a written report produced 21 days before trial, it violated Crim.R. 16(K).\n\n2. There are limits on a trial court’s discretion under Crim.R. 16(K).\n\n{¶ 24} What we must next determine is whether the state’s violation of Crim.R. 16(K) required the court to preclude it from offering Dr. Schlievert’s undisclosed opinions, as Walls argues, or whether it was within the court’s discretion to allow the testimony.\n\n{¶ 25} The state maintains that it is within the trial court’s discretion to fashion a sanction for a Crim.R. 16(K) violation, and it must impose the least severe sanction possible. Here, the state claims, the trial court reprimanded it on the record. It urges that “given the mild nature of the alleged discovery abuse,” the oral reprimand was an appropriate sanction. It further maintains that prosecutorial violations of Crim.R. 16(K) are reversible only where it is shown that (1) the state willfully violated the rule,\n(2) foreknowledge of the information would have aided in preparing a defense, and\n(3) the defendant suffers prejudice. It insists that Walls cannot show any of these three elements.\n\n{¶ 26} Ordinarily, “[a trial court has broad discretion to determine the appropriate sanction for a discovery violation, and a trial court’s decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.” State v. Alvarado, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-13-1225, 2015-Ohio-75, ¶ 42, citing State v. Woods, 4th Dist. Ross No. 13CA3396, 2014-Ohio-4429, ¶ 15. And generally speaking, the state’s failure to disclose discoverable evidence under Crim.R. 16 does not constitute reversible error where the nondisclosure was not willful, foreknowledge of the withheld information would not have aided appellant’s defense, and no prejudice resulted from the nondisclosure. State v. Wiles, 59 Ohio St.3d 71, 80, 571 N.E.2d 97 (1991).\n\n{¶ 27} Effective July 1, 2010, Crim.R. 16 underwent comprehensive changes. As part of those changes, Crim.R. 16(K) was enacted, requiring for the first time that experts generate written reports and that those reports be disclosed 21 days before trial. “The purpose of Crim.R. 16(K) is to avoid unfair surprise by providing notice to the defense and allowing the defense an opportunity to challenge the expert’s findings, analysis, or qualifications, possibly with the support of an adverse expert who could discredit the opinion after carefully reviewing the written report.” (Internal citations and quotations omitted.) State v. Buck, 2017-Ohio-273, 81 N.E.3d 895, ¶ 33 (9th Dist.). To that end, Crim.R. 16(K) defines the consequence for failing to disclose an expert’s written report\nas required by the rule: “Failure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert’s testimony at trial.”\n\n¶ 28 Before the July 1, 2010 amendments to the rule, discretion was granted to the trial court under Crim.R. 16(E)(3) to remedy noncompliance with all Crim.R. 16 discovery requirements. It provided that “the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.” See State v. Boaston, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-15-1274, 2017-Ohio-8770, ¶ 46. For the most part, the trial court maintains this discretion to sanction discovery violations, and this discretion is recognized under Crim.R. 16(L)(1):\n\nThe trial court may make orders regulating discovery not inconsistent with this rule. If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evidence the material not disclosed, or it may make such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\n\n¶ 29 But Crim.R. 16(L)(1) added an important limitation on the trial court’s discretion: that it make orders “not inconsistent with this rule.” (Emphasis added.) The plain language of Crim.R. 16(K) requires exclusion of an expert’s testimony where a\nwritten report from the expert has not been disclosed. It would, therefore, be inconsistent with Crim.R. 16(K) to hold otherwise.\n\n¶ 30 Our review of the case law that has developed since Crim.R. 16(K)’s effective date reveals that many courts apply Crim.R. 16(L)(1) and hold that trial courts retain discretion to allow an expert’s testimony despite the failure to disclose a written report. See, e.g., State v. Opp, 3d Dist. Seneca No. 13-13-33, 2014-Ohio-1138, ¶ 16 (“We therefore continue to apply the long-established precedent, which holds that questions regarding the admission or exclusion of evidence are within the trial court’s discretion * * *, and we will apply this standard to the trial court’s actions in connection with violations of Crim.R. 16(K).”).\n\n¶ 31 We cannot reconcile this conclusion with the plain language of Crim.R. 16(K) which unambiguously precludes the expert’s testimony. We, therefore, hold that Crim.R. 16(K) mandates exclusion of expert testimony where a written report has not been disclosed in accordance with the rule. In reaching this conclusion, however, we make several observations.\n\n¶ 32 First, the plain language of Crim.R. 16(K) does allow discretion to modify the deadline for disclosing an expert’s written report, but only if good cause has been shown and no prejudice results to any party. See e.g., State v. McGhee, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2014-T-0106, 2017-Ohio-5773, ¶ 18, 20-21 (reversing and remanding for a new trial where state disclosed written report three days before trial without showing good cause and where prejudice resulted to defendant).\nSecond, where a written report has been produced, issues may arise where (1) the expert seeks to supplement or modify the opinions contained in the report, or (2) the parties genuinely debate whether the expert’s proposed testimony exceeds the scope of what was disclosed in the report. These matters appropriately require the trial court to exercise discretion.\n\nThird, a party may waive a violation of Crim.R. 16(K). We have addressed a number of situations where this has happened. For instance, in State v. Williams, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-14-1067, 2015-Ohio-1686, ¶ 17-21, we found, inter alia, that appellant waived the Crim.R. 16(K) violation by objecting only to the admission of the expert’s report and not to the expert’s testimony. And in Boaston, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-15-1274, 2017-Ohio-8770, ¶ 39-49, we found that appellant waived the Crim.R. 16(K) violation because defense counsel failed to raise the issue until after opening statements, despite learning of the violation 19 days before trial during an interview with the expert, at which time the expert disclosed the substance of the opinions that she intended to offer at trial. We recognized in Boaston that Crim.R. 16(A) requires parties to exercise due diligence. This may require pretrial motion practice under Crim.R. 12 should it become known that an expert intends to express opinions and either (1) no written report was disclosed; or (2) the report is somehow deficient or incomplete.¹\n\n¹ In State v. Luce, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-16-1028, 2017-Ohio-4472, ¶ 44-48, we noted that appellant failed to raise an objection to the Crim.R. 16(K) violation at or before trial, and we reviewed for plain error. Plain-error review was, however, effectively unnecessary because a trial court cannot address a Crim.R. 16(K) discovery violation that\nFinally, common sense should not be ignored when there has been clear compliance with the purpose of Crim.R. 16(K), which is to eliminate unfair surprise at trial by requiring advance disclosure of an expert’s qualifications and opinions so that opposing counsel has sufficient time to prepare for cross-examination, retain a rebuttal expert, and seek court intervention if there is reason to believe that the disclosures are inadequate. For instance, in State v. Retana, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-12-225, 2012-Ohio-5608, ¶ 49, the state did not provide the defense a “written report” from its expert, but six months before trial, it provided it with a transcript of the expert’s testimony in a companion case, specifically articulating the expert’s opinions. Clearly no unfair surprise or trial by ambush could be claimed where the defense had the expert’s actual testimony in its possession a full six months before trial.\n\nAnd in State v. Crosby, 5th Dist. Guernsey No. 15 CA 000011, 2016-Ohio-571, ¶ 13-23, the state failed to disclose a “written report” from its expert, but six months before trial, it turned over the expert’s PowerPoint presentation. This presentation contained the expert’s conclusions, findings, and opinions, but not his analysis. Defendant claimed that knowledge of the analytical process employed by the expert was needed so that his own expert could refute the opinions and conclusions, but he never made any request to the state for a more detailed report during that six-month time period. Again, there was ample opportunity to ask the court to intervene if more was never brought to its attention. In such situations, any error would be that of trial counsel, not the trial court.\n\n{¶ 37} Subject to the caveats we have discussed, we hold that Crim.R. 16(K) requires exclusion of expert testimony where a written report containing the expert’s testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinions has not been disclosed before trial.\n\n3. The trial court erred by admitting the expert testimony.\n\n{¶ 38} Here, although the state provided Dr. Schlievert’s written report to Walls before trial, it is undisputed that the report wholly failed to disclose that Dr. Schlievert intended to testify about sexual grooming, delayed disclosure, or recantation. It did not identify the studies upon which Dr. Schlievert relied in forming his opinions. And it did not disclose his opinions that Me.W. was “a troubled young lady with some serious psychological issues” that would fit with someone being sexually abused, that she exhibited signs of someone who’s been sexually traumatized and sexually groomed, that she exhibited behaviors typically seen in children who are incest victims, or that it was, in his opinion, likely that she had been sexually abused in the past. Because there was no genuine debate that Dr. Schlievert’s proposed testimony exceeded the scope of what was disclosed in his report, it was incumbent on the court to preclude Dr. Schlievert from testifying to these undisclosed opinions.\n\n{¶ 39} Moreover, it was not until the state’s opening statement that there was any suggestion that Dr. Schlievert’s testimony would exceed the scope of his report. There was no earlier opportunity, therefore, for Walls to seek the court’s intervention. This is\nprecisely the type of trial-by-ambush strategy that Crim.R, 16(K) was enacted to prevent. Upon learning of the proposed testimony, defense counsel properly objected at the earliest point possible, effectively preserving his objections for our review. Accordingly, Walls did not waive his objections to the Crim.R. 16(K) violation. It was error to allow Dr. Schlievert’s testimony.\n\n4. The admission of the expert’s undisclosed opinions resulted in prejudice.\n\n¶ 40 Having found that the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Schlievert’s testimony, we must determine whether that error is reversible. Crim.R. 52(A) provides that “[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.”\n\n¶ 41 The Ohio Supreme Court explained in State v. Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, ¶ 23, that in performing a harmless-error inquiry, the state has the burden to prove that the error did not affect the defendant’s substantial rights. It recognized that “substantial rights” “has been interpreted to require that the error must have been prejudicial.” (Internal quotations omitted.) Id. It clarified that determining whether error is prejudicial requires appellate courts to evaluate “both the impact that the offending evidence had on the verdict and the strength of the remaining evidence.” Id. at ¶ 25-26. Appellate courts “must excise the improper evidence from the record and then look to the remaining evidence” in order to determine whether there is “overwhelming evidence of guilt or some other indicia that the error did not contribute to the conviction.” Id. at ¶ 29. An error in the admission of evidence is harmless only when\n“there is no reasonable possibility that the testimony contributed to the accused’s conviction.” *Id.* at ¶ 28. In addition, the conduct of the prosecutor “may combine with an evidentiary error to cause greater impact.” *Id.* at ¶ 30.\n\n{¶ 42} The Eleventh District considered whether prejudice resulted to the defendant in a factually analogous case. In *State v. McGhee*, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2014-T-0106, 2017-Ohio-5773, the state’s witness list included the name of a physician specializing in child sexual abuse who served as the site director of the child advocacy center where the victim was examined, but it provided no written report from this doctor. Five days before trial, the defense moved to exclude his testimony after learning at a pretrial that the state intended to call the doctor to testify about the reasons for a victim’s delayed disclosure of abuse. He argued that the state violated Crim.R. 16(K) by failing to provide an expert report from the witness within 21 days of trial. The state responded by providing a written report three days before trial.\n\n{¶ 43} Noting that Crim.R. 16(K) grants discretion to modify the deadline for exchanging expert reports, and observing that the defense had known for several months that the doctor may be called to testify, the trial court denied the motion and permitted the testimony. The expert testified about the reasons for delayed disclosure of sexual abuse and why a victim may display no physical signs of abuse.\n\n{¶ 44} On appeal, the Eleventh District acknowledged that Crim.R. 16(K) was enacted to prevent trial by ambush. It recognized that the rule allows the trial court to modify the deadline for disclosing written reports from experts, but it emphasized that\n“good cause” must be shown and there must be no prejudice to any party. It found that the state did not show good cause for waiting until three days before trial to disclose its expert’s written report. It also found that the doctor’s testimony was “vital” because without it, “a jury might well question [the victim’s] testimony that [defendant] had been molesting her for four years.” *Id.* at ¶ 20. It observed that the doctor’s testimony “may have significantly buttressed her credibility.” *Id.* Because the state failed to show good cause and because prejudice resulted to the defendant, the Eleventh District reversed and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial.\n\n{¶ 45} We must reach the same conclusion here. First, it is clear that the state intended for Dr. Schlievert’s testimony to carry great weight with the jury. His experience and education in child abuse pediatrics were presented to emphasize that he was qualified to diagnose Me.W. and to express opinions about how this diagnosis manifested itself in her behavior and reactions. He was the only expert to do so. See *State v. Holt*, 17 Ohio St.2d 81, 86, 246 N.E.2d 365 (1969) (“Because of the witness’s educational background and his apparent prestige, his testimony undoubtedly made an impression on the jury and was accorded greater weight than it was entitled to.”).\n\n*Compare State v. Luce*, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-16-1028, 2017-Ohio-4472, ¶ 47 (finding no prejudicial error in admission of expert’s undisclosed opinions where “the remaining admissible evidence contained in the record contains much of the same information as [the expert] provided during his testimony”).\nAdditionally, there was no physical evidence in this case. The state’s case hinged largely upon whether the jury believed Me.W. Dr. Schlievert’s testimony was important to overcome credibility issues arising from (1) Me.W.’s repeated denials of abuse, (2) her initial statements of support for her father, (3) her delayed disclosure of abuse followed by recantation, and (4) additional instances of dishonesty explored during Me.W. and others’ testimony.\n\nFinally, the state further emphasized the improper evidence by repeatedly referencing Dr. Schlievert’s testimony in its closing argument. For example, the state told the jury that they should believe Dr. Schlievert. The prosecutor told the jury:\n\n[Dr. Schlievert is] a child abuse pediatrician. He’s been treating abused children for 15 years exclusively. You saw his resume. You saw him testify. You saw him spouting off articles and referencing statistics. I mean, the guy knows his stuff. He’s seen hundreds, maybe even thousands of patients. * * * It was clear to Dr. Schlievert that [Me.W.] was protecting someone. He said these psychologic – this psychological damage, it leaks through. You can see through it. He could see through it because he’s trained to see through it. He said that [Me.W.’s] behavior was consistent with a sexually abused child. Not just sexually abused, but a sexually abused child of incest.\n\nThe state’s closing argument also highlighted that Dr. Schlievert testified that Me.W.’s delayed disclosure of abuse “is extremely typical of kids of sexual abuse.\nThey wait until they’re comfortable. He said late disclosure is also very common when there’s a lack of a mother. What do we have here. No mother.”\n\n¶ 49 And the state relied upon Dr. Schlievert’s testimony to explain Me.W.’s recanting of her initial allegations of abuse, telling the jury that Dr. Schlievert explained that this is “very typical for these kids of sexual abuse to recant, especially when the abuse is from a parent and especially when there’s a lack of support of a non-offending caretaker. No mom.”\n\n¶ 50 The state’s multiple references to the importance of Dr. Schlievert’s testimony served to highlight the error to the jury, and further demonstrates why Dr. Schlievert’s opinions were “vital to the state’s case.” See McGhee, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2014-T-0106, 2017-Ohio-5773, at ¶ 20; Morris, 141 Ohio St.3d 399, 2014-Ohio-5052, 24 N.E.3d 1153, at ¶ 30. Moreover, given that Dr. Schlievert’s undisclosed opinions buttressed the credibility of Me.W’s testimony, it is impossible to “excise the improper evidence” to determine whether the remaining evidence, alone, overwhelmingly supports a guilty verdict. Id. at ¶ 29.\n\n¶ 51 Because of the impact of Dr. Schlievert’s testimony and the state’s actions in emphasizing the improper testimony for the jury, we find that there is “a reasonable possibility that the testimony contributed to the accused’s conviction.” Id. at ¶ 28. We therefore cannot find harmless error and, instead, we must conclude that Walls was prejudiced by the admission of Dr. Schlievert’s undisclosed opinions. Id. The admission\nof his testimony constituted reversible error requiring remand to the trial court for a new trial.\n\n5. The expert’s opinions were not competent.\n\n¶ 52 Walls also points out that Dr. Schlievert’s opinions were not stated to a reasonable degree of medical probability. “A medical expert’s opinion testimony is only competent if it is held to a reasonable degree of medical certainty or probability.” State v. Smith, 4th Dist. Ross No. 02CA2687, 2003-Ohio-5524, ¶ 16. Dr. Schlievert testified that he did not make a medical diagnosis in his report because he lacked diagnostic certainty:\n\nWell, I think I was careful to say on direct with [the state] that those were gut feelings, medical beliefs, but because of the lack of disclosure, I did not feel that I could make a certain final diagnosis of sexual abuse that would go on a record that would then enter legal proceedings. * * *\n\n¶ 53 Dr. Schlievert nonetheless testified at trial that it was his “medical opinion” that “[Me.W’s] behavior [was] consistent with a sexually abused child.” Dr. Schlievert made this diagnosis before the jury even though the state never established that the opinions to which he testified were held to a reasonable degree of medical probability. As such, his opinion testimony was not competent.\n\n¶ 54 Because Dr. Schlievert’s opinions were improperly admitted at trial and Walls was prejudiced by the error, we find Walls’ first assignment of error well-taken. Our conclusion necessitates a remand to the trial court for a new trial."}

On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Me.W. why she left her mother’s house. Me.W. responded that her mother had kicked her out. When defense counsel asked why, the state objected and asked to approach the bench. The state advised the court that it did not know how Me.W. would respond to the question, but it reminded the court that it had granted a motion in limine precluding testimony about Me.W.’s juvenile record, which apparently included an adjudication of delinquency for a domestic violence incident involving her mother.\n\n¶ 57 The trial court reiterated that it would not allow evidence of Me.W.’s juvenile record, and the state asked if the court would advise Me.W. that she may not discuss this topic. The court asked defense counsel if he objected to it telling Me.W. to avoid the topic of her juvenile record, and defense counsel said no. The court, therefore, told Me.W. not to talk about it at all. Me.W. then asked the court how she should respond to defense counsel’s question given that the domestic violence incident was “one of the major reasons” she was kicked out of her mother’s house.

The court conferred with the parties concerning Walls’ objection. It was advised that phone records showed that Grubbe left messages for Walls on July 1, 2013, at 12:55 and 1:06 p.m. This was shortly after Grubbe spoke with Detective Nixon about the need for Walls to surrender the children into ECCS custody. In the first message, Grubbe simply left his name and number and asked that Walls return the call. The second message was more substantive.\n\n¶ 64 The court ruled that the content of Grubbe’s second message was protected by the attorney-client privilege, but Walls sought to exclude the first message as well, arguing that (1) his identity as Grubbe’s client, and (2) the fact that Grubbe contacted Walls were protected by privilege unless waived. The court found that neither Walls’ identity as Grubbe’s client nor the fact that Grubbe contacted Walls was protected by privilege, and it allowed Grubbe to testify.\nOn direct examination, the state asked Grubbe if he knew Walls. Grubbe admitted that he knew Walls “by telephone,” and represented him between June 25, 2013, and July 16, 2013. He testified that he spoke with Detective Nixon about Walls, and admitted that after speaking with Detective Nixon, he contacted Walls.\n\n“The burden of showing that testimony [should] be excluded under the doctrine of privileged attorney-client communications rests upon the parties seeking to exclude it.” Lemley v. Kaiser, 6 Ohio St.3d 258, 263-264, 452 N.E.2d 1304 (1983). Generally, a client’s name or identity is not protected by the attorney-client privilege because it is not a fact about which the client seeks legal assistance. Id. at 264. This is especially true here given that Walls disclosed to Detective Nixon that Grubbe represented him. We, therefore, conclude that Walls’ identity as Grubbe’s client was not protected by the attorney-client privilege.\n\nAs to Grubbe calling Walls after speaking with Detective Nixon, the attorney-client privilege protects the substance of communications—”not the fact that there has been communication.” Burton v.

None of these provisions require that material be produced in order for a performance to constitute an \"obscene performance.\" We find no error in the state’s failure to prove that Walls created photos, videos, or other materials of the sex acts that he instructed Me.W. to perform in front of him because this is not an element of the offense."}

Deem, 40 Ohio St.3d 205, 533 N.E.2d 294 (1988), paragraph four of the syllabus. “Provocation, to be serious, must be reasonably sufficient to bring on extreme stress and the provocation must be reasonably sufficient to incite or arouse the defendant into using deadly force.” Id. at paragraph five of the syllabus. To determine if the provocation was reasonably sufficient to incite the defendant to use deadly force, we must “consider the emotional and mental state of the defendant and the conditions and circumstances that surrounded [the defendant] at the time.” Id.\n¶ 10 In a felonious assault trial, an instruction on aggravated assault must be given to the jury where the defendant “presents sufficient evidence of serious provocation.” State v. Morrow, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2002-CA-37, 2002-Ohio-6527, ¶ 7. The provocation must be enough to “arouse the passions of an ordinary person beyond the power of his or her control.” State v. Shane, 63 Ohio St.3d 630, 634-635, 590 N.E.2d 272\nWords alone will not rise to the level of sufficient provocation to incite the use of deadly force. *Id.* at paragraph two of the syllabus.\n¶ 11 The Ohio Supreme Court has discussed what constitutes sufficient provocation to incite a person into using deadly force. “First, an objective standard is applied to determine whether the alleged provocation is sufficient to arouse the passions of an ordinary person beyond the power of his or her control. If that objective standard is met, the inquiry shifts to a subjective standard to determine whether the defendant in the particular case actually was under the influence of a sudden passion or rage.” *Id.* at 634.\n¶ 12 The trial court’s decision whether to grant the requested jury instruction will not be disturbed unless it has abused its discretion. *State v. Murrell*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24717, 2012-Ohio-2108, ¶ 24. “Abuse of discretion has been defined as an attitude that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. It is to be expected that most instances of abuse of discretion will result in decisions that are simply unreasonable, rather than decisions that are unconscionable or arbitrary.” *State v. Malloy*, 2d Dist. Clark No. 11-CA-21, 2012-Ohio-2664, ¶ 24.\n¶ 13 In this case, James cannot meet the objective prong of the *Shane* test. According to testimony and evidence presented at trial, James pulled her car behind Houston and was already upset. She was in a hurry, claiming her car was about to run out of gas, and she wanted Houston to pull away immediately. Then, when Houston got out of her car to argue with James, James became even more irate, as evidenced by the gas station security video. After more arguing, Houston threw a bag of candy at James, James kicked the bumper of Houston’s car, and the brawl ensued.\n¶ 14 None of the actions taken by Houston, either on their own or collectively,\nrose to the level of a serious provocation that would “arouse the passions of an ordinary person beyond the power of his or her control.” See Shane at 635. For instance, no matter how argumentative Houston got with James, arguing did not rise to the level of “serious provocation” because, as the Ohio Supreme Court said in Shane, “words alone will not rise to the level of reasonably sufficient provocation to incite the use of deadly force.” Id. at 634. Tossing a bag of candy at James did not suffice either. An “ordinary person” simply would not react in such a violent manner in a similar situation. It was reasonable that some of Houston’s actions upset James, but an ordinary person would not have responded by stabbing Houston eight times from that type of provocation.\n¶ 15 James argues that she was sufficiently provoked, and the objective prong was satisfied, because she was engaged in “mutual combat” with Houston. This, however, was not “mutual combat.” Black’s Law Dictionary defines “mutual combat” as “a consensual fight on equal terms – arising from a moment of passion but not in self-defense – between two persons armed with deadly weapons.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1045 (8th Ed. 2004). “Mutual combat” has also been described as more than a fist fight, and “usually arises when the parties are armed with deadly weapons and mutually agree or intend to fight with them.” 40 Corpus Juris Secundum, Homicide § 206. While there is no question that James had a deadly weapon, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Houston did. This may have been a consensual fight, but it was not on equal terms, and only James had a weapon.\n¶ 16 The trial court’s decision was not an abuse of discretion. Even if we might have reached a different conclusion than the court did, its decision was not unreasonable, unconscionable, or arbitrary. The record shows that, prior to making its decision on the\naggravated assault instruction, the court heard vigorous arguments from both parties, researched the issue, and then gave a detailed explanation of its decision on the record. It was a reasonable decision.\n¶ 17 Because this was not “mutual combat,” and because James failed to demonstrate that she was sufficiently provoked, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give an aggravated assault instruction. The first assignment of error is overruled."}

Brown, 2017-Ohio-7424, 96 N.E.3d, ¶ 24 (2d Dist.), citing State v. Thomas, 77 Ohio St.3d 323, 326, 673 N.E.2d 1339\nIt is well established that a person cannot provoke a fight or voluntarily enter combat and then claim self-defense. *State v. Wallace-Lee*, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2019-CA-19, 2020-Ohio-3681, ¶ 39; *State v. Nichols*, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 01CA2775, 2002 WL 126973, *3 (Jan. 22, 2002). Another component, within the second prong, ‘is the defendant’s bona fide belief that the use of force was the only means of escape. Part of this entails a showing that the defendant used ‘only that force that [was] reasonably necessary to repel the attack’ ” *Wallace-Lee* at ¶ 42, citing *State v. Bundy*, 2012-Ohio-3924, 974 N.E.2d 139, ¶ 55 (4th Dist.). If the force used was so disproportionate that it shows a purpose to injure, self-defense is unavailable. *Id.* at ¶ 43, quoting *State v. Macklin*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94482, 2011-Ohio-87, ¶ 27.\n\nGenerally, a person has a duty to retreat, if possible, before using lethal force. *State v. Willford*, 49 Ohio St.3d 247, 250, 551 N.E.2d 1279 (1990); *State v. Dale*, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 2012-CA-20, 2013-Ohio-2229, ¶ 15. The exception, known as the Castle Doctrine, applies if a confrontation happens in a person’s home, in which case there is no duty to retreat. R.C. 2901.09(B); *State v. Eng*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 14015, 1994 WL 543277, *5 (Sept. 30, 1994).\n\nIn the case before us now, James failed to establish any of the elements of self-defense. She did not meet the first element, that she was not at fault in creating the violent situation, because she initiated the whole series of events by pulling in behind Houston at the gas pump and immediately yelling at her to move out of the way. James had other alternatives: the security video clearly showed many open pumps. She also initiated the fight by charging at Houston.\nJames also did not establish that the use of the knife was the only means of escape. At any point, before or during the confrontation, James could have de-escalated the situation and left. She could have returned to her car and driven to a different pump when she realized Houston was not ready to leave; she could have returned to her car and left when Houston started arguing with her; she could have returned to her car and left after Houston threw candy at her; and she could have returned to her car and left instead of fighting with Houston. There were other means of escape, James just chose not to use them.\n\nFinally, because the Castle Doctrine did not apply in this case, James had a duty to retreat or avoid the danger before escalating to deadly force. At each step along the way, James could have (but chose not to) avoid the danger. She could have run to the safety of her car and left, or she could have run to the safety of the store to get help; instead, she brought a knife to a fist fight and seriously injured Houston."}

According to this standard, an ‘appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider witness credibility, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact ‘clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.’ ’ State v. Cochran, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 27023, 2017-Ohio-216, ¶ 5, quoting State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997). Although an appellate court ‘must defer to the factfinder's decisions whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses,’ the court nevertheless ‘may determine which of several competing inferences suggested by the evidence should be preferred.’ (Citation omitted.) Id. A conviction ‘should be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence only in exceptional circumstances.’ (Citation omitted.) Id.\n\nAs we noted in our discussion of Appellant's second assignment of error, two witnesses—Herbert Boyd and Ashley Byrd—saw Appellant in possession of a gun in the minutes leading to the shooting. Trial Tr. vol. 2, 547-549, 553 and 558-560; Trial Tr. vol. 3, 865-869 and 877-880.

See Appellant’s Br. 20-21. Appellant’s defense counsel submitted corresponding proposed instructions in advance of Appellant’s trial.\n\nRequested jury instructions ‘should ordinarily be given if they are correct statements of law, if they are applicable to the facts in the case, and if reasonable minds might reach the conclusion sought by the requested instruction.’ State v. Adams, 144 Ohio St.3d 429, 2015-Ohio-3954, 45 N.E.3d 127, ¶ 240, citing Murphy v. Carrollton Mfg. Co., 61 Ohio St.3d 585, 591, 575 N.E.2d 828 (1991), and State v.

Kidder, 32 Ohio St.3d 279, 281, 513 N.E.2d 31 (1987). In the second part, the court determines whether the ‘jury could reasonably find the defendant not guilty of the charged offense, but could convict the defendant of the lesser included offense.’ City of Shaker Heights v. Mosely, 113 Ohio St.3d 329, 2007-Ohio-2072, 865 N.E.2d 859, ¶ 11; State v. Miller, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25504, 2013-Ohio-5621, ¶ 23. If the jury could convict the defendant of the lesser included offense, then an instruction on that offense is required. Miller, 2013-Ohio-5621, ¶ 24, citing State v. Trimble, 122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, ¶ 192.\n\nIn his request for an instruction on involuntary manslaughter, Appellant argued that the anticipated evidence, viewed in his favor, would allow ‘the jury [to] reasonably conclude that [he] was not guilty of the underlying charged offense of felonious assault, but rather a felony charge of aggravated assault or a misdemeanor charge.’ Def.’s Req. for Jury Instructions on Lesser Included Offenses of Involuntary Manslaughter and Reckless Homicide 2, July 14, 2016. Involuntary manslaughter ‘is a lesser included offense of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design[] [under] R.C. 2903.01(A), aggravated felony murder[] [under] R.C. 2903.01(B), and murder[] [under] R.C. 2903.02,’ although aggravated assault is an inferior degree offense with respect to felonious assault. State v. Lynch, 98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, ¶ 78-79; see also State v. Conley, 2015-Ohio-2553, 43 N.E.3d 775, ¶ 32\nBecause the elements of aggravated assault ‘are identical to the elements defining felonious assault, except for the additional mitigating element of serious provocation,’ an instruction ‘on aggravated assault must be given to the jury’ if a ‘defendant presents sufficient evidence of [the] provocation.’ Conley, 2015-Ohio-2553, ¶ 32, citing State v. Morrow, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2002-CA-37, 2002-Ohio-6527, ¶ 7, fn. 2.\n\nAfter the close of evidence and before the parties delivered their closing statements to the jury, the State objected to Appellant’s proposed jury instruction on involuntary manslaughter. Trial Tr. vol. 5, 1506. The trial court sustained the State’s objection, finding that no evidence had been introduced showing that ‘Joshua Hamilton [had] any physical contact or [engaged in] any type of provocational contact with [Appellant].’ Id. at 1508-1509.\n\nThe testimony of Herbert Boyd, Tyrone Moss and Brittany Hamilton establishes that Joshua Hamilton did not initiate the fistfight and that Appellant became involved in the fight once it had already started. See Trial Tr. vol. 2, 545-557 and 640-658; Trial Tr. vol. 3, 1000-1010 and 1115-1120; see also Trial Tr. vol. 5, 1508-1509. In the absence of any provocational conduct on Joshua’s part, vis-à-vis Appellant, the jury could not reasonably have found Appellant guilty of aggravated assault or, by extension, involuntary manslaughter. Hence, we agree that an instruction on involuntary manslaughter was not warranted by the evidence and hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to provide such an instruction to the jury.\n\nAppellant also requested an instruction on reckless homicide. Notwithstanding that Appellant did not object at trial to the court’s refusal to include an instruction on reckless homicide, his submission of a formal request for the instruction\npreserved the issue for appeal. See State v. Fine, 2d Dist. Miami No. 09 CA 00032, 2010-Ohio-2637, ¶ 12-21.\n\nWe find that the evidence did not warrant an instruction on reckless homicide. Herbert Boyd testified that he observed Appellant participating in the fight and ‘kicking Mr. Hamilton in the head’ before the shooting, and that as the fight dissolved, he saw Appellant ‘standing in the doorway raising a gun up.’ Trial Tr. vol. 2, 553-559 and 621. The fact that Appellant drew his gun as the fight ended, as opposed to diving into the fight with his gun already drawn, suggests that Appellant drew his gun for a purpose, a conscious decision incompatible with the standard for recklessness. Moreover, a forensic pathologist testified that Joshua died from a ‘[g]unshot wound [in] the back,’ which she described as ‘a contact wound.’ See id. 452-453 and 460-461. Inasmuch as the gun must have been pressed against Joshua when it was fired, the nature of the wound suggests that it was inflicted intentionally. For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of reckless homicide."}

First, he contends his attorneys should have filed a motion requesting funds for a medical expert and should have retained a medical expert. He reviews the testimony presented by the three physicians called as witnesses by the state. He suggests a medical expert should have been utilized by the defense to rebut their testimony. The state responds the decision could be considered part of the trial strategy and there were no indications of deficiency or prejudice by counsel relying on cross-examination in order to construct a defense. Appellant’s second argument of ineffective assistance of counsel revolves around the state’s final witness, the former director of the Child Advocacy Center. At the time of trial, this physician was working as the chief of child abuse pediatrics at a medical university in South Carolina. He had cerebral palsy and was in a wheelchair. He was subpoenaed to appear to testify at trial on October 3, 2016 at 8:30 a.m. On that day, jury selection began at 8:36 a.m. and was completed at 10:50 a.m. (Tr. 2, 102). After opening statements, the state presented the testimony of the detective, the emergency room physician, the neurosurgeon, the baby's mother, and her friend. At some point, the prosecution advised the court’s bailiff that the final witness was on a flight and would not be present to testify until the next morning. At approximately 3:00 p.m., the court sent the jury from the courtroom to address the whereabouts of the prosecutor's final witness. The court noted how the jurors had been assured their time would not be wasted. The court also noted the lawyers were asked by the bailiff that morning if there was anything they needed to speak to the court about, but the prosecution did not reveal this issue. (Tr. 264-265). The court reminded the assistant prosecutor: “You don't run my court * * * I need to know what's going on.” (Tr. 265). The court inquired: “You knew he wouldn't be here today to testify. * * * When would I get to know that?” (Tr. 266). The prosecutor advised the court the witness was on a flight to this area in order to testify in the morning. (Tr. 264). He envisioned the neurosurgeon's testimony would have taken longer, and he did not realize until after her testimony that the final witness might be called the first day of trial. (Tr. 266, 269). The court scolded, “That's not something you do as you go along. It's something I need to know before we start.” (Tr. 267). The court noted its options ranging from proceeding without the witness to excusing the jury early and resuming in the morning. (Tr. 265, 267, 269). The court also inquired why the prosecution informed the bailiff the final witness's testimony would take three to four hours. (Tr. 270, 272). The assistant prosecutor said this was the state's primary witness. (Tr. 270). The court voiced suspicion about the motive for what it viewed as an overly-high estimate of the time necessary to examine the witness. (Tr. 273-274). The court asked the defense if it wished to say anything before the court decided what to do. Defense counsel said they found out “this morning” the witness would not be available to testify until tomorrow. One of the attorneys noted, “I was quite aware of [the physician's] participation in this trial.” He advised, “I'm not going to quarrel with his presentation.” He also opined there was “no way” the testimony would take three hours, estimating it would take a maximum of one hour. (Tr. 273). The court revealed it was “tempted to impose a sanction” otherwise “you never learn.” (Tr. 274-275). In the end, the court recessed for the day and ordered the case to resume at 8:00 a.m. The court limited the state to one hour with the final witness. (Tr. 275). The court warned the state to get timely pre-approval of the court on the matter of witness scheduling in the future. (Tr. 276). On appeal, Appellant contends defense counsel should have moved the trial court to impose the sanction of precluding the witness from testifying. However, there is no indication such a request would have been successful based upon any defense argument and thus no indication of deficiency or prejudice. The trial court expressed its displeasure over the perceived disrespect for the court’s protocol and scheduling. The concern was not with the effect of the early recess on the defense. There was no issue of notice, i.e., this was not a discovery issue. As defense counsel conceded, he was fully informed the physician would be testifying at trial. Even in the case of a discovery violation, a court should impose the least severe sanction if possible. See State v. Darmond, 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, 986 N.E.2d 971 (2013), applying Lakewood v. Papadelis, 32 Ohio St.3d 1, 511 N.E.2d 1138 (1987), paragraph two of syllabus."}

Debatable trial tactics do not demonstrate deficient performance and ‘do not constitute a deprivation of the effective assistance of counsel.’ Smith at ¶ 63, citing State v. Clayton, 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49, 402 N.E.2d 1189 (1980).\n\nMarshall claims that his trial counsel was ineffective for not filing a motion to suppress or asking for a continuance after he received Davis’s interview notes.\n\nThe interview notes are less than half a page long and contain a very brief summary of the interview. Counsel was aware that Davis and Kassem would testify that Marshall made incriminating statements. The notes would not have provided new or surprising information. Therefore, counsel had no reason to believe that a continuance was necessary when he first received the notes. Once he realized that there was a time discrepancy in the notes, he did ask for a continuance. Counsel’s performance was not deficient. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (“[a] fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel’s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel’s perspective at the time”).\n\nAlso, Marshall has failed to demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that a motion to suppress would have been granted. Thus, he has not demonstrated prejudice. The third assignment of error is overruled."}

It is a question of law for the court to determine, the court is not to weigh the evidence. MacDonald at ¶ 12. ‘When evidence is susceptible to more than one construction, a reviewing court must give it the interpretation that is consistent with the judgment.’ In re J.C., 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-180493, 2019-Ohio-4027, ¶ 20.\n\nIn order to convict Marshall of the trafficking counts, the state had to prove that he knowingly prepared for shipment, shipped, transported, delivered, prepared for distribution, or distributed cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl-related compounds, when he knew or had reasonable cause to believe that the cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl-related compounds, were intended for sale or resale by him or another person. See R.C. 2925.03(A)(2).\n\nTo convict Marshall of the possession of cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl-related compounds, the state was required to prove that he knowingly obtained, possessed, or used cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl-related compounds. See R.C. 2925.11(A).\n\nTo convict Marshall of aggravated possession of drugs, the state had to prove that he knowingly obtained, possessed, or used methamphetamine. See R.C. 2925.11(A) and 2925.11(C)(1).\n\nTo convict Marshal of possession of drugs, the state was required to prove that he knowingly obtained, possessed, or used buprenorphine, and that he was previously convicted of a drug-abuse offense. See R.C. 2925.11(A) and 2925.11(C)(2)(a).\nFinally, to convict Marshall of having a weapon while under a disability, the state had to prove that he knowingly acquired, had, carried, or used a firearm after being convicted of a felony drug-abuse offense. See R.C. 2923.13(A)(3).\n\nMarshall argues that the state failed to present sufficient evidence that he possessed or trafficked any of the drugs. Regarding the charge for having a weapon while under a disability, Marshall stipulated to a prior felony conviction for a drug-abuse offense, but argues that the state failed to prove that he possessed the firearm.\n\nKassem testified that after arresting Marshall he observed several little baggies containing drugs approximately ten feet away from Marshall, in the area where Marshall had just been. Agents found the firearm hidden in the door jamb of his car. Kassem and Davis testified that Marshall admitted ownership of the drugs and the firearm."}

He complains of the agents’ decision to not record the interview, and the lack of physical evidence corroborating their testimony. Agent Fangman testified that it would have been a waste of resources to send the baggies or firearm for DNA testing or fingerprinting, because Marshall admitted the drugs and firearm were his. There is no requirement that interviews of suspects be recorded, and the jury was free to reject the agents’ testimony regarding Marshall’s admissions. We are not persuaded that the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice."}

{"index": "236-Murphy", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "The trial court violated his state and federal constitutional rights when it summarily denied his petition, successive petition for postconviction relief, and delayed motion for a new trial.", "extracted_text": "In his 2019 petition, Murphy raised three grounds for relief: (1) actual innocence; (2) the state committed a *Brady* violation; and (3) ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\n\nA. Actual Innocence\n\nIn his first claim for relief, Murphy contended that he is actually innocent of the charged offenses because the allegations were uncorroborated and the victim recanted her allegations. He supported this claim with Exhibit A, a transcript of an ex parte civil stalking protection order hearing conducted in Portage County, Ohio. Although this evidence is outside the record, the trial court determined that this transcript did not demonstrate any recantation of the victim’s testimony. We agree. Our review of the supporting transcript reveals that the testimony presented at the hearing was given solely by the victim’s mother. Accordingly, the testimony given regarding alleged statements, if any, made by the victim were merely hearsay.\n\nAdditionally, there is no freestanding constitutional right to postconviction relief based on actual innocence. A claim of actual innocence is not itself a constitutional claim, nor does it constitute a substantive ground for\npostconviction relief. *State v. Apanovitch*, 155 Ohio St.3d 358, 2018-Ohio-4744, 121 N.E.3d 351, at ¶ 26, citing *Herrera v. Collins*, 506 U.S. 390, 404, 113 S.Ct. 853, 122 L.Ed.2d 203 (1993); see also *State v. Williams*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 85180, 2005-Ohio-3023, ¶ 31. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in summarily denying his petition on the basis of actual innocence.\n\n**B. Brady Violation**\n\n¶ 16 Murphy contends in his second ground for relief that the state violated *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by withholding exculpatory evidence from his trial counsel. The exculpatory evidence that Murphy claims the state withheld are statements made by the victim prior to trial during meetings with the prosecutors. He contends that the victim attempted to recant the allegations but was told that she was unable to recant. Additionally, Murphy contends that the victim provided varying accounts of the allegations during those conversations. Finally, he maintains that the victim told the prosecuting attorney that she was uncertain whether the allegations were true because she had false, but vivid, memories of attending a boot camp for children who misbehaved. According to Murphy, those statements from the victim were recorded or memorialized but never provided to trial counsel.\n\n¶ 17 Our review of Murphy’s petition and exhibits reveal that these allegations are unsupported by any evidence. First, the arguments raised in the petition do not cite to any evidence outside the record. And the exhibits filed under seal do not contain any information supporting Murphy’s arguments. We note that\nthe state opposed Murphy's petition by discrediting the victim's mother's sworn statement, but as the trial court correctly noted, “the record being reviewed by this court does not contain such a statement.” Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Murphy failed to establish any *Brady* violation.\n\nC. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n¶ 18 In his third ground for relief, Murphy contends that his trial counsel was ineffective because he only met briefly with counsel before trial, and that counsel failed to (1) call any witnesses to provide an alibi; (2) subpoena or speak with doctors and counselors who treated the victim; (3) retain a medical expert to rebut the state’s expert regarding the correlation between sexual abuse and a physical examination; (4) call the victim’s mother as a witness; (5) cross-examine the victim on a prior false allegation of assault; (6) object to the state’s use of Murphy’s internet searches and willingness to take a polygraph; (7) object to the testimony of Detective Adkins; and (8) fully develop and proffer the facts and circumstances surrounding an alleged incident of abuse in 2013 and the involvement of the victim’s “stepmother.” He further contends that counsel opened the door to damaging testimony from Dr. McPherson. According to Murphy, had counsel investigated and developed this new information and the information readily available to him, the state’s case against him would have been undermined.\n\n¶ 19 In support of these allegations, Murphy relies on confidential records from the Cuyahoga County Division of Children and Family Services related to a\nprior allegation and investigation in 2015 involving the victim. A review of the record reveals that these records were provided or made available to trial counsel prior to trial; thus, the records are not evidence outside the record. See Docket No. 13, Submission of CCDCFS Records; and Docket No. 17, Supplemental Response to Request for Discovery.\n\n\\{¶ 20\\} Additionally, Murphy challenged on direct appeal (1) Dr. McPherson’s testimony; (2) the discussions and interactions between the victim and her father’s girlfriend; (3) testimony regarding Murphy’s willingness to take a polygraph test; (4) the use of his internet searches; and (5) that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. See Murphy at ¶ 4, 82.\n\n\\{¶ 21\\} Accordingly, because the evidence relied upon by Murphy in support of this ground for relief was available to him during trial, and the arguments made in his petition were or could have been addressed on direct appeal, we agree with the trial court that res judicata bars his postconviction ground for relief regarding his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n\n\\{¶ 22\\} Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Murphy’s 2019 petition for postconviction relief without a hearing because the petition, the supporting evidence, and the record do not demonstrate sufficient operative facts to establish substantive grounds for relief, or in the alternative, res judicata bars his requested grounds for relief."}

Smith testified he never saw Portis hit him because the basement was dark after the lights were turned off. However, Coleman testified he was hit in the head and that, as he turned, he observed Portis, who then hit him in the face and fractured his jaw. Coleman also testified that Portis hit Smith and took the money from Smith. Coleman testified he had a good opportunity to observe Portis when Portis first approached the men outside the unit just minutes before the attack occurred.\n\nOfficer Hayes testified that Smith and Coleman were still at the scene when they provided information identifying Portis as the perpetrator. He testified they also identified Portis when he interviewed them later at the hospital. Hayes testified Smith informed him that Portis was the assailant and that Portis took the rent money from him.\n\nBased upon this evidence, we cannot say the jury lost its way in concluding Portis was the principal actor in the attack on Coleman. Further, Coleman’s testimony supported a finding that Portis also attacked Smith.\n\nNext, Portis contends the State did not present sufficient evidence to establish that a deadly weapon was used in the commission of the assaults. In support, he argues that no weapon was recovered and that there was no expert testimony regarding what caused the injuries to each man.\n\nR.C. 2923.11(A) defines ‘deadly weapon’ as ‘any instrument, device, or thing capable of inflicting death, and designed or specially adapted for use as a weapon, or possessed, carried, or used as a weapon.’ ‘Committee comment on this generic definition points out that a deadly weapon is anything capable of causing death and is carried, possessed or used as a weapon such as a rock or cane when used for offensive or defensive purposes.’ State v. Clark, 2d Dist. Clark No. 1298, 1979 WL 208322, *1 (May 23, 1979). ‘Illustrations of things, innocent in themselves, that may be capable to causing death include a baseball bat, a Coke bottle, a toy pistol and an unloaded gun. The statute is not limited to instruments that are dangerous or deadly per se, but includes anything that may be possessed that has an actual or potential danger of serious or deadly harm under the circumstances encountered in a theft offense such as robbery.’ Id. In other words, ‘[t]he definition of deadly weapon in R.C. 2923.11(A) imposes two requirements of proof. First, the article must be capable of inflicting death. Second, the article must either (1) have been designed or specially adapted for use as a weapon or (2) possessed, carried, or used as a weapon. When use is a factor, the manner of its use and the nature of the instrument itself determines its capacity to inflict death.’ State v. Schooler, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19627, 2003-Ohio-6248, ¶ 21, citing State v. Deboe, 62 Ohio App.2d 192, 406 N.E.2d 536 (6th Dist.1977); State v. Taylor, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2018-CA-9, 2019-Ohio-142, ¶ 90.\n\nWe first note that ‘expert testimony is only offered to assist the trier of fact, and such testimony may be believed or disbelieved by such trier.’ State v. Coney, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 94APA05-670, 1995 WL 65013, *4 (Feb. 16, 1995), citing Vetter v. Hampton, 54 Ohio St.2d 227, 230, 375 N.E.2d 804 (1978). Thus, contrary to Portis’s suggestion, expert testimony is not required to establish that an instrumentality is capable of causing death. Coney at *4. ‘Common sense and [the] experience of those upon [a] jury observing the instrument that was in the hands of [a defendant], under the circumstances as presented within [a] case, dictate the appropriate finding.’ Id.\n\nNext, although no weapon was recovered and Smith did not see what the assailant used in the assault, there was evidence that Coleman observed a weapon he described as a machete or knife. Smith also testified he was hit with something he described as feeling sharp, like a machete. Further, the evidence demonstrated that the assailant hit both men with something that was capable of denting their scalps, caused serious cuts to their heads, and severed Smith’s finger. Both men sustained severe injuries which caused them to be hospitalized in the intensive care unit for several days.\n\nWhen viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, the record contains sufficient evidence that some instrumentality was utilized by the assailant as a deadly weapon.\n\nMoreover, the evidence in this record demonstrated that Portis used a deadly weapon to attack Coleman and Smith and that he removed money from Smith’s pocket. Based upon the evidence, we cannot say the jury clearly lost its way in convicting Portis."}

In this case, Johnson testified that during the encounter, Rouzier ‘locked’ and ‘blocked’ the front door while bellowing that she ‘wasn’t getting out of this * * * place until I get my money.’ She further testified that she felt trapped, she tried to call the police, and Rouzier allowed her to exit from the house only after she paid him the $100. Finally, Johnson testified that Rouzier’s forceful actions when wrestling her cell phone from her caused her pain and injured her hand. A photograph of her bruised hand was admitted as an exhibit. The evidence also showed that Rouzier snuck out of the house after the encounter and falsely reported to Officer Roy that he had not been home at the time of the encounter, facts indicating a consciousness of guilt. We conclude that a rational factfinder, viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the state, could have found the state had proved beyond a reasonable doubt every element of unlawful restraint and assault, including that Rouzier acted knowingly when he barricaded Johnson in his house preventing her from leaving and separately injured her hand."}

Regarding the first conviction for gross sexual imposition, the state presented testimony from the minor who informed police that Ward had touched her pubic area. The victim testified that when she was 15 years old, she spent the night at Ward's house with his daughter, with whom she was friends. At approximately 1:00 a.m., Ward came into his daughter's room where the two girls were lying next to each other in the same bed. The victim testified that she had seen Ward drinking alcohol earlier in the evening and that she thought he was drunk at the time he spoke to the girls. After speaking with the girls for approximately an hour, he left the room and the two fell asleep.\n{¶ 23} The victim testified that she later awoke when she felt a hand rubbing the bottom of her leg. She turned the opposite direction in the bed and fell back to sleep. However, she awoke again when she felt a hand on her inner thigh. The victim testified that the hand was rubbing her and moving toward her pubic area, and that the hand was larger than a woman's hand and rough. She also testified that she felt the hand underneath her panties touching her pubic hair.\n\n{¶ 24} The victim testified that she nudged Ward's daughter in the back and that Ward's daughter woke up. Although the victim did not tell Ward's daughter what had just occurred, Ward's daughter observed her father on the floor next to the bed and told him that he was not supposed to be in her room. Ward responded that he must have fallen asleep while he was speaking with the girls. However, the victim testified that she and Ward's daughter had seen Ward leave the room earlier in the night.\n\n{¶ 25} The next morning, Ward texted his daughter and asked that she tell the victim that he was \"sorry about last night.\" However, the victim did not tell Ward's daughter what occurred. Instead, she called her sister and told her about the events. The victim's sister informed their mother and the victim's mother told the victim to inform Ward's daughter what occurred on the night in question. After the victim texted Ward's daughter and told her what occurred on the night in question, Ward's daughter told her older sister, and a detective later came to the victim's home to ask her about the events.\n\n{¶ 26} The state then presented testimony from Ward's daughter who also testified that she observed Ward drinking alcohol on the night in question and that he came into her room and talked to her and the victim. Ward's daughter testified that after he left, he closed the door. However, she was later awoken and observed her father laying on the floor of her bedroom. Ward's daughter testified that she told him to get out of her room and that he left.\n{¶ 27} Regarding another count of gross sexual imposition, the victim testified that she and her friend were on their way to breakfast when Ward pulled them over for speeding. The victim, who was the passenger in the vehicle, testified that Ward removed her friend from the car and placed her in the back of his cruiser. He then asked the victim to exit the vehicle and consent to a pat down. The victim complied. The victim testified that Ward told her to stand with her arms down at her side and to spread her legs. He then patted down the victim's arms and sides, and then patted down her chest area. The victim testified that Ward paused on her chest area and then continued to pat down her legs, thighs, as well as her vaginal area with an open palm, and that he repeated his pat down three times.\n\n{¶ 28} When asked to more thoroughly explain the way in which Ward patted her down in her vaginal area, the victim testified that Ward cupped his hand, \"pressed up against, rubbing inward and his fingers curled a couple of times just pressing up, just feeling overly in-depth in there each time.\" The victim testified that after Ward patted her down for the last time, he placed her in the back of his cruiser with her friend and that she told her friend that Ward had touched her vagina. Once Ward released the two, they continued to a nearby restaurant where the victim called police and her father. She then filed a complaint with the Ohio State Highway patrol.\n\n{¶ 29} The final gross sexual imposition victim testified that Ward pulled her over multiple times over an extended period of time, each time issuing her a warning. The last time he pulled her over, he issued a written warning and included his name and telephone number on the back of the citation. The victim testified that she called Ward in hopes of stopping his pulling her over. They agreed to a date, and she drove to his house to meet him.\n\n{¶ 30} The victim testified that the two went to dinner and then returned to Ward's house. There, the victim overheard Ward on the telephone with his daughter. She testified\nthat Ward was yelling and screaming during his telephone conversation and that his face was \"blood red.\" He then disappeared from the victim's view and came back wearing his trooper's uniform.\n\n{¶ 31} Ward moved behind the victim's body and put his arms around her. The victim testified that Ward placed his arms over her arms and then placed his hands down her pants and began rubbing her vaginal area. The victim was able to \"twist\" out of Ward's arms and leave his house.\n\n{¶ 32} Regarding the sexual battery charge, the victim testified she was returning home after transporting a horse in a trailer when she was pulled over by Ward. Ward told her to shut off her engine, took her driver's license, and told her that he had pulled her over because a light on the trailer was broken. Ward then claimed that the road noise was too loud and went around to the passenger side of the victim's vehicle and entered her truck. When the victim asked Ward to exit her truck, he told her to \"shut up\" and that she needed to listen to him. Ward then unbuckled the victim's seatbelt, grabbed her hair, and pulled her across the seat. When the victim cried out and told Ward, \"no,\" he again told her to shut up.\n\n{¶ 33} The victim testified that Ward's pants were unzipped and that he exposed his penis. Ward told the victim that he knew where she was from and that he had friends in her location that would \"watch over\" her. Ward instructed the victim to make him \"happy.\" The victim tried to move, but Ward held her head, pushed it down, and stepped on her hand with his boot. When the victim began crying, Ward yanked her head up by her hair and slapped her in the face. Ward then forced his penis into the victim's mouth. After Ward released the victim, he smiled at her and warned her that he could \"do certain things\" to keep her \"quiet.\" He then produced a camera and took a photograph of the victim."}

UNITED STATES, 571 U.S. ___ (2014).", "extracted_text": "Appellant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for acquittal and in failing to properly provide jury instructions on the charge of involuntary manslaughter. Motion for Acquittal: Involuntary Manslaughter\nAn appellate court reviews a denial of a Crim.R. 29 motion for acquittal using the same standard used to review a sufficiency of the evidence claim. See State v. Larry, 5th Dist. Holmes No. 15CA011, 2016-Ohio-829, ¶ 20, citing State v. Carter (1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 553, 651 N.E.2d 965, 1995–Ohio–104. Thus, “[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Jenks (1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n¶17 Appellant herein was convicted of involuntary manslaughter (Count 1), which is set forth in R.C. 2903.04(A) as follows: “No person shall cause the death of another or the unlawful termination of another's pregnancy as a proximate result of the offender's committing or attempting to commit a felony.”\n\n¶18 The predicate offense in this instance (Count 2) was corrupting another with drugs under R.C. 2925.02(A)(3), which states as follows: “No person shall knowingly *** [b]y any means, administer or furnish to another or induce or cause another to use a controlled substance, and thereby cause serious physical harm to the other person, or cause the other person to become drug dependent.”\n\n¶19 Count 2 of the indictment includes the language “to wit: Heroin, a Schedule I controlled substance.”\n\n¶20 In support of his argument, appellant directs us to Burrage v. United States, — U.S. ——, 134 S.Ct. 881, 892, 187 L.Ed.2d 715 (2014), which involved a penalty enhancement provision under 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841(b)(1)(C). Said federal statute in essence imposes a 20–year mandatory minimum sentence on a defendant who unlawfully distributes a Schedule I or II drug, when “death or serious bodily injury results from the use of such substance.” The United States Supreme Court in Burrage granted certiorari on two questions, the first of which was whether the defendant could be convicted under the “death results” provision when the use of the controlled substance was a “contributing cause” of the death. Id. at 886. The Court first determined that the federal statute in question imposes a requirement of “but-for causation.” Id. at 889-891.\nAlthough the Government proposed the argument that an act or omission should be considered a cause-in-fact if it was a “substantial” or “contributing” factor in producing a given result, this was rejected by the Court. *Id.* at 890. The Court instead stated: “The language Congress enacted requires death to ‘result from’ use of the unlawfully distributed drug, not from a combination of factors to which drug use merely contributed.” *Id.* at 891. The Court proceeded to hold that “*** at least where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is not an independently sufficient cause of the victim's death or serious bodily injury, a defendant cannot be liable under the penalty enhancement provision of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) unless such use is a but-for cause of the death or injury.” *Id.* at 892.\n\n{¶21} In the case *sub judice*, the State of Ohio was required to prove under R.C. 2903.04(A) that appellant had caused the death of Chad Baker as a proximate result of his committing or attempting to commit the felony offense of corrupting another with drugs under R.C. 2925.02(A)(3). We note the indictment and the bill of particulars both allege that the cause of Chad Baker's death was based on the felony of corrupting another specifically with heroin. However, the record before us reveals that said theory is not fully consistent with Dr. Lee's investigation. He specifically testified that “acute combined drug effects” from “[u]sing heroin and cocaine” were the cause of Chad's death. Tr. at 243 (emphasis added). Dr. Lee also could not opine on cross-examination that Chad would have died from the heroin use in and of itself. In other words, there is arguably a reasonable probability that but for the use of cocaine, the death would not have occurred. Appellant was not charged with providing cocaine to Chad, nor did the State pursue a\ntheory that appellant did so. In particular, the jury heard the following testimony by Dr. Lee during his cross-examination:\n\nQ. Okay. Let's go back and talk about that toxicology report. So, I was kind of processing your testimony the other day, and your theory is the combined effect of cocaine and heroin caused Mr. Baker's death. Correct?\n\nA. That's correct.\n\nQ. So, not just the heroin?\n\nA. Correct.\n\nQ. So, but for the use of the cocaine, do you know whether or not the heroin would have killed him?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Or, are we guessing?\n\nA. It would be a guess. There's no way to tell for sure if he would have died of only heroin. There's no way to tell if he would have died only of cocaine. But, certainly, he died when they were both mixed together. That's the best that we can - -\n\nQ. I appreciate your honesty.\n\nA. - - get out of this.\n\n{¶22} Tr. at 261.\n\n{¶23} Thus, just as in Burrage, “[n]o expert was prepared to say that [the victim] would have died from the heroin use alone.” Id. at 890\nWe recognize that in *Burrage*, the United States Supreme Court was interpreting a penalty enhancement provision in a federal statute, not an Ohio criminal statute. However, this distinction does not dissuade us from applying the rationale of *Burrage* herein, and “*** we cannot amend statutes to provide what we consider a more logical result.” *State v. Link*, 155 Ohio App.3d 585, 2003–Ohio–6798, 802 N.E.2d 680, ¶ 17, citing *State v. Virasayachack* (2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 570, 741 N.E.2d 943.

She recalled that Mr. Fortune engaged in sexual activity with her about four to five times when she was nine years old, but she was only able to recount the details surrounding two of those incidents. During one of the incidents, M.F. recalled falling asleep on the family’s living room couch and waking to find Mr. Fortune’s mouth on her vagina. She could remember feeling ‘the wetness of his tongue and his beard hairs.’ She also remembered pretending to sleep and just letting the assault happen. The second incident M.F. recalled also occurred in their family’s living room. M.F. recalled being asleep on the couch and waking to find Mr. Fortune touching the area around her vagina. Penetration did not occur, but M.F.’s pants and underwear were down around her ankles, and Mr. Fortune was making direct contact with her vaginal area. Startled by the realization that he was touching her, M.F. drew up her knees and pushed Mr. Fortune away with her feet. She stated that, in response, he asked what was wrong and said he was giving her a massage. She then retreated to her older sister D.M.’s bedroom, woke her, and told her Mr. Fortune had touched her. M.F. testified that she saw three different counselors after she turned fourteen, but never told them about the abuse. D.M. was the first person she told, and she later confided in a few friends. M.F. recalled that she also briefly spoke to her mother about the abuse when she was nine years old. She remembered riding in the car with her mother and D.M. and her mother receiving a phone call. The phone call was from an older friend of D.M.’s and, during the call, the friend told M.F.’s mother that she (the friend) was having a sexual relationship with Mr. Fortune. M.F. recalled her mother being extremely upset and questioning how something like that could have happened. According to M.F., D.M. responded by telling their mother it had happened to her. D.M. then nudged M.F., and M.F. likewise said it had happened to her. M.F. indicated that their mother did not believe anything had transpired, so nothing came of their disclosure. M.F. testified that, after she turned seventeen, she was referred to a psychiatrist due to severe depression and anxiety. According to M.F., she did not plan on disclosing the abuse at that time, but her new psychiatrist had an aggressive style and coaxed it out of her. The psychiatrist then reported the abuse to the authorities, and M.F. was interviewed at the child advocacy center.

According to Mr. Fortune, the trial judge demonstrated bias against him when he admitted that he had knowledge of a presentence investigation report (PSI) that was completed in 1996. He claims that the judge admitted to having read the report in 1999 when it sentenced him to three years in prison on an unrelated matter. Mr. Fortune avers that the contents of that PSI were never made available to him or his counsel, and the court never informed them that he was intimately familiar with its contents.

Rucker argues that the state never authenticated the phone calls and that the calls contained inadmissible hearsay.\n\n¶27 The admission of evidence lies within the broad discretion of a trial court and a reviewing court should not disturb evidentiary decisions in the absence of an abuse of discretion that has created material prejudice. State v. Noling, 98 Ohio St.3d 44, 2002-Ohio-7044, 781 N.E.2d 88, ¶ 43, citing State v. Issa, 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 64,\n2001-Ohio-1290, 752 N.E.2d 904. Within this broad discretion is the trial court’s duty “to determine whether testimony is relevant and to balance its potential probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice.” State v. Clark, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 95928, 2011-Ohio-4109, ¶ 32. Evid.R. 402 allows the admission of any relevant evidence so long as the probative value of that evidence is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect, it does not confuse the issue or mislead the jury. Evid.R. 403(A).\n\n{¶28} Evid.R. 901 governs authentication and provides a liberal standard for the authentication of telephone calls. State v. Teague, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90801, 2009-Ohio-129. Pursuant to Evid.R. 901(A), the requirement of authentication for evidence to be admissible “is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.” “Telephone conversations are admitted where the identity of the parties is satisfactorily explained.” State v. Williams, 64 Ohio App.2d 271, 274, 413 N.E.2d 1212 (8th Dist.1979).\n\nTestimony as to a telephone call is admissible where there is a reasonable showing, through testimony or other evidence, that the witness placed or received a call as alleged, plus some indication of the identity of the person spoken to. There is no fixed identification requirement for all calls. * * * “Each case has its own set of facts.” (Citations omitted.)\n\nState v. Vrona, 47 Ohio App.3d 145, 149, 547 N.E.2d 1189 (9th Dist.1988).\n\nCircumstantial evidence, as well as direct, may be used to show authenticity. Moreover, the threshold standard for authenticating evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 901(A) is low, and “does not require conclusive proof of authenticity, but only sufficient foundational evidence for the trier of fact to conclude that * * * [the evidence] is what its proponent claims it to be.” (Internal citations omitted.)\n\nTeague at ¶ 7.\nIn the present case, Sergeant Phillip Christopher testified that jail phone calls are made and recorded using a system called Global Telelink (“GTL”). According to Sgt. Christopher, when an inmate makes a call they must input their inmate PIN and these calls are recorded and monitored by the jail’s GTL system that allows him to search for calls by an inmate’s pin number, name or a destination phone number. He identified state’s exhibit No. 31 as a call detail report produced by the GTL system for calls placed from the jail to the same phone number that other witnesses identified as the number used by Rucker to order the taxi on July 19, 2015. Contrary to Rucker’s argument on appeal, he did not object to the introduction of the exhibit No. 31 at trial and has failed to present any argument on appeal that its introduction constituted plain error.\n\nWith respect to the four specific recorded phone calls, the calls involved Rucker receiving calls in jail from Nicholas Kraft and Heather Mitchell wherein he made statements indicating his awareness of the present offenses and the police investigation of him as the second suspect. Kraft identified his own voice as well as the voices of Rucker and Mitchell. The testimony of Kraft was sufficient to conclude that it was Rucker’s voice captured by the recording. Although Rucker now argues that the phone calls contained inadmissible hearsay, he failed to place such an objection on the record at trial and the statements made by Rucker were admissible as admissions of a party opponent under Evid.R. 801(D)(2).\n\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the recorded conversations."}

Here, the evidence presented could not reasonably support both an acquittal on the charges of aggravated robbery and a conviction upon a robbery charge. The victim testimony was uniform that Kraft both had a deadly weapon on his person and displayed and brandished the firearm to facilitate the offenses.

{"index": "257-PATE", "allegation_num": "allegation_3", "allegation": "Pate's convictions for ten counts of rape of a minor less than ten years of age were not supported by sufficient evidence and were against the manifest weight of the evidence.", "extracted_text": "The following evidence, however, established otherwise.\n\nRape of A.A.1\n\n{¶ 91} During trial, A.A.1 referred to her vagina as her \"private.\" A.A.1 testified that she used her private for \"pottying\" and indicated that it was located in her lap area. Trial Trans. Vol. IV, p. 639-640. A.A.1 also referred to Pate’s penis as his \"private,\" as she testified that boys use their private for \"pottying\" and indicated that a boy’s private is located between his legs. Id. Using this terminology, A.A.1 testified to several incidents of cunnilingus, digital penetration, and fellatio. Each of those incidents are discussed in detail below.\n\n1. Cunnilingus\nThree of the six counts of rape related to A.A.1 involved allegations of Pate performing cunnilingus. In support of these counts, A.A.1 testified that Pate licked on her private in the \"back room\" and identified the \"back room\" as Pate’s bedroom. *Id.* at 635 and 646. A.A.1 testified that when it happened, she would be lying on her belly on Pate’s side of the bed with her clothes off. *Id.* at 646-647. A.A.1 also testified that when Pate licked her private it would be on her skin. *Id.* at 646. A.A.1 additionally testified that Pate licked on her private while she was on the flower chair in Pate’s front room/living room. *Id.* at 643, 646-648.\n\nA.A.1 further testified that Pate licked on her private while she was in his van and truck. *Id.* at 648-651. A.A.1 testified that after Pate picked her up from school, he would drive her to the river where no one else was around. *Id.* at 648-649. A.A.1 testified that when they got to the river, Pate would get out of his vehicle, come around to the front-passenger seat where she was sitting, and \"lick on [her] private.\" *Id.* at 649-650. A.A.1 testified that Pate instructed her how to put her legs up and once again indicated that when Pate licked on her private it would be on her skin. *Id.* at 651-653.\n\nWhen viewed in a light most favorable to the State, the foregoing testimony was sufficient to establish at least three counts of rape by cunnilingus in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b). The testimony established that Pate performed cunnilingus on A.A.1 on at least three separate occasions while: (1) in his bedroom, (2) in the living room and (3) inside his vehicle by the river.\n\n2. Digital Penetration\n\nTwo of the six counts of rape related to A.A.1 involved allegations of Pate’s digitally penetrating A.A.1’s vagina. In support of these counts, A.A.1 testified that Pate\nrubbed on her private using two of his fingers. Trial Trans. Vol. IV, p. 653. A.A.1 testified that Pate’s fingers \"would go in circles\" on her skin. Id. At one point, A.A.1 testified that Pate only touched \"outside\" her body. Id. at 652. However, when A.A.1 was asked to demonstrate on a tissue box how Pate touched her with his fingers, the record indicates that A.A.1’s fingers went slightly inside the tissue box during the demonstration. Id. at 654. A.A.1 testified that Pate did this type of touching \"[i]n the living room, back room, van, and truck.\" Id. at 654. A.A.1 specifically recalled it happening in the living room while she was \"sitting in [Pate’s] lap.\" Id. at 654. A.A.1 testified that it would happen when they were sitting on \"the flower chair\" and on \"the blue chair.\" Id. at 655. A.A.1 testified that it felt \"weird.\" Id.\n\n¶ 96 The insertion, however slight, of any part of the body into the vaginal opening of another constitutes \"sexual conduct\" for purposes of establishing rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b). R.C. 2907.01(A). Therefore, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, we find that the foregoing testimony elicited from A.A.1 was sufficient to establish at least two counts of rape by digital penetration. Specifically, the testimony established that Pate digitally penetrated A.A.1 on two occasions in the living room, i.e. on the flower chair and on the blue chair. The testimony additionally established that Pate digitally penetrated A.A.1 while in his bedroom and vehicle. Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence of at least two instances of digital penetration. Pate’s claim otherwise again lacks merit.\n\n3. Fellatio\n\n¶ 97 The remaining count of rape related to A.A.1 involved an allegation that Pate made A.A.1 perform fellatio on him. In support of this count, A.A.1 testified that\nPate \"would make [her] put [her] mouth on his private spot.\" Trial Trans. Vol. IV, p. 659. A.A.1 testified that Pate instructed her how to do it by showing her a video on his cell phone of \"girls sucking on the boys’ things.\" Id. at 659, 661. A.A.1 testified that Pate would put his private spot in her mouth while in the living room and in the back room. Id. at 660. A.A.1 specifically recalled an incident in the front room when \"something white\" came out of Pate’s private spot after he put his private in her mouth. Id. A.A.1 testified that the white substance \"squirted out\" on the floor and that Pate said \"it was juice.\" Id. at 660-661.\n\n¶ 98 When viewed in a light most favorable to the State, the foregoing testimony was sufficient to establish one count of rape by fellatio in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b).\n\nRape of A.A.2\n\n¶ 99 As previously discussed, because five-year-old A.A.2 was found to be incompetent to testify at trial, a portion of A.A.2’s forensic interview was played for the jury and admitted into evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 807(A). During the interview, A.A.2 initially only described Pate’s abuse of A.A.1. However, A.A.2 eventually began to include herself in the abuse and described two instances of fellatio. In addition, A.A.1 provided testimony at trial indicating that she saw Pate perform cunnilingus on A.A.2. All of these incidents are discussed in detail below.\n\n1. Fellatio\n\n¶ 100 Two of the four counts of rape related to A.A.2 involved allegations of fellatio. After telling the interviewer about how Pate touched A.A.1 with his genital area,\nA.A.2 made the following unsolicited comment: \"Him does it sometimes and we have to put it in [her] mouth.\" State’s Exhibit 5(A), 4:55:08 p.m. to 4:55:56 p.m. When the interviewer clarified and asked A.A.2 if Pate did that to her, A.A.2 first shook her head no and then responded: \"Yeah, but we say no all the time.\" Id. at 4:55:57 p.m. to 4:56:06 p.m. When the interviewer asked A.A.2 to tell her about Pate putting \"his spot,\" i.e., his genitalia, in her mouth, A.A.2 indicated that Pate did it even though she did not want him to. Id. at 4:58:12 p.m. to 4:58:21 p.m. A.A.2 then said \"We tell him to stop\" and indicated that Pate stopped. Id. at 4:57:42 p.m. to 4:58:43 p.m. When the interviewer asked A.A.2 to clarify what the \"thing\" or \"spot\" was on Pate’s body, A.A.2 said that Pate’s thing was \"in the middle.\" Id.\n\n¶ 101 The interviewer then asked A.A.2 where she was located when Pate puts his \"thing\" in her mouth and A.A.2 responded: \"At Pawpaw and Mammaw’s.\" Id. at 4:58:48 p.m. to 4:58:53 p.m. When asked where in Pawpaw and Mammaw’s house, A.A.2 responded: \"In their bedroom.\" Id. at 4:58:54 p.m. to 4:58:59 p.m. A.A.2 thereafter indicated that Pate only did it to her and A.A.1, not to A.A.3. Id. at 4:59:00 p.m. to 4:59:16 p.m.\n\n¶ 102 Later in the interview, A.A.2 indicated that Pate showed her pornographic videos. Id. at 5:06:37 p.m. to 5:07:11 p.m. When the interviewer asked what the people were doing in the videos, A.A.2 said \"all these girls do this\" and then A.A.2 physically imitated oral sex by opening her mouth and moving her head. Id. at 5:06:48 p.m. to 5:07:00 p.m. A.A.2 thereafter clarified that \"they are doing it to the boy.\" Id. at 5:07:03 p.m. to 5:07:13 p.m. A.A.2 said that the people in the videos were \"not kids they’re grownups.\" Id. at 5:07:14 p.m. to 5:07:23 p.m. When asked how Pate showed her the\nvideos, A.A.2 said that \"they were doing it on his phone.\"  *Id.* at 5:07:45 p.m. to 5:08:06 p.m.  A.A.2 also shook her head yes when the interviewer asked her whether Pate had ever made her do the things shown in the videos.  *Id.* at 5:08:15 p.m. to 5:08:20 p.m.\n\n{¶ 103} When viewed in a light most favorable to the State, the foregoing evidence was sufficient to establish two counts of rape by fellatio in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b).  A.A.2’s comments indicating that she said no to fellatio all the time and that Pate did it anyway suggested that Pate made her perform fellatio on more than one occasion.  A.A.2 also specifically indicated that Pate made her perform fellatio in his bedroom.  In addition, A.A.2’s comments indicating that Pate showed her videos on his cell phone of females performing oral sex on males and how Pate made her do the things in the videos indicated a time that Pate made her perform fellatio on him while showing her a pornographic video on his cell phone.  We further note that A.A.1 testified that she observed Pate do everything to A.A.2 that he did to her, and A.A.1 specifically testified that Pate would make her (A.A.1) perform fellatio in the living room and in his bedroom.  Trial Trans. Vol. IV, p. 660 and 664-665.  Based on the foregoing statements and testimony, we find that there was sufficient evidence in the record supporting at least two separate instances of fellatio involving A.A.2.\n\n2. Cunnilingus\n\n{¶ 104} The remaining two counts of rape related to A.A.2 involve allegations of cunnilingus.  At trial, A.A.1 testified that she observed Pate lick A.A.2’s private in the living room and his bedroom.  Trial Trans. Vol. IV, p. 666-667.  A.A.1 testified that this would happen after school and during sleepovers.  *Id.* at 667.  A.A.1 recalled a specific incident when this happened in the living room, as A.A.1 testified that A.A.2 was on her\nbelly leaning over the arm of the flower chair and Pate was sitting on the \"rolling chair.\"\n\nId. A.A.1 also testified that she recalled seeing Pate lick A.A.2’s private in the back room while on his side of the bed. Id. at 667-668.\n\n¶ 105 Again, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, the foregoing testimony was sufficient to establish two counts of rape by cunnilingus in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b). A.A.1’s testimony sufficiently established that Pate performed cunnilingus on A.A.2 in his bedroom and living room.\n\n¶ 106 Based on all the foregoing evidence, the jury could have reasonably determined that Pate engaged in six incidents of sexual conduct with A.A.1, as well as four incidents of sexual conduct with A.A.2, thereby committing a total of ten counts of rape of a minor less than ten years of age in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) and (B). In reaching its verdict, the jury was free to believe all, part, or none of the testimony of each witness and to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented. State v. Hunt, 2d Dist. Darke No. 2018-CA-9, 2019-Ohio-2352, ¶ 24. After weighing all the evidence, including but not limited to the material discovered on Pate’s cell phone, E.K.’s observations of Pate’s interactions with the girls, and E.K.’s own allegations of abuse, we cannot say that the jury lost its way or created a manifest miscarriage of justice in believing A.A.1’s and A.A.2’s allegations of sexual abuse. Simply because the jury chose to believe A.A.1’s and A.A.2’s allegations did not mean that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Therefore, in addition to being supported by sufficient evidence, Pate’s convictions for six counts of raping A.A.1 and four counts of raping A.A.2 were not against the manifest weight of the evidence."}

We note that while the standard for reviewing the trial court’s admission of expert testimony is for abuse of discretion, an error of law can constitute an abuse of discretion. Valentine v. Conrad, 110 Ohio St.3d 42, 2006-Ohio-3561, 850 N.E.2d 683, ¶ 9; see State v. Boles, 187 Ohio App.3d 345, 2010-Ohio-278, 932 N.E.2d 345, ¶ 24-25 (2d Dist.) (explaining that trial court could in fact abuse its discretion by committing an error of law). Defense counsel duly objected to Detective Noel’s testimony, arguing that the state furnished no Crim.R. 16(K) report.\n\nCrim.R. 16(K) requires that an expert witness must prepare a ‘written report summarizing the expert witness’s testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinion, and shall include a summary of the expert’s qualifications.’ That report must be turned over to the other side ‘no later than twenty-one days prior to trial’ in the absence of good cause shown that does not prejudice the other side. Crim.R. 16(K). The rule also contains a simple remedy for a violation: ‘Failure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert’s testimony at trial.’ Id.\nThis rule is one of fairly recent vintage, promulgated in 2010. The purpose of the rule is straightforward, as reflected in its plain language and echoed by the Staff Notes: ‘Failure to comply with the rule precludes the expert witness from testifying during trial. This prevents either party from avoiding pretrial disclosure of the substance of expert witness’s testimony by not requesting a written report from the expert, or not seeking introduction of a report.’ Our sister districts have explained that the purpose of Crim.R. 16(K) is to avoid ‘trial-by-ambush’ scenarios. See State v. Walls, 2018-Ohio-329, 104 N.E.3d 280, ¶ 39 (6th Dist.) (error to allow doctor’s expert testimony when testimony exceeded scope of report). Supplying a Crim.R. 16(K) report alleviates ‘unfair surprise by providing notice to the defense and allowing the defense an opportunity to challenge the expert’s findings, analysis, or qualifications, possibly with the support of an adverse expert who could discredit the opinion after carefully reviewing the written report.’ State v. Fetty, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2011-P-0091, 2012-Ohio-6127, ¶ 36, quoting State v. Perry, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2011-L-125, 2012-Ohio-4888, ¶ 55 (no prejudice to defendant when medical records had been supplied, thwarting any undue surprise from medical expert’s testimony). Providing the report in advance of trial affords the opposing party an opportunity to secure its own expert in response, but even if it elects not to do that, it may well consult with an expert on how to best cross-examine the other side’s expert. See Fetty at ¶ 37 (The policy behind these rules is to avoid ambush and thwarting of opposing counsel’s ability to effectively cross-examine the expert.)"}
{"index": "658-Hall", "allegation_num": "allegation_2", "allegation": "The prosecutor engaged in pervasive misconduct during closing argument, demonizing the defendant as a ‘wolf’ and ‘predator,’ and repeatedly vouching for the credibility of the accusers.", "extracted_text": "This defendant, this **predator**, told you that he is the victim of a conspiracy of little girls. * * * Do not be fooled. [Mr. Hall] is a **wolf** and he is the **predator**. He raped [J.C.] by raping her with his penis. He raped her vaginally by penetrating her vagina with his penis. He did this at her house. *\n* * He forced her to touch his penis with her hand. That’s rape, gross sexual imposition.\n\n* * *\n\nPredators like his man, Randy Hall, pick their victims wisely so there isn’t corroboration. He knows how to deal with these girls. He was nice to them, but also sort of threatening and controlling. He chose easy targets.\n\n* * *\n\nAfter reviewing the evidence and applying the law, justice demands that this defendant, this predator, be found guilty of these charges. Any verdict other than guilty would not be reasonable, it would defy common sense, and it would be contrary to your instructions.\n\n{¶30} In evaluating these remarks, we are reminded that “[p]rosecutors serve a special role in our justice system requiring them to adhere to the highest standards and to avoid improper arguments, insinuations, and assertions calculated to mislead the jury.” State v. Freeman, 138 Ohio App.3d 408, 419, 741 N.E.2d 566 (1st Dist.2000), quoting State v. Fears, 86 Ohio St.3d 329, 351, 715 N.E.2d 136 (1999) (Moyer, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Therefore, a “prosecutor should not invade the jury’s realm by rendering a personal belief regarding guilt.” State v. Simmons, 2014-Ohio-3695, 19 N.E.3d 517, ¶77 (1st Dist.), citing State v. Smith, 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984). While we acknowledge that prosecutors are afforded some latitude in closing, this leeway crosses the line when a prosecutor “deliberately saturate[s] trials with emotion.” State v. Keenan, 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 409, 613 N.E.2d 203 (1993) (“[P]rosecutor’s histrionic approach to this case crossed the line that separates permissible fervor from a denial of a fair trial” by expressing opinion about the guilt of the defendant). We have little hesitation in finding\nthese comments improper because they are in the same vein of comments that we have repeatedly deemed inappropriate.\n\n{¶31} Over a decade ago, in State v. Burrell, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-030803, 2005-Ohio-34, we faulted this prosecutor's office for calling a defendant a “psychopath” in closing argument, and emphasized that this was not an isolated misstep: “We agree that the prosecutor's comments went beyond zealous advocacy into the realm of the patently improper. Yet again, we caution the state about using these tactics.” (Emphasis added.) (Citations omitted.) Id. at ¶ 25. That message has apparently not resonated, as we faced essentially the same issue several years later in Simmons, where this court explained that continued reference to a defendant as an “offender” during closing arguments insinuated the prosecutor's belief regarding the defendant's guilt and was improper. Simmons at ¶ 77. (We did not grant relief in either Burrell or Simmons in light of the overwhelming evidence in those cases.). We fail to understand why prosecutors must resort to improper name-calling during closing argument rather than letting the strength of their evidence do the talking.\n\n{¶32} Other courts in Ohio have shared our concern. The Ohio Supreme Court found references to the defendant as a “thug” and “hardnosed goon” improper in other circumstances. State v. Liberatore, 69 Ohio St.2d 583, 433 N.E.2d 561 (1982), fn. 9 (prosecutorial misconduct when prosecutor “characterized the defendant in derogatory terms clearly designed to inflame the jury.”). Even use of the word “predator” once during closing argument constituted improper conduct according to the Fourth District. State v. Canterbury, 4th Dist. Athens No. 13CA34, 2015-Ohio-1926, ¶ 24 (comment improper but not prejudicial in the face of other evidence before the jury).\nThere can be little question, reading the closing argument as a whole, that the prosecutor’s deliberate, and repeated, invocation of these terms was designed to “inflame the jury,” see Liberatore at 590, and to “deliberately saturate” the trial with emotion. Keenan at 409. Nevertheless, the state insists that the terms “wolf” and “predator” fell within permissible bounds under the circumstances. The state largely points to Simmons, endeavoring to distinguish “offender” (which has a legal connotation) with “predator” (which the state contends does not). This is misguided for two reasons. First, contrary to the state’s argument, the term “predator” has certain legal connotations which denote the word to mean someone convicted of a sex-related crime and implicates guilt. For example, under Ohio’s previous sexual-offender-classification framework, Megan’s Law (former R.C. 2950.09), the highest level of a sexual-offender classification was “sexual predator.” Additionally, this term has a similar colloquial connotation, as one need look no further than the title of the show “To Catch a Predator” to appreciate the point.\n\nSecond, and more fundamentally, the state cannot demonize (and even dehumanize) a defendant with this type of name-calling in argument. As noted above, such language invites the jury to make its decision based on emotion rather than facts, and we see no purpose for such language in a courthouse erected to serve the ends of justice and the search for truth. Notably, the state fails to identify any case where an Ohio court has upheld the propriety of terms like “wolf” and “predator” during the course of closing argument.\n\nConsidering the entire closing argument in context only reinforces our view. In addition to the prosecutor’s comments labeling Mr. Hall a “predator” and a “wolf,” the prosecutor engaged in improper vouching. Recall, without physical evidence at hand, this case involved a credibility battle between Mr. Hall and his accusers. In closing, the prosecutor vouched for the credibility of the accusers by assuring the jury that they lacked\nthe capacity to lie. Such statements thus implied that the prosecutor knew facts outside the record about the mental proclivities of these witnesses.\n\n{¶36} Nor were these statements accidental, as the prosecutor drove the point home multiple times:\n\nAnd the [defense counsel] wants to talk about credibility. Who has the motive to lie in this case? This defendant right here, Randy Hall. Not these little girls. They don't have the capacity to continue on this year-long conspiracy against him. Give me a break.\n\n***\n\nYou saw these girls. They do not have the capacity to carry on three independent accounts of sexual abuse by this defendant for over a year.\n\n***\n\n[The girls] came in here and did the best of their little girl brain ability to tell you what he did to them. They don't have the capacity to form a conspiracy against poor victim Randy Hall.\n\nProsecutors must not vouch for the credibility of witnesses. State v. Williams, 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 12, 679 N.E.2d 646 (1997) (“It is improper for an attorney to express his or her personal belief or opinion as to the credibility of a witness or as to the guilt of the accused.”); State v. Myers, 154 Ohio St.3d 405, 2018-Ohio-1903, 114 N.E.3d 1138, ¶ 145 (“It is improper for a prosecutor to vouch for the credibility of a witness at trial.”); State v. Wilson, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-000670, 2002 WL 598226, *7 (April 19, 2002) (“[T]he prosecutor's act of personally vouching for the credibility of the state's witnesses was an invasion on the province of the jury *** it was clearly improper and constituted misconduct.”).\nAlthough Mr. Hall did not object to the closing, the misconduct “still form[s] part of the context in which we evaluate the effect on the jury of errors that were not waived.” See Keenan, 66 Ohio St.3d at 410, 613 N.E.2d 203. This brings us back to Detective Noel’s testimony.\n\nIn closing, the prosecutor returned to Detective Noel’s testimony, reminding the jury that: “Detective Noel told you about her vast experience and how she would not be able to get a viable crime scene or evidence * * * yet, [Mr. Hall’s] going to ask you to just completely disregard that.” The state also played up the significance of the expert testimony, and of course Detective Noel’s opinions provided an important corroboration for those of the medical expert. Closing argument thus brings about the confluence of Detective Noel’s expert testimony with the litany of problematic statements, all of which we must consider against a case without an overwhelming evidentiary foundation. Id. at 411. (“Without overwhelming evidence of guilt, we cannot know what the verdict might have been had not the prosecutor clouded the jury’s vision with improper tactics.”).\n\nWhen the jury’s determination of guilt rests solely on the question of which testimony they believed, the victims’ or Mr. Hall’s, the prosecutor’s conduct (denigrating the defendant, calling him a “wolf” and a “predator,” vouching for the state’s witnesses) compounded the problems inherent in admitting Detective Noel’s testimony. And under the circumstances, we cannot say with any degree of confidence that the jury’s determination here was based on the actual credibility of the witnesses rather than the errors at trial because the errors were so significant in terms of their impact on credibility. Thus, Mr. Hall was prejudiced by the admission of the expert testimony, it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt that this error did not affect the outcome, and the strength of the remaining evidence was no doubt buttressed by Detective Noel’s testimony. In sum, under these circumstances\nthe admission of Detective Noel’s testimony constituted prejudicial, rather than harmless, error."}

The rule also contains a simple remedy for a violation: 'Failure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert’s testimony at trial.' Id. This rule is one of fairly recent vintage, promulgated in 2010. The purpose of the rule is straightforward, as reflected in its plain language and echoed by the Staff Notes: 'Failure to comply with the rule precludes the expert witness from testifying during trial. This prevents either party from avoiding pretrial disclosure of the substance of expert witness’s testimony by not requesting a written report from the expert, or not seeking introduction of a report.' Our sister districts have explained that the purpose of Crim.R. 16(K) is to avoid 'trial-by-ambush' scenarios. See State v. Walls, 2018-Ohio-329, 104 N.E.3d 280, ¶ 39 (6th Dist.)

Supplying a Crim.R. 16(K) report alleviates 'unfair surprise by providing notice to the defense and allowing the defense an opportunity to challenge the expert’s findings, analysis, or qualifications, possibly with the support of an adverse expert who could discredit the opinion after carefully reviewing the written report.'

We acknowledge, however, that the Southern District of Texas in United States v. Beverly, declined to apply the good faith exception to CSLI obtained before Carpenter. United States v. Beverly, S.D.

Beverly involved an unconstitutional statute, not binding judicial precedent as is the case here.\nindictment, information or complaint in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged, whether felonies or misdemeanors or both, are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are part of a course of criminal conduct.\n\n‘The law favors joinder to prevent successive trials, to minimize the possibility of incongruous results in successive trials before different juries, to conserve judicial resources, and to diminish the inconvenience to witnesses.’ State v. Goodner, 195 Ohio App.3d 636, 2011-Ohio-5018, 961 N.E.2d 254, ¶ 39 (2d Dist.), citing State v. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 58, 600 N.E.2d 661 (1992).\n\nCrim.R. 14 provides:\n\nIf it appears that a defendant or the state is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment, information, or complaint, or by such joinder for trial together of indictments, informations or complaints, the court shall order an election or separate trial of counts, grant a severance of defendants, or provide such other relief as justice requires. In ruling on a motion by a defendant for severance, the court shall order the prosecuting attorney to deliver to the court for inspection pursuant to Rule 16(B)(1)(a) any statements or confessions made by the defendants which the state intends to introduce in evidence at the trial.\n\nEven if offenses are properly joined pursuant to Crim.R. 8(A), a defendant may move to sever the charges pursuant to Crim.R. 14. In order to affirmatively show\nthat his rights have been prejudiced by the joinder, the defendant must furnish the trial court with information sufficient to allow the court to weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant's right to a fair trial; to obtain reversal on appeal, the defendant must demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to separate the charges for trial. Goodner at ¶ 42. Thus, we review the trial court's decision on severance under an abuse of discretion standard. State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990).\n\nA defendant normally cannot establish prejudice, however, where either (1) the evidence of each of the crimes joined at trial is simple and direct or (2) the State could have introduced evidence of one offense in a separate trial of the other offense had severance been granted. State v. Ward, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26773, 2016-Ohio-5354, ¶ 16. If the evidence of other crimes would be admissible at separate trials, any ‘prejudice that might result from the jury's hearing the evidence of the other crime in a joint trial would be no different from that possible in separate trials,’ and a court need not inquire further. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 59, 600 N.E.2d 661 (1992), citing Drew v. United States, 331 F.2d 90 (D.C. Cir.1964).\n\nInitially, we note that evidence that tends to demonstrate the attempted bribery of a witness by a defendant is admissible against that defendant since such an attempt is an admission of guilt. See State v. Hunt, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 84528, 2005-Ohio-1871, at ¶ 8. Accordingly, had the trial court granted Snowden's motion to sever, his phone call to D.E. from the jail offering $2,500 for D.E. to change his testimony would have been admissible to establish Snowden's consciousness of guilt regarding his role in the murder of Sarver. If the charges had been severed, the State would necessarily have\ncalled several of the same witnesses from the trial on the underlying charges to prove motive and interest in connection with the bribery charges, which would have wasted judicial resources and subjected the witnesses to a needless second turn on the stand. Thus, we conclude that since the evidence of Snowden’s attempt to bribe D.E. would have been admissible at Snowden’s murder trial, the trial court did not err when it overruled his motion to sever."}

Darmond, 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 2013-Ohio-966, 986 N.E.2d 971, ¶ 34.\n\nTheodora Watson’s Testimony\n\n¶ 56 The first instance of allegedly prejudicial testimony admitted into evidence over objection occurred when, during direct examination, the prosecutor asked Watson if she had ever changed her story regarding the events surrounding Sarver’s shooting on the night of June 6, 2016. The following exchange occurred regarding a recorded conversation between Watson and Snowden on November 30, 2017, when Snowden was in jail:\n\nThe State: Ma’am, do you remember back in November of 2017 testifying in another hearing regarding this matter?\n\nWatson: Yes.\n\nQ: And the phone call I’m about to play for you, was that after you received this call from Mr. Snowden?\n\nA: Yes.\n\n(State’s Exhibit 29 marked for identification)\n\nQ: Okay. Judge, permission?\n\n(Audio played at 2:58 p.m., ending at 3:00 p.m.)\n\nThe State: I want to just stop you there. Was that – do you recognize that voice who answered it?\nWatson: Yes.\n\nQ: Who was that?\n\nA: My son, Munchie [Derrick Watson].\n\nQ: Munchie. Okay. So your son, actually, answered the phone call, and then did he give the phone to you?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Okay.\n\n(Audio played at 3:00 p.m., ending at 3:01 p.m.)\n\nQ: Okay. Ma’am, I want to ask you a couple [of] questions. If you could help – what was your understanding of why DeeDot, Mr. Snowden, was calling you?\n\nA: So I could change my story.\n\n***\n\nQ: Is that how you took that?\n\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Have you ever changed your story in this?\n\nA: No.\n\nDefense Counsel: Objection.\n\nThe State: Have you ever identified anyone else as the shooter, besides Mr. Snowden?\n\nWatson: No, sir.\n\n(Emphasis added.) Tr. p. 151-153.\n\n{¶ 57} In a sidebar prior to the above exchange, the trial court overruled a\ncontinuing objection made by defense counsel to the State playing the recorded conversation between Watson and Snowden. During the above exchange, Watson was simply explaining how she interpreted the phone call she received from Snowden. Based upon the conversation, Watson testified that she believed that Snowden wanted her to change her story regarding the shooting. The State’s next question to Watson with respect to whether she had ever changed her story was a clarification from Watson regarding Snowden’s improper and unsuccessful attempt to influence her testimony. Furthermore, after the objection from defense counsel, the State immediately asked Watson whether she had ever identified anyone other than Snowden as the shooter, to which she replied in the negative.\n\n{¶ 58} Even if the inquiry made by the State regarding whether Watson ever changed her story were improper, we would not reverse Snowden’s conviction on this basis because any error was harmless. Crim.R. 52(A) instructs us to disregard ‘[a]ny error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights.’ See also Evid.R. 103(A) (‘Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected * * *.’). This rule is premised on the idea that the U.S. Constitution guarantees an accused the right to a trial free only from prejudicial error, which is not necessarily a trial free from all error. See United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 508-509, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983).\n\n{¶ 59} Snowden next contends that the trial court erred in allowing Watson to testify at length regarding the $20 bill Sarver handed to her before he was shot. During Watson’s direct examination, the following exchange occurred:\n\nThe State: Ma’am, the $20 that Mr. Sarver gave to you, what did you do\nwith that?\nWatson: It’s in my purse.\nQ: You still have it?\nA: Yes, I do.\nQ: What do you plan on doing with it?\nA: Keeping it.\nQ: Why?\nDefense Counsel: Objection, Your Honor.\nWatson: Because –\nThe Court: Approach.\n(At sidebar)\nDefense Counsel: Your Honor, I object for relevancy. This is strictly just to invoke sympathy for Mr. Sarver. There’s no – the $20 has no other relevance. She’s explained why it had been, and that’s fine. Now they intend to offer it into evidence; and I would argue it’s irrelevant and just meant to invoke sympathy for Mr. Sarver which isn’t, I don’t think, a proper basis at this point.\nThe State: My response would be that the $20 testified to that that was an item given to Ms. Watson on the night of the incident. It shows that she has a memory of things that happened. It is also evidence that Mr. Sarver was a very good, close personal friend and that she would have no need, then – I think, ultimately, what the argument’s going to be, to make up a story as to who killed him.\nDefense Counsel: I would also point out during cross-examination, for what it's worth, her statement at the scene – the only mention of $20 is in her written statement, is that [Snowden] had approached Mr. Sarver, mad, about $20 the Mr. Sarver, apparently, owed [Snowden]. So it's already in contradiction to what she has testified here to today, which will be gone into on cross-examination. But I think – she's testified to where the $20 came from, she's testified it's (indiscernible).\n\nThe Court: What's the contradiction?\n\nDefense Counsel: She says Mr. Sarver gave her $20. The written statement at the time that she gave – the other statement she gives to the police is that the whole argument started over [Snowden] approaching Mr. Sarver while he was talking to Ms. Watson, that [Snowden] was mad over $20 * * * that Sarver owed [Snowden]. But again, I just don't see how this goes to – and she testified where it came from, she's testified it's (indiscernible).\n\nThe Court: Well, is this going to be an issue about the $20, or –\n\nDefense Counsel: It's just – I'm going to use it to impeach her, as far as what she said; but I'm not going to go into who – where the $20 came from or who has the $20. I just – that's why I don't (indiscernible).\n\nThe Court: Well –\n\nDefense Counsel: -- the fact that she kept the $20.\n\nThe Court – we're (indiscernible).\nThe State: That’s why (simultaneous speaking).\n\nDefense Counsel: But she’s testified she kept it. I don’t see why she kept it is relevant. They’ve gotten (indiscernible).\n\nThe Court: I’m going to allow it.\n\n(End sidebar)\n\nThe State: Ma’am, I just asked you what – why you kept the $20 bill that Mr. Sarver gave you. Why do you still have it?\n\nWatson: I’ll keep it forever.\n\nQ: You will keep it forever.\n\nA: Until I die.\n\n(Emphasis added.) Tr. p. 154-157.\n\n¶ 60 Here, we find that the trial court erred when it allowed Watson to testify, over objection, regarding the reason she kept the $20 given to her by Sarver on the night of the shooting. The State’s question regarding retention of the $20 was not relevant to the disputed factual issues and evoked an emotional response, not related to Snowden’s guilt or innocence. Relevant testimonial evidence tends to prove (or disprove) a material element of an offense. State v. Harris, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22992, 2010-Ohio-498, ¶ 20; State v. Gardner, 59 Ohio St.2d 14, 20, 391 N.E.2d 337 (1979); see also Evid.R. 401 (‘Relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.’). We do not see how this evidence tended to prove that Snowden was guilty. However, we find the trial court’s error in this regard to be harmless. The admission of this evidence did not materially contribute to\nSnowden's convictions because we find it highly unlikely that the jury would have acquitted Snowden in its absence. The prosecutor presented other evidence, independent of the irrelevant testimony regarding the $20 Sarver gave Watson, on which the jury could have based its verdicts. See Harris at ¶ 20.\n\nLastly, Snowden argues that the trial court erred when it sustained an objection from the State regarding defense counsel's questioning of Watson on cross-examination about the 911 call during the following exchange:\n\n(Audio [911 call] played ***)\n\nDefense Counsel: And again, you don't remember who it was with you?\n\nWatson: Just my grandkids was there.\n\n(Audio played ***)\n\nQ: “They” being just your grandsons?\n\nA: Yes.\n\n(Audio played ***)\n\nQ: Who was putting pressure on it?\n\nA: I don't know.\n\nQ: One of your son – grandsons?\n\nA: No, it wasn't my son.\n\nQ: One of your grandsons?\n\nA: I don't know.\n\n(Audio played ***)\n\nQ: “Well, what. Well, what,” whose voice is that?\n\nA: I don't know.\nQ: But you just said it was just – was that a man's voice?\nA: I don't know.\n\nQ: Could that have been a kid's voice? Want to listen to it again?\nThe State: Objection.\nThe Court: Sustained.\nDefense Counsel: Okay. You heard that voice?\nWatson: Yes.\n\nQ: Is that man's voice?\nA: I don't know.\n\nQ: Are you claiming that could be one of your grandsons' voices?\nA: It could have been the oldest.\nThe State: Objection.\nDefense Counsel: Your Honor –\nThe Court: Okay. Let's move on.\nDefense Counsel: Okay.\n\n(Tr. p. 178-179.)\n\n¶ 62 In our view, it clear from the record that defense counsel asked Watson multiple times whether a male voice heard on the 911 recording could have been one of her grandsons. Watson indicated multiple times that she did not know whose voice was on the recording. The question from defense counsel had been asked and answered, and the trial court did not err when it sustained the State's objection and asked defense counsel to move on with his cross-examination. Additionally, the trial court did not ‘cut off a relevant line of inquiry’ when it sustained the State's objection. In fact, the record\nestablishes that defense counsel continued questioning Watson regarding the voices that could be heard on the recording after the objection had been sustained.\n\n**Bribery Evidence**\n\n{¶ 63} Snowden also argues that the trial court erred in admitting the recording of his jail phone calls to Watson and D.E. in which he attempted to influence their testimony; in D.E.’s case, Snowden offered him $2,500 to change his testimony. While Snowden concedes that the recordings of the phone calls were relevant, he argues that the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The only prejudice Snowden argues that he suffered was that his first trial ended in a mistrial, but after the State offered the jail telephone call recordings into evidence, he was convicted on all counts. Snowden’s argument is without merit.\n\n{¶ 64} The trial court did not err when it admitted the jail phone call recordings into evidence. The probative value of the recordings was indisputable. With respect to the bribery charge, Snowden can be heard offering D.E. $2,500 to change his testimony. The call with D.E. contained the material elements of bribery, which the State had the burden of proving at trial. As previously stated, both phone calls showed a consciousness of guilt on Snowden’s part by trying to influence Watson’s and D.E.’s testimony. Unfavorable evidence is not equivalent to unfairly prejudicial evidence. See *State v. Geasley*, 85 Ohio App.3d 360, 373, 619 N.E.2d 1086 (9th Dist.1993). Unfairly prejudicial evidence is that which might result in an improper basis for a jury decision. *Oberlin v. Akron Gen. Med. Ctr.*, 91 Ohio St.3d 169, 172, 743 N.E.2d 890 (2001); *State v. Broadnax*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 18169, 2001 WL 127779 (Feb. 16, 2001). In the instant case, we conclude that the jail phone call recordings were unfavorable evidence\nwhich were probative of Snowden’s guilt for the bribery charge, as well as the shooting\ndeath of Sarver. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it admitted the recordings.\n\n¶ 65 Snowden’s third assignment of error is overruled."}

Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997), applies in both criminal and civil cases. Eastley v. Volkman, 132 Ohio St.3d 328, 2012-Ohio-2179, 972 N.E.2d 517, ¶ 17-23.” Mathews v. Mathews, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2012-CA-79, 2013-Ohio-2471, ¶ 9.\n\n¶ 69 This court has stated that “a weight of the evidence argument challenges the believability of the evidence and asks which of the competing inferences suggested by the evidence is more believable or persuasive.” (Citations omitted). State v. Jones, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25724, 2014-Ohio-2309, ¶ 8. “When evaluating whether a [judgment] is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider witness credibility, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact ‘clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.’ ” Id., quoting Thompkins at 387.\n\n¶ 70 Because the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses at trial, we must defer to the factfinder's decisions whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses. *State v. Lawson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16288, 1997 WL 476684, *4 (Aug. 22, 1997). However, we extend less deference in weighing competing inferences suggested by the evidence. *Id.* The fact that the evidence is subject to differing interpretations does not render the judgment against the manifest weight of the evidence. *State v. Wilson*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 22581, 2009-Ohio-525, ¶ 14. A judgment should be reversed as being against the manifest weight of the evidence only in exceptional circumstances. *State v. Martin*, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\n\n¶ 71 As previously stated, the evidence adduced at trial established that at approximately 11:00 p.m. on June 6, 2016, Snowden shot and killed Sarver after the two men got into a brief altercation while standing next to Watson’s car. Watson, D.S., and D.E., who were sitting inside the vehicle, each testified that Snowden fired a single shot, striking Sarver in the abdomen. Watson and D.S. testified that because it was dark, they never saw the handgun with which Snowden shot Sarver. D.E., however, testified that from his vantage point inside the vehicle, he was able to see the handgun in Snowden’s hand when he shot Sarver.\n\n¶ 72 Furthermore, in late November 2017, D.E., who had testified at trial, received a phone call from Snowden, who was in jail. During the conversation, Snowden offered D.E. $2,500 to give testimony favorable to Snowden at an upcoming hearing. On November 30, 2017, Snowden also called Watson from the jail and asked her to change her story regarding her recollection of the events surrounding Sarver’s shooting. As previously stated, evidence that tends to demonstrate the attempted bribery of a witness by a defendant is admissible against that defendant since such an attempt is an admission of guilt. See Hunt, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 84528, 2005-Ohio-1871, at ¶ 8.\n\n¶ 73 Thus, having reviewed the record, we find no merit in Snowden's manifest weight challenge. It is well settled that evaluating witness credibility is primarily for the trier of fact. State v. Benton, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2010-CA-27, 2012-Ohio-4080, ¶ 7. A trier of fact does not lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice if its resolution of conflicting testimony is reasonable. Id. Here, the jury quite reasonably credited the State's evidence, which established that Snowden was guilty of the offenses for which he was convicted. Accordingly, the jury did not lose its way and create a manifest miscarriage of justice in reaching guilty verdicts for the charged offenses."}

In addition, the doctrine of res judicata prevents further review of the issue of insufficient evidence because the issue has already been addressed by this court on direct appeal, through the claim that Townsend’s convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence, and found to be without merit. *State v. Perry*, 10 Ohio St.2d 175, 226 N.E.2d 104 (1967).

We’re here today, [assistant prosecutors] are representing the prosecutor’s office, and we’re here today to discuss the discovery issues that were raised yesterday by the defendant, who is representing himself.\n\nSo [assistant prosecutor], would you care to make a record as to what’s going to be provided to the defendant?\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: Yes, Your Honor. I do have all of the discovery that is available to be printed out, printed out. I am right now handing the defendant his initial response to discovery. That includes the bill of particulars, the evidence list, as well as an initial witness list.\n\nFurther, the previous prosecutor who handled this case, [assistant prosecutor], also filed supplements to his initial discovery, and I am handing the defendant supplements from March 13th of 2017; supplemental discovery responses from April 5th of 2017, April 26th of 2017, May 24th of 2017, September 1st of 2017, September 5th of 2017. So those are all the actual discovery responses via initial discovery, as well as the supplemental discovery.\n\nYesterday I did have an opportunity to speak to the sheriff’s deputy and it was indicated to me that I could not provide any discovery\nto him that involved staples or paper clips, so everything I’m handing him has not been stapled or paper-clipped.\n\nWith regards to the actual evidence against this defendant, Your Honor, I have printed out the evidence. I am handing him the detective files, as well as police reports. All four of them in discovery are labeled \"1st police report.\" One of them is further labeled \"1st police report, Maple Heights.\" I have redacted out Social Security numbers as well as addresses, Your Honor.\n\nI also have for the defendant the BCI lab work and submission sheets; BCI report dated January 5th of 2017, December 16th of 2015, February 2nd of 2015. All of those include the CVs of the BCI DNA analysts who tested that particular evidence.\n\nI have an evidence submission sheet from August 5th of 2014; a BCI report from December 23rd of 2015; I have submission sheets from December 8th of 2006; submission sheet to BCI from May 29th of 2014; a lab report from December 23rd of 2015; a lab report from BCI from December 22nd, 2006; a lab report from BCI from August 17th of 2017.\n\nI also have the letter that BCI sends to the Cleveland Police Department to notify them of a CODIS hit, that letter being dated April 6th of 2015.\n\nI have a CODIS match memorandum sent by BCI to the Maple Heights Police Department dated December 18, 2015; a CODIS match memorandum from BCI to the Cleveland Police Department dated December 18th, 2015; I have a summary of the statement made by Kris Williams to the police department; a Cleveland Police report RMS 2003-32948; Cleveland RMS 2005-104080.\n\nI have Cuyahoga County prosecutor’s office investigator report created by Dshaun Thompson, that was created on November 28th, 2016. I have another report from Dshaun Thompson created on November 9th of 2016. We have several copies of that report created November 9th of 2016.\n\nI have certified medical records from MetroHealth concerning patient [victim]; certified medical records from University Hospitals concerning [victim]; and certified medical records from Marymount hospital concerning [victim].\nI have photocopies of jail mail from Mr. Townsend to Keisha Fletcher.\n\nTHE COURT: And that’s relevant how?\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: Your Honor, some of the information that we have gathered as a result of this case, while he is the creator of these documents, just so that he has a copy of whatever the State has in his possession. I also –\n\nTHE COURT: She is not a victim?\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: No.\n\nTHE COURT: Thank you.\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: Sorry, Your Honor. I have a letter from Mr. Townsend addressed to Sister Souljah; a letter from Mr. Townsend addressed to Robert Foster; a letter from Mr. Townsend addressed to Tiara Townsend; a letter from Kris Williams addressed to Natasha Gant, also not a victim in this case; a letter from Mr. Williams addressed to Ms. Gant; a letter from Mr. Williams addressed to — I’m going to spell this out — T-w-a-n-e-l-i-a Walker.\n\nI have a copy of a Cleveland Police Department photo array; I have a photo array shown to [victim] by Dshaun Thompson and Investigator Sahir Hassan; I have a photo array shown to [victim] by Dshaun Thompson and Investigator Hassan.\n\nI have a waiver of rights that was signed by Kris Williams. I have a photo of Mr. Townsend and a photo of [victim] shown to Mr. Williams during his interview with the police. And finally, Your Honor, I have crime scene photos that were taken of 17308 McCracken.\n\nYour Honor, in this case there is also several recorded statements taken from witnesses and victims. In speaking to the sheriff’s deputy, I was informed that I cannot provide a copy of those to the defendant on a CD, because they’re not allowed to have them in jail; further, they have no way of listening to them. I would be able to make a copy of those recordings and have a jury room laptop available, if the court wants to bring the defendant up to listen to those in the holding cell.\nTHE COURT: What are they exactly? What has been recorded?\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: They are interviews with the victims in this case and the co-defendant, Your Honor. So when Investigator Dshaun —\n\nTHE COURT: What’s the status of the co-defendant’s case?\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: He is also set for trial. I think at this time we were intending to start [victim’s] trial with both co-defendants on November 13th.\n\nTHE COURT: So both defendants are set for trial on November 13th?\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: Correct.\n\nTHE COURT: As regards victim —\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: [Victim].\n\nTHE COURT: Is it the State’s position to try the other two cases against this defendant separately?\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: Yes, Your Honor, together, but separate from the [victim] trial.\n\nTHE COURT: I understand. So what’s at issue is her oral interview?\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: Correct, and the interview of the co-defendant.\n\nTHE COURT: And it’s your decision to make this information available, it’s only a question of what format is utilized?\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: Correct, Your Honor.\n\nTHE COURT: You’re telling me that the defendant is not permitted to have a CD in the county jail?\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: Correct, Your Honor. That is information that was given to me by the deputy yesterday in speaking to how discovery could be provided to this defendant.\nTHE COURT: How do you propose we provide this to him?\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: It’s my understanding that he can’t bring it down to the jail. I propose having a copy of that interview up here on the 19th floor along with a jury laptop, a —\n\nTHE COURT: We may be able to have his standby counsel assist in this where you would provide a laptop with a disk and they move into the holding cell, as opposed to the jury room.\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: The holding cell is what I was suggesting, Your Honor. I’m sorry.\n\nTHE COURT: That’s acceptable to me, we’ll set a date for that.\n\nASSISTANT PROSECUTOR: Okay. The only other thing with regards to discovery, the defendant did file a discovery motion that was filed with the clerk of court on October 6th of 2017. In that request I have provided him with a copy of his bill of particulars, his evidence notice. He also makes a demand for summaries of all cellular phone calls made to or from the officers involved in the stop, arrest, or incident involving the defendant. I’m not a hundred percent sure what he’s asking me for, and I don’t have any copies of any cell phone calls or summaries of those cell phone calls.\n\nTHE COURT: All right, thank you. Thank you very much, [assistant prosecutor], I appreciate your comments on behalf of the State of Ohio.\n\nTr. 68 - 76.\n\n{¶ 22} In addition, the transcript demonstrates that Townsend withdrew his request for an independent DNA analysis:\n\nTHE COURT: I want to stick to the DNA analysis, because the problem with this is, in the past your attorneys have not requested an independent analysis. It was my understanding that that motion was revoked, I believe by [defense counsel], because he doesn’t wish the information to incriminate you. I think there was a concern. Now you are, as far as I am concerned, reversing that trial strategy.\n\nTHE DEFENDANT: You can cancel the DNA.\nTHE COURT: Pardon me?\n\nTHE DEFENDANT: It can be canceled. Can I speak, please?\n\nTHE COURT: I want to resolve the DNA issue, because if you want the DNA analysis, it’s going to require a lengthy continuance of this case.\n\nTHE DEFENDANT: Okay. We don’t need it; cancel it.\n\nTHE COURT: You don’t want it?\n\nTHE DEFENDANT: I don’t want it; don’t need it.\n\nTHE COURT: Then the request for the DNA analysis independent review is canceled.\n\nTr. 105 - 106."}

State v. Long, 127 Ohio App.3d 328, 332, 713 N.E.2d 1 (4th Dist. 1998).\n\nIn the case sub judice, both Trooper Browne and Sergeant Barrett testified that Atos alerted. In addition, the video of the stop was played for the trial court. The trial court, in its Judgment Entry overruling the Motion to Suppress, stated, in relevant part, as follows:\n\nThe court has considered Tpr. Browne and K9 Atos’s certifications and training records. The court also has had the opportunity to review the in car video of the free air sniff performed by Tpr. Browne and K9 Atos. The court believes that the video speaks for itself. The court finds Tpr. Browne’s testimony to be credible and consistent with what can be seen on video. Clearly, Atos is bothered by getting a face full of exhaust fumes. The court find (sic) defense witness, Andy Jimenez, to be less than credible when he testified that rather than the exhaust fumes, it was simply Atos’s displaying avoidance behavior at the rear of the vehicle. The video says otherwise in the court’s opinion.\n\nDefense witness Andy Jimenez, also says he did not see any independent alert by Atos for the presence of narcotics on the video. It is the testimony of Mr. Jimenez that everything Atos does with reference to the vehicle was simply the result of Tpr. Browne pressuring Atos to do it. Again, the court finds Mr. Jimenez to lack credibility regarding this assertion. The video shows what the court finds to be independent alerts by Atos consistent with the testimony of Tpr. Browne. Tpr. Browne’s testimony is also supported by not only the video itself but also by Sgt. Barrett’s testimony. The court, as fact finder in this matter, finds Tpr. Browne’s and Sgt. Barrett’s testimony to be more credible and more believable than Mr. Jimenez. The court further finds that the video itself is more consistent with the testimony of Tpr. Browne and Sgt. Barrett then it is with testimony of Mr. Jimenez.\n\nUpon our independent review of the video of the traffic stop, we find that the greater weight of evidence militates towards a finding that Atos alerted on the vehicle. The video show Atos attempting to crawl under the truck on rear of the driver’s side."}

If a motion for a new trial is made on grounds of newly discovered evidence, the motion must be filed within 120 days after a verdict. Crim.R. 33(B). If a defendant files a motion for a new trial after the expiration of that time, the defendant must first seek leave of the trial court to file a delayed motion for a new trial. *State v. Mathis*, 134 Ohio App.3d 77, 79, 730 N.E.2d 410 (1st Dist.1999). To obtain leave, the defendant must demonstrate by clear and convincing proof that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the new evidence within the time period specified by Crim.R. 33(B). *Mathis*. When a defendant files a motion for leave to file a new trial, the trial court may not consider the merits of the motion for a new trial until it first makes a finding of unavoidable delay. *State v. Brown*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 95253, 2011-Ohio-1080, ¶14.\n\n\"[A] party is unavoidably prevented from filing a motion for a new trial if the party had no knowledge of the existence of the ground supporting the motion and could not have learned of that existence within the time prescribed for filing the motion in the exercise of reasonable diligence.\" *Brown* at ¶13, quoting *State v. Walden*, 19 Ohio App.3d 141, 145-146, 483 N.E.2d 859 (10th Dist.1984). As the Second District explained in *State v. McConnell*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24315, 2011-Ohio-5555, ¶18,\n\n[t]he essence of Crim.R. 33 is that collateral attacks on the validity of trial proceedings must be made close in time to the proceeding to ensure that any issue raised may be given full and fair consideration.

Washington, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103875, 2016-Ohio-5329, ¶ 16. The trial court’s decision whether to hold an evidentiary hearing on a defendant’s request for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial is also reviewed for an abuse of discretion. State v. Hill, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102083, 2015-Ohio-1652, ¶ 16.\n\nAppellant’s Motion for Leave and Supporting Documents\n\n¶ 13 Cowan attached to his motion for leave three pages (pages 6, 7, and 9) from the “Cleveland Police Department Offense/Incident Report” in this case. Page 6 of the Offense/Incident Report contained Detective Don Meel’s report regarding the test result for two firearms and a partially loaded pistol magazine retrieved from the bushes of 4120 E. 139th Street, near Cowan’s residence. Detective Meel stated that “these two weapons and ammunition were processed using cyanoacrolate [fuming] and white powder with negative results. No prints. No trace.” There was no further explanation as to what a result of “no prints” or “no trace” indicate.\n\n¶ 14 To show that Detective Meel’s report was newly discovered evidence and that he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence, Cowan attached a correspondence in the letterhead of City of Cleveland Department of Law Public Records. The document states the following in its entirety:\n\n07/30/2018\n\nCraig A. Cowan\n\nRe: PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST of July 30, 2018, Reference # P006993-073018\nDear Craig A. Cowan,\n\nThe City of Cleveland received a public record request from you on July 30, 2018. You requested the following:\n\n“Crime Scene Unit Report 2011-00143308”\n\nThis letter will certify that the responsive documents are true, accurate, and authentic copies of the records maintained in the regular course of business by the City of Cleveland Law Department\n\nPublic Safety- Public Records Request – P006993-073018\n\nIf you have any questions, or wish to discuss this further, please contract City of Cleveland Public Records.”\n\nSincerely,\nCity of Cleveland Public Records\n\nCity of Cleveland\nMayor Frank G. Jackson\n\n{¶ 15} Five months after the alleged public records request, on January 2, 2019, Cowan filed a motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial. In his motion for leave, he stated the following:\n\nMovant has had family friends make public record request to the Cleveland Police Department concerning any and all police reports related to Cowan’s case and investigation. Some request[s] have been more successful than other requested materials.\n\nOver a period of over 7½ years, family friends have made several visits to secure evidence that had been suppressed. This is not ordinary information. I present to this court exculpatory evidence.\n\n***\n\nOn one visit to the Police Department, family friend was given access to the missing CLEVELAND DEPARTMENT INCIDENT REPORT of Detective Donald J. Meel. ***.”\nThe state filed a brief opposing Cowan’s motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial on the ground that, contrary to Cowan’s allegation, the report in question had been provided to the defense as part of pretrial discovery.\n\nThe state pointed to a Bate stamp at the bottom of the pages that Cowan purportedly obtained through a public records request and explained that the Bate stamp reflected that these pages were part of the documents that were provided through discovery before trial. For example, page 6 — the page containing Detective Meel’s report — bore the stamp “Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office 5066092 40128 V14560E-65 PKG1 6/10/2011 Page 65,” which indicated the document was provided through the electronic discovery portal on June 10, 2011, and was page 65 of the discovery package provided to the defense.\n\nThe state also attached to its brief in opposition an affidavit from the assistant prosecutor who handled the trial in this case. The affidavit stated that (1) he prepared a discovery package during the course of prosecuting the case in response to the discovery request made by the defense pursuant to Crim.R. 16; (2) the case management system used by the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office allowed for discovery to be electronically delivered to defense counsel; and (3) the nine-page Offense/Incident Report in this case was included in the discovery package.\n\nOn the record before us, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion in summarily denying Cowan’s motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial without a hearing. The documents submitted by Cowan — the correspondence\npurportedly showing a public records request on July 30, 2018, concerning the case and pages from the Cleveland Police Department Offense/Incident Report bearing Bate stamping by the Prosecutor’s Office — on their face did not support his claim that he was unavoidably prevented from timely discovering the new evidence. Even if we assume the authenticity of the public records letter — which the state disputes — the letter only demonstrates that there was a public records request for a “Crime Scene Unit Report” in this case and that the Law Department provided documents in response. This document on its face did not support a claim that Cowan had no knowledge of the existence of the police report and could not have learned of its existence timely in the exercise of reasonable diligence. See, e.g., State v. Armengau, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 16AP-355, 2017-Ohio-197, ¶ 33 (trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant’s motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial without holding an evidentiary hearing where appellant failed to allege facts that would excuse his failure to timely file a motion for new trial).\n\nIn fact, the documents submitted by Cowan did not even seem to support his claim that the police report was newly discovered evidence — the Bate stamping by the prosecutor’s office appears to be telling evidence that the document was part of the discovery package provided to the defense. In order to establish a defendant was unavoidably prevented from discovering the new evidence, the defendant must first establish the evidence was “newly discovered.” State v. Davis, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 03AP-1200, 2004-Ohio-6065, ¶ 14. For these reasons, we are unable to find that the trial court abused its discretion denying Cowan’s motion\nfor leave to file a motion for a new trial without a hearing. The first and second assignments of error is without merit.\n\nUnder the third assignment of error, Cowan claims that the trial court’s denial of his motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial was an abuse of discretion because he has established his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to call Detective Meel as a witness at trial. Cowan did not raise this argument in his motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial. Even assuming he had raised this claim before the trial court, we note that the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim may conceivably be raised as part of his motion for a new trial if he successfully demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that he was unavoidably prevented from timely discovering the evidence in question. As we have explained in the foregoing, Cowan failed to present documents to support the threshold issue that he was avoidably prevented from timely discovering the evidence. Accordingly, the third assignment of error also lacks merit.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nIt is ordered that appellee recover from appellant costs herein taxed.\n\n1 In his brief on appeal, Cowan appears to argue that Detective Meel’s report constituted newly discovered evidence because it was not provided to him either directly or through counsel. He states in his brief that “[t]he prosecutor has revealed that it is acceptable not to disclose favorable information to the defendant, as long as [they say] it was furnished/ provided through the electronic discovery portal to the defense counsel.” Even assuming Cowan did not know of the existence of Meel’s report as he alleged, we note that Crim.R. 16 only requires discovery to be provided to the defendant’s counsel. There is no case law authority requiring discovery to be provided to a represented defendant constituted new evidence for purposes of a motion for leave to file a motion for a new trial.\nThe court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\nIt is ordered that a special mandate issue of this court directing the common pleas court to carry this judgment into execution.\n\nA certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to Rule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\nMICHELLE J.

Loc.R. 12.01, 12.02, and 12.03 provide:\n\n12.01\n\nA supporting or opposing memorandum or brief, including administrative appeals, shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages exclusive of any supporting documents.

Loc.R. 12.02 plainly provides that \"[a]ny reply memorandum or brief which exceeds seven pages shall not be considered without prior leave of the Court.\" Appellant did not seek prior leave of the court. Furthermore, pursuant to Loc.R. 12.03, such prior leave to exceed the page limitations must be made at least seven days before the filing of the brief. Appellant did not comply with this mandate either. In addition, Loc.R. 12.03 provides that, in such a motion, the appellant must \"set forth the unusual and extraordinary circumstances which necessitate exceeding the page limitation.\" Appellant obviously failed to comply with this requirement, as well. Significantly, appellant's motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial was a lengthy 42 pages, pursuant to leave by the court to file a long brief, but the state's memorandum contra was within the 15-page limitation set forth in Loc.R. 12.01. Given appellant presented a 42-page argument initially, while the state's memorandum contra was within the 15-page limit of the local rule, appellant faced a significant hurdle to setting forth any unusual or extraordinary circumstances that demonstrated the need for a 20-page reply. Also, appellant was clearly aware of the page limitations set forth in the local rules, as he already utilized the local rules to seek leave to file his motion for leave to file a long brief. In the end, appellant clearly failed to follow the local rules in filing his non-compliant reply, and the trial court had appellant's initial 42-page motion from which to fairly judge the merits of appellant's\nargument. Given these circumstances, we cannot find the trial court erred when it declined to consider appellant's reply that exceeded the page limitations as set forth in the local rules."}

Otherwise, the trial court may exercise its discretion regarding whether to hold a hearing on a defendant's motion for leave to file a motion for new trial. Armengau at ¶ 33 (finding trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's motion for leave to file a delayed motion for new trial without holding an evidentiary hearing where appellant's affidavit failed to allege facts which would excuse his failure to timely file a motion for new trial); State v.

See, e.g., Bush (finding trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for leave to file a motion for new trial without an evidentiary hearing where co-defendant's recanting affidavit exonerated defendant but nothing in the affidavit supported the conclusion that defendant could not have obtained the information within 120 days of trial and no evidentiary materials were otherwise provided on this point).\n\n¶ 22 In the present case, the jury rendered its verdict in the criminal trial on October 18, 2007. Because appellant did not file his motion for new trial within either time frame stated in Crim.R. 33(A)(1), (2), and (6), Crim.R. 33(B) required appellant to seek leave from the trial court before filing his motion for new trial.\nIn denying appellant's motion for leave to file a motion for new trial, the trial court found appellant was not unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence that formed the basis of the motion. We agree with the trial court.\n\nAppellant presents several different arguments under this assignment of error. Appellant claims he was unavoidably prevented from raising these arguments within 120 days because of the state's insistence on denying information to the defense. Appellant asserts he requested, on November 15, 2006, from the state, pursuant to *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), D.W.'s recorded statements, C.W.'s criminal record, and any other information from Franklin County Children Services Enforcement Agency (\"FCCSEA\"), Center for Child and Family Advocacy, and the Grove City Police Department that would be inconsistent with or refute D.W.'s claims. Appellant argues the state provided none of this information even though it had all of it in its possession.\n\nAppellant's first argument is that there is no physical evidence and the entire case is based on the statement of a four-year-old child, D.W., who was five years old at the time of trial. Appellant points out D.W.'s testimony and statements were inconsistent, and E.A. testified he never saw appellant put anything in D.W.'s mouth. However, these arguments go to the underlying merits of the motion for new trial and not the merits of the motion for leave to file his untimely motion for new trial.\n\nAppellant next argues the state did not provide \"Brady\" material to him regarding D.W.'s possible biological father, D.L., who lived in the same apartment complex as D.W. Although D.L. has a past history of alleged sexual abuse when he was 14 years old involving a 7-year-old victim, which appellant admits the state minimally disclosed through discovery, D.L. also has an extensive adult criminal history. A woman once filed a petition for domestic violence that claimed D.L. physically and sexually assaulted her. Appellant claims the state did not disclose this later information. However, appellant was not unavoidably prevented from discovering this evidence. Initially, appellant does not contend he was unaware of D.L.'s criminal and sexual assault history. Furthermore, it is mere speculation that any records relating to D.L.'s criminal and sexual assault history are exculpatory as related to the present case. There is nothing to support the theory that D.L. committed the actual abuse against D.W. in the present case. In addition, these records were public records which were freely and equally available to\nappellant. See State v. Stoutamire, 11th Dist. No. 2008-T-0108, 2009-Ohio-6228, ¶ 37 (court records are matters of public record, and were discoverable by the defense in preparation of trial); State v. Ross, 9th Dist. No. 23028, 2006-Ohio-4352, ¶ 27 (Brady does not require that a party disclose information which is part of a public record). Therefore, this argument is without merit.\n\n¶ 27 Appellant next argues the Grove City Police purposely failed to investigate T.W.’s alleged sexual assault of E.A., which occurred shortly after D.W.’s accusation. Appellant points out T.W. was the babysitter of both boys and had court documented psychiatric sex-related offenses, and the state refused to investigate her or disclose her history of psycho-sexual violence, even after appellant reported to the police that he had caught T.W. molesting E.A. Appellant claims he did not know until he filed his motion for new trial in 2014 that T.W. had been indicted for burglary and theft in 2001, and she underwent court-ordered psychiatric treatment in relation to that case. Appellant claims the state never disclosed this information.\n\n¶ 28 However, appellant was not unavoidably prevented from discovering this evidence. As to T.W.’s alleged sexual assault of E.A., appellant himself made the report to the police; thus, he was aware of the accusation. As for T.W.’s past criminal and psychiatric history, this claim suffers from the same deficiencies as discussed above with regard to D.L. That T.W. was the true perpetrator of the abuse at issue in this case is pure speculation, and T.W.’s past criminal history was of public record and available to appellant. Therefore, this argument is without merit.\n\n¶ 29 Appellant also argues that, in violation of Brady, C.W.’s children services background was not fully provided to appellant, including she had previously alleged that one of her other children had been sexually assaulted by that child’s father, but the allegation was determined to be unfounded. Appellant asserts he did not obtain this information until 2014. However, as pointed out by the state, appellant fails to support his theory with evidentiary documentation, and he is merely speculating about what transpired in the juvenile case involving C.W. and the other child. Furthermore, even if C.W. lied in the other case, appellant presents nothing to suggest that C.W. fabricated the story in the present case. Therefore, we find this argument without merit.\nAppellant next argues that even if no *Brady* violation occurred here, he was still entitled to a new trial based on ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel. \"Ineffective assistance of trial counsel may be raised as a ground for a new trial under Crim.R. 33(A)(1) 'irregularity in the proceedings.' \" *State v. Farley*, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-555, 2004-Ohio-1781, ¶ 11. To establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that counsel's performance was deficient and that counsel's deficient performance prejudiced him. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). The failure to make either showing defeats a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Bradley*, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 143 (1989), quoting *Strickland* at 697. (\"[T]here is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to approach the inquiry in the same order or even to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.\"). A tactical decision by trial counsel, who as a licensed attorney is presumed to be competent, is not by itself enough to show ineffective assistance of counsel simply because the strategy did not result in an acquittal. *State v. Clayton*, 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 48-49 (1980).\n\nIn the present case, appellant argues his counsel never developed the obvious motive for C.W.'s and D.L.'s accusations against him. He claims he is the biological father of E.A., and the biological father of D.W. according to FCCSEA. He argues that only six days after he was awarded emergency custody and named legal custodian of E.A., C.W. and D.L. accused him of sexual abuse of D.W. He asserts that C.W. and D.L. concocted the accusations fearing he would also seek custody of D.W. He points out that C.W. had reason to fear he would seek custody of D.W. because she was an alcoholic and stripper, and had a history with children services.\n\nHowever, appellant was clearly aware of these circumstances of both E.A. and D.W. at the time of the present accusations. More importantly, the record reveals no indication that C.W. and D.L. were aware appellant had been granted temporary custody of E.A. prior to the accusations. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to suggest the circumstances that led appellant to be granted temporary custody of E.A. would also apply to his custody of D.W., so that C.W. and D.L. would fear appellant would be granted custody of D.W. The record shows the basic underlying custodial circumstances with E.A. and D.W. were, in fact, fundamentally different. D.W. and E.A.'s mothers were different.\nE.A.'s mother abandoned E.A., and E.A. was already living with appellant. D.W. was living with C.W. Appellant's argument is without merit.\n\n{¶ 33} Similarly, appellant also asserts his counsel failed to investigate and pursue the evidence related to D.L., T.W., and C.W. However, this decision was a strategic decision. Appellant has presented no convincing argument or evidence to suggest either D.L. or T.W. abused D.W. or that D.L. and C.W. fabricated the abuse claims based on a fear of losing custody of D.W. These were weak arguments based on pure speculation. Instead, appellant's counsel pursued a sound strategy of arguing the abuse never occurred at all. Counsel did pursue the argument that C.W. coerced D.W. into making up the rape allegation, and that argument had a clear evidentiary basis, which arose from D.W.'s statement that C.W. told D.W. she would \"whoop\" him if he did not tell her what happened. The other theories appellant raises are not based on any evidence and would have muddied the simpler trial strategy that the abuse never happened and D.W.'s claim was not credible. Therefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, we find the trial court did not err when it denied appellant's motion for leave to file motion for new trial. Appellant's third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n{¶ 34} Accordingly, appellant's three assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.\n\nJudgment affirmed.\n\nSADLER and DORRIAN, JJ., concur."}

While the Defense cross examined Thomas, defense counsel introduced the false statements that Thomas made to the grand jury. Further, Thomas admitted at trial that he had lied to the grand jury in making these statements. However, these false statements did not constitute perjury as these were not material statements. See State v. Widmer, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2012-008, 2013-Ohio-62, ¶ 41, quoting Monroe v. Smith, 197 F.Supp.2d 753, 762 (E.D.Mich.2001) (holding 'the fact 'that a witness contradicts [himself] or changes [his] story also does not establish perjury.''). The grand jury was convened to determine whether an indictment should be issued against Randle. Thus, in this context, a false statement would have had to have been able to affect the decision as to whether an indictment should be issued against Randle in order to be material. The false statements that Thomas made did not address Randle’s activities in the matter before the grand jury. Rather, the false statements that Thomas made to the grand jury addressed his involvement in this crime and marginalized his role in committing this offense. The statements that Thomas made to the grand jury about Randle’s criminal activities were consistent with the statements that he made about Randle at trial. In the absence of these false statements, the indictment would not have been based on insufficient evidence. See State v. Cruise, 4th Dist. Washington No. 85-CA-28, 1987 WL 7009, *4 (Feb. 24, 1987),2 citing 2 La Fave Criminal Procedure 312 Sec. 15. Since the grand jury was considering whether to indict Randle, these particular false statements could not have had an effect on the outcome of the proceeding because the false statements did not address Randle’s activities. Compare State v. Wimbush, 5th Dist. Richland No. 2005CA0024, 2005-Ohio-6436, ¶ 15. Thus, the prosecution did not violate an ethical duty in this regard as alleged by Randle."}

{"index": "718-Carpenter", "allegation_num": "allegation_2", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT ALLOWED EXPERT TESTIMONY FROM A STATE’S WITNESS WHO WAS NOT FIRST QUALIFIED AS AN EXPERT, AND WHO DID NOT PREPARE A REPORT AT ALL, LET ALONE PROVIDE ONE TO THE DEFENSE IN DISCOVERY.", "extracted_text": "In this assignment of error, appellant contends the state was required to, and failed to, provide him with a copy of an expert report from social worker Pamela Spencer. Spencer conducted a forensic interview of A.C.\n\nAppellant argues that Spencer testified as an expert in conducting forensic interviews of children who alleged sexual assault. As such, appellant asserts, the state was required to provide him with an expert report from Spencer prior to trial. He contends Spencer did not merely recite the circumstances of her interview with A.C. Instead, she gave opinions and judgments that only an expert in child forensic interviewing could give. For instance, Spencer offered the opinions that A.C. was not coached and that A.C.’s self-harming was an indicator of sexual abuse. Moreover, Spencer testified as to her training and qualifications to offer such opinions.\n\nAppellant asserts the trial court should not have allowed Spencer to testify since she did not file a report and provide a copy to him before trial. Alternatively, he contends the trial court should have declared a mistrial after Spencer’s testimony. He asserts the trial court’s failure to do so constituted plain error because Spencer’s testimony bolstered A.C.’s testimony that appellant raped her, which was not otherwise supported by any other evidence.\n\nOnce again, appellant acknowledges that his counsel did not object to Spencer’s testimony or the lack of an expert report. Thus, this matter will be reviewed for plain error.\n\nCrim.R. 16(K) provides:\nAn expert witness for either side shall prepare a written report summarizing the expert witness’s testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinion, and shall include a summary of the expert’s qualifications. The written report and summary of qualifications shall be subject to disclosure under this rule no later than twenty-one days prior to trial, which period may be modified by the court for good cause shown, which does not prejudice any other party. Failure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert’s testimony at trial.\n\nThus, pursuant to the rule, Spencer was only required to prepare and submit a report if she was testifying as an expert. If she did testify as an expert, the fact that the state did not provide appellant with her report, could preclude her expert testimony at trial.\n\nTherefore, Appellant urges this court to examine whether Spencer actually testified as an expert. The state contends she testified as a lay witness.\n\nPursuant to Evid.R. 702, a witness may testify as an expert if three conditions are met: (1) the testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons; (2) the witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony; and (3) the testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information. “If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness’ testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness’ testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.” Evid.R. 701.\n\nAs the Second District has pointed out:\n\nThe line between expert testimony under Evid.R. 702 and lay opinion testimony under Evid.R. 701 is not always easy to draw. Id. at ¶ 19. However, as recognized by the Supreme Court of Ohio, courts have permitted lay witnesses to express their opinions in areas in which it would ordinarily be expected that an expert must be qualified under Evid.R. 702. State v. McKee, 91 Ohio St.3d 292, 296, 744 N.E.2d 737 (2001). “Although\nthese cases are of a technical nature in that they allow lay opinion testimony on a subject outside the realm of common knowledge, they still fall within the ambit of the rule's requirement that a lay witness's opinion be rationally based on firsthand observations and helpful in determining a fact in issue. These cases are not based on specialized knowledge within the scope of Evid.R. 702, but rather are based upon a layperson's personal knowledge and experience.” (Footnote omitted.) Id. at 296–297, 744 N.E.2d 737; see also State v. Jones, 2015-Ohio-4116, 43 N.E.3d 833, ¶ 107 (police detective could testify about typical behavior of children in child abuse cases based on his training and experience in such cases); State v. Renner, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25514, 2013-Ohio-5463, 2013 WL 6576714, ¶ 77.\n\nHetzer-Young v. Elano Corp., 2d Dist. Greene No. 2015-CA-38, 2016-Ohio-3356, ¶ 44.\n\n¶31 In this case, the state did not ask the trial court to qualify Spencer as an expert. Thus, the issue was never before the court.\n\n¶32 Spencer is a social worker and forensic interviewer at the Stark County Department of Job and Family Services (SCDJFS). She testified that in order to receive her position she earned a bachelor's degree in sociology. (Tr. 466). While employed at SCDJFS, she completed 30 hours of training pertaining to child welfare and forensic interviewing. (Tr. 466-467). This training included multiple classes on forensic interviewing during the course of her employment. (Tr. 468-469).\n\n¶33 Spencer then testified regarding her interview with A.C. Spencer stated that while she was talking with A.C., she notice several verbal and non-verbal clues common in children who have been abused. (Tr. 473). She noted A.C. was soft spoken and giggled a little bit. (Tr. 473). She also observed that A.C. appeared embarrassed at times and didn't maintain eye contact. (Tr. 473-474).\n\n¶34 Spencer testified that during the interview, A.C. disclosed that appellant touched her inappropriately and vaginally raped her many times over a five-to-six year period. (Tr. 478-479). A.C. told Spencer that she would tell appellant to stop, but he refused. (Tr. 479). She also told Spencer that appellant told her she would be in trouble if she told her mom. (Tr. 479). A.C. denied oral and anal sex to Spencer. (Tr. 481-482). Spencer testified that it was not uncommon for children to later disclose more information\nover time. (Tr. 482-483). She also testified that A.C. talked about cutting herself and punching herself. (Tr. 488-489). Spencer stated that self-harm is an indicator of sexual abuse. (Tr. 489).\n\n{¶35} The prosecutor asked Spencer to answer several questions based on her “education,” “training,” and/or “experience.” (Tr. 477, 482, 483). Spencer also testified that her testimony was based on her observations of A.C. and what A.C. told her in addition to her forensic interview training and her education. (Tr. 500).\n\n{¶36} Clearly, Spencer’s testimony as to what A.C. disclosed to her during the interview was that of a lay witness. She was simply relating facts to the jury as to what A.C. said based on her own observations.\n\n{¶37} The issue concerns other testimony that is alleged to stray into the territory of an expert witness.\n\n{¶38} The prosecutor asked Spencer if disclosure over time, as opposed to all at the same time, was to be expected based on her “education and your training and your experience.” (Tr. 477). The prosecutor followed up by soliciting testimony that Spencer had conducted over one thousand forensic interviews. (Tr. 477).\n\n{¶39} Later, Spencer testified that A.C. did not disclose anal or oral sex during her interview. (Tr. 481). The prosecutor then asked her, “is that something that is based on your education and training and experience, would that be inconsistent if she later said that it did happen?” (Tr. 482). To which Spencer replied “no.” (Tr. 482).\n\n{¶40} In discussing how children remember things, the prosecutor asked Spencer, “Do you think that kids based on your education, training and experience, remember things based on other significant events?” (Tr. 483).\n\n{¶41} Regardless of whether Spencer offered some expert opinions, there was no objection, and for the reasons explained below, the admission of the contested testimony was not an obvious error that was outcome determinative. As explained in the prior assignment of error, plain error cannot be recognized unless the error is obvious and the outcome of the trial would have been different. State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 2002-Ohio-68, 759 N.E.2d 1240. The reviewing court’s “discretionary” power to recognize plain error must be exercised “with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” Id.\nIn addition, the Ohio Supreme Court very recently addressed the issue of whether the admission of expert opinion testimony that was not set forth in a written report is reversible error and found harmless error in a case where there was an objection. In State v. Boaston, Slip Opinion 2020-Ohio-1061, Boaston was convicted of murdering his ex-wife.\n\nMore than a year prior to trial, the state provided the deputy coroner’s written autopsy report to the defense. Id. at ¶ 38. The report detailed the deputy coroner’s findings, which included her determinations as to the appearance and weight of the contents in the victim’s stomach, but did not include her opinion as to the time of death based on those stomach contents. Id. The deputy coroner then met with defense counsel 19 days before trial. Id. at ¶ 40. At this meeting, based on the findings contained in the autopsy report, she shared her opinion as to the victim’s time of death and her opinion that the shape of the abrasion under the victim’s chin was consistent with the shape of the buckle on a glove that had been collected from Boaston. Id. Defense counsel “suggested” that the state supply a supplemental report, but the state did not provide one. Id.\n\nAt trial, defense counsel moved to exclude the deputy coroner’s opinion testimony as to the time of death and the glove-buckle comparisons because the deputy coroner failed to provide a written report summarizing these opinions at least 21 days prior to trial, as required by Crim.R. 16(K), or because she failed to supplement her report following defense counsel’s meeting with her. Id. at ¶ 41. The trial court overruled the objection and permitted the testimony. Id. The court of appeals upheld the trial court’s judgment based on the trial court’s broad discretion in regulating the admission of evidence and on waiver. Id.\n\nOn appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, Boaston argued the state’s failure to supply a written report providing the deputy coroner’s opinions and “scientific reasoning” that the victim died within one to two hours after eating and that the bruise under her chin was consistent with Boaston’s glove violated Crim.R. 16(K). Id. at ¶ 42. The state, on the other hand, argued that Crim.R. 16(K) only requires “a written report summarizing ‘the expert witness’s testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinions’ ” and does not require “scientific reasoning.” Id. at ¶ 43. Alternatively, the state argued\nthat even if it violated Crim.R. 16(K), the rule is subject to the requirements of Crim.R. 52. *Id.* Thus, any error in the admission of an expert opinion not specifically stated in the deputy coroner’s written report would only be reversible if the error was prejudicial to Boaston’s substantial rights. *Id.*\n\n{¶46} The Court began by analyzing Crim.R. 16, noting that the Rule was amended in 2010 “in large part to strengthen the protections of a defendant’s constitutional due-process rights to a fair trial.” *Id.* at ¶ 44. As part of the amendment, Crim.R. 16(K) was adopted, which requires that expert witnesses generate written reports and that those reports be disclosed to the opposing party no later than 21 days before trial. *Id.* at ¶ 46.\n\n{¶47} The Court went on then to determine whether Crim.R. 16(K) required the exclusion of the deputy coroner’s testimony that went beyond the scope of her written autopsy report. *Id.* at ¶ 46. The Court noted that the deputy coroner’s unwritten opinions did not affect Boaston’s defense strategy, no continuance was requested, and defense counsel thoroughly cross-examined the deputy coroner as to her time-of-death and glove-buckle-analysis opinions. *Id.* at ¶ 50. Thus, no unfair surprise occurred. *Id.* But the Court continued its analysis.\n\n{¶48} The Court went on to find:\n\nThe plain language of Crim.R. 16(K) expressly provides the consequence for failing to disclose an expert’s report as required: “Failure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert’s testimony at trial.” (Emphasis added.) Crim.R. 16(L)(1) implicitly acknowledges this remedy: “The trial court may make orders regulating discovery not inconsistent with this rule.” (Emphasis added.) And while Crim.R. 16(K) confers some measure of discretion on trial judges, it is limited to modifying the 21-day requirement “for good cause shown, which does not prejudice any other party.” *Id.* at ¶ 55. Thus, the Court found that the deputy coroner’s opinions regarding the time of death and buckle abrasion, should have been set forth in a report or supplemental report pursuant to Crim.R. 16(K), which would have placed Boaston on formal notice of this substantive opinion testimony and given him the opportunity to seek other expert-\nopinion testimony on these issues. *Id.* at ¶ 56-57. As such, the Court determined that the state violated Crim.R. 16(K) by failing to provide a written report that contained the deputy coroner’s opinions on these topics and the trial court erred in allowing the opinion testimony that went beyond the scope of the supplied expert report. *Id.* at ¶ 58.\n\n¶49 But the Court did not end its analysis there. Having found that the admission of this evidence was error, it moved on to consider whether that error was harmless. *Id.* at ¶ 59.\n\n¶50 The Court found the error was harmless because Boaston was not prejudiced by the admission of the evidence. *Id.* at ¶ 64. It noted that the evidence was not essential to the state’s prosecution. *Id.* It also found that even without the deputy coroner’s opinion testimony regarding the time of death and the glove-buckle comparison, the remaining evidence overwhelmingly established Boaston’s guilt beyond any reasonable doubt. *Id.* at ¶ 65. The Court concluded: “We hold that it is error to admit expert opinion testimony when the expert’s opinion was not set forth in a written report prepared in compliance with Crim.R. 16(K). In this case, however, the trial court’s admission of testimony that went beyond the scope of the expert’s written report was harmless error.” *Id.* at ¶ 70.\n\n¶51 Likewise, in this case, any error in the trial court’s admission of Spencer’s testimony without a report was harmless. Disregarding the parts of Spencer’s testimony alleged to contain expert opinions, the evidence against appellant in this case was substantial.\n\n¶52 A.C. testified that appellant began sexually abusing her after he and her mother (Tabitha) split up and appellant moved in with his girlfriend (Charlotte). (Tr. 275). She was five years old at the time and about to start kindergarten. (Tr. 275-276). She described the first time the abuse occurred. (Tr. 276-281). A.C. testified that they were sitting on the bed watching the movie *It* while Charlotte was grocery shopping. (Tr. 276-277). Appellant removed her pants and his own pants. (Tr. 278-279). A.C. stated that appellant then vaginally raped her. (Tr. 279-280). She stated that it “hurt incredibly awful” and she asked him to stop but he did not. (Tr. 280-281). When it was over, appellant told A.C. not to tell anyone. (Tr. 282).\nA.C. went on to testify that appellant repeatedly raped her whenever she visited him. (Tr. 284-295). The abuse included vaginal and anal rape in addition to oral sex. (Tr. 295). A.C. testified she never told her mother about the abuse because she was scared. (Tr. 294, 299). She stated that she obeyed appellant because he was her dad. (Tr. 298-299). A.C. testified that the last time appellant raped her was on February 14, 2016, when she was 11 years old. (Tr. 306, 311). She remembered this day because it was the last time she visited appellant at Charlotte’s house. (Tr. 306).\n\nA.C. also testified that when she was ten years old, her mother had her see a counselor because she was cutting herself. (Tr. 312). A.C. stated that close to Christmas 2016, she finally disclosed to her school counselor that appellant had been raping her. (Tr. 317). She stated she was going to have to visit appellant over Christmas break and she was trying to put a stop to the abuse. (Tr. 317-318).\n\nA.C. additionally testified about appellant being transgender. She stated that she grew up with appellant being “trans” and that she loved him regardless of the fact that he wanted her to call him “Mom” or “Brittany.” (Tr. 324-325).\n\nA.C.’s mother, Tabitha, testified that after she and appellant broke up, A.C. visited with appellant every other weekend. (Tr. 375). A.C.’s visits with appellant continued until third or fourth grade. (Tr. 380). Tabitha noticed marks on A.C.’s arms and came to learn from A.C. that she was cutting herself. (Tr. 381-382). Tabitha also noticed that A.C. did not want to go to visit appellant. (Tr. 383). Tabitha took A.C. to counseling to deal with the cutting. (Tr. 384-385).\n\nTabitha stated that in December 2016, she received a call from the school counselor. (Tr. 386). She went to A.C.’s school and A.C. then disclosed to her that appellant had been raping her. (Tr. 386). She stated that thereafter she took A.C. for interviews and a checkup. (Tr. 387). Tabitha also stated that after her disclosure, A.C. learned appellant had been abusing G.B. too. (Tr. 390). She testified that A.C. blamed herself and thought that if she would have come forward sooner she would have been able to spare G.B. from appellant’s abuse. (Tr. 390).\n\nA.C.’s school counselor testified that on December 22, 2016, A.C. disclosed to her that appellant had been raping her since she was five. (Tr. 453-454). The counselor stated that A.C. was shaking and in tears and also confided that she was\nhaving suicidal thoughts. (Tr. 454). The counselor immediately contacted children’s services and Tabitha. (Tr. 455-456). She stated that Tabitha came right away and A.C. then disclosed to her what appellant had done. (Tr. 457).\n\n¶59 Retired Police Chief Chuck Hamilton investigated this matter. He interviewed appellant. Chief Hamilton informed appellant of the allegations A.C. had made. (Tr. 618). He asked appellant if he believed A.C. to be a truthful person. (Tr. 618). Appellant responded that she was. (Tr. 618). At no point did appellant call A.C. a liar. (Tr. 622). Chief Hamilton also spoke with A.C. She told the chief that appellant placed his penis in her vagina and that he did so whenever she visited him. (Tr. 627). She indicated that the last time this happened was in February 2016. (Tr. 627).\n\n¶60 Megan Dahlheimer is the pediatric nurse practitioner who examined A.C. Dahlheimer testified that it is very common for children to not report sexual abuse immediately. (Tr. 687-688). She stated that A.C.’s physical examination was normal, which is very common in a sexual abuse case. (Tr. 692). This is due in part because A.C.’s exam did not take place until almost a year after the last disclosed incident of abuse. (Tr. 692-693). Dahlheimer also stated that Tabitha had informed her that A.C. began menstruating at age seven. (Tr. 696). Dahlheimer testified that early onset of menstruation can be a sign of sexual abuse. (Tr. 696-697). Additionally, she stated that cutting is a red flag for abuse as is suicidal ideation, which A.C. disclosed to her. (Tr. 698). At the conclusion of her exam, Dahlheimer’s diagnosis was consistent for child sexual abuse. (Tr. 702).\n\n¶61 G.B. was nine when she testified. (Tr. 411). She testified that appellant touched her in a place he was not supposed to touch her. (Tr. 414). G.B. stated that it happened when her mom was at work. (Tr. 414). She said this occurred when she was in the first or second grade. (Tr. 415). She stated that this would occur on the couch in the living room. (Tr. 421-422). G.B. then elaborated and testified that appellant touched her “pee-pee” with his hands. (Tr. 417). She stated that she told him not to do that because her mom would get really mad but that he did it anyway. (Tr. 417). Appellant then told G.B. not to tell her mom. (Tr. 418). She also testified that appellant put his mouth on her “pee-pee.” (Tr. 428-429). G.B. stated that appellant also did these thing when she visited him (after he had moved out of Charlotte’s house). (Tr. 432-433). She\nthen finally disclosed to Jamie (her mom’s friend) and Charlotte (her mom) what appellant had been doing to her. (Tr. 431). G.B. also testified that she “didn’t even know [A.C.] was involved in this” until she heard her mom talking on the phone about the night before the trial. (Tr. 441-442).\n\n¶62 G.B. also testified that she had a scar on her side from appellant hitting her with a belt. (Tr. 418). And she testified that appellant would lock her in the basement. (Tr. 419).\n\n¶63 Charlotte testified that she began a relationship with appellant in 2010, when G.B. was a year old. (Tr. 516). Appellant moved in with her and the two had a son together in 2011. (Tr. 518). Charlotte stated that A.C. came and stayed with them every other weekend from the time she was five. (Tr. 522). She testified that appellant would care for the children while she was at work. (Tr. 523).\n\n¶64 After she and appellant broke up and appellant moved out, Charlotte’s girlfriend Jamie moved in with her. (Tr. 544). Charlotte testified that Jamie called her at work to tell her that G.B. had disclosed to her that appellant had been abusing her. (Tr. 543-544). Charlotte then asked G.B. what had happened and G.B. disclosed the abuse to her. (Tr. 545). Charlotte filed a police report. (Tr. 545). Charlotte stated that at the time G.B. disclosed to her what appellant had done she did not know about A.C.’s disclosure. (Tr. 547). She also testified that G.B. developed a problem with bedwetting when she was approximately four years old, which got better after her disclosure. (Tr. 553).\n\n¶65 Charlotte additionally testified regarding State’s Exhibit 2, a photograph of appellant naked. She stated that the photograph was an accurate depiction of appellant while he was taking hormones. (Tr. 550-551). She stated that appellant was taking hormones throughout the time they were living together. (Tr. 550).\n\n¶66 Scott Steele is a child forensic interviewer at Harmony House Children’s Advocacy Center. He interviewed G.B. She was seven at the time of the interview. (Tr. 578). The interview was played for the jury. (Tr. 574). Steele testified that G.B. was uncomfortable describing what appellant did to her. (Tr. 578-579). She was willing to circle areas on a picture of where appellant touched her. (Tr. 577-578). G.B. circled the genital area and the buttocks area. (Tr. 578). And when Steele asked her what appellant\nused to touch her private area, G.B. circled the mouth on the picture. (Tr. 583-584). She then indicated that appellant used his hand to touch her buttocks. (Tr. 584).\n\n¶67 Lauren Brown is another forensic interviewer who interviewed G.B. The video of her interview with G.B. was also played for the jury. (Tr. 644-645). During the interview, G.B. disclosed that appellant put his mouth on her vagina and put his finger on her vagina. (Tr. 646). Brown also prepared and submitted a report describing her findings. (Tr. 650).\n\n¶68 The evidence was overwhelming that appellant sexually abused both girls. Both A.C. and G.B. testified that appellant sexually abused them. And neither girl knew that the other had disclosed abuse. In other words, they disclosed abuse by appellant independently of each other. This bolstered each of their testimonies. Additionally, the nurse who examined A.C. testified that A.C.’s condition was consistent with sexual abuse. And both A.C.’s counselor and her mother corroborated her disclosure. Moreover, the jury viewed the videos of G.B.’s forensic interviews so they were able to view her demeanor as she disclosed the abuse to the interviewers.\n\n¶69 In sum, even if Spencer offered some expert opinions without submitting an expert report, any error was not plain error and was harmless even if an objection had been lodged in light of the substantial evidence against appellant."}

We will examine each allegation of ineffectiveness in turn.\n\nFirst, appellant argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge Juror C. as being biased in favor of the prosecution. He asserts his counsel should have challenged Juror C. for cause, or at least used a peremptory challenge to strike him from the jury. Instead, appellant asserts, counsel used his peremptory challenges on less-objectionable jurors. Appellant focuses on Juror C.’s statements that he tended to believe children over adults and he might not be able to follow the law if appellant did not testify.\n\nSecond, appellant argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Spencer’s expert testimony, which she offered without providing appellant with an expert report. He contends there was no strategic reason for his counsel to allow the jury to hear Spencer’s opinions when her testimony could have been precluded all together.\n\nThird, appellant argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to conduct voir dire examination of the jurors regarding any potential transgender bias. He points out that his transgender status was brought up throughout his trial. Appellant contends his counsel should have inquired during voir dire about the jurors’ attitudes towards transgender individuals. In support, he cites to various studies claiming that transgender individuals are discriminated against or harassed because they are transgender.\n\nFinally, appellant argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to request that State’s Exhibit 2 be cropped to exclude an irrelevant and inflammatory depiction of him during hormone therapy. A.C. testified that appellant did not have any pubic hair when he was abusing her. The state offered State’s Exhibit 2 to corroborate A.C.’s testimony on this point. State’s Exhibit 2 shows appellant completely naked, wearing makeup, with a women’s hairstyle, and breasts starting to develop from hormone therapy. Appellant argues his counsel should have argued for the photograph to have cropped to display only the area that was relevant to the state’s case, in other words, only his male genital area. He argues that for the jury to see him in his “gender fluidity” was prejudicial."}

Bowermaster claims that the prosecutor’s statements at sentencing were inflammatory and improperly influenced the trial court in imposing a fifty-seven month prison term, contrary to the jointly recommended sentence of five years of community control and ninety-days local jail time. Bowermaster maintains that the prosecutor’s conduct deprived him of his right to due process of law.\n\nProsecutor’s Statements at Issue\n\n¶8 After stating the jointly recommended sentence on the record at sentencing, which included a five year term of community control with ninety days of local jail time, a mental health assessment, 70 hours of community service, obtain a GED, forfeit all seized computers and cell phones, pay court costs, submit DNA, Tier I sex offender registration, and a suspended prison sentence totaling 57 months, the prosecutor stated the following, forming the basis of Bowermaster’s assignments of error on appeal:\nProsecutor: As the Court pointed out, and in the PSI, the motivation in this case was very clear that he was trolling. There was no other word for it. Even he gave the PSI writer what exact subject matter he was trolling for. Young girls. And so even though he was off paper less than forty eight hours, he was already trolling for young ladies, young girls. A thirty six year old man who has had a series of failed relationships with mature women, failed marriages, he obviously has an addiction, he has a problem, he can’t control himself. As for the result, even what really brought the State’s attention to this case, was the issue the fact that he was actually coming on to a little boy. The little boy basically called him out.\n\nDefense Counsel: I’m going to object Your Honor. This is out\n\nProsecutor: No, I can speak. I’ve stuck to my end.\n\nTrial Court: Once again we’re not bound by the rules of evidence at sentencing. You can certainly speak to whatever he’s going to say. I don’t know what that is.\n\nProsecutor: And I’ve stuck to my bargain. I’ve said to the Court what my recommendation is, and I stood by my recommendation. It doesn’t mean I can’t speak at sentencing. And basically what brought this case out was a search warrant which was given out in discovery. In the affidavit, what broke this case, was the fact that a young man, basically, called law enforcement and was based on that PC we executed the search warrant. In that case he was basically talking to a young boy who, at that time called him out. He called him, I think basically, you’re a pervert and he was gonna report him. That’s what brought law enforcement into the case, which we worked backwards, and that’s what executed the search warrant and the house search, which seized the computers and the phones. The computers were wiped clean, not the cell phones. The cell phones is where we found the pictures. Then in the PSI he pretty much told the PSI writer what he was doing. And, of course, as the Court pointed out in its opening dialogue, that was less than forty eight hours after he was released off paper on PRC, what he was doing, and that was trolling for young ladies. Your Honor, I think\nthat sums it up right there before the judge. The State did make it’s deal, the State will honor its recommendation. We put the recommendation before the Court. I ask the Court then to adopt that recommendation. Thank You.\n\n(Sept. 20, 2018 Sent. Hrg. at 7-10).\n\n{¶9} Initially we note that there was no agreement that the State would stand silent at sentencing. Moreover, we find there is no evidence in the record that the trial court relied on the prosecutor’s statements in imposing its sentence. To the contrary, the trial court specifically stated, in referring to the prosecutor’s statements about the alleged incident involving a young boy, “I’m not putting any importance in the matter that [the prosecutor] brought up. I just want to make a record on that. I’m not putting any credence from [sic] that. There is no evidence before me on that.” (Sept. 20, 2018 Sent. Hrg. at 22). With respect to the additional facts in the case discussed by the prosecutor at sentencing, the PSI which the trial court stated it relied upon at the sentencing hearing contained the same information.\n\n{¶10} As noted by the trial court, the PSI indicated that Bowermaster had previously been placed on community control for a prior incident involving convictions for Pandering Obscenity, Importuning, and Possession of Criminal Tools, all fifth degree felonies. Two years later while on community control, Bowermaster was sentenced to a three month prison term for violating the terms of his supervision. The PSI also revealed Bowermaster’s extensive criminal history, which included a 2008 conviction for Public Indecency and a 2016 Domestic\nViolence conviction, both of which resulted in Bowermaster serving jail time. The trial court further observed that Bowermaster committed the underlying offenses in the instant case less than forty-eight hours after being terminated from supervision."}

He first challenges J.S.’ credibility, arguing that when she was first hospitalized she did not disclose any allegations of sexual assault. It is not uncommon, however, for victims of abuse to delay their reporting. Here, J.S. testified that when she was a young child Mr. Berila would tell her not to tell anyone about the incidents and she would simply obey her step-father. As she grew older, however, she did not tell anyone because Mr. Berila showed her his gun and told her he would kill them all if she told anyone. When she was first hospitalized, the evidence showed that Mr. Berila was a constant presence at the hospital. J.S.’ mother recalled Mr. Berila being there “every possible second” for visiting hours. J.S.’ stipulated medical records further revealed specific notes from both a doctor and a nurse that Mr. Berila talked over J.S. and took over the doctor’s interview and had to be told not to lie in J.S.’ bed with his arm around her. It would not be unreasonable to presume that J.S. neglected to inform hospital staff of Mr. Berila’s sexual assaults in light of his overbearing and constant presence during her hospital stay. Mr. Berila also argues that J.S. did not recall revealing any sexual assault allegations during her second hospital stay. However, other evidence showed that J.S. did reveal the sexual assaults to hospital staff as well as her counselor, her boyfriend, and her grandmother. Mr. Berila further attempts to discredit J.S. by calling attention to evidence of her multiple hospitalizations, history of mental illness, suicide threats and attempts, use of marijuana, and association with drug dealers and drug users. But, J.S. testified as to frequent sexual assaults at the hands of her own step-father throughout an entire decade of her childhood, along with a pregnancy by her step-father and a forced abortion. Mental health issues and other difficulties in life are not to be unexpected when one is subjected to years of repeated sexual assaults as a child. The jury was made fully aware of J.S.’ issues, and was able to consider them when weighing her credibility."}

Gondor, 112 Ohio St.3d 377, 2006-Ohio-6679, ¶ 62. ‘There are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case. Even the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.’ Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689 (1984). Moreover, debatable trial tactics will not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Clayton, 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49 (1980). To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, one must establish that: (1) his counsel’s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. *Strickland* at 687. Counsel’s performance is deficient if it falls below an objective standard of reasonable representation. *State v. Bradley*, 42 Ohio St.3d 136 (1989), paragraph two of the syllabus. Prejudice can be shown by proving ‘there exists a reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel’s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.’ *Id.* at paragraph three of the syllabus. ‘[T]he Court need not address both *Strickland* prongs if an appellant fails to prove either one.’ *State v. Lortz*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 23762, 2008-Ohio-3108, ¶ 34.\n\nMr. Berila argues that his counsel should have called a forensic psychologist as a witness at trial on his behalf, due to J.S.’ history of mental health issues and hospitalizations. He notes that counsel presented no expert testimony at trial to rebut either J.S.’ testimony or the contents of her medical records. As a general rule, trial counsel’s decision not to call an expert witness will not establish ineffective assistance. *State v. Hanford*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 29204, 2019-Ohio-2987, ¶ 37. *See also State v. Coombs*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 03CA008262, 2004-Ohio-441, ¶ 26 (‘[T]he decision whether to call an expert witness is simply a matter of trial strategy.’); *State v. Spaulding*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 28526, 2018-Ohio-3663, ¶ 52 (‘[C]ounsel’s decision to rely on cross-examination instead of calling an expert witness to testify is not ineffective assistance.’). Moreover, when the trial record is silent regarding the substance of a potential expert’s testimony, establishing prejudice under *Strickland* requires proof outside of the record, and the claim is therefore not appropriately considered on direct appeal. *Hanford* at ¶ 37. Here, the record is silent as to what a forensic psychologist’s testimony may have been regarding J.S.’ mental health, so any arguments as to resulting prejudice are purely speculative. *See id.* We therefore find no merit in Mr. Berila’s ineffective assistance of counsel argument."}

Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91 (1978), paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\nIn executing a search warrant on Mr. Berila’s home, the police seized approximately 30,000 pictures. During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Mr. Berila if he ever received Officer Thompson’s message to come pick up his property, and Mr. Berila said he had not. Mr. Berila now claims that these pictures were exculpatory in nature, but he only states that they “[show him] with J.S. at family gatherings and vacations * * *.” He neglects to explain how these pictures are in any way exculpatory, i.e., they are favorable to him and would have led to an acquittal. See Whalen at ¶ 8 (defining “exculpatory evidence” as evidence favorable to the accused which, if disclosed and used effectively, may make the difference between conviction and\nacquittal). Mr. Berila has also failed to demonstrate how any of these pictures were suppressed by the prosecutor. See Jalowiec, at ¶ 31 (requiring the evidence to be suppressed by the prosecutor for a Brady violation). The pictures were seized from Mr. Berila’s home, and he, in turn, knew they existed and even described what they depicted; we therefore cannot say that the pictures were suppressed by the State in violation of Brady. See, e.g., State v. Ketterer, 126 Ohio St.3d 448, 2010-Ohio-3831, ¶ 53-54. The record further reveals that the police actively reached out to Mr. Berila to return his pictures to him. Mr. Berila simply failed to respond. He has failed to demonstrate any improper conduct on the part of the prosecutor denying him a fair trial. See Moreland at ¶ 22. Because Mr. Berila has failed to show any error, let alone plain error, his argument must fail."}

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY DENYING BOWEN’S MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE THAT POLICE OBTAINED IN VIOLATION OF HIS RIGHT AGAINST UNREASONABLE SEARCHES AND SEIZURES GUARANTEED BY THE FOURTH AMENDMENT TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND SECTION 14, ARTICLE I OF THE OHIO CONSTITUTION.", "extracted_text": "¶20 Bowen argues in his first Assignment of Error that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress. He states law enforcement had no constitutional basis to seize the Chevy Avalanche without a warrant. We disagree.\n\n¶21 Appellate review of a trial court's decision to deny a motion to suppress involves a mixed question of law and fact. State v. Long, 127 Ohio App.3d 328, 332, 713 N.E.2d 1 (4th Dist.1998). During a suppression hearing, the trial court assumes the role of trier of fact and, as such, is in the best position to resolve questions of fact and to evaluate witness credibility. State v. Brooks, 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 154, 661 N.E.2d 1030 (1996). A reviewing court is bound to accept the trial court's findings of fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. State v. Medcalf, 111 Ohio App.3d 142, 145, 675 N.E.2d 1268 (4th Dist.1996). Accepting these facts as true, the appellate court must independently determine as a matter of law, without deference to the trial court's conclusion, whether the trial court's decision meets the applicable legal standard. State v. Williams, 86 Ohio App.3d 37, 42, 619 N.E.2d 1141 (4th Dist.1993), overruled on other grounds.\n\nThere are three methods of challenging a trial court's ruling on a motion to suppress on appeal. First, an appellant may challenge the trial court's finding of fact. In reviewing a challenge of this nature, an appellate court must determine whether the trial court's findings of fact are against the manifest weight of the evidence. See State v. Fanning, 1 Ohio St.3d 19, 437 N.E.2d 583 (1982); State v. Klein, 73 Ohio App.3d 486, 597 N.E.2d 1141 (4th Dist.1991). Second, an appellant may argue the trial court failed to apply the appropriate test or correct law to the findings of fact. In that case, an appellate court can reverse the trial court for committing an error of law. See Williams, supra. Finally, an appellant may argue the trial court has incorrectly decided the ultimate or final issues raised in a motion to suppress. When reviewing this type of claim, an appellate court must independently determine, without deference to the trial court's conclusion, whether the facts meet the appropriate legal standard in any given case. State v. Curry, 95 Ohio App.3d 93, 96, 620 N.E.2d 906 (8th Dist.1994).\n\nThe Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 14, Article I, Ohio Constitution, prohibit the government from conducting unreasonable searches and seizures of persons or their property. See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); State v. Andrews, 57 Ohio St.3d 86, 87, 565 N.E.2d 1271 (1991).\n\nOn May 26, 2016, Det. Wilhite observed a Chevy Avalanche parked on Lindsay Street, in front of the residence of Ronald Brandon. Because of his investigation into Ronald Brandon, Det. Wilhite knew Bowen was an associate of Ronald Brandon. Det. Wilhite observed Bowen driving the Chevy Avalanche during the investigation. On May 26, 2016, while the search warrants were being executed as to the residences, Det. Wilhite requested Salsa, a trained narcotics dog, conduct a free air sniff of the Chevy Avalanche parked on Lindsay Street. The use of a trained narcotics dog to sniff an automobile does not constitute a “search” under the Fourth Amendment. *State v. Cook*, 5th Dist. Muskingum Nos. 2010-CA-40, 2010-CA-41, 2011-Ohio-1776, ¶ 56 citing *Illinois v. Caballes*, 543 U.S. 405, 125 S.Ct. 834, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005). Salsa alerted to the odor of drugs from the Chevy Avalanche. Based on Salsa’s alert to the odor of drugs from the Chevy Avalanche and that the truck was parked on a public roadway, Det. Wilhite had the truck towed to the Muskingum County Sheriff’s Office. Det. Wilhite obtained a search warrant to search the interior of the truck.\n\n{¶25} The trial court found the automobile exception to the search warrant requirement applied to the facts of the case. One of the exceptions to the warrant requirement is the automobile exception, which “allows police to conduct a warrantless search of a vehicle if there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband and exigent circumstances necessitate a search or seizure.” *State v. Perdue*, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 27499, 2017-Ohio-876, ¶ 23 quoting *State v. Mills*, 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 367, 582 N.E.2d 972 (1992), citing *Chambers v. Maroney*, 399 U.S. 42, 48, 90 S.Ct. 1975, 26 L.Ed.2d 419 (1970). (Other citation omitted.) The mobility of automobiles often creates exigent circumstance and is the traditional justification for this exception to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement. *California v. Carney*, 471 U.S. 386, 391, 105 S.Ct. 2066, 85 L.Ed.2d 406 (1985). “If a car is readily mobile and probable cause exists to believe that it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment thus permits police to search the vehicle without more.” *Pennsylvania v. Labron*, 518 U.S. 938, 940, 116 S.Ct. 2485, 135 L.Ed.2d 1031 (1996). A warrantless search is justified where there is imminent danger that evidence will be lost or destroyed if a search is not immediately conducted. *State v. Moore*, 90 Ohio St.3d 47, 734 N.E.2d 804 (2000), citing *Ker v. California*, 374 U.S. 23, 41-42, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726 (1963) (exigent circumstances justified the warrantless search of an apartment for drugs when officers feared destruction of evidence). “Because marijuana and other narcotics are easily and quickly hidden or destroyed, a warrantless search may be justified to preserve evidence.” *Moore* at 52; see *United States v. Gaitan-Acevedo*, 148 F.3d 577 (6th Cir.1998).\n\n{¶26} Bowen argues the State cannot rely upon the mobility of the Chevy Avalanche to support its argument for the application of the automobile exception because at the time of the seizure, the truck was parked on a public roadway. It has been held that “[t]he absence of a traffic stop does not prevent application of the automobile exception, as it does not detract from the automobile’s inherent mobility or affect the officer’s belief that the vehicle contains contraband.” *State v. Acoff*, 1st Dist. No. C-160867, 2017-Ohio-8182, 100 N.E.3d 87, ¶ 24 citing *State v. Bazrawi*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 12AP-1043, 2013-Ohio-3015, 2013 WL 3497638, ¶ 27. See *State v. Friedman*, 194 Ohio App.3d 677, 2011-Ohio-2989, 957 N.E.2d 815, ¶ 11 (9th Dist.) (the warrantless search of a parked vehicle alerted on by a police drug dog was permissible under the automobile exception because “no meaningful distinction” exists between a search conducted pursuant to a traffic stop and the search of a locked car parked in a public area).\n\n{¶27} In this case, Det. Wilhite requested a canine free air sniff of the Chevy Avalanche because it was parked in front of the residence of Ronald Brandon, the subject of a criminal investigation. Det. Wilhite knew Bowen drove the truck and was an associate of Ronald Brandon. The canine free air sniff of the parked Chevy Avalanche alerted Det. Wilhite to the presence of drugs. If a trained narcotics dog alerts to the odor of drugs from a lawfully stopped and detained vehicle, an officer has probable cause to search the vehicle for contraband. *State v. McCray*, 2nd Dist. Montgomery No. 26519, 2015-Ohio-3049, ¶ 17 citing *State v. Heard*, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19323, 2003-Ohio-1047, ¶ 17. Based on the alert from the trained narcotics dog, Det. Wilhite had probable cause to seize the truck based on the automobile exception. After the truck was seized, the task force obtained a search warrant to search the interior of the truck.\n\n{¶28} We do not find the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress.

{"index": "105-Craig", "allegation_num": "allegation_2", "allegation": "The prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence that the offense of money laundering as charged was committed in violation of the Ohio and United States Constitutions.", "extracted_text": "In his second assignment of error, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the state’s evidence with respect to his convictions for money laundering in violation of R.C. 1315.55(A)(3), which provides: ‘No person shall conduct or attempt to conduct a transaction with the purpose to promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on of corrupt activity.’ The term ‘corrupt activity’ is defined in R.C. 2923.31(I), and includes theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02. See State v. Searfoss, 2019-Ohio-4619, 135 N.E.3d 853, ¶ 78 (6th Dist.), citing R.C. 1315.51(B) and 2923.31(I)(2)(c).\n\nIn this case, appellant was convicted of three counts of money laundering relating to his purchase of real property in late 2012. The ‘corrupt activity’ alleged in this case related to thefts committed by appellant over the course of three transactions, including appellant’s October 11, 2012 payment of $3,000 to the Wood County Sheriff’s Department as a deposit toward the purchase of the real property, his December 19, 2012 withdrawal of $25,000 from PHCA’s Key Bank medical clinic account and subsequent deposit into an investment account owned by Koester, and his December 20, 2012 payment of $13,000 to the Wood County Sheriff’s Department to pay for the remaining balance on the real property.\n\nAppellant’s sufficiency argument regarding the foregoing money laundering counts is two-fold. First, appellant contends that the state failed to introduce evidence to prove that he committed any thefts. In our resolution of appellant’s first assignment of error, we rejected this argument and found that the state’s evidence concerning appellant’s use of PHCA funds to purchase the investment properties from the Wood County Sheriff’s Department was sufficient to establish aggravated theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02(A)(2). Therefore, we need not revisit this argument.\n\nSecond, appellant argues that the state failed to introduce sufficient evidence to prove that he conducted the transactions culminating in the purchase of the investment properties with the purpose to promote, manage, establish, or carry on corrupt activity. Relying upon our decision in Searfoss, supra, and the cases cited therein, appellant asserts that ‘the State improperly sought to turn Ohio’s money laundering statute into a ‘money-spending’ statute because the State thought Mr. Craig’s expenditures on behalf of PHCA seemed odd or curious.’\n\nIn response, the state argues that this case is distinguishable from Searfoss insofar as the defendant in that case merely used the proceeds of his thefts to purchase real estate for his personal use, whereas appellant used stolen funds to purchase investment properties in an attempt to generate further income that would appear to be lawfully obtained.\n\nIn Searfoss, we addressed a sufficiency argument raised by a defendant, Robert Searfoss, who was convicted on several counts of money laundering, two of which fell under R.C. 1315.55(A)(3), the same statutory section at issue in the present case. In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence as to those two counts on appeal, Searfoss argued that his purchase of a single family residence for his family with stolen funds did not promote further theft in any way, and thus did not support the promotion element of the money laundering statute. Searfoss, 2019-Ohio-4619, 135 N.E.3d 853, at ¶ 79.\n\nRelying upon precedent from federal courts construing the promotion element of the federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. 1956(a)(1)(A)(i), we agreed with Searfoss and found that there was ‘no support for the state’s suggestion that [Searfoss] purchased the Perrysburg residence with the purpose to promote corrupt activity.’ Id. at ¶ 84. We went on to find that Searfoss’s purchase of the residence occurred after the theft offense was already completed, and thus did not promote ongoing theft. Id. We found that the money laundering charge was ‘based merely upon appellant’s expenditure of the stolen Trust funds,’ and noted that ‘[t]he act of transacting money alone does not amount to money laundering.’” Id. at ¶ 85, quoting State v. Pugh, 9th Dist. Summit No. 24905, 2010-Ohio-2741, ¶ 13.\n\nHaving set forth the salient points from our decision in Searfoss, we now turn to the application of those points to the case sub judice. Like Searfoss, this case involves theft-related charges of money laundering under R.C. 1315.55(A)(3). For its part, the state invites us to rely upon the difference in the type of real estate purchased – a family residence in Searfoss versus investment properties used to generate further income in this case – as a reason for distinguishing Searfoss and finding that its evidence was sufficient to establish the promotion element of R.C. 1315.55(A)(3). We have considered the state’s argument, but find it unavailing.\n\nIn Searfoss, we did not rely upon, or even draw, a distinction between real estate used as a family dwelling and real estate used as investment property. Instead, we focused on the distinction between real estate used for legitimate, lawful means (i.e. as a family dwelling) and real estate used to further the corrupt activity (i.e. theft). Id. at ¶ 85. Prosecution in the former case amounts to ‘turning the money laundering statute into a money spending statute.’” Id. at ¶ 86, quoting United States v. Brown, 186 F.3d 661, 670 (5th Cir.1999).\n\nSimilar to Searfoss, this case involves the purchase of real estate with previously stolen funds, and subsequent use of that real estate for lawful ends, namely the generation of rental income. The state has not established, or even alleged, that the rental income generated from the transactions at issue here was somehow used by appellant to further pilfer money from PHCA or carry on appellant’s corrupt activity, nor has the state introduced any evidence to prove that appellant intended to use the real estate to promote further unlawful activity. Therefore, the state has not met its burden with respect to the promotion element of R.C. 1315.55(A)(3). See United States v. Olaniyi-Oke, 199 F.3d 767 (5th Cir.1999) (overturning a federal money laundering conviction, where the government introduced no evidence to demonstrate that the defendant intended to use computers purchased with stolen funds to promote further unlawful activity).\n\nIn short, the state’s evidence is insufficient to support the money laundering counts in this case for the same reason it failed in Searfoss: appellant cannot be convicted for money laundering under R.C. 1315.55(A)(3) for simply spending stolen funds to purchase real property for his own use, where such use does not ‘promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate the promotion, management, establishment, or carrying on of corrupt activity.’ R.C. 1315.55(A)(3). Accordingly, appellant’s second assignment of error is well-taken, and his convictions for money laundering must be vacated."}

As already noted, the term ‘corrupt activity’ is defined in R.C. 2923.31(I), and includes theft in violation of R.C. 2913.02.\n\n2923.31(I)(2)(c).\n\nIn challenging the sufficiency of the state’s evidence concerning the charge of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, appellant contends that the state failed to introduce any evidence to establish (1) the existence of any corrupt activity, and alternatively (2) that more than one incident of corrupt activity occurred.\n\nIn support of his first argument, appellant refers to the seven incidents of theft-related corrupt activity contained in the indictment and argues that the state failed to introduce sufficient evidence to establish those theft offenses for the reasons articulated in his first assignment of error. We have already found that the state’s evidence was sufficient to support appellant’s conviction for aggravated theft in our resolution of appellant’s first assignment of error. Therefore, we reject appellant’s contention that the state failed to introduce evidence to establish the existence of any corrupt activity.\n\nNext, we turn to appellant’s assertion that the record contains no evidence to establish more than one incident of corrupt activity. In his brief, appellant asserts, without elaboration, that the individual incidents of theft making up the charge of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity in the indictment ‘combine to form one incident.’ In essence, appellant’s argument attacks the sufficiency of the state’s evidence on the pattern element of R.C. 2923.32(A)(1).8\n\nR.C. 2923.31(E) defines ‘pattern of corrupt activity’ as ‘two or more incidents of corrupt activity * * * that are related to the affairs of the same enterprise, are not isolated, and are not so closely related to each other and connected in time and place that they constitute a single event.’\n\nIn the indictment, the state lists several incidents of theft that occurred over a three-year period from August 1, 2012, to December 31, 2015. In total, the state alleged that appellant, acting in association with Koester, stole $238,360.31 from PHCA while he was treasurer of the organization. During the five-day jury trial in this matter, the state introduced extensive evidence to support its allegations of the individual incidents of theft set forth in the indictment.\n\nSpecifically, the state introduced testimony from Kinder, who tracked the flow of money into and out of PHCA’s accounts and Koester’s accounts over the relevant time period, and determined that a total of $238,360.31 in unaccounted funds were missing from PHCA’s accounts. During his testimony, Kinder tracked individual transfers and withdrawals made by appellant from PHCA accounts, and was careful to exclude from his total calculation any transactions that he could not identify as illegitimate. Further, the state’s trial witnesses testified to appellant’s unauthorized withdrawal of funds out of PHCA’s bank accounts on multiple occasions, and his subsequent use of those funds to purchase real estate that was held by Koester in her name. The state’s evidence also demonstrates that appellant used PHCA funds to purchase ViSalus products without Board authorization, and then deposited the proceeds from the sales of those products into Koester’s accounts. Once removed, the funds were never redeposited into PHCA’s accounts.\n\nUpon our consideration of the entire record in this case, we find that the foregoing evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the state, established that appellant committed multiple theft offenses over a span of several years and utilized more than one scheme to do so. We find that this evidence demonstrates that appellant’s theft offenses were not isolated, and were not so closely related to each other and connected in time and place that they constitute a single event. Thus, we reject appellant’s argument that these thefts combine to form one incident of corrupt activity."}

He essentially argues that the State’s witnesses, especially White, are not credible, and without their testimony, no evidence exists that he had any involvement or knowledge of what happened to TJ. Whether a conviction is supported by sufficient evidence is a question of law that we review de novo. In making this determination, we must determine whether the evidence adduced at the trial, if believed, reasonably could support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The standard of review is whether, after viewing the probative evidence and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. In determining whether a criminal conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, an appellate court must review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed. The weight and credibility of evidence are to be determined by the trier of fact. A trier of fact is free to believe all, part or none of the testimony of any witness who appears before it. Questions of witness credibility are irrelevant to the issue of whether there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction, however. In determining whether a conviction is based on sufficient evidence, we do not address whether the evidence is to be believed, but whether, if believed, the evidence against defendant would support a conviction. White’s testimony, if believed, is sufficient to support appellant’s murder conviction. White testified that TJ was in her and the appellant’s care prior to his death. White further testified that appellant extensively abused both her and TJ, and withheld food and drink from TJ. Based on this evidence, a jury could reasonably conclude that appellant’s actions, inactions, and manipulative and abusive control of White and TJ caused the death of TJ through abuse, neglect, and malnourishment. Thus, appellant’s murder conviction is indeed supported by sufficient evidence. Appellant argues that his remaining convictions for aggravated murder, child endangering, tampering with evidence, and gross abuse of a corpse are against the manifest weight of the evidence because of the “credibility issues” of the witnesses – particularly White. He argues that the witnesses’ credibility has been destroyed due to their personal and criminal histories - and in the case of White, her incredible explanation of events that “def[ies] explanation” - and thus could not be relied upon by the jury. However, a conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence simply because the jury believed the prosecution testimony. As the trier of fact, the jury was free to believe or disbelieve all, part, or none of the testimony of the witnesses presented at trial. The jury apparently believed all or part of White’s testimony that appellant perpetrated abuse and neglect against TJ that ultimately resulted in his death; and they were free to do so. They also apparently believed the testimony of the State’s other witnesses whose testimony bolstered and corroborated much of the evidence presented through White. The jury was able to observe the witnesses on the witness stand, and was in the best position to judge and weigh the credibility of the witnesses. Put simply, the jury had before it sufficient facts to ascertain the witnesses’ credibility and to weigh it accordingly, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the jury. After a thorough review of the record, we cannot say that this is an exceptional case where the evidence weighs heavily in favor of appellant and where it is clear that the jury lost its way or created a manifest miscarriage of justice."}

{"index": "105-Hunt", "allegation_num": "allegation_5", "allegation": "Appellant’s Counsel was ineffective for (a) failing to object to improper opinion testimony, (b) failing to request a proper jury instruction on co-defendant testimony, (c) failing to object to prior bad acts evidence, and (d) failing to object to the prosecutor’s improper comments during closing.", "extracted_text": "Appellant first contends that his trial counsel acted deficiently because he failed to object to the opinion testimony of the coroner, Dr. Lehman, or to the admission of Lehman’s autopsy report. Appellant notes that attached to the autopsy report is a report from Dr. Elizabeth Murray, a forensic anthropologist consulted by Dr. Lehman. Dr. Murray did not testify at trial, and Murray’s report includes a questionnaire that was circulated to a number of unnamed colleagues. The answers provided by these unnamed colleagues were attached to the autopsy report and allowed to be seen by the jury. Appellant submits that his trial counsel was ineffective because he should have (1) objected to the opinion testimony of Dr. Lehman as it was based on the opinions of numerous other individuals, and (2) objected to the admission of the autopsy report due to inadmissible hearsay. We conclude that appellant’s trial counsel did not perform deficiently when it failed to object to Dr. Lehman’s testimony or to the admission of the autopsy report. ‘[A]n autopsy report [prepared by a nontestifying medical examiner] that is neither prepared for the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual nor prepared for the primary purpose of providing evidence in a criminal trial is nontestimonial, and its admission into evidence at trial under Evid.R. 803(6) as a business record does not violate a defendant’s Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.’ State v. Maxwell, 139 Ohio St.3d 12, 2014-Ohio-1019, 9 N.E.3d 930, ¶ 63; see also State v. Adams, 146 Ohio St.3d 232, 2016-Ohio-3043, 54 N.E.3d 1227, ¶ 4. Furthermore, additional reports used as aids to help the coroner determine the cause of death and that are neither prepared for the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual or prepared for the primary purpose of providing evidence in a criminal trial are nontestimonial and admissible into evidence at trial. State v. Crane, 2014-Ohio-3657, 17 N.E.3d 1252, ¶ 51 (12th Dist.). Finally, because the reports are admissible, Dr. Lehman’s testimony about the contents of the reports and his ultimate opinion are also admissible and do not violate appellant’s constitutional rights. Adams at ¶ 6, citing Maxwell at ¶¶ 51-52. Based on this precedent, we hold that the failure to challenge Dr. Lehman’s testimony or the admissibility of the autopsy report was not ineffective representation, because any such challenge would have failed as a matter of law. Next, appellant asserts that his trial counsel’s failure to request the jury instruction set forth in R.C. 2923.03(D), and his failure to object to its omission in the court’s charge amounts to ineffective assistance. We disagree. Because we found in appellant’s fourth assignment of error that the court’s failure to give the jury instruction provided for in R.C. 2923.03(D) does not rise to the level of plain error, we find that counsel’s failure to request the same instruction fails to meet the prejudice prong of the Strickland test. Accordingly, we do not find that appellant’s counsel was ineffective in this regard. Accord State v. Johnson, 4th Dist. Vinton No. 06CA650, 2007-Ohio-2176, ¶ 53; State v. West, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 12CA3507, 2014-Ohio-1941, ¶ 20. Appellant’s third claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is based upon his trial counsel’s failure to object to prior bad acts evidence presented by the State. Specifically, appellant claims that his counsel should have objected to White’s testimony that appellant regularly beat and choked her, and abused the other two children under his care. We initially note that appellant’s claim that the State failed to file a notice of intention to use other acts evidence is inaccurate. In fact, the State filed such notice on August 30, 2017; revealing that it intended to introduce evidence of other acts such as drug abuse and a pattern of abusive behavior towards children. ‘A trial court has broad discretion in the admission or exclusion of evidence, and so long as such discretion is exercised in line with the rules of procedure and evidence, its judgment will not be reversed absent a clear showing of an abuse of discretion with attendant material prejudice to defendant.’ State v. Dunham, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 04CA2931, 2005-Ohio-3642, ¶ 28. Evid.R. 404(B) states ‘[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.’ However, such evidence ‘may * * * be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.’ Id. ‘Thus, while evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts committed by the accused is not admissible to show that the accused has a propensity to commit crimes, it may be relevant to show: motive, intent, absence of a mistake or accident, or a scheme, plan, or system in committing the act in question.’ Dunham at ¶ 29, citing State v. Broom, 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 533 N.E.2d 682 (1988), paragraph one of the syllabus. ‘When other acts evidence is relevant for one of those limited purposes, the court may properly admit it, even though the evidence may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the accused.’ Id., citing R.C. 2945.59. Here, the State introduced the evidence to show motive, scheme, planning, and knowledge as it pertained to appellant’s participation in the offenses charged in the indictment. Therefore, the evidence was admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) and R.C. 2945.59; and trial counsel did not act deficiently by failing to object to its admission under these rules. Appellant contends that even if the evidence is relevant, his trial counsel still provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to its admission under Evid.R. 403 because the testimony was unduly prejudicial. Evid.R. 403(A) states, ‘Although relevant, evidence is not admissible if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.’ Here, White testified, inter alia, that appellant would choke her until she passed out, and that he would ‘fold’ up their child Noah until his oxygen supply would be cut-off and he would turn blue. She also testified that appellant would beat her for hours on end. While this testimony is certainly disturbing, it is also highly relevant for the reasons previously discussed. Hence, we find that the probative value of the bad acts testimony outweighs any prejudice to appellant. Therefore, his trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the testimony on the basis of Evid.R. 403. Lastly, appellant contends that his trial counsel’s failure to object to the alleged improper remarks of the prosecutor during rebuttal closing argument deprived him of his right to the effective assistance of counsel. However, in resolving appellant’s sixth assignment of error, we determined that the prosecutor’s remarks during closing arguments were not improper. Accordingly, because the remarks were not improper, his trial counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to object to the remarks."}

The trial court denied the motion at the commencement of trial, with the caveat that if it became necessary as the evidence was presented, it would reconsider the motion. Ultimately, the issue of a jury view was never revisited.\n\nThe purpose of a jury view of the property is not evidentiary but rather to give the jury a chance to apply the evidence offered at trial.

Taylor, 4th Dist. Adams No. 95CA601, 1996 WL 205593, *2 (Apr. 24, 1996). As discussed above, the term \"abuse of discretion\" implies that the trial court’s ruling was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Id.\n\n\"There are no particular requirements as to when the trial court should grant a jury view.\" Id. However, R.C. 2945.16 states:\n\nWhen it is proper for the jurors to have a view of the place at which a material fact occurred, the trial court may order them to be conducted in a body, under the charge of the sheriff or other officer, to such place, which shall be shown to them by a person designated by the court. * * *\n\n\"Thus, the facts of each case determine whether the court abused its discretion.\" Taylor at *2.\n\nHere, there is nothing in the record to support appellant’s assertion that the trial court acted unreasonably, unconscionably, or arbitrarily in denying the jury view. At trial, several photographs of 1522 Mabert Road, where TJ’s body was located, were presented to the jury and admitted as evidence. Moreover, photographs of the remains of TJ’s body as they were\nfound under the tabletop at 1522 Mabert Road were presented and admitted. Even a photograph of the area behind 1524 Mabert Road, where the cooler was located, was presented to the jury and admitted as evidence. Appellant did not question at trial whether the photographs were accurate representations of the properties, and did not renew its request to view the residences. Furthermore, the witnesses described the scene during the trial. Given these facts, we believe that the trial court’s decision to deny a jury view was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.

To succeed on a claim of ineffectiveness, a defendant must satisfy a two-prong test. Initially, a defendant must show that trial counsel acted incompetently. See, *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668. In assessing such claims, “a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action ‘might be considered sound trial strategy.’ ” *Id.* at 689, citing *Michel v. Louisiana*, 350 U.S. 91, 101, 76 S.Ct. 158 (1955). “There are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case. Even the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.” *Strickland*, 466 U.S. at 689. The question is whether counsel acted “outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.” *Id.* at 690.\n\nEven if a defendant shows that counsel was incompetent, the defendant must then satisfy the second prong of the *Strickland* test. Under this “actual prejudice” prong, the defendant must show that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” *Strickland*, 466 U.S. at 694.\nAppellant challenges defense trial counsel’s decision to introduce the prior convictions upon direct examination, a decision we find to be trial strategy. Counsel may have attempted to blunt the impact of the prior convictions upon cross-examination. State v. Adkins, 5th Dist. Morrow No. CA-906, 2002-Ohio-3942, ¶ 27. While the trial strategy was ultimately not successful and the tactics were debatable, we find they do not form a basis for ineffective assistance of counsel. Id.\n\nIn the instant case, we find appellant has demonstrated neither ineffectiveness by counsel nor resulting prejudice. Appellant does not suggest what counsel should have done differently, other than request a limiting instruction. The record contains extensive discussion of a limiting instruction (T. 214-217) and as noted supra, the trial court did give a limiting instruction regarding appellant’s prior convictions."}

The prosecution is responsible for disclosing not only what is in the prosecutor's case file, but any information known to the prosecutor or any investigating officers or members of the prosecution team. “[T]he individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government's behalf in the case, including the police.” *Kyles*, 514 U.S. at 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). However, no *Brady* violation occurs when the undisclosed evidence is cumulative to evidence already known by the defense at the time of trial. *See State v. Cook*, 1st Dist.

Frazier*, 142 Ohio App.3d 718, 721, 756 N.E.2d 1258 (9th Dist.2001).\n\n¶ 44 On appeal, Buehner argues the trial court ignored credible evidence in order to reach the conclusion that he failed to establish a *Brady* violation. Buehner contends the evidence presented at the *Brady* hearing unquestionably demonstrates that the state failed to disclose relevant and favorable evidence to the defense team prior to trial, including (1) the police statements made by Anderson, Jenkins, Tierra, and Mason; (2) information relating to Det. Garisek's involvement in the investigation; and (3) the identification of a potential third suspect. Thus, Buehner asserts that viewing the material exculpatory evidence together, and in conjunction with ‘the weakness of the [s]tate of Ohio's case against [him],’ ‘there is no plausible way the trial court could properly reach the conclusion that [his] constitutional rights were not violated.’\n\n¶ 45 In contrast, the state maintains that the record conclusively establishes that it did not suppress the oral statements made by Anderson, Jenkins, Tierra, or Antoine. The state contends that the testimony presented at the *Brady* hearing demonstrated that (1) these individuals were named in the witness list, (2) the subject statements were provided to the prosecutor's office, (3) the statements were within the state's file, and (4) it was the prosecutor's common practice to read each statement contained in the case file to the defense during the discovery process. With respect to Mason and information relating to Sonny, the state suggests that based on the questions posed by the defense team during the underlying trial, it can logically be inferred that information regarding Sonny and the black truck registered to Mason were disclosed to the defense team during pretrial proceedings.\nThe state further asserts that the allegedly exculpatory evidence was not material in light of the overwhelming evidence supporting Buehner's guilt. The state notes that codefendant Price, who is a white male, admitted his involvement in the shooting and provided a detailed accounting of the events as they unfolded. In addition, Edwards, an eyewitness to the shooting and the preceding events, consistently identified Buehner as the shooter throughout the pretrial and trial process.\n\nBefore addressing the foregoing arguments, we preliminarily reject Buehner's unfounded and repeated assertions that the trial court arbitrarily reached a \"predetermined outcome\" prior to assessing the testimony presented at the Brady hearing. As exhibited by the thoroughness of the trial court's decision, it is evident the trial court diligently considered the arguments posed by the parties, carefully weighed the credibility of the witnesses, and provided Buehner with a full and fair opportunity to litigate his motion for new trial. Although this court departs from several of the conclusions reached by the trial court, the record refutes all allegations of bias levied against the court during the pendency of this case.\n\nWe now turn to the merits of Buehner's Brady claims. For the purposes of this appeal, our inquiry will focus exclusively on the allegedly undisclosed statements of Anderson, Jenkins, and Mason. As discussed further below, Buehner has repeatedly challenged the credibility of evidence placing him at the scene on the night of the shooting. In our view, the statements provided by Anderson, Jenkins, and Mason are directly relevant to the contested issue of identity, including specific information regarding the race, gender, and description of the alleged shooter, as well as information relating to the truck used to facilitate the crime. The remaining evidence disputed at the Brady hearing, while relevant, required speculation about other potential leads or otherwise did not dispositively address the issue of identity.3\n\nConsistent with our prior holding in Buehner II, we find the statements made by Anderson and Jenkins during the early stages of the police investigation were exculpatory. As discussed, evidence is exculpatory when it is \"favorable to an accused.\" Brady, 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). In this case, there has been much debate regarding the race of the individuals inside the black truck at the time of the shooting. In addition, the defense has suggested that the gun used to fatally shoot Saunders was fired from the driver's seat of the vehicle, a position alleged to have been occupied by Price.\n\nIn this regard, the statements of Anderson and Jenkins provided essential information regarding the descriptions of the perpetrators and the location of the shooter inside the black truck. If believed, Anderson's statement suggests that a black male was responsible for Saunders's death. Buehner II, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106319, 2018-Ohio-4432, at ¶ 26. Similarly, Jenkins's statement, if believed, suggests that the individuals sitting in the middle and passenger seats of the black truck were black males. In addition, Jenkins's testimony expressed that the white male sitting in the driver's seat of the black truck was the person responsible for shooting Saunders. Such information would undoubtedly been favorable to Buehner and his efforts to discredit the state's witnesses while corroborating his own alibi.\n\nWe recognize that the statements provided by Anderson, Jenkins, and Tierra varied from each other in certain aspects. We are also aware that Price, a white male, accepted responsibility for his role in the events. Significantly, however, the statements provided by Anderson and Jenkins do not place a gun in the hands of a white male sitting in the middle passenger's seat of the black truck. The statements were inconsistent with, and in some instances contradictory to, the testimony presented by the state's primary witnesses, Price and Edwards. Under these circumstances, we find Anderson's and Jenkins's statements constituted exculpatory evidence that should have been produced during the discovery process.\n\nWe further find the information set forth in the statement provided by Mason was favorable evidence that should have been disclosed to the defense team. Throughout these proceedings, there has been much debate regarding the identity of the third perpetrator and the make, model, and ownership of the black truck used during the shooting. Edwards testified that the truck was a \"black, GMC small body pickup,\" whereas Price testified that the truck was a \"regular-sized\" Dodge Ram pickup. (Trial tr. 476, 635.). Locating and analyzing the truck was certainly important to the investigation because it may have provided a direct link to the perpetrators. Although Det. Hasan testified that the detectives discovered a truck believed to be involved in the shooting, the trial prosecutor confirmed that the prosecution could not confirm the identity of the truck used in the incident. (Tr. 209-210.)\nHere, Mason expressed in her statement to detectives that Edwards “confronted” her about a 1993 black GMC pickup truck that was registered under her name because the truck “looked exactly like the one used when [Saunders] was killed.” He also informed Mason that “he saw the black truck immediately after the shooting with [Sonny] and Victor inside.” The record reflects that in response to Mason's statement, the detectives interviewed Edwards and confronted him about Mason's truck and Sonny's potential involvement in the shooting. In a statement, dated July 24, 2001, Edwards expressed to the detectives that Sonny “was not the black male inside the black colored truck that night and had no involvement in this case.” (Defendant's exhibit Y.) Edwards conceded that Sonny did have a truck similar to the one used in the shooting but that Sonny's truck was in worse condition.\n\nThe state suggests that Mason's statement was not exculpatory because Edwards later clarified that Sonny and the black GMC pickup truck were not involved in the shooting. We disagree. Viewing Mason's statement in its entirety, a reasonable person could conclude that Edwards confronted Mason because he believed her vehicle was used in the shooting death of Saunders. Edwards's use of the phrase, “the black truck,” when referring to the vehicle he observed Sonny inside “immediately” after the shooting is relevant. In addition, Mason indicated that the confrontation caused her to believe that the black GMC pickup truck was the vehicle “involved in [Saunders]'s homicide.” At the very least, Mason's statement could be used to impeach Edwards's July 24, 2001 statement and his testimony at trial that Sonny was not the third, unidentified male inside the truck on the night of the shooting. For these reasons, trial counsel 1 testified that had he known of Mason's existence and her statement to police that Robert “Sonny” Allen was a potential suspect in Saunders's death, he would have subpoenaed her to testify at trial. (Tr. 128.)\n\nHaving determined that the foregoing statements contained favorable information to the defense, we now turn to the highly contested issue of whether these statements were disclosed during the closed discovery process utilized in 2001.\n\nIn addressing this issue, we begin by acknowledging the professionalism of the attorneys involved in Buehner's prosecution and defense, as well as the credibility of these witnesses to the extent their testimony relied on their memory and common practices. Unfortunately, however, the passage of time, the defense team's inability to locate their case file, and the nature of the discovery process used at the time of pretrial discovery in this case has created an untenable situation where the trial court was left to rely on speculative statements and accounts of what the trial prosecutor and trial counsel 1 believed they would have done under normal circumstances. During the Brady hearing, both the trial prosecutor and trial counsel 1 demonstrated, albeit justifiably, the inability to have specific recollections of critical issues. For instance, the trial prosecutor did not dispute that he had no specific recollections concerning the disclosure of the statements provided by Anderson, Jenkins, and Mason. (Tr. 183-184, 226-227, 272-273.) He stated:\n\nQ: You also don't have any specific recollection of the day that any of those reports would have been read to anyone?\n\nA: No, I don't have a specific recollection, no I don't. No. (New trial tr. 273.) In turn, the state demonstrated that trial counsel 1 could not specifically recall other aspects of the case, including specific testimony and evidence presented at trial, the basis of specific questions posed on cross-examination, or the information that prompted him to file additional discovery requests. (Tr. 130-131, 142-144.)\n\nDespite their faded memories, however, the trial prosecutor maintains that he had no reason to believe he would not have disclosed the statements pursuant to his common practice of meticulously reading each statement to counsel; while trial counsel 1 emphatically claims that he would have utilized these statements in his defense had they been disclosed because they directly addressed contested issues concerning the identity of the shooter. (Tr. 124-131.)\n\nWithout questioning the truthfulness of the testimony presented at trial, or the good faith efforts pursued by all parties during the discovery process, it is imperative to focus on the objective, verifiable information in the record. As this court stated in Buehner II, there is no dispute that the state indicated in its discovery requests that ‘[n]o exculpatory material [wa]s available to or in the possession of the prosecuting attorney.’ Buehner II, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106319, 2018-Ohio-4432, at ¶ 23. It is equally uncontested that trial counsel 1 subsequently filed motions requesting the statements of all persons who were believed to have information regarding the shooting, including Anderson and Jenkins. At the Brady hearing, trial counsel 1 did not recall receiving a response to this discovery request, but confirmed that he ‘never received from the state of Ohio any exculpatory evidence.’ (Tr. 121-122.) Trial counsel 1 further explained\nthat he only filed the additional discovery requests for specific exculpatory evidence in order to ‘lock [the state] into’ its initial response ‘on the file that indicate[d] that there [wa]s no exculpatory evidence.’ (Tr. 122.)\n\n¶ 59 In its written opinion, the trial court determined that trial counsel 1’s motion for specific exculpatory information, marked defendant's exhibit R, contained language that ‘infers knowledge of the information from Jenkins and Tierra’ through discovery. In support of its position, the trial court cited a paragraph from the motion, which states, in relevant part:\n\nBased on pre-trial disclosures by the state of Ohio and investigation by the defense it was discovered that a number of persons were arrested and interviewed within 48 hours of the shooting. Also, statements were allegedly made suggesting that Randy Price was present and the perpetrator of the offense. In addition, witnesses supposedly made observations about persons in the car.\n\n¶ 60 When confronted with the statement contained in the discovery motion, trial counsel 1 indicated that the motion was referring to information drawn from the known statements made by Price and Edwards. (Tr. 151-153.) More significantly, however, the nature of the request demonstrates, without speculating, that the defense team had not yet been provided with any specific statements regarding other potential eyewitnesses as of the time of the filing. At the very most, the motion demonstrated that the defense learned that individuals listed on the state witness list may have made statements helpful to the defense through their own independent investigation, but the content of those statements were not disclosed by the state. Trial counsel 1 explained that if he had information relating to favorable statements from a specific witness, he would have listed that person by name in the motion. (Tr. 155.) Under these circumstances, we cannot join the trial court's conclusion that the language contained in the discovery motion illustrated the state's disclosure of relevant statements.\n\n¶ 61 We acknowledge that Anderson and Jenkins were named in the witness list disclosed to the defense team. However, this did not relieve the state of its obligation to disclose their exculpatory statements particularly where, as here, those statements were specifically requested during the discovery phase of trial. See State v. Johnston, 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 61, 529 N.E.2d 898 (1988), fn. 22. Trial counsel 1 explained that because the state indicated ‘on numerous occasions’ that there was no exculpatory evidence, he had no reasonable expectation that any witnesses had made exculpatory statements. (Tr. 130.) And, unlike Anderson and Jenkins, the state concedes that Mason was not listed on the witness list provided during discovery. (Tr. 183.) As such, trial counsel 1 testified that he was completely unaware of Mason's existence as a witness and, therefore, could not have reviewed her statement or contacted her prior to Buehner's trial. (Tr. 126.)\n\n¶ 62 Consistent with our prior decision, we reiterate that the objective facts in this record support the conclusion that ‘Buehner had no knowledge of the exculpatory information contained in the undisclosed police reports. Nor did he have any reason to believe that the police reports contained improperly suppressed exculpatory evidence because the state represented that no exculpatory evidence existed.’ Buehner II, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106319, 2018-Ohio-4432, at ¶ 30. Deferring to the need to uphold the constitutional protections afforded to criminal defendants and in the absence of specific recollections or documentary evidence to establish clear disclosures, we decline to reject Buehner's Brady claims based on the state's reliance on probabilities or assumptions. Accordingly, we find competent, credible evidence supports a finding that the state failed to disclose to the defense exculpatory evidence contained in Anderson, Jenkins, and Mason's statements. We, therefore, find that the trial court erred in concluding that no exculpatory evidence was withheld from Buehner in advance of his trial."}

Napue, 360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959).\n\n¶ 73 Where a prosecutor knowingly uses perjured testimony, or fails to correct what he subsequently learns was perjury, the falsehood is deemed material for Brady purposes ‘if there is any reasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.’\n\n¶ 74 To establish a Napue claim, a defendant must show that (1) testimony was false, (2) the testimony was material, and (3) the prosecution knew it was false. Coe v. Bell, 161 F.3d 320, 343 (6th Cir. 1998). ‘The burden is on the defendants to show that the testimony was actually perjured, and mere inconsistencies in testimony by government witnesses do not establish knowing use of false testimony.’ Id. See also State v. Iacona, 93 Ohio St.3d 83, 97, 752 N.E.2d 937 (2001).

In this case, Edwards testified at trial that even though he was on probation for drug trafficking at the time of Saunders's murder, he was also selling crack cocaine at that time. Buehner asserts that because Edwards was never found in violation of his probation and was never charged with new drug charges even though Edwards told police he was selling drugs at the time of the shooting, the state must have known he would offer false testimony at Buehner's trial.\n\n¶ 76 However, there is no evidence establishing that Edwards offered perjured testimony or that the prosecutors knew he would offer perjured testimony. Here, Edwards was thoroughly cross-examined about his extensive involvement in drug trafficking and his prior and pending criminal cases. Although there were issues that affected Edward's credibility as a state's witness, including his criminal history, there is no indication that Edwards provided false testimony merely because he admitted to engaging in illegal activities with Saunders on the night of the shooting. Therefore, Buehner has failed to establish a Napue claim.\n\n¶ 77 The sixth assignment of error is overruled."}

State v. Dean, 146 Ohio St.3d 106, 2015-Ohio-4347, 54 N.E.3d 80, ¶ 151, citing State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997).

Murphy, 4th Dist. Ross No. 07CA2953, 2008-Ohio-1744, ¶ 31. ‘Because the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses and is particularly competent to decide “whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses,” we must afford substantial deference to its determinations of credibility.’ Barberton v.

State v. Picklesimer, 4th Dist. Pickaway No. 11CA9, 2012-Ohio-1282, ¶ 24; accord State v. Howard, 4th Dist.

Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983); e.g., Wilks at ¶ 168. If the prosecution presented substantial credible evidence upon which the trier of fact reasonably could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the essential elements of the offense had been established, the judgment of conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. E.g., State v. Eley, 56 Ohio St.3d 169, 383 N.E.2d 132 (1978), syllabus, superseded by state constitutional amendment on other grounds in State v. Smith, 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 684 N.E.2d 668 (1997).

R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c) provides:\n\nNo person shall engage in sexual conduct with another who is not the spouse of the offender or who is the spouse of the offender but is living separate and apart from the offender, when any of the following applies:\n\n* * * *\n\n(c) The other person’s ability to resist or consent is substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of advanced age, and the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the other person’s ability to resist or consent is substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of advanced age.\n\nR.C. 2907.03(A)(2) states as follows:\n\nNo person shall engage in sexual conduct with another, not the spouse of the offender, when any of the following apply:\n\n* * * *\n\n(2) The offender knows that the other person’s ability to appraise the nature of or control the other person’s own conduct is substantially impaired.\nHere, the only element appellant seemingly disputes is whether C.B. was ‘substantially impaired.’ We limit our review accordingly.\n\n¶ 50 In State v. Canterbury, 4th Dist. Athens No. 13CA34, 2015-Ohio-1926, 2015 WL 2452024 we discussed the meaning of ‘substantial impairment’:\n\n‘The phrase ‘substantial impairment’ is not defined in R.C. 2907.02, nor has the Ohio Supreme Court provided any definition.’ State v. Keeley, [4th Dist. Washington No. 11CA5, 2012-Ohio-3564] at ¶ 16; citing State v. Daniels, Summit No. 25808, 2011–Ohio–6414, ¶ 6. However, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated, in regards to a sexual battery charge against a youth victim alleged to have an impairment due to alleged mental retardation, as follows:\n\n‘The phrase ‘substantially impaired,’ in that it is not defined in the Ohio Criminal Code, must be given the meaning generally understood in common usage. As cogently stated by the appellate court, substantial impairment must be established by demonstrating a present reduction, diminution or decrease in the victim’s ability, either to appraise the nature of his conduct or to control his conduct.’ State v. Zeh, 31 Ohio St.3d 99, 103–104, 509 N.E.2d 414 (1987).\n\n* * * *\n\nFurther, ‘whether a person is substantially impaired ‘does not have to be proven by expert medical testimony; rather, it can be shown to exist by the testimony of people who have interacted with the victim, and by allowing the trier of fact to do its own assessment of the person’s ability to appraise or control his or her conduct.’’ State v. Lasenby, 3rd Dist. Allen No. 1–13–36, 2014–Ohio–1878, ¶ 27; quoting State v. Brady, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87854, 2007–Ohio–1453, ¶ 78; State v. Brown, 3rd Dist. Marion No. 9–09–15, 2009–Ohio–5428, ¶ 21. Thus, the determination of substantial impairment is made ‘on a case-by-case basis, providing great deference to the fact-finder.’ Lasenby at ¶ 27; citing Brown at ¶ 22.\n\nAdditionally, voluntary intoxication or impairment is included in the terms ‘mental or physical condition’ as used in R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c). Lasenby at ¶ 28; citing State v. Harmath, 3rd Dist. Seneca No. 13–06–20, 2007–Ohio–2993, ¶ 14; see also State v. Boden, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26623, 2013–Ohio–4260, ¶ 20; State v. Cedeno, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98500, 2013–Ohio–821, ¶ 20. Further, courts have held that ‘[t]he consumption of large amounts of alcohol in a short period of time is evidence that voluntary intoxication caused substantial impairment.’ Lasenby at ¶ 28; citing State v. Hatten, 186 Ohio App.3d 286, 2010–Ohio–499, ¶ 22 (2nd Dist.); see also State v. Lindsay, 3rd Dist. Logan No. 8–06–24, 2007–Ohio–4490, ¶ 20.\n\nId. at ¶¶ 57-59.\nIn the case sub judice, after our review we believe that the state presented substantial, competent and credible evidence that allowed the fact-finder to find that C.B. was substantially impaired at the time appellant committed the offense. Every witness who interacted with C.B. during the night of the incident testified that C.B. was drunk. Even appellant admitted that C.B. ‘was pretty wasted.’ Not one person stated that C.B. appeared sober and in control of her faculties. Moreover, every witness testified that C.B. consumed at least six to eight alcoholic beverages over the course of a four- to six-hour period. *Lasenby* at ¶ 28 (stating that consuming large quantity of alcohol in short time period evidence of substantial impairment); *State v. Kuck*, 2nd Dist. No. 2015-CA-13, 2016-Ohio-8512, 79 N.E.3d 1164, 2016 WL 7493691, ¶ 95 (concluding that substantial impairment established when evidence showed victim ‘consumed at least ten alcoholic drinks’). Additionally, C.B. stated that she ‘passed out.’ *Hatten* at ¶ 24 (noting that passing out indicative of substantial impairment). Thus, substantial evidence was adduced at trial to show that C.B. experienced a ‘reduction, diminution or decrease in [her] ability, either to appraise the nature of [her] conduct or to control [her] conduct.’ *Zeh*, 31 Ohio St.3d at 103–104.\n\nAppellant nevertheless asserts that the following actions illustrate that C.B. had an ability to appraise the nature of her conduct and to control her conduct: (1) she asked Grey to drive her to appellant’s residence, (2) C.B. voluntarily chose to enter appellant’s bedroom to rest, and (3) C.B. became aware that appellant was on top of her and feigned sleep. We believe, however, that appellant’s argument is unpersuasive. Even though C.B. may have displayed some awareness, this does not mean that she had not experienced a ‘reduction, diminution or decrease’ in her abilities to appraise the nature of, or control, her conduct. *Zeh*, 31 Ohio St.3d at 103–104; see State v. Bentz, 2017-Ohio-5483, 93 N.E.3d 358 (3rd Dist.), ¶ 105 (rejecting defendant’s argument that weight of the evidence showed that victim was ‘not substantially impaired because she was able to ambulate out of [defendant]’s bedroom, to [a] vehicle, and to the police department without assistance’).\n\n¶ 53 We observe that appellant does not challenge whether the weight of the evidence shows the remaining elements of rape and sexual battery. Therefore, we do not address them in any detail. Instead, we point out that substantial competent and credible evidence shows that appellant engaged in sexual conduct with C.B. and that he knew C.B. was substantially impaired. Appellant admitted to the investigator that he and C.B. had sexual intercourse. He also admitted that C.B. appeared ‘pretty wasted.’ Consequently, based upon our review of the record, we cannot conclude that the fact-finder clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice by finding appellant guilty of rape and sexual battery.\n\n¶ 54 Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant’s fourth assignment of error."}

Whitfield, 124 Ohio St.3d 319, 2010-Ohio-2, 922 N.E.2d 182, ¶ 12; accord State v. Williams, 148 Ohio St.3d 403, 2016-Ohio-7658, 71 N.E.3d 234, ¶ 17. Consequently, “R.C. 2941.25(A)’s mandate that a defendant may be ‘convicted’ of only one allied offense is a protection against multiple sentences rather than multiple convictions.” Whitfield at ¶ 18. Accordingly, “once the sentencing court decides that the offender has been found guilty of allied offenses of similar import that are subject to merger, R.C. 2941.25 prohibits the imposition of multiple sentences.” Williams at ¶ 19 (citation omitted). The sentencing court thus has a mandatory duty to merge allied offenses. Williams at ¶ 27. “[I]mposing separate sentences for allied offenses of similar import is contrary to law and such sentences are void.” Id. at ¶ 2. Therefore, “a judgment of sentence is void * * * when the trial court determines that multiple counts should be merged but then proceeds to impose separate sentences in disregard of its own ruling.” State ex rel. Cowan v. Gallagher, 153 Ohio St.3d 13, 2018-Ohio-1463, 100 N.E.3d 407, ¶ 19, citing Williams at ¶ 28–29.\n\nIn Williams, for example, the court determined that the trial court’s imposition of concurrent sentences for allied offenses rendered the sentence void. The court determined that “the imposition of concurrent sentences is not the equivalent of merging allied offenses.” Id. at ¶ 3. The court explained:\nIt therefore follows that when a trial court concludes that an accused has in fact been found guilty of allied offenses of similar import, it cannot impose a separate sentence for each offense. Rather, the court has a mandatory duty to merge the allied offenses by imposing a single sentence, and the imposition of separate sentences for those offenses—even if imposed concurrently—is contrary to law because of the mandate of R.C. 2941.25(A). In the absence of a statutory remedy, those sentences are void.\n\n*Id.* at ¶ 28.\n\n{¶ 59} Rather than remanding, the court “modif[ed] the [appellate court’s] judgment * * * to vacate the sentences” that the trial court improperly imposed for the allied offenses. *Id.* at ¶¶ 3 and 33. The court explained that a remand for resentencing is not always necessary when a trial court possesses a mandatory duty to merge allied offenses and impose a single sentence. *Id.* at ¶ 31. Instead, if the record indicates which offense the state elected to pursue at sentencing, then a reviewing court may invoke its authority to modify the lower court’s judgment. *Id.*\n\n{¶ 60} In the case at bar, the trial court found that the rape and sexual battery offenses constituted allied offenses of similar import. Moreover, the state elected to proceed to sentencing on the rape offense. The trial court, despite its finding that the offenses were allied, imposed separate sentences for each offenses—four years for rape and thirty months for sexual battery. Although the court then attempted to merge the two sentences, according to the *Williams* court a court cannot impose separate sentences for both counts.\n\n{¶ 61} We therefore exercise our authority to modify the trial court’s judgment and vacate the separate sentence that the trial court imposed for sexual battery. The remaining four-year prison sentence for rape and the court’s finding of guilt for the sexual battery offense remain intact. *Whitfield*, paragraph three of the syllabus (observing that “the determination of the\ndefendant’s guilt for committing allied offenses remains intact, both before and after the merger of allied offenses for sentencing”).\n\n¶ 62 Accordingly, based upon the foregoing reasons, we sustain appellant’s fifth assignment of error and modify the trial court’s judgment so as to vacate the imposition of a thirty-month prison term for the sexual battery offense.

However, because prior false accusations of rape do not constitute ‘sexual activity’ of the victim, the rape shield law does not exclude such evidence. The defense bears the burden to demonstrate that the accusations were totally false and unfounded. The Boggs court also held that before cross-examination of a rape victim as to prior false rape accusations may proceed, the trial court shall hold an in camera hearing to ascertain whether such testimony involves sexual activity and thus is inadmissible under R.C. 2907.02(D), or is totally unfounded and admissible for impeachment of the victim. In the instant case, the state made an oral motion at a pretrial hearing to preclude anticipated testimony that the ‘defense is going to try to elicit’ from M.T. regarding ‘two prior incidents that were reported.’ The following colloquy took place: THE STATE: There was a prior incident on July 27, 2005 that was unsubstantiated with regards to our victim and her brother. There was no police investigation with regards to this matter. And then there is an incident with a neighbor across the street that no one did investigate that was mentioned in the defendant’s statement and the victim was asked about it with the detective after the defendant’s statement was made. THE COURT: These are prior allegations — the defense claims that the complaining witness made prior false claims? THE STATE: He didn’t say that they were false. I’m just saying that he’s trying to elicit that testimony with cross and that’s protected under the rape shield. There’s no evidence that they are false allegations and there’s no Boggs motion filed. THE COURT: Okay. [Defense counsel], you intend to produce this type of testimony? DEFENSE COUNSEL: Well, the first one she was talking about from 2005 is the JFS(^2) records, so it was part of a JFS investigation. Just asking about the records, Your Honor. Not the witness themselves and not the victim herself. THE COURT: What do you intend to ask? DEFENSE COUNSEL: Just what JFS did as far as their investigation went. (^2) Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services. THE COURT: Of a different incident? DEFENSE COUNSEL: No, that incident from 2005. JFS, in their records — THE COURT: Involving a different individual, different perpetrator? DEFENSE COUNSEL: Yes. THE COURT: How is it relevant and not violative of rape shield? DEFENSE COUNSEL: The victim wasn’t the complainer. THE COURT: I find that to be not relevant. You won’t be able to examine on that because it will probably violate rape shield protections. DEFENSE COUNSEL: The second one was disclosed during the interview with the detective, and the victim — it sounded like the victim considered it a consensual act and I just want to ask — THE COURT: Consensual with whom? DEFENSE COUNSEL: Another individual, a different perpetrator. THE COURT: Well, again, consensual sex with a different individual is exactly what the rape shield is designed to protect. § 82 On appeal, Dandridge argues that ‘following Boggs, there is not enough evidence in this record to establish that the trial court erred by prohibiting the defense from engaging in cross-examination on these topics. The convictions should be vacated and the matter should be reversed and remanded to make these necessary determinations.’ Upon review, we find that the court acted within its discretion by prohibiting defense counsel from questioning M.T. about these incidents. The trial court did not invoke the rape shield law concerning the first incident. According to the record, M.T. was not the ‘complainer’ of the 2005 incident, and the court found that this incident was irrelevant to whether Dandridge sexually abused M.T. in the case at hand. We find no error here. As to the second incident concerning the neighbor, it does not appear that Dandridge is arguing that M.T. made a false allegation of sexual activity. As noted in Boggs, 63 Ohio St.3d 418, 588 N.E.2d 813, the defendant has the burden to show that the victim’s prior allegation was false, and in this case not only did Dandridge fail to meet the burden, he failed to proffer the evidence or make the argument. We note that, on appeal, Dandridge still does not assert that either of the two incidents involved M.T. making false allegations. There is nothing in the record that would alert the trial court to hold a Boggs in camera hearing, and we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion. Accordingly, Dandridge’s second assignment of error is overruled."}

Reversing a conviction under a manifest weight theory ‘should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.’ *State v.

Dandridge argues that he ‘was restricting [M.T.’s] boyfriend from being in the car and was\nquestioning the source of the $10,000 [M.T.’s boyfriend] had.’ Dandridge further argues that ‘[a]fter making the accusations at school, [M.T.] avoided the police repeatedly. She only pursued her accusations when [her boyfriend] accompanied her. It is plausible that [M.T.] felt she had to pursue the allegations because she did not know how to stop the investigation without getting into trouble herself.’\n\nDandridge’s arguments are not supported by the record. As addressed earlier, M.T.’s testimony alone is sufficient to support Dandridge’s convictions, and whether her testimony was credible was in the hands of the jury. She was subject to cross-examination, and defense counsel questioned her credibility. Dandridge testified in his own defense, and the jury found his testimony lacked credibility. J.H. also testified, and it was apparent that she was concerned about incriminating herself and Dandridge. This also weighed in favor of Dandridge’s convictions.\n\nUpon review, we cannot say that this is an exceptional case where the jury lost its way in resolving inconsistencies and conflicts in the evidence presented. This court affords great deference to the jury’s determination of witness credibility. State v. DeHass, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 231, 227 N.E.2d 212 (1967).

He doesn’t even know what that place is, where according to the victim’s mother, they did go there; they all know what that is.\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court has held that a ‘prosecutor’s reference to [the defendant] as a sociopath or psychopath was a fair inference based on the evidence’ presented at trial. ‘Prosecutors are entitled to latitude as to what the evidence has shown and what inferences can be drawn therefrom.’ State v.

The alleged mischaracterization is so subtle that we will let Dandridge’s brief speak for itself:\n\nIn the state’s final close, the prosecutor misstated [J.H.’s] testimony by claiming it corroborated [M.T.’s] version of events. In particular, the state said [J.H.] confirmed that ‘[M.T.] did walk in on us. I told her to leave. He told her to stay.’ In fact, what [J.H.] actually said was that [Dandridge] told her to stay because they weren’t engaging in any sexual activity at the time. ([Dandridge] told her to stay because they weren’t doing anything.) Although [J.H.’s] testimony contradicted, rather than corroborated [M.T.’s] testimony, there was no defense objection.\n\nA review of King’s testimony reflects that these statements are misleading and inaccurate.\n\nThe State then twice mischaracterized King’s testimony by claiming to the jury she had reported [Dandridge] saying, ‘I’m sorry. I made a mistake. My behavior was bad. I’ll leave. I thought she was okay. A year ago I was going to leave.’ *** A review of King’s testimony reflects that these statements are misleading and inaccurate.\n\nUpon review, we disagree with Dandridge’s assertion that the prosecutor mischaracterized J.H.’s and King’s testimony. The prosecutor’s closing remarks reiterated the substance of these two witnesses’ testimony. Given the latitude prosecutors are entitled to in closing arguments, we do not find that the isolated comments were improper, let alone that they denied Dandridge a fair trial.

Redding*, 3d Dist Union No. 14-19-01, 2019-Ohio-5302, ¶ 19 (“A single punch, standing alone, may not constitute deadly force.”), quoting *State v. Jeffers*, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2007-L-011, 2008-Ohio-1894, ¶ 81; *State v. Davis*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 17AP-438, 2018-Ohio-58, ¶ 25 (“A single punch with a fist is ordinarily considered use of non-deadly force.”).\ngreater than that reasonably necessary to defend against the imminent use of unlawful force.”). There is no duty to retreat to avoid the danger in cases involving the use of nondeadly force, even if retreat is possible. *Welms* at ¶ 19; *Chavez* at ¶ 40.\n\nUnder former R.C. 2901.05(A), the defendant had the burden of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence. Former R.C. 2901.05(A) stated:\n\nEvery person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, for an affirmative defense, is upon the accused.\n\nEffective March 28, 2019, Ohio’s self-defense law was changed to require the state to prove that a defendant did not act in self-defense where the defense could reasonably be found apply. 3 R.C. 2901.05(A), as amended, states, in relevant part:\n\nEvery person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of the offense is upon the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the evidence of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other than self-defense * * * as described in division (B)(1) of this section, is upon the accused.)\n\n(Emphasis added.) R.C. 2901.05(B)(1) further states:\n\nA person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence. If, at the trial of a person who is accused of\n\n---\n\n3 In this case, although the incident occurred prior to the effective date of the amended statute, the trial occurred after the effective date. The parties agree that the amended version of the statute applies.\nan offense that involved the person’s use of force against another, there is evidence presented that tends to support that the accused person used the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused person did not use the force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person’s residence, as the case may be.\n\nThus, if evidence is presented at trial that tends to support that a defendant used nondeadly force in self-defense, the state must now prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not use that force in self-defense. In other words, the state must disprove at least one of the elements of the use of nondeadly force in self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt, i.e., the state must prove that (1) the defendant was at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray in which the force was used or (2) the defendant did not have reasonable grounds to believe or an honest belief that he or she was in imminent danger of bodily harm or (3) the defendant used more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against the imminent danger of bodily harm. See, e.g., State v. Carney, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 19AP-402, 2020-Ohio-2691, ¶ 31; State v. Nestingen, 5th Dist. Richland No. 2019 CA 110, 2020-Ohio-2965, ¶ 17.\n\nThe state has no obligation to disprove all possible affirmative defenses a defendant may claim applies. The state need not disprove an affirmative defense unless evidence is presented that is sufficient to raise that defense. ‘A bare assertion by the defendant that he acted in self-defense will not bring the affirmative defense of self-defense into issue in the trial.’ State v. Gideons, 52 Ohio App.2d 70, 73, 368 N.E.2d 67 (8th Dist.1977). ‘Coupled with such an assertion must be\nsupporting evidence from whatever source introduced of a nature and quality sufficient to raise the defense and which \"if believed, would under the legal tests applied to a claim of self-defense permit a reasonable doubt as to guilt.\" Gideons at 73, quoting State v. Robinson, 47 Ohio St.2d 103, 113, 351 N.E.2d 88 (1976).\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary defines ‘tend’ as ‘[t]o be disposed toward (something),’ ‘[t]o serve, contribute, or conducive in some degree or way, to have a more or less direct bearing or effect’ and ‘[t]o be directed or have a tendency to (an end, object, or purpose).’ Black's Law Dictionary 1696 (10th Ed.2014).\n\nThus, evidence ‘tends to support’ that a defendant used force in self-defense, and a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on the defense of self-defense under R.C. 2901.05, as amended, where the evidence in the record is sufficient to raise a question of reasonable doubt of guilt, based on a claim of self-defense, in the mind of a reasonable juror. See, e.g., State v. Tolle, 4th Dist. Adams No. 19CA1095, 2020-Ohio-935, ¶ 23-24 (Evidence is sufficient to support a self-defense jury instruction under R.C. 2901.05, as amended, ‘where a reasonable doubt of guilt has arisen based upon [the affirmative defense].’ * * * In order for evidence [to] ‘tend[]’ to support an affirmative defense, it must be sufficient to raise a question in the mind of a reasonable juror.”), quoting State v. Melchior, 56 Ohio St.2d 15, 20, 381 N.E.2d 195 (1978); see also State v. Sullivan, 11th Dist. Lake Nos. 2019-L-143 and 2019-L-144, 2020-Ohio-1439, ¶ 33-34, 45 (“When a defendant’s testimony, if believed, would have raised the question of self-defense in the mind of\na reasonable juror, the defendant’s burden of production has been met.”). If the evidence presented ‘generates only a mere speculation or possible doubt, such evidence is insufficient to raise the affirmative defense, and submission of the issue to the jury will be unwarranted.’ Tolle at ¶23, quoting Melchior at 20.\n\nThe record reflects that, prior to denying Jacinto’s request for a jury instruction on self-defense, the trial court carefully considered whether a self-defense jury instruction was appropriate, including eliciting and considering the arguments of counsel, analyzing applicable legal authority and re-reviewing the relevant testimony, the surveillance video footage and the recordings of Jacinto’s statements to police. The trial court ultimately denied Jacinto’s request for a jury instruction on self-defense because it found that no evidence had been presented that Jacinto felt that ‘his physical wellbeing was in any way, shape or form in danger’ when he struck Lee.\n\nBased on the record before us, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion or otherwise erred in denying Jacinto’s request for a self-defense jury instruction. Tolle at ¶26-32 (where the evidence presented was insufficient to create a question in the minds of reasonable jurors regarding whether defendant was ‘not at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray,’ trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s request for a self-defense instruction under R.C. 2901.05(B)(1), as amended). Even assuming a reasonable juror could find that Jacinto was not at fault in creating the situation that gave rise to the altercation, no evidence was presented that ‘tended to support’ that Jacinto\nbelieved he was in imminent danger of bodily harm prior to striking Lee or from which a rational juror could reasonably infer that Jacinto believed he was in imminent danger of bodily harm prior striking Lee.\n\nNo evidence was presented that Lee struck, pushed or physically threatened Jacinto in any way or used any physically threatening, ‘fighting’ words prior to Jacinto punching Lee. Although Contreras testified that Lee ‘poked’ Jacinto in the chest, he indicated that the ‘poking’ occurred approximately ten minutes before Jacinto punched Lee. Contreras testified that after the poking, the situation deescalated. The surveillance video confirms this.\n\nJacinto did not testify at trial. In his police interviews, Jacinto told police that Lee ‘tapped’ or ‘poked’ him in the chest repeatedly, but indicated that he at no point he felt threatened by, or feared he might be physically harmed in any way by, Lee. According to his statements to police, Jacinto punched Lee because they were both ‘drunken idiots’ and Jacinto was aggravated, annoyed or frustrated by his conversation with Lee and the fact Lee was ‘getting in [his] face’ about it.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the record in this case, we find that there was insufficient evidence to warrant a jury instruction on self-defense. There is no evidence from which a jury might reasonably conclude that Jacinto had a bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger of bodily harm. \\textit{Cf. State v. Arnett}, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 95-A-0005, 1995 Ohio App. LEXIS 3294, 3-4 (August 11, 1995) (insufficient evidence to warrant a jury instruction on self-defense where victim did not strike, push or threaten defendant and defendant testified that he struck victim\nbecause victim accused him of something he did not do and poked his finger in defendant’s face).

Jacinto contends that because it is a “universal truth” that “[d]runk people tell tall tales,” his “drunken[ ] boasting about his skills” could not be considered “evidence” that Jacinto knew his punch could cause serious physical harm to Lee.\n\nSimply because an individual made statements while intoxicated does not mean those statements cannot be believed and used to support a conviction. Cf. State v. Melton, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103341, 2016-Ohio-1227, ¶ 7 (intoxication “bears upon” a witness’ credibility, but it does not render a witness’ testimony “per se incredible”). Although Jacinto told police after the incident that he was simply “boasting” when he told others he was an MMA fighter and that, in fact, he did not “even know how to fight,” Contreras testified that he had an extended conversation with Jacinto regarding their training histories and experience with fighting. Accordingly, the jury could have reasonably determined that Jacinto had fighting experience and knew what he was doing when he struck Lee in the jaw.\n\nEven if, however, Jacinto had had no fighting experience, it would not preclude a rational jury from finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Lee knowingly caused Lee serious physical harm.\nAlthough Jacinto may not have specifically intended to cause Lee any serious physical harm — much less the catastrophic injuries Lee ultimately sustained — and although Jacinto may not have known that his punch would cause the particular injuries Lee sustained, “neither [Jacinto’s] purpose nor his lack of knowledge that his act would cause the precise injury [Lee] suffered are the relevant inquires when examining the evidence required to establish the knowingly element.” State v. Murphy, 9th Dist. Summit No. 24753, 2010-Ohio-1038, ¶ 20.\n\nTo have acted “knowingly,” a person need not have specifically intended to cause a particular result. “A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature.” R.C. 2901.22(B). In other words, a defendant acts knowingly when, although not necessarily intending a particular result, he or she is aware that the result will probably occur.\n\nIf a result is a probable consequence of a voluntary act, the actor “will be held to have acted knowingly to achieve it” because a person “is charged by the law with knowledge of the reasonable and probable consequences of his [or her] own acts.” State v. Dixon, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 82951, 2004-Ohio-2406, ¶ 16, quoting State v. McDaniel, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 16221, 1998 Ohio App. LEXIS 2039, 16 (May 1, 1998); see also State v. McCurdy, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 13AP-321, 2013-Ohio-5710, ¶ 16 (“[F]elonious assault under R.C. 2903.11, combined with the definition of “knowingly” found in R.C. 2901.22(B), does not require that a defendant intended to cause “serious physical harm,” but rather, that\nthe defendant acted with an awareness that the conduct probably would cause such harm.”) (emphasis deleted), quoting State v. Smith, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 04Ap-726, 2005-Ohio-1765, ¶ 28. “Stated another way, when a defendant voluntarily acts in a manner that is likely to cause serious physical injury, the factfinder can infer that the defendant was aware that his actions would cause whatever injury results from his actions, or, in other words, that he acted knowingly.” State v. Reed, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 89137, 2008-Ohio-312, ¶ 10. “To be actionable it is only necessary that the result is within the natural and logical scope of risk created by the conduct.” State v.

The defendant need not have known that his or her actions would cause the precise injury sustained by the victim. See, e.g., State v. Perez, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 91227, 2009-Ohio-959, ¶ 42, citing Dixon at ¶ 24; see also Hampton at ¶ 13 (“A person need not foresee the precise consequences of criminal conduct.”).\n\nAbsent an admission, whether a defendant acted “knowingly” must be determined “from all the surrounding facts and circumstances, including the doing of the act itself.” Dixon at ¶ 16, quoting State v. Huff, 145 Ohio App.3d 555, 563, 763 N.E.2d 695 (1st Dist.2001).\n\nJacinto argues that there was insufficient evidence that he knowingly caused Lee serious physical harm because it was “not reasonable to believe,” under the circumstances, that a single punch would cause “serious physical harm.” We disagree.\n“Serious physical harm,” as defined in R.C. 2901.01(A)(5), is very broad and includes any of the following:\n\n(a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment;\n\n(b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death;\n\n(c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity;\n\n(d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement;\n\n(e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.\n\nLoss of consciousness, “irrespective of its duration,” has been found to constitute severe physical harm under R.C. 2901.01(A)(5)(c). Watson, 2018-Ohio-4964, ¶ 11, quoting State v. Sales, 9th Dist. Summit No. 25036, 2011-Ohio-2505, ¶ 19.\n\nIn support of his argument that the evidence did not demonstrate he knowingly caused Lee serious physical harm, Jacinto cites State v. McCleod, 7th Dist. Jefferson No. 00 JE 8, 2001-Ohio-3480, and State v. McFadden, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 95APA03-384, 1995 Ohio App. LEXIS 5144 (Nov. 21, 1995). In McFadden, the defendant was convicted of felonious assault after throwing one “blind-side punch” to the right side of the victim’s head. Id. at 4, 12. The defendant and the victim were of “similar size and body weight” and the defendant lacked any “boxing or fighting experience.” Id. at 11. The court indicated that, under the circumstances of that case, while it was “reasonable to assume that a person would\nexpect one punch to cause physical harm to another person,” it could not be said that “a reasonably prudent person would have been aware that the throwing of one punch had the propensity to cause serious physical harm to another person.” *Id.* at 11-12. Accordingly, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant of felonious assault. *Id.*\n\n{¶ 106} In *McCleod*, the Seventh District held that the trial court’s failure to instruct the jury on assault warranted a reversal of the defendant’s conviction for felonious assault. 2001-Ohio-3480 at ¶ 1, 57. In that case, the defendant had “sucker-punched” and possibly kicked his victim. The court held that a reasonable jury could have acquitted the defendant of felonious assault because it was “not clear” that he was aware that one punch and possibly a kick “would certainly or likely result in the type of serious injury which occurred.” *Id.* at ¶ 45. That is not the issue in this case. In this case, the trial court instructed the jury both on felonious assault and assault.\n\n{¶ 107} In numerous other cases, this court and others have held that a single punch to the head or face can support a conviction for felonious assault even in the absence of evidence that the defendant had fighting or boxing experience or was “more physically imposing” than the victim. *See, e.g.*, *Watson*, 2018-Ohio-4964, at ¶ 16 (affirming felonious assault conviction where defendant struck the victim “with a strong closed fist punch to the side of his head” with enough force “that it knocked [the victim] to the ground, left him unconscious for an extended period of time, and damaged his skull and brain”); *State v. Eisenman*, 10th Dist.\nFranklin No. 17AP-475, 2018-Ohio-934, ¶ 11-12 (affirming felonious assault conviction where defendant punched the victim once in the head with sufficient force to “knock [the victim] out immediately”); Hampton, 2016-Ohio-5321, at ¶ 2, 14, 24, 27-28 (evidence of a single, forceful intentional punch to the head could support the inference that defendant knowingly caused serious physical harm); State v. Westfall, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 10CA009825, 2011-Ohio-5011, ¶ 2, 10 (single punch to the victim’s face was sufficient to support felonious assault conviction); State v. Shepherd, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2003-A-0028, 2006-Ohio-4315, ¶ 28 (one punch to the face with sufficient force to crack two of the victim’s teeth was sufficient to support a conviction for felonious assault); see also State v. Redman, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-15-54, 2016-Ohio-860, ¶ 22 (“Punching someone in the face satisfies the requisite culpable mental state for felonious assault.”), quoting State v. Beaver, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-13-15, 2014-Ohio-4995, ¶ 37; State v. Vanover, 4th Dist. Lawrence No. 98CA38, 1999 Ohio App. LEXIS 2357, 14-15 (May 16, 1999) (“[T]he mere act of punching someone in the head area carries with it the risk of causing serious physical harm. * * * Serious physical harm is unquestionably a natural and logical consequence of punching, without warning or provocation, an intoxicated person whose faculties are likely impaired.”).\n\n¶ 108 As explained above, the determination of whether a defendant acted knowingly requires a review of all the relevant facts and circumstances. See, e.g., State v. Porter, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 19AP-29, 2019-Ohio-4868, ¶ 18 (“[I]n analyzing an attack, inferences about mens rea depend on the nature and\ncircumstances of the event.”). In this case, the evidence shows that Lee weighed 180 pounds. After Jacinto punched Lee in the jaw, he immediately fell to the ground, was unconscious and gasping for breath and sustained a severe brain injury. Dr. Brown could not state whether Lee’s brain injury came from the punch or the fall that followed, but testified that a “pretty significant amount of force” would have been necessary to cause the significant acute swelling and bruising she observed on Lee’s jaw. This was not a case of a light jab or minor clip. Jacinto’s punch was a voluntary, significant, forceful blow to Lee’s face.\n\n\\{¶ 109\\} As the court explained in State v. Ayers, 3d Dist. Marion No. 9-81-1, 1981 Ohio App. LEXIS 10550 (Aug. 18, 1981), in concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support a felonious assault conviction where the defendant hit the victim twice with his fist with sufficient force to break his cheekbone:\n\n[T]he evidence clearly shows the blows were directed to the victim’s face and head. This is the site of the sense of smell, of taste, of sight, and of hearing. It is the situs of the brain. As such, any violent blow can be expected to probably cause * * * some temporary substantial incapacity and to cause acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering.\n\nId. at 4.\n\n\\{¶ 110\\} Although Jacinto may not have reasonably anticipated that Lee would sustain a serious brain injury, considering all the circumstances, it could be reasonably inferred that Jacinto knew that some form of serious physical harm to Lee was a reasonable and probable consequence of his forceful punch to Lee’s jaw. Furthermore, after punching Lee and seeing him fall to the ground, Jacinto simply\nwalked away. Jacinto’s response to the immediate impact of his punch could reasonably support the inference that Jacinto was “unsurprised by its severity” and that Jacinto was aware that his punch to Lee’s jaw would probably cause him serious physical harm. See Watson, 2018-Ohio-4964, at ¶ 16.\n\n¶ 111 Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state and considering the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, we find that the evidence presented was sufficient to support a finding, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Jacinto knew that his conduct would probably cause serious physical harm to Lee.\n\n¶ 112 Accordingly, we overrule Jacinto’s fifth assignment of error."}

But our review of the record convinces us that the evidence in support of guilt was overwhelming. Contrary to Morrissette’s argument, the surveillance video footage showing him reaching for something at his hip while looking at and walking towards the victim, in the exact area where the shooting took place, seconds before the shooting, was substantial physical evidence connecting him to the murder. And the inference from that footage was corroborated by testimony from multiple credible witnesses. For instance, Taylor testified that he had seen Morrissette shoot Tremble and that Morrissette had asked for help in getting rid of his gun after admitting to shooting Tremble. Admittedly, Taylor had not stepped forward as an eyewitness until he had been arrested on his own charges. But Taylor’s prior experience as a witness adequately explained his reluctance to assist the police. Miller and Cody testified that Morrissette had been “looking for” Tremble when he left their apartment with a gun compatible with the murder weapon minutes before Tremble was shot. And Cody further testified that Morrissette had admitted to shooting Tremble when, as confirmed by the surveillance video footage, Morrissette returned to Cody's apartment building shortly after the shooting. Other testimony supported a finding of guilt. Anderson and Inman both testified that they had heard Morrissette threaten to kill Tremble and admit to shooting him. Tremble's sister Naicha identified Morrissette as the individual she had seen at the crime scene immediately after the shooting. Finally, Morrissette's statements in his recorded phone calls from jail showed a consciousness of guilt. He admitted that he had fled from and concealed himself from the police to avoid apprehension, intended to feign insanity to avoid a long prison sentence for murder, and had tried to distance himself from the nickname Psycho because he knew it would be connected to the shooter."}

The decision whether to instruct the jury on flight is a matter within the trial court’s discretion and is reviewed for an abuse of that discretion.

In the recorded jail calls, Morrissette repeatedly acknowledged that he knew the police had been looking for him and he laughed about successfully eluding them. He recalled eluding apprehension by a squad of police officers by hiding in a tree. On another occasion he had rubbed ‘hella hair grease’, ‘seasoning’, and ‘cologne’ on his body to prevent K-9 police dogs from alerting to his scent. Under these circumstances, we cannot hold that the trial court’s decision to give a flight instruction was so arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable as to connote an abuse of discretion.

When disposing of the second assignment of error, we found the prosecutor had acted improperly when he referred to Morrissette as Psycho in instances where that reference had not been required for identification purposes, but concluded that any improper use of the nickname had not affected the outcome of the trial. We determined that any impugning effect was negligible when weighed against the overwhelming evidence of guilt. For similar reasons, we hold that defense counsels’ failure to object to the state’s unnecessary use of the name and defense counsels’ own allegedly unnecessary use of the name at trial was not outcome determinative, either. The jury was not told the origin of the nickname and it was not used in an impugning manner. Although the nickname was used a significant number of times, this alone does not demonstrate the requisite prejudice to establish an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. The strength of the state’s evidence was such that we are confident the jury would have found Morrissette guilty of the offenses even absent the allegedly deficient performance by trial counsel."}

Appellant was also convicted of a single count of felonious assault in violation of 2903.11(A)(2). R.C. 2905.01(A)(3) and (B)(2) provide: (A) No person, by force, threat, or deception, or, in the case of a victim under the age of thirteen or mentally incompetent, by any means, shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, for any of the following purposes: * * * (3) To terrorize, or to inflict serious physical harm on the victim or another; * * * (B) No person, by force, threat, or deception, or, in the case of a victim under the age of thirteen or mentally incompetent, by any means, shall knowingly do any of the following, under circumstances that create a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the victim or, in the case of a minor victim, under circumstances that either create a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the victim or cause physical harm to the victim: * * * (2) Restrain another of the other person's liberty. R.C. 2903.11(A)(2) provides: (A) No person shall knowingly do either of the following: * * * (2) Cause or attempt to cause physical harm to another or to another's unborn by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance. Appellant correctly cites the controlling law R.C. 2941.25 which states: (A) Where the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one. (B) Where the defendant's conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them. The issue of allied offenses for purposes of merger pursuant to R.C. 2941.25 is reviewed under a de novo standard. The burden is on the defendant to establish his entitlement to merger. In determining whether offenses are allied offenses of similar import within the meaning of R.C. 2941.25, courts must evaluate three separate factors: the conduct, the animus, and the import. If any of the following are true, a defendant's convictions do not merge and he or she may be sentenced for multiple offenses: (1) the offenses are dissimilar in import or significance; in other words, each offense caused separate, identifiable harm, (2) the offenses were committed separately, or (3) the offenses were committed with separate animus. In the instant matter, the record reflects that Appellant went to the victim’s bedside and grabbed her by the hair and the arm, forcibly pulling her out of bed to a standing position. He dragged her into the bathroom. At that point, the forcible detainment of the victim and the act of leading her against her will into the bathroom completed the kidnapping offense. Once Appellant had the victim in the bathroom, he punched her face multiple times and held her head under the scalding water, preventing her from breathing. This second course of conduct constituted felonious assault. The harm caused by the kidnapping is clearly identifiable from the felonious assault, one reason being that the victim would not be near the tub of water were it not for the kidnapping and restraint of her liberty. The second factor requires review of whether the offenses were committed separately. If so, there is no merger. The evidence of record demonstrates two separate courses of conduct here. The first offense involved restraint of the victim and forcibly removing her to the bathroom. The second offense consisted of utilizing the bath tub as a deadly weapon and submerging the victim after multiple punches to the face. Therefore, this record shows the offenses were committed separately. The third factor requires that the offenses be committed with separate animus or motivation. Animus refers to the defendant’s immediate criminal motive, intent or state of mind. Here, the restraint and movement involved in Appellant’s kidnapping of Mrs. Thomas is not merely incidental to the felonious assault offense. Appellant kidnapped the victim from the bedroom to the bathroom, in part to avoid waking his grandchild. Once there, his assault began both verbally and with punches. He then used the bath tub as a deadly weapon, supporting the felonious assault charge. Therefore, separate animus exists precluding merger."}
{"index": "132-Pennington", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "Ineffective Assistance of Counsel", "extracted_text": "In his first assignment of error, Pennington argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. To prevail on an ineffective-assistance claim, an appellant must demonstrate that: (1) counsel’s performance was deficient, and (2) counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced the defense. *Strickland v. Washington*, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); *State v. Bradley*, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 141-142, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).\n\nIn reviewing defense counsel’s performance, we must remain highly deferential. *Strickland* at 689. We must “recognize that counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.” *Id.* at 690.\n\nAn appellant’s demonstration that counsel’s performance was deficient does not warrant the reversal of a conviction if counsel’s error had no effect on the judgment. *Id.* at 691; *Bradley* at 142. The appellant must affirmatively demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s deficient performance,\nthe result of the trial would have been different. *Strickland* at 693-694; *Bradley* at 143.\n\n{¶34} **A. Failure to hire a forensic pathology expert.** Pennington first asserts that defense counsel’s performance was deficient because counsel failed to request funds for or hire a forensic pathology expert to contradict the opinion of the state’s forensic pathology expert, Dr. Stephens.\n\n{¶35} Generally, the decision whether to call any witness “falls within the rubric of trial strategy and will not be second-guessed by a reviewing court.” *State v. Treesh*, 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 490, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001). A decision by defense counsel not to call an expert witness and instead rely on cross-examination of the state’s expert is generally a matter of trial strategy and does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Hunter*, 131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, ¶ 66; *State v. Mundt*, 115 Ohio St.3d 22, 2007-Ohio-4836, 873 N.E.2d 828, ¶ 118; *State v. McHenry*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170671, 2018-Ohio-3383, ¶ 25.\n\n{¶36} Here, trial counsel conducted a thorough and rigorous cross-examination of the state’s expert, attacking her opinion that the manner of death was homicide, and leading her to concede that there was a chance, albeit slim, that the victim had shot herself. We conclude that defense counsel’s decision not to hire or call a forensic pathology expert fell “within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.” *See State v. Thompson*, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, 23 N.E.3d 1096, ¶ 244, quoting *Strickland*, 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.\n\n{¶37} Pennington directs us to *Hinton v. Alabama*, 571 U.S. 263, 274-275, 134 S.Ct. 1081, 188 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014), where the United States Supreme Court held that trial counsel had rendered deficient performance by employing an expert he knew to be inadequate because he failed to understand the resources that state law made available to him. However, *Hinton* involved a postconviction proceeding\nwhere the defendant produced evidence outside the trial record, including the affidavits of three experts who had reached different conclusions than the state’s experts. See id. at 270.\n\n{¶38} In this case, on the other hand, Pennington cannot establish prejudice based on the record before us. Resolving this issue in Pennington’s favor would be purely speculative. See State v. Madrigal, 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 390, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000). Nothing in the record indicates that testimony from another forensic pathologist would have been favorable to Pennington and would have altered the outcome of the trial. See id. at 390-391; Mundt at ¶ 118; State v. Jeffries, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170182, 2018-Ohio-2160, ¶ 78-79. “Establishing that would require proof outside the record, such as affidavits demonstrating the probable testimony. Such a claim is not appropriately considered on a direct appeal.” Madrigal at 391. Therefore, even assuming that counsel’s failure to obtain a forensic pathology expert was deficient, Pennington has failed to demonstrate any resulting prejudice.\n\n{¶39} B. Failure to discover that the handgun model was defective. Pennington also argues that counsel should have discovered that the model of handgun that caused Herald’s injuries, a Taurus PT111 Millennium, was defective and had been the subject of a Florida class-action lawsuit that alleged defects with the handgun’s firing. He asserts that information regarding the defects in the Taurus handguns was “widely publicized,” citing a court order that approved a class-action settlement in the Florida case. See Carter v. Forjas Taurus S.A., S.D.Fla. No. 1:13-CV-24583-PAS, 2016 WL 3982489 (July 22, 2016). He acknowledges, however, that the court order in the Florida case was not made part of the record in this case. As we have stated, we are unable to determine on appeal whether ineffective assistance of counsel occurred where the allegations of ineffectiveness are based on facts not appearing in the record. See State v. Cooperrider, 4 Ohio St.3d 226, 228, 448\nC. Failure to subpoena the victim’s mother. Pennington contends that defense counsel should have subpoenaed Herald’s mother to testify at trial because she had made statements that caused the police to investigate the possibility that Herald had previously attempted suicide.\n\nWe will not second-guess counsel’s decision not to call any witness because that is a matter squarely within the ambit of trial strategy. See Treesh, 90 Ohio St.3d at 490, 739 N.E.2d 749. It is possible that defense counsel interviewed Herald’s mother and decided that her testimony would not be favorable to Pennington. Moreover, although Pennington claims that testimony by Herald’s mother may have been favorable to his defense, there is nothing in the record to support that assertion. Therefore, we cannot say that Pennington was prejudiced by counsel’s decision not to call Herald’s mother as a witness. And we note that defense counsel was able to get into evidence the officer’s testimony about a possible prior suicide attempt.\n\nD. Failure to advise a pretrial guilty plea to the weapons-under-disability count. Finally, Pennington contends that trial counsel should have advised him to enter a guilty plea to the weapons charge prior to trial to prevent the state from introducing into evidence the shotgun, shotgun shells, and certain ammunition that was not compatible with the shotgun or with the handgun that caused Herald’s injuries. He claims that the evidence was relevant only to the weapons charge and would not have been admissible at trial if he had entered the plea beforehand.\n\nPennington has not demonstrated that counsel’s performance was deficient, or that but for counsel’s deficient performance, the result of the bench trial would have been different.\nE. Pennington’s ineffective-assistance claims fail. Finding no merit to Pennington’s claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, we overrule the first assignment of error."}
{"index": "132-Pennington", "allegation_num": "allegation_2", "allegation": "Admission of Evidence", "extracted_text": "Pennington argues that the trial court erred by admitting into evidence the shotgun, shotgun shells, and different types of ammunition, and by allowing a detective to testify that Pennington had a tattoo of a bullet on his hand and displayed pictures of shell casings in his home. He contends that the evidence was irrelevant to the murder charges and amounted to improper evidence under Evid.R. 404(B) that was used to portray him as a person with bad character. Pennington failed to object to the evidence and testimony at trial, so he has waived all but plain error. See State v. Diar, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, at ¶ 73. Evid.R. 404(B) precludes admission of evidence of 'other crimes, wrongs or acts' to prove a person's character trait to demonstrate conduct in conformity with that trait. State v. Williams, 134 Ohio St.3d 521, 2012-Ohio-5695, 983 N.E.2d 1278, ¶ 16. But the rule allows trial courts broad discretion to admit evidence of a defendant's other acts 'for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.' See Evid.R. 404(B); Williams at ¶ 17. We question whether the evidence at issue was, in fact, evidence of 'other crimes, wrongs, or acts.' Nevertheless, we do not find that the trial court plainly erred by admitting it. The shotgun, shotgun shells, and ammunition were relevant to the question of whether Pennington knowingly possessed any firearm, for purposes of the weapons-under-disability charge, so their admission did not contravene Evid.R. 404(B). Therefore, the evidence was properly admitted by the trial court. The detective's testimony about Pennington's bullet tattoo and display of pictures of shell casings came in response to a question about what evidence contradicted Pennington's claim that he did not know there were guns in his home. The detectives had talked to Pennington about those items when they interviewed him. Even though the testimony had little, if any, relevance, it was of such minor significance that no plain error occurred in its admission. See Diar, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, at ¶ 73."}

See McKelton, 148 Ohio St.3d 261, 2016-Ohio-5735, 70 N.E.3d 508, at ¶ 257. The test for whether prosecutorial misconduct mandates reversal is whether the prosecutor's remarks or actions were improper, and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused. State v. Smith, 97 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-Ohio-6659, 780 N.E.2d 221, ¶ 45.\n\nA. Impeachment during redirect examination. Pennington asserts that 'the state improperly impeached Donny McKee by threatening him with prosecution if he did not testify as they wished.' He points to the prosecutor's questions on redirect examination about a conversation that McKee had with prosecutors and a detective a few days before trial. Pennington failed to object, so his challenge to the prosecutor's conduct is reviewed for plain error. See id.\n\nB. Questioning of a defense witness. Pennington argues that the prosecutor improperly questioned Teaionna Richmond about his 2004 domestic-violence arrest. We conclude that the prosecutor’s conduct did not amount to plain error because, as we previously explained, the evidence was admissible after Pennington opened the door with evidence of his nonviolent character.\n\nC. No prosecutorial misconduct occurred. Because the prosecutor did not act improperly in questioning Richmond, and because no plain error occurred in the prosecutor’s questioning of McKee, no misconduct occurred."}
{"index": "132-Pennington", "allegation_num": "allegation_4", "allegation": "Weight and Sufficiency", "extracted_text": "In his fourth assignment of error, Pennington challenges the weight and sufficiency of the evidence upon which his murder conviction was based. Specifically, he argues that the state failed to prove that he shot Herald.\n\n{¶75} In a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, the question is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the state, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. *State v. Jenks*, 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus. When considering a challenge to the weight of the evidence, the court must examine the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of the witnesses, and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice. *State v. Thompkins*, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997).\n\n{¶76} Construing the evidence presented at trial in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Pennington had purposely killed Herald, in violation of R.C. 2903.02(A). After discovering that his ring was taken, Pennington was so angry with Herald that he texted McKee to say that Herald's life was his until he got his ring back. And Herald's text messages to McKee, her mother, and a friend, confirmed how angry Pennington was about it.\n\n{¶77} In addition, Herald's text messages to Burles indicated that she was ready to leave Pennington's home just minutes before she was shot. And in his 911 call, Pennington explained how Herald may have obtained a gun before relaying the crucial information about her being shot. Then he lied to the dispatcher about the handgun and the shotgun, and he lied about the guns during his later interview with police.\n\n{¶78} And despite Pennington's claim to police that after he heard the gunshot and ran to his room, he had “instantly” grabbed the handgun and thrown it on a shelf, two experienced investigators testified that the gun was too clean for Herald to have shot herself. Pennington's calm demeanor immediately after the shooting stood out as unusual to a responding officer. And Dr. Stephens explained her conclusion that the manner of death was homicide.\nMoreover, the trial court, as the trier of fact, was in the best position to judge the credibility of the witnesses. See State v. DeHass, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212 (1967), paragraph one of the syllabus. The court was entitled to reject Pennington's claim to police that he had been downstairs when the shooting occurred.\n\nConsequently, we hold that the record contained sufficient evidence to convict Pennington of murder, and his conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence."}

Clark constituted ineffective assistance: First, we determine “whether there has been a substantial violation of any of defense counsel’s essential duties to his client.” When making this inquiry, the court will presume that licensed counsel has performed in an ethical and competent manner. Second, we determine whether “the defense was prejudiced by counsel’s ineffectiveness.” Prejudice requires a showing to a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Counsel failed to use a written statement made by M. Clark to impeach M. Clark’s trial testimony but subsequently attempted to use the statement during cross-examination of the officer that took the statement. Counsel also failed to invoke Evid.R. 609 to impeach M. Clark’s credibility for prior criminal acts.

See Eastley at ¶ 21.\n\n¶ 52 In support of his assertion that his convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence, appellant points to the fact that the testimony of J.H. and Carroll were different from what they initially told police. Appellant also argues the plea agreements of J.H. and Carroll render their testimony lacking in credibility. We find this argument to be without merit. The jury was aware of the plea agreements of J.H. and Carroll and was therefore in the best position to weigh that fact in determining their credibility. State v. Jackson, 10th Dist.

Furthermore, the trial court instructed the jury regarding J.H.'s and Carroll's credibility and the weight of their testimony in light of their related convictions.\n\n¶ 53 Appellant's attacks on the credibility of J.H. and Carroll fail for the additional reason that other evidence connects appellant to the incident in question. In her search of the basement at the Rotunda house where appellant was residing, Detective Swisher recovered pizza boxes with labels matching the information associated with the delivery to the vacant house. Sanchez testified that, after hearing a shot, he saw three individuals running from the delivery vehicle by the vacant house. Thus, the greater amount of credible evidence weighs in favor of appellant's convictions. See State v. Edmond, 10th Dist. No. 15AP-574, 2016-Ohio-1034, ¶ 34.\n\n¶ 54 Appellant also contends the alibi testimony renders his convictions against the manifest weight of the evidence. Based on the totality of the evidence, we find the state's evidence was stronger and more persuasive than appellant's alibi evidence. Latonya Nichols testified that she was very close with appellant and considered him \"like my son.\" (Tr. Vol. III at 588.) Brian Nichols testified appellant was \"very close\" and \"like a cousin or a brother\" to him and his other siblings. (Tr. Vol. III at 635.)

Instead, appellant's counsel raised arguments related to the timing of discovery and the number of continuances in the case. Most importantly, appellant's counsel stated that arguments made by the state related to the timing of the notice of alibi were proper:\n\n[Assistant Prosecutor]: So then the jury's left with the notion that this is the trial date, the one and only; and they come forward with their alibi before this one and only trial date. That is not the analysis that is factually correct here.\n\nThey were scheduled for trial eight times and didn't say one word about alibi. And they didn't say a word about it until after this defendant finds out that his co-defendant, Sir Jeffrey Carroll, is going to testify against him. And then all of a sudden there's an alibi.\n\n[Appellant's Counsel]: I don't know what that has to do with providing late discovery and telling the jury there's one trial date, two trial dates, three trial dates. The bottom line is is [sic] we provided that information. The jury has the information.\nThey can make the inference and argue that they got last-minute notice. We don't need to get into specifics about trial dates and continuances.\n\n[The Court]: I think they want to argue that, you know, that this case was going to trial eight different times and here's two key witnesses that didn't bother to come forward.\n\n[Appellant's Counsel]: Then I should be able to argue I didn't get the discovery at the last minute, and we were never really prepared to go to trial, and we would have been in trouble had we realized that we didn't have the discovery that we needed to go to trial.\n\n[The Court]: I don't see what that discovery would have had to do with these two witnesses.\n\n[Appellant's Counsel]: Strategically I may not have disclosed the two witnesses if I knew -- you know, we haven't made that decision ultimately. And I have not sat down with my client to the final point of preparing our defense, his testimony, and totally evaluating the case. So for strategic reasons --\n\nObviously they should be able to point it out. I'm not saying they can't get up and say I didn't file my notice of alibi on the 27th. I'm not disputing that. What I'm disputing is them articulating there were multiple continuances because there were -- what's it matter if there's one continuance or four continuances.\n\n(Emphasis added.) (Tr. Vol. IV at 755-56.)\n\n¶ 61 Thus, any error resulting from the state's argument was invited by the concession of appellant's trial counsel. \"Under the \"invited error\" doctrine, a party may not take advantage of an error which he invited or induced.\" State v. Neil, 10th Dist. No. 14AP-981, 2016-Ohio-4762, ¶ 75, quoting State v. Griffin, 10th Dist. No. 10AP-902, 2011-Ohio-4250, ¶ 16. \"Pursuant to this doctrine, a party cannot claim that a trial court erred by accepting the party's own stipulation.\" Id., quoting State v. McClendon, 10th Dist. No. 11AP-354, 2011-Ohio-6235, ¶ 37.\n\n¶ 62 Moreover, even if appellant's trial counsel did not invite the alleged error, appellant's failure to object forfeited review of any such error absent plain error. Id. at ¶ 76. \"Plain error consists of an obvious error or defect in the trial proceedings that affects a substantial right.\" Williams, 2017-Ohio-5598, at ¶ 28, quoting State v. Lindsey, 87 Ohio St.3d 479, 482 (2000). Pursuant to Crim.R. 52(B), \"[p]lain errors or defects affecting\nsubstantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\" An appellate court takes notice of plain error \" 'with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.' \" State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27 (2002), quoting State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.2d 91 (1978), paragraph three of the syllabus.\n\n¶ 63 Appellant argues that pursuant to Hirsch, it was error to permit the state to include in its closing argument references to the date appellant filed his notice of alibi. In Hirsch, the defendant timely filed his notice of alibi. The court found that it was \"patently improper\" for the state to have \"adduced evidence and argued about the date that Hirsch filed his notice of alibi.\" Hirsch at 311. Nevertheless, because Hirsch failed to object and the court could not conclude that the error was so egregious as to deprive Hirsch of a fair trial, the court found Hirsch failed to demonstrate plain error.\n\n¶ 64 Here, unlike in Hirsch, there is no dispute that appellant failed to file a timely notice of alibi pursuant to Crim.R. 12.1. Therefore, we find that Hirsch is not dispositive of the issue before us. However, even if we were to find the trial court erred in permitting the state to argue the timing of the notice of alibi, we would find such error to be harmless considering the overwhelming evidence supporting appellant's convictions. See Ohio v. Depew, 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 288 (1988); State v. Banks, 10th Dist. No. 03AP-1286, 2005-Ohio-1943, ¶ 6; Elson at ¶ 43. As appellant has failed to demonstrate prejudice, we cannot find the trial court committed plain error by allowing the state to include references to appellant's untimely filing of his notice of alibi during closing arguments. Hirsch at 311; Tolbert at 381. Accordingly, we overrule appellant's third assignment of error."}

She testified that the dog was ‘extremely emaciated’ at its first visit and was chewing at a wound on its leg. She evaluated the dog’s ‘body condition score’ as a one out of nine. The only possible lower score is for a deceased animal. After reviewing imaging studies of the dog’s leg to rule out any bone fractures, she treated the wound with oral and injectable antibiotics along with application of an antibiotic ointment. She then began performing various blood tests to determine why the dog was underweight. These results indicated that the dog was not receiving enough nutrients.\n\n¶ 20 To determine whether the lack of nutrients was a result of a lack of feeding or a medical condition, the veterinarian began feeding the dog on a regular schedule. It ate each of its meals ‘ravenously.’ Imaging studies revealed no obstruction or foreign body preventing digestion and conversations with appellant indicated no issues with vomiting or diarrhea as an explanation for the weight loss. She performed subsequent testing for other digestive issues which could have also accounted for the weight loss. These tests also came back normal. After eliminating all potential medical causes of the dog’s weight loss, and through her own observations of the dog’s physical condition, the\nveterinarian determined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the dog’s weight loss was due to lack of food. Since being treated by the veterinarian and remaining in her care, the dog has continued to gain weight and appears healthy.\n\n{¶ 21} The warden’s testimony reflects similar observations of the dog’s physical condition as being ‘very thin.’ After being contacted by the veterinarian, he spoke with appellant about the dog’s condition. Ultimately, based on the veterinarian’s findings, he filed the criminal complaint on which appellant was convicted.\n\n{¶ 22} After review of the record, including the physical evidence and witness testimony, we find no evidence to conclude that the trial court lost its way so as to cause a manifest miscarriage of justice.

Evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different if the prosecution had disclosed the evidence to the defense. *Braun* at ¶ 66. When an appellate court reviews an alleged *Brady* violation, it is the appellant’s burden to prove that there was a violation and that it rose to the level of\ndenial of due process. *Braun* at ¶ 68, citing *State v. Jackson*, 57 Ohio St.3d 29, 33, 565 N.E.2d 549 (1991).\n\n¶ 38 In *United States v. Agurs*, 427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976), the United States Supreme Court determined that the *Brady* rule applies only in situations involving the discovery of information *after trial* that was known to the prosecution but not known to the defense. Accordingly, in *State v. Wickline*, 50 Ohio St.3d 114, 552 N.E.2d 913 (1990), the Ohio Supreme Court found that no *Brady* violation occurred where the state presented the alleged exculpatory records during trial.\n\n**Crim.R. 16**\n\n¶ 39 As is relevant to this case, Crim.R. 16(B) provides that the prosecuting attorney shall provide to the defense, upon request:\n\n1. Any written or recorded statement by the defendant or a co-defendant, including police summaries of such statements, and including grand jury testimony by either the defendant or co-defendant;\n\n3. Subject to divisions (D)(4) and (E) of this rule, all laboratory or hospital reports, books, papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects, buildings, or places;\n\n6. All reports from peace officers, the Ohio State Highway Patrol, and federal law enforcement agents, provided however, that a document prepared by a person other than the witness testifying will not be considered to be the witness’s prior statement for purposes of the cross examination of that particular witness under the Rules of Evidence unless explicitly adopted by the witness;\n\n***\nIn order to prove that there was a discovery violation that amounted to a due process violation, an appellant must show that the evidence was material to a finding of guilt, and the appellant bears the burden of proving its materiality. *State v. Thomas*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 87666, 2006-Ohio-6588, ¶ 18-19. Evidence is only material if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different. *State v. Johnston*, 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 529 N.E.2d 898 (1988), paragraph five of the syllabus.\n\nIf a trial court finds that there was a discovery violation, it must impose the least restrictive sanction to cure the violation. *State v. Darmond*, 135 Ohio St.3d 343, 986 N.E.2d 971, 2013-Ohio-966, ¶ 20-22; *Lakewood v. Papadelis*, 32 Ohio St.3d 1, 2, 511 N.E.2d 1138 (1987). The appellate court reviews a trial court’s decision whether to sanction under an abuse of discretion standard. *Darmond* at ¶ 33. A trial court abuses its discretion when it makes a decision that is unreasonable, unconscionable, or arbitrary. *Id.* at ¶ 34; *State v. Adams*, 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 404 N.E.2d 144 (1980); see also *State v. Miller*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100461, 2014-Ohio-3907, ¶ 67.\n\nIf a reviewing court finds a discovery violation was not properly cured by the trial court, the reviewing court will consider whether any resulting error was harmless. *Middleburg Hts. v. Lasker*, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103903, 2016-Ohio-5522, ¶ 16 (holding that an undisclosed witness’s testimony was harmless error because it was cumulative to other witness testimony).\nIt is with these concepts in mind that we review each alleged discovery violation.\n\na. Polygraph report\n\nDuring trial, the parties became aware that Newell underwent a polygraph test while he was in police custody. Newell claims that the information gleaned from the polygraph test was \"potentially useful\" to him because it may have provided a reason why Newell confessed to B.F.’s murder or provided other background information regarding the investigation and potential police misconduct. Newell further contends that the police’s failure to disclose the polygraph report was done in bad faith.\n\nThe criteria for the admission of polygraph examination results was set forth in State v. Souel, 53 Ohio St.2d 123, 372 N.E.2d 1318 (1978). One criterion is that all parties must stipulate to the admission of the test results:\n\nThe nature of polygraphs is different from traditional scientific tests. Most, if not all, scientific tests involved objective measurements such as blood or genetic typing or gunshot residue. In a polygraph test, the bodily response of the examinee to his answers is dependent upon the subjective interpretation thereof by the examiner. In as much as the test is not perceived by the profession to be reasonably reliable, its admissibility is limited in Ohio to situations where the parties stipulate to its admission.\n\nState v. Davis, 62 Ohio St.3d 326, 341, 581 N.E.2d 1362 (1991).\n\nIn this case, once the state became aware of the possibility that Newell might have undergone a polygraph test, the prosecutor contacted the polygrapher, who was an FBI agent that was present during some of Newell’s interviews. The\npolygrapher checked his records and discovered that he had given Newell a brief exam. The polygrapher asked Newell two questions: \"Did you shoot [B.F.]?\" and \"On August 19th, did you shoot [B.F.]?\" Newell answered \"No\" to both questions and the examiner determined that Newell was being deceptive.\n\n¶ 47 This alleged discovery violation does not fall under the purview of Brady because the polygraph report was disclosed to defense counsel during trial. In addition, Newell does not claim that he was going to stipulate to the admission of the polygraph results; therefore, the polygraph results would not have been admissible at trial. His bare assertion that the results were \"potentially useful\" does not mean that the material was exculpatory. Moreover, he has not shown that the evidence was material to a finding of guilt or that there is a \"reasonable probability\" that the outcome of trial would have been different had the polygraph results been disclosed before trial.\n\nb. Crime scene visit\n\n¶ 48 During Newell’s cross-examination of Detective Lundy, the detective testified that he took Newell to the crime scene. That visit was not disclosed to defense counsel before trial; it was not contained in any of the police reports and the detective did not video or tape record any part of the crime scene visit. Newell claims that had defense counsel known of this visit to the crime scene, counsel would have challenged the admissibility of Newell’s confession and investigated whether Detective Lundy’s conduct was inappropriate or coercive.\nDetective Lundy testified that he had Newell’s consent to take him to the crime scene; the detective testified that consent is required in order for an officer to take a jailed suspect to a crime scene. The detective testified that he took another detective along and \"probably\" informed his commander that he was taking Newell to the crime scene.\n\nThey remained on the scene for less than five minutes. According to Detective Lundy, he took Newell to the crime scene because Newell was claiming that Doss was on the scene of the shooting and had driven to the scene. Newell told the detective that, at the time of the shooting, Doss’s car was \"present, facing the opposite direction.\" According to the detective, \"[w]e were just trying to get a better understanding of which way cars were facing and where [B.F.’s] body was laying.\"\n\nAs with the polygraph results, we find no Brady violation because the information was disclosed to defense counsel during trial. Newell has not shown that his visit to the crime scene was material evidence, that is, that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had defense counsel known of the crime scene visit prior to trial.\n\nc. DNA evidence\n\nDuring trial, it came to defense counsel’s attention that the police had secured a buccal swab from Newell. Detective Lundy testified that he submitted Newell’s standard to BCI. BCI forensic scientist Farinacci testified that she received the standard but returned it to the police department with a note stating that \"written authorization from the prosecutor is required before testing can begin on\nthese samples.\" The BCI scientist that performed the DNA analysis on the firearm recovered from Woods’s house did not have Newell’s standard for comparison; BCI scientist Nelsen-Rausch testified that although Newell’s DNA standard was requested, she never received the standard from the East Cleveland Police.\n\n¶ 53 Newell claims that the failure to disclose the existence of the swab was done in bad faith. Newell further contends that all DNA evidence should have been excluded from trial because Newell’s DNA standard was never tested.\n\n¶ 54 In State v. Jamie, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102103, 2015-Ohio-3583, ¶ 18, this court found that the defendant’s right to a fair trial was not violated when the state failed to turn over DNA evidence. During trial, the prosecutor learned that a DNA sample found in the backseat of the car where the victim was found matched someone other than the defendant. Defense counsel claimed that the discovery of the DNA bolstered its defense and argued that it would have investigated the other individual more fully if counsel had known that his DNA was in the car.\n\n¶ 55 On appeal, the appellant argued that he was denied due process of law and a fair trial because the state withheld exculpatory evidence. He further argued that the evidence was material evidence because it gave the defense a solid basis to argue that there was an alternate suspect. Therefore, the appellant argued, the prosecution’s failure to disclose the evidence regarding the DNA was a clear Brady violation and a violation of his right to a fair trial. Id. at ¶ 19.\n\n¶ 56 This court found that the Brady rule did not apply because the alleged exculpatory evidence was not known to the prosecutor prior to trial. This court also\nfound that there was no violation of Crim.R. 16 because the state’s failure to disclose was not a willful violation, the appellant had not demonstrated how the knowledge of the DNA would have benefitted him in his defense, defense counsel did not request a continuance for further investigation once he became aware of the evidence, and the appellant did not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the state’s failure to disclose the DNA evidence. *Id.* at ¶ 22.\n\n¶ 57 In this case, the state’s failure to disclose the existence of a DNA swab did not violate Newell’s right to a fair trial. Newell’s DNA standard was initially sent to BCI but was returned to the East Cleveland Police Department. BCI requested the standard again, but the police did not send the swab to BCI a second time for testing or comparison. While the mix-up is concerning, Newell has not shown that the failure to disclose the existence of the DNA swab was a willful violation of Crim.R. 16. Moreover, Newell has not shown that this untested DNA was material to a finding of guilt and or a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had the existence of the DNA standard been disclosed.\n\n¶ 58 Nelson-Rausch testified that even if she had received Newell’s DNA standard, it would not have changed any of her conclusions regarding the evidence because none of the bullet casings recovered from the crime scene had DNA that was suitable for comparison. In addition, although there was DNA recovered from the firearm taken from Woods’s house, the firearm was ruled out as the murder weapon. In other words, there was no DNA recovered from the scene to compare to Newell’s\nDNA. Therefore, we do not find that Newell’s right to a fair trial was violated by the failure to disclose the existence of his DNA standard to defense counsel.\n\nd. Police misconduct\n\n{¶ 59} Within these assignments of error, Newell claims that the East Cleveland Police intentionally destroyed or hid evidence, disabled recording devices, withheld information from their police reports, and did these things in bad faith. Newell, however, does not support his claims with more than bare assertions. We, therefore, find no merit to his claims.\n\n{¶ 60} The trial court did not err in denying Newell’s motion for a mistrial or in deciding not to sanction the state for any alleged misconduct. The first, second, and third assignments of error are overruled."}

Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), the United States Supreme Court held that a criminal defendant may claim denial of due process when the prosecution fails to disclose the existence of exculpatory evidence.

BCI forensic scientist Farinacci testified that she received the standard but returned it to the police department with a note stating that “written authorization from the prosecutor is required before testing can begin on\nthese samples.” The BCI scientist that performed the DNA analysis on the firearm recovered from Woods’s house did not have Newell’s standard for comparison; BCI scientist Nelsen-Rausch testified that although Newell’s DNA standard was requested, she never received the standard from the East Cleveland Police.\n\nNewell claims that the failure to disclose the existence of the swab was done in bad faith. Newell further contends that all DNA evidence should have been excluded from trial because Newell’s DNA standard was never tested.\n\nIn State v. Jamie, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102103, 2015-Ohio-3583, ¶ 18, this court found that the defendant’s right to a fair trial was not violated when the state failed to turn over DNA evidence. During trial, the prosecutor learned that a DNA sample found in the backseat of the car where the victim was found matched someone other than the defendant. Defense counsel claimed that the discovery of the DNA bolstered its defense and argued that it would have investigated the other individual more fully if counsel had known that his DNA was in the car.\n\nOn appeal, the appellant argued that he was denied due process of law and a fair trial because the state withheld exculpatory evidence. He further argued that the evidence was material evidence because it gave the defense a solid basis to argue that there was an alternate suspect. Therefore, the appellant argued, the prosecution’s failure to disclose the evidence regarding the DNA was a clear Brady violation and a violation of his right to a fair trial. Id. at ¶ 19.\n\nThis court found that the Brady rule did not apply because the alleged exculpatory evidence was not known to the prosecutor prior to trial. This court also\nfound that there was no violation of Crim.R. 16 because the state’s failure to disclose was not a willful violation, the appellant had not demonstrated how the knowledge of the DNA would have benefitted him in his defense, defense counsel did not request a continuance for further investigation once he became aware of the evidence, and the appellant did not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the state’s failure to disclose the DNA evidence. *Id.* at ¶ 22.\n\nIn this case, the state’s failure to disclose the existence of a DNA swab did not violate Newell’s right to a fair trial. Newell’s DNA standard was initially sent to BCI but was returned to the East Cleveland Police Department. BCI requested the standard again, but the police did not send the swab to BCI a second time for testing or comparison. While the mix-up is concerning, Newell has not shown that the failure to disclose the existence of the DNA swab was a willful violation of Crim.R. 16. Moreover, Newell has not shown that this untested DNA was material to a finding of guilt and or a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had the existence of the DNA standard been disclosed.\n\nNelson-Rausch testified that even if she had received Newell’s DNA standard, it would not have changed any of her conclusions regarding the evidence because none of the bullet casings recovered from the crime scene had DNA that was suitable for comparison. In addition, although there was DNA recovered from the firearm taken from Woods’s house, the firearm was ruled out as the murder weapon. In other words, there was no DNA recovered from the scene to compare to Newell’s\nDNA. Therefore, we do not find that Newell’s right to a fair trial was violated by the failure to disclose the existence of his DNA standard to defense counsel."}

State v. Magwood, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105885, 2018-Ohio-1634, ¶ 62. Specifically, the court must find that (1) consecutive terms are required to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender, (2) consecutive terms are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the conduct and danger posed to the public, and (3) either the offender committed at least one offense while awaiting trial or sentencing, that multiple offenses were part of a course of conduct and the harm caused was so great or unusual that a single term does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offender’s conduct, or that the offender’s criminal history is such that consecutive terms are necessary to protect the public. R.C. 2929.14(C)(4); State v. Bonnell, 140 Ohio St.3d 209, 2014-Ohio-3177, 16 N.E.3d 659, ¶ 22, 26.

State v. Blevins, 2017-Ohio-4444, 93 N.E.3d 246, ¶ 15 (8th Dist.), citing Bonnell at ¶ 37. The court made the following findings when it sentenced Newell to consecutive terms of imprisonment: The court makes the finding as such that a consecutive sentence is necessary to punish Mr. Newell and to protect the public from future crimes and is not disproportionate to the seriousness of the conduct. And I find that one or more of the offenses were committed while Mr. Newell was on community control sanctions. Two or more of the offenses are part of one or more course of conduct, and that the harm caused is so great and unusual that a single prison term will not adequately reflect the seriousness of the conduct. Finally, Mr. Newell, your criminal history does demonstrate that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public, specifically because you were on community control sanctions on a weapons case and you were found guilty of that case. The court further found that Newell had a criminal history dating back to 2013, when he was a juvenile, and was currently on community control to the court for two separate cases. The court noted that Newell not only took B.F.’s life and destroyed her family but also destroyed the lives of G.J., J.B., and T.G. The court reasoned: You manipulated [B.F.]. You took advantage of her and you snuffed out her life when it was convenient for you. When I consider the seriousness and recidivism factors, it doesn’t get more serious than this, Mr. Newell. You lured [B.F.] out of the safety of her home where she was with her mom painting her nails. You executed her on a dark sketchy street and then abandoned her lifeless body. As if it couldn’t be any worse, you shot her in front of three young boys with no regard [as to] how it would change their lives."}

The rationale behind this principle is that the trier of fact is in the best position to take into account inconsistencies, along with the witnesses’ manner and demeanor, and determine whether the witnesses’ testimonies are credible.’ (Citations omitted.) *State v. Hernandez*, 2018-Ohio-738, 107 N.E.3d 182, ¶ 28 (8th Dist.).\n\nThe witnesses in this case were subjected to cross-examination and were thoroughly questioned regarding their alleged biases. Tiffany was cross-examined about losing custody of her son and about her decision to come forward to police to tell them about her son’s involvement in B.F.’s death. The three juvenile eyewitnesses were questioned about their plea agreements with the state. The police officers who testified were cross-examined regarding police procedures and the department’s investigation of the case.\n\nThree juveniles witnessed Newell shoot B.F. multiple times, resulting in her death. Their testimonies were substantially similar to each other and to what Tiffany, Kieauntee, and Detective Lundy testified Newell told each of them: Newell shot B.F. five times, killing her, because he feared that B.F. would tell someone about the bank robbery."}
{"index": "415-Newell", "allegation_num": "allegation_7", "allegation": "Appellant received ineffective assistance of trial counsel in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution.", "extracted_text": "Newell argues his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel did not preserve any evidence containing statements Newell made during the polygraph examination. He also contends that counsel did not ask for appropriate sanctions after counsel were made aware of discovery violations. We find evidence to the contrary; counsel asked for a mistrial after the parties found out about the polygraph evidence, and the trial court denied the motion.\n\nNewell has not shown that counsel had a duty to preserve evidence or exhibits that were not entered into evidence. Although Newell’s attorney did not proffer the polygraph report, we do not find that counsel’s representation fell below a standard of reasonableness on these points.\n\nNewell also argues that counsel was ineffective for not moving to suppress Newell’s confession. The failure to file a motion to suppress is not per se ineffective assistance of counsel. Rather, counsel’s failure to file a motion to suppress is ineffective assistance of counsel only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the motion\nbeen filed, it would have been granted. To determine whether a confession was involuntary, this court considers the totality of the circumstances, including the age, mentality, and prior criminal experience of the accused; the length, intensity, and frequency of interrogation; the existence of physical deprivation or mistreatment; and the existence of threat or inducement. However, a court will not conclude that a waiver was involuntary “unless there is evidence of police coercion, such as physical abuse, threats, or deprivation of food, medical treatment, or sleep.” Here, counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress Newell’s confession because there was no evidence that Newell’s confession was coerced. Newell was 20 years of age at the time of his arrest. He had an 11th grade education and had a lengthy history of criminal conduct and interaction with law enforcement. Detective Lundy testified that the interviews with Newell each lasted 30 to 60 minutes and he was offered bathroom breaks, food, and drinks during the interviews.\nNewell has not alleged that he was mistreated or threatened and has provided no evidence to sustain his bare allegation that he was coerced into confessing to B.F.’s murder.\n\nNewell cannot demonstrate that a motion to suppress would have been granted had such a motion been filed. Accordingly, counsel’s performance did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness, thereby failing the first prong of Strickland."}

The state represented that it intended to use other acts evidence to show appellant’s motive and “a clear modus operandi in which [appellant] burns down the residence of women with whom he is romantically involved.” (Notice of intent to use other acts evidence at 2.) In response to the state’s notice of intent, defense counsel filed a motion in limine to exclude any evidence relating to appellant’s other crimes, wrongs, or bad acts. Therein, defense counsel argued that the evidence would be irrelevant to the charges at issue in this case, and that the evidence would be unfairly prejudicial and deny appellant his rights to due process and a fair trial. The trial court held a hearing on defense counsel’s motion in limine on December 12, 2016. (Tr. 48.) The state argued that an exception to Evid.R. 404(B) applied, in that the other acts evidence was admissible to establish identity through a modus operandi. The state asserted that appellant and Judith were dating and that their relationship “quickly deteriorated.” (Tr. 42.) The state further alleged that Judith discovered that appellant was using her credit card without her permission which caused her to break up with him. Defense counsel argued that the other acts evidence was not necessary to prove identity and that the state could establish identity by other means, such as scientific evidence, evidence related to credit card transactions, and cell phone records. Defense counsel contended that the other acts evidence was far more prejudicial than probative and that the prejudice could not be cured by a limiting instruction. Finally, defense counsel opined that the state was attempting to circumvent appellant’s Fifth Amendment right to refuse to testify at trial. After considering the parties’ arguments, the trial court ruled that it would allow the state to introduce other acts evidence over defense counsel’s objection. (Tr. 48.)

Dr. Pritchard opined that the victim died from natural causes, specifically heart disease. Dr. Pritchard acknowledged on cross-examination, however, that he had never performed an autopsy. Dr. Trelka, on the other hand, opined that the victim’s cause of death was “homicidal violence.”\n\nThe state called Dr. Thomas Gilson, the Medical Examiner for Cuyahoga County and director of the county’s crime laboratory, as a rebuttal witness. Dr. Gilson agreed with Dr. Trelka’s findings regarding the cause of death. Dr. Gilson testified, “homicidal violence of undetermined type, is the best explanation I can give you as a forensic pathologist as to why [the victim] died.” (Tr. 2175.) Dr. Gilson disagreed with the defense’s theory and the opinion of Dr. Pritchard that the victim died of natural causes. He explained, “Ms. Bewley does have natural disease, but she was pretty thoroughly evaluated in the year prior to her death and she didn’t really demonstrate a lot of untoward affects of the heart disease that she had.” (Tr. 2175-2176.)\n\nAfter reviewing the record, we cannot say that this is “an exceptional case” in which the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that appellant’s convictions were against the manifest weight of the evidence.

On the other hand, the state’s theory of the case was that the victim and appellant had a falling out and, as a result, appellant murdered her and set her body on fire.\n\nWhen there exist two fairly reasonable views of the evidence or two conflicting versions of events, neither of which is unbelievable, it is not the province of this court to choose which version we believe.

Appellant’s convictions are not against the manifest weight of the evidence merely because the jury rejected the defense’s theories and found the state’s version of the events to be more believable.\n\nAs noted above, the question in this case was whether appellant murdered the victim and set her body on fire.

Statutory Speedy Trial Rights\n\nIn the instant appeal, appellant argues that his statutory speedy trial rights were violated.\n\nAppellate review of a trial court’s decision on a motion to dismiss for a speedy trial violation raises a mixed question of law and fact. State v. Loder, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 93242 and 93865, 2010-Ohio-3085, ¶ 9, citing State v. Easley, 4th Dist. Scioto No. 03CA2910, 2005-Ohio-767. This court applies a de novo review to the legal issues, and independently determines whether the trial court correctly applied the law to the facts of the case. Id. However, we afford great deference to the trial court’s findings of fact, if any, if the factual findings are supported by competent, credible evidence. Id. When reviewing the legal issues presented in a speedy trial claim, we are required to strictly construe the relevant statutes against the state. Id., citing Brecksville v. Cook, 75 Ohio St.3d 53, 57, 661 N.E.2d 706 (1996).\nPursuant to R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), “the state is required to bring a defendant to trial on felony charges within 270 days of arrest.” State v. Martin, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106038, 2018-Ohio-1843, ¶ 43, citing State v. Geraci, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 101946 and 101947, 2015-Ohio-2699, ¶ 19. The “triple count provision” set forth in R.C. 2945.71(E), however, provides that each day a defendant is held in jail in lieu of bail counts as three days for purposes of calculating speedy trial time. Geraci at id.\n\nIn his appellate brief, appellant summarily concludes that even when the tolling events set forth in R.C. 2945.72 are considered, “the [s]tate failed to bring [him] to trial within the statutory speedy trial limits; entitling him to immediate discharge.” Appellant’s brief at 38. He does not address any of the applicable tolling events or cite to parts of the record in support of his assertion that “[w]ell over 270 days had passed” between his arrest and the commencement of trial. See App.R. 16(A)(7).\n\nIt is undisputed that the triple-count provision under R.C. 2945.71(E) applies in this case because appellant was arrested on December 31, 2014, and remained incarcerated until trial commenced.\n\nAs an initial matter, we note that the trial court stated that there was an APA hold on appellant. (Tr. 26.) The triple-count provision is inapplicable when an accused is held in jail pursuant to a valid parole holder. See State v. Glover, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 89059, 2007-Ohio-5727, ¶ 3, citing State v. Brown, 64 Ohio St.3d 476, 479, 597 N.E.2d 97 (1992).\n\nNevertheless, after reviewing the record, we find no merit to appellant’s assertion that his statutory speedy trial rights were violated. R.C. 2945.72 sets forth the following relevant circumstances under which speedy trial time is tolled:\n\n(B) Any period during which the accused is mentally incompetent to stand trial or during which his mental competence to stand trial is being determined, or any period during which the accused is physically incapable of standing trial;\n(C) Any period of delay necessitated by the accused’s lack of counsel, provided that such delay is not occasioned by any lack of diligence in providing counsel to an indigent accused upon his request as required by law;\n(D) Any period of delay occasioned by the neglect or improper act of the accused;\n\n(E) Any period of delay necessitated by reason of a plea in bar or abatement, motion, proceeding, or action made or instituted by the accused;\n\n* * *\n\n(H) The period of any continuance granted on the accused’s own motion, and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused’s own motion[.]\n\n¶134 In the instant matter, the record reflects that on December 30, 2014, appellant was indicted and a capias was issued for his arrest. Appellant was taken into custody the following day, December 31, 2014.\n\n¶135 Appellant fails to acknowledge that his own actions resulted in delaying trial. Specifically, trial was delayed, in large part, based on (1) appellant’s filing of at least three motions to disqualify appointed counsel, which the trial court granted; (2) appellant’s and/or defense counsel’s multiple requests for continuances of pretrial conferences; and (3) appellant’s filing of several pro se motions, despite the fact that he was represented by counsel.\n\n¶136 Speedy trial time was tolled by the following motions filed by appellant’s first appointed counsel: demand for discovery and bill of particulars, filed on January 5, 2015; motion to appoint an investigator, filed January 9, 2015; motion to dismiss, filed on February 20, 2015; motions for grand jury transcripts, the names of grand jury witnesses, and funds to retain an expert, filed February 23, 2015; demand for discovery, filed on April 3, 2015; motion for discovery, filed on April 13, 2015; motion to compel discovery, filed on May 3, 2015; motions to\ncompel law enforcement to turn over materials related to the investigation and disclosure of exculpatory evidence, filed May 4, 2015; motion in limine, filed May 7, 2015; motion to appoint arson investigator, filed May 21, 2015; motion for appropriation of funds for an expert witness, filed June 3, 2015; motion for disclosure of impeaching information, filed June 25, 2015; second motion to compel discovery, filed July 8, 2015; and supplemental motion for disclosure of exculpatory evidence, filed July 29, 2015.\n\n¶137 Appellant filed a waiver of speedy trial time from May 27, 2015 to October 30, 2015.\n\n¶138 On October 14, 2015, the trial court granted appellant’s motion for new counsel and appointed a new attorney to represent appellant. Speedy trial time was tolled by the appellant’s second appointed counsel’s motion for discovery, request for evidence, and motion for bill of particulars, filed October 15, 2015.\n\n¶139 On April 19, 2016, appellant filed a notice of substitution of counsel. Appellant’s third attorney filed the following motions that tolled speedy trial time: motions for bill of particulars and discovery, filed on April 19, 2016; motion for bond reduction, filed September 6, 2016; motion for continuance, filed September 13, 2016; motion to suppress, filed October 11, 2016; motion to supplement suppression motion, filed October 17, 2016; and motion in limine, filed December 9, 2016. On November 1, 2016, trial was rescheduled, at appellant’s request, to December 12, 2016.\n\n¶140 Appellant’s trial initially commenced on December 12, 2016. However, trial was rescheduled, at appellant’s request, to January 9, 2017. The reason for the continuance was that “additional information has been brought forward by [appellant].”\nThe record reflects that the case was reassigned to a new judge on January 9, 2017. The trial court’s January 9, 2017 journal entry provides that the case was transferred “for good cause shown[.]”\n\nOn January 9, 2017, appellant’s third attorney filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. The trial court granted counsel’s motion and assigned a fourth attorney to represent appellant on January 17, 2017. Appellant’s fourth attorney filed motions for discovery, bill of particulars, a motion to examine mitigatory material, and a motion requesting evidence on January 25, 2017. These filings tolled speedy trial time.\n\nAppellant was referred for a competency evaluation on February 8, 2017. This referral tolled speedy trial time, pursuant to R.C. 2945.72(B).\n\nThe trial court appointed secondary defense counsel to represent appellant on February 8, 2017. Thereafter, counsel filed the following motions that tolled speedy trial time: motion for discovery/bill of particulars, filed on February 10, 2017; motion for appointment of defense investigator, filed February 18, 2017; motion for bond reduction, filed March 2, 2017; motion to reconsider motion for bond reduction, filed May 13, 2017; motion for appointment of cell phone expert witness, filed July 21, 2017; motion to recuse the trial judge and correspondence, filed October 5, 2017.\n\nFinally, the following filings by the defense tolled speedy trial time: motion to correct deficiencies, for a continuance, or, in the alternative, to disqualify counsel, and correspondence, filed October 13, 2017; motion to dismiss, filed October 14, 2017; and motions in limine and to submit jury questionnaire, filed October 19, 2017. Appellant’s trial ultimately commenced on October 23, 2017.\nThe state filed discovery demands on April 19, 2016 and September 29, 2016. The record reflects that the defense did not respond to the state’s discovery demands until more than one year later, on October 16, 2017. Appellant’s failure to respond to the state’s request for discovery constitutes neglect that tolls the running of speedy trial time, pursuant to R.C. 2945.72(D). See State v. Palmer, 112 Ohio St.3d 457, 2007-Ohio-374, 860 N.E.2d 1011, paragraph one of the syllabus. Generally, 30 days is considered to be a reasonable time to respond to discovery requests. Geraci, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 101946 and 101947, 2015-Ohio-2699, at ¶ 26.\n\nPretrial conferences were continued at the request of the defense on the following dates: (1) 2015: January 29, February 13, February 26, March 12, March 19, March 26, April 15, May 27, June 17, July 15, July 30, September 3, September 14, November 4, November 19, December 9; (2) 2016: January 5, January 25, February 3, February 9; and (3) 2017: January 17, February 9, February 22, February 24, March 2, March 21, April 6, April 25, May 18, June 7, June 13, June 29, July 5, July 26, August 1, August 21, September 12, September 27, and October 10. On the other hand, pretrial conferences were continued at the state’s request on two occasions, January 14 and December 1, 2015.\n\nAppellant filed various pro se motions on September 25, 2015, October 2, 2015, December 30, 2015, February 4, 2016, February 19, 2016, March 1, 2016, March 4, 2016, March 28, 2016, March 31, 2016, and June 19, 2017. It is well-established that a defendant has the right to counsel or the right to act pro se, but a defendant does not have the right to hybrid representation. See State v. Hicks, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106101, 2018-Ohio-1964, ¶ 15.\n\nOn April 15, 2016, the state filed a motion for a continuance of the trial date, which was set for May 2, 2016. In its brief in support of the motion, the prosecutor asserted\nthat she was unavailable on the scheduled trial date because she was involved in a capital murder trial. Furthermore, due to the complexity of appellant’s prosecution, the prosecutor opined that it would not be appropriate for another prosecuting attorney to represent the state on her behalf at appellant’s trial. On April 21, 2016, the trial court granted the state’s motion for a continuance, and converted the May 2, 2016 trial date to a pretrial conference. However, the trial court did not incorporate the state’s grounds for the request in its journal entry. See State v. Cochern, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 104960, 2018-Ohio-265, ¶ 66. On April 25, 2017, the parties jointly requested a continuance of the date of trial to August 21, 2017.\n\nBased on the foregoing analysis, we find that appellant’s statutory right to a speedy trial was not violated. The record reflects that appellant was brought to trial within the statutory speedy trial time constraints, and the extended delay in the commencement of trial primarily resulted from appellant’s own actions."}

We review felony sentences under the standard set forth in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2). State v. Marcum, 146 Ohio St.3d 516, 2016-Ohio-1002, 59 N.E.3d 1231, ¶ 16. R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) provides that when reviewing felony sentences, a reviewing court may overturn the imposition of consecutive sentences where the court 'clearly and convincingly' finds that (1) 'the record does not support the sentencing court’s findings under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)', or (2) 'the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.'\n\nR.C. 2929.14(C)(4) provides that in order to impose consecutive sentences, the trial court must find that consecutive sentences are (1) necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish the offender, (2) that such sentences would not be disproportionate to the seriousness of the conduct and to the danger the offender poses to the public, and (3) that one of the following applies:\n\n(a) The offender committed one or more of the multiple offenses while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing, was under a sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or 2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was under postrelease control for a prior offense.\n(b) At least two of the multiple offenses were committed as part of one or more courses of conduct, and the harm caused by two or more of the multiple offenses so committed was so great or unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses committed as part of any of the courses of conduct adequately reflects the seriousness of the offender’s conduct.\n(c) The offender’s history of criminal conduct demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime by the offender.\n\nCompliance with R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) requires the trial court to make the statutory findings at the sentencing hearing, which means that 'the [trial] court must note that it engaged in the analysis' and that it 'has considered the statutory criteria and specified which of the given bases warrants its decision.' State v. Bonnell, 140 Ohio St.3d 209, 2014-Ohio-3177, 16 N.E.3d 659, ¶ 26, quoting State v. Edmonson, 86 Ohio St.3d 324, 326, 715 N.E.2d 131 (1999).\nFurther, the reviewing court must be able to discern that the record contains evidence to support the findings. State v. Davis, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102639, 2015-Ohio-4501, ¶ 21, citing Bonnell at ¶ 29. A trial court is not, however, required to state its reasons in support of its consecutive sentence findings. State v. Johnson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106450, 2018-Ohio-3670, ¶ 49, citing Bonnell at ¶ 37.\n\nIn the instant matter, appellant appears to acknowledge that the trial court made the requisite findings pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). Nevertheless, appellant argues the trial court’s findings were 'perfunctory' and that the court offered 'essentially no rationale' in support of its findings. Appellant’s brief at 40. Appellant’s argument is misplaced. A trial court is not required to state its reasons in support of its consecutive sentence findings. See State v. Johnson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 106450, 2018-Ohio-3670, ¶ 49, citing Bonnell at ¶ 37.\n\nFurthermore, appellant appears to argue that consecutive sentences were not warranted and that a prison sentence of 15 years to life would adequately protect the public. In support of this argument, appellant asserts that if the parole board determines that he is, in fact, a threat to society in 15 years, they will simply not release him from prison. Essentially, appellant disagrees with the trial court’s findings.\n\nAs an initial matter, this court has upheld consecutive sentences that include a life sentence as long as the trial court complied with R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) and made the requisite findings. See State v. Bennett, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 105737, 2018-Ohio-287, ¶ 4 (this court upheld an aggregate sentence of life with parole eligibility after 27 years); State v. Peak, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102850, 2015-Ohio-4702, ¶ 6 (this court upheld the trial court’s decision to run life sentences with parole eligibility after ten years on two counts of rape consecutively); see also\nThe record reflects that the trial court made the requisite consecutive sentence findings during the sentencing hearing. In making the first finding, the trial court stated, 'consecutive sentences are necessary, again, to protect the public from future crimes by you and to punish you.' (Tr. 2357.) In making the second finding, the trial court stated, 'consecutive sentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of your conduct and to the danger that you pose the public.' (Tr. 2357.)\n\nIn making the third finding, the trial court determined that R.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(b) and (c) applied. Specifically, the trial court stated, 'this really has been a course of conduct here in terms of the misuse of the credit cards, obviously the harm caused to Miss Bewley and the arson and certainly your criminal history demonstrates that consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crimes by you.' (Tr. 2357-2358.)\n\nAfter reviewing the record, we find that the trial court did not err in imposing consecutive sentences. The record reflects that the trial court made the appropriate consecutive sentence findings, and the court engaged in the correct analysis required under R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). We do not clearly and convincingly find that the record does not support the trial court’s findings. Finally, the trial court incorporated its consecutive sentence findings into its November 30, 2017 sentencing journal entry, as required by Bonnell.

The trial court denied the request. Generally, jury instructions are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial court. When reviewing a lower court's decision not to instruct a jury in a certain manner, an appellate court should apply the abuse of discretion standard. Under Ohio Crim.R. 30(A), a trial court is required to 'fully and completely give the jury all instructions which are relevant and necessary for the jury to weigh the evidence and discharge its duty as the fact-finder.' A trial court does not err in failing to instruct the jury on an affirmative defense where the evidence is insufficient to support the instruction. In reviewing the record to ascertain the presence of sufficient evidence to support the giving of a proposed jury instruction, an appellate court should determine whether the record contains evidence from which reasonable minds might reach the conclusion sought by the instruction. Appellant argues he presented sufficient evidence of entrapment. He contends law enforcement had Padgett invade his life after a significant amount of time had passed when there was no romantic relationship between the two of them. The law enforcement officers instructed Padgett to use his love for her to get him to sell her drugs; she was told what to say and how to convince Appellant to give her drugs.

(Appellant's Brief at 13-16.)\n\n¶ 20 This district and other Ohio appellate courts have rejected the \"claim that Ohio's postconviction statute does not afford an adequate corrective process.\" State v. Hessler, 10th Dist. No. 01AP-1011, 2002-Ohio-3321, ¶ 73 (collecting cases). It is settled law that the doctrine of res judicata applies when considering a petition for postconviction relief. The application of principles of res judicata in postconviction relief proceedings is necessary to preserve the finality of judgments and the integrity of the appeals process. Furthermore, a petitioner's inability to immediately engage in discovery is a gate-keeping function of the postconviction relief statute, not a deprivation of due process. Id. Accordingly, the second assignment of error is overruled.\n\nC. Third Assignment of Error\n\n¶ 21 Conway's third assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred by granting the state's motion to dismiss the second and third grounds for relief in his petition. In these grounds for relief, Conway alleged that his initial trial attorney, Christopher Cicero, had conflicts of interest and provided ineffective assistance of counsel, resulting in a violation of Conway's rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. (Appellant's Brief at 17-20.)\n\n¶ 22 In the petition's second ground for relief, Conway alleged that Cicero operated under a conflict of interest because (1) he represented several witnesses at the time he represented Conway; (2) Cicero disclosed information protected by the attorney-client privilege to officers investigating the shooting; and (3) Cicero himself was under investigation for the murder of Andrew Dotson, whom Conway was convicted of killing, as well as a conspiracy to murder one of the state's witnesses in this case, Brian McWhorter. Conway argued that these conflicts \"adversely affected\" Cicero's representation of him and \"affected the outcome\" of the case. (July 14, 2016 Postconviction Petition, hereinafter \"petition\" at 27.)\nThe trial court concluded that Conway had failed to demonstrate prejudice because he \"merely [laid] out Cicero's conflicts of interest and a conclusory statement that prejudice resulted.\" (Jan. 6, 2017 Decision at 10.) The trial court also pointed out it had ordered Cicero's removal as Conway's counsel on June 13, 2002, a date \"well in advance of trial.\" Id. In addition, the trial court found that res judicata barred Conway from stating a claim based on Cicero's conflicts of interest because the information concerning his conflicts could have been raised during the first postconviction motion or even the direct appeal. Id.\n\n\"Where there is a right to counsel, the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution also guarantees that representation will be free from conflicts of interest.\" State v. Dillon, 74 Ohio St.3d 166, 167 (1995), citing State v. Gillard, 64 Ohio St.3d 304, 312 (1992). In Gillard, the Supreme Court of Ohio set forth the following standard for evaluation of a claim of conflicted counsel:\n\nWhere a trial court knows or reasonably should know of an attorney's possible conflict of interest in the representation of a person charged with a crime, the trial court has an affirmative duty to inquire whether a conflict of interest actually exists. The duty to inquire arises not only from the general principles of fundamental fairness, but from the principle that where there is a right to counsel, there is a correlative right to representation free from conflicts of interest.\n\nId. at syllabus.\n\nOn appeal, Conway argues that the trial court erred, and asserts that four categories of facts support his claim that Cicero operated under a conflict of interest. (Appellant's Brief at 18.) First, he points to evidence that Cicero represented several \"potential defendants\" in the case: Jimmy Turner, Rickey Turner, and Joe Epling. Id. This evidence consists of the police interviews with these individuals, which all took place on January 22, 2002, three days after the shooting. (Petition Ex. No. 2-4.) Each interview summary identifies Cicero as the attorney of each individual and states that he was present during the interview. The summaries do not mention Cicero or describe any interaction he had with the investigating officers, much less one that prejudiced Conway. Furthermore, even if Cicero continued to serve as these individuals' attorney while representing Conway, \"multiple representation does not violate the Sixth Amendment unless it gives rise to a\nconflict of interest.\" *Cuyler v. Sullivan*, 446 U.S. 335, 348 (1980). Conway does not explain how Cicero's representation of each interviewee created a conflict of interest. Our review of the interview summaries identifies no actions by Cicero that created a conflict.\n\nSecond, Conway argues that Cicero \"[d]ivulged information concerning Conway to the prosecution,\" thereby violating the attorney-client privilege. (Appellant's Brief at 18.) In his petition, Conway points to transcripts of two telephone conversations between Cicero and an assistant prosecutor that took place on May 27 and 29, 2002, and argues that Cicero revealed privileged information. (Petition at 59-62.) In Conway's successive petition for postconviction relief in his other death penalty conviction, he made the same argument. We rejected it for the following reasons, which we adopt here as well:\n\nIn his second petition for post-conviction relief, appellant relies upon the following recently discovered evidence: exhibit No. 6, which is a transcript of a June 12, 2002 interview of Cicero by FCSO officers Floyd and Scott; exhibit No. 7, which is a transcript of a May 29, 2002 interview of Cicero, conducted by prosecutor David DeVillers; and exhibit No. 8, which is a transcript of a telephone conversation between Cicero and DeVillers on an unspecified date. The subject matter discussed in these interviews is the murder of Andrew Dotson.\n\nAppellant claims that he would have moved the trial court to exclude evidence uncovered as a result of Cicero's unauthorized disclosure of privileged information, had he known that Cicero was cooperating with the investigation. Although the recently discovered interview transcripts reveal that Cicero was cooperating with investigators, this fact alone does not establish the existence of constitutional error in the context of his criminal trial. Indeed, as the Supreme Court observed in Conway I, and as this court stated in Conway II, the trial court removed Cicero as counsel for appellant at an early stage of the proceedings. Consequently, counsel's conflict of interest did not manifest itself in deficient performance at trial.\n\nMoreover, even with the benefit of the interview transcripts, appellant does not direct the court's attention to any specific information that was disclosed to investigators in violation of the attorney-client privilege, nor does he identify the specific evidence he would have sought to exclude from his trial. In short, even though the recently discovered interview transcripts establish that appellant's initial trial counsel may have violated attorney-client privilege by cooperating with investigators, appellant has not demonstrated by clear and\nconvincing evidence that no reasonable fact finder could have found him guilty absent evidence uncovered as a result of Cicero's cooperation.\n\nState v. Conway, 10th Dist. No. 12AP-412, 2013-Ohio-3741, ¶ 21-23.\n\n¶ 27 Here, the tapes Conway points to have even less relevance, as this petition does not concern his conviction for the murder of Andrew Dotson. Conway specifically points to statements that Cicero made to the prosecution suggesting that Conway would be surprised to discover that a particular individual had not been killed. (Petition at 61.) Notes that the prosecutor made at the conclusion of the transcript indicate that Cicero was cooperating with the prosecution because he believed that \"his client [was] out trying to kill witnesses or have someone do it.\" (Petition Ex. No. 11 at 16.)\n\n¶ 28 Any statement Conway made to Cicero regarding the potential murder of a witness was not subject to the attorney-client privilege. \"A communication is excepted from the attorney-client privilege if it is undertaken for the purpose of committing or continuing a crime or fraud.\" State ex rel. Nix v. Cleveland, 83 Ohio St.3d 379, 383 (1998). An attorney's action of divulging of such information to the state cannot plausibly be asserted as a conflict of interest that prejudices the client, particularly as such an action might save the life of an endangered witness. The argument that Cicero's statement violated any privilege or created a conflict is wholly without merit.\n\n¶ 29 Finally, Conway argues that Cicero suffered conflicts of interest because Cicero was under investigation for the murder of Andrew Dotson and a conspiracy to kill Brian McWhorter, one of the state's witnesses who ultimately testified against Conway in this case. (Appellant's Brief at 18.) The evidence attached to the petition supporting these allegations includes several interviews with Shawn Nightingale by homicide investigators (Petition Ex. Nos. 13-15.) In a May 28, 2002 interview, Nightingale reported that the night before Andrew Dotson's murder, Cicero had stated to himself and several people in Cicero's office, including Conway, that it would \"be a lot easier if\" Dotson were \"not around,\" and that he \"need[ed] to disappear.\" (Petition Ex. No. 13 at 2.) In an August 12, 2003 interview with an assistant prosecutor and a homicide detective, Nightingale made the same allegation. (Petition Ex. No. 14 at 2.) A homicide investigation report dated March 14, 2007 stated that Jamie Horton had been interviewed regarding his \"past criminal relationship\" with Cicero. (Petition Ex. No. 15.) Horton told detectives that he was present at a\nconversation in Cicero's office with Conway where Cicero had told them to \"eliminate\" any persons who had witnessed Conway shoot Jessie James, including Dotson and James. (Petition Ex. No. 15 at 2.) Horton also reported that he had been present at a meeting during which Cicero had told Conway to kill a witness identified as \"Brian McCorders\" who had seen the shooting at Dockside Dolls. Id.\n\n¶ 30 While this evidence is undeniably troubling, Conway fails to connect Cicero's actions to any identifiable prejudice that occurred during his trial. The fact is that the trial court removed Cicero as Conway's attorney on July 12, 2002, because the state intended to call him as a \"material witness.\" (Jul. 12, 2002 Jgmt. Entry.) This removal occurred well in advance of the January 2003 trial, where other attorneys represented Conway, and he fails to explain in his petition or on appeal how this removal did not satisfy the standard for resolving attorney conflicts of interest set forth in Gillard.\n\n¶ 31 Moreover, at the time the trial court removed Cicero, he was expected to testify about \"his meetings with a person by the name of Mr. Horton and conversations therewith pertaining to the killing of witnesses.\" (July 12, 2002 Jgmt. Entry.) Thus, in addition to a failure to demonstrate prejudice, Cicero's actions were part of the record before trial, and res judicata therefore bars these actions from being raised as grounds for postconviction relief. Steffen at 410. Finally, even if Nightingale's statements concerning Cicero were not available until after the trial or only uncovered during discovery conducted in a federal habeas proceeding, they are cumulative evidence of an issue that was present in the trial record before trial even began, as is apparent from the trial court's order removing Cicero as Conway's attorney. For this reason, none of this evidence overcomes the bar that res judicata places on postconviction relief premised on the conflicts of Cicero as Conway's attorney."}
{"index": "418-Conway", "allegation_num": "allegation_4", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT GRANTED THE STATE'S MOTION TO DISMISS THE FOURTH GROUND FOR RELIEF [] AND DENIED CONWAY FACTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND RELIEF.", "extracted_text": "¶ 33 In the fourth assignment of error, Conway argues that the trial court erred by dismissing the fourth ground of relief presented in his petition, in which he asserted that his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment were violated when the prosecution withheld information favorable to his defense. (Appellant’s Brief at 21.)\n\n¶ 34 Under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963), \"the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\" \"The evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A'reasonable probability' is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985).\n\n¶ 35 Three elements must be met to show a Brady violation. Beuke v. Houk, 537 F.3d 618, 633 (6th Cir.2008), citing Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 280 (1999). First, the evidence must be either exculpatory or impeaching, and therefore favorable to the accused. Id. Second, the prosecution must have suppressed the evidence in question, whether intentionally or not. Id. Third, the defendant must have suffered prejudice as a result to the suppression. Id.\n\n¶ 36 Conway identifies four categories of undisclosed information that he believes would have been favorable to his defense, each of which we consider in turn.\n\n¶ 37 First, Conway argues that the prosecution suppressed prior inconsistent statements of Brian McWhorter and Ronald Trent, both of whom testified against him. In his petition for relief, Conway identifies several police reports and interviews with McWhorter during which McWhorter denied seeing Conway in the parking lot of the shooting and denied seeing him with a gun. (Petition at 30-31.) Conway argues that those statements were inconsistent with McWhorter’s trial testimony, during which he stated that (1) he saw Conway immediately obtain a gun from the trunk of a car after Conway’s brother stated that he had just been stabbed, and (2) he saw Conway lowering his hand with a gun in it after shots were fired. (Petition at 31.)\n\n¶ 38 The police reports and interviews with McWhorter memorialize two initial interviews conducted with him early on January 24, 2002, during which McWhorter admitted that Conway was at the bar at the time of the shooting but denied knowing any other details. (Petition Ex. Nos. 5, 22 & 23.) A third interview occurred the same day, after McWhorter called the detectives himself and said that he wanted to tell them what really happened the night of the shooting. During the interview, McWhorter stated that on the night of the shooting, he heard Conway's brother Jeff tell Conway that he had just been stabbed, after which Conway left his view. Thereafter, McWhorter heard gunshots. He told the detectives that he did not see Conway with a gun. (Petition Ex. No. 24.)\n\n¶ 39 Even if these interviews were not available to Conway because the state withheld them, they do not amount to a violation under *Brady* because they are not inconsistent the statements that McWhorter made at trial. During his testimony, McWhorter stated that he had lied to the detectives during the initial two interviews because he had been \"scared.\" (Jan. 23, 2003 Tr. Vol. X at 1759.) McWhorter was cross-examined about these interviews by Conway's attorney at trial, during which he stated that he went to the police for the third interview after being \"jumped\" by Conway's friends. (Tr. Vol. X at 1781.) Thus, the interview reports were consistent with McWhorter's testimony and would not have provided grounds for impeaching McWhorter. In addition, even if McWhorter's trial testimony stating that he saw Conway with a gun were inconsistent with a previous statement, such inconsistency could not have prejudiced Conway, who admitted at trial that he fired the shots. *Conway II* at ¶ 19.\n\n¶ 40 Conway also asserts that a Brady violation occurred because the state withheld a letter from Ronald Trent to prosecutors in which Trent stated that he wanted to testify in exchange for a deal. (Petition at 31.) Attached to the petition is a letter from Trent to the Franklin County Prosecutor dated March 12, 2002, in which Trent states that he has \"detailed information on this case\" and is \"willing to work out a deal with your office.\" (Petition Ex. No. 26.) According to Conway, this statement was inconsistent with Trent's testimony at trial, where he stated that his motivation for testifying against Conway was \"because he laughed at someone else's pain from another killing.\" (Petition at 31; Tr. Vol. X at 1825.)\n\n¶ 41 The purported inconsistency cited by Conway would not have had an impeaching effect on Trent at trial. During his testimony, Trent admitted that he went to his initial meeting with the prosecutor hoping to make some kind of deal in exchange for providing information. (Tr. Vol. X at 1830.) In addition, Trent stated that he did make a deal allowing him to obtain work release while in prison in exchange for working with the Franklin County Sheriff's office to gather information. (Tr. Vol. X at 1831). Thus, the letter's\ncontents were not inconsistent with Trent's testimony, would not have had an impeaching effect, and do not support Conway's claim of a *Brady* violation.\n\n¶ 42 Second, Conway argues that the state suppressed statements made by eyewitnesses that identified individuals other than Conway as the shooter. (Appellant's Brief at 22.) The statements in question were part of reports prepared by police investigators describing initial leads obtained from interviewing persons who had been at the scene of the shooting, including the surviving victim. (Petition Ex. Nos. 5, 27-38, 41-43.) Many of the witness statements do not identify the shooter by name, and many fit Conway's physical description at the time of the shooting. Conway fails to connect any of these statements to the testimony of particular witnesses whose credibility they would have impeached. Furthermore, none of these statements were exculpatory because Conway, while testifying on his own behalf, admitted to the shooting at trial. Accordingly, we reject the contention that they support his allegation of a violation under *Brady*.\n\n¶ 43 Third, Conway argues that a *Brady* violation resulted from the prosecution's suppression of evidence that he believes contradicted its theory of the case. (Appellant's Brief at 23.) He again mentions the witness statements, which, for the reasons just discussed, do not demonstrate a *Brady* violation. *Id.*\n\n¶ 44 Conway also cites to what he describes as \"the statement of the security guard\" in exhibit Nos. 54-56. A security guard working at an apartment complex next to the bar where the shooting occurred heard gunfire, saw people running, and saw one man get into a silver Chevrolet that he then drove onto the apartment complex premises. He witnessed the car strike another car before the driver got out and ran into one of the buildings. The security guard reported the license number of the car to the police. (Petition Ex. Nos. 55-56.) The police interviewed the person to whom the car was registered, who claimed not to be at the bar that night. (Petition Ex. No. 54.) It is not clear how this report contradicts the state's theory of the case, and Conway does not elaborate on the assertion that it does. Many people were involved in the fight that immediately preceded the shooting, and it is logical that many of them would flee at the sound of shots being fired.\n\n¶ 45 Conway also cites to a police interview with an employee of the club named Christopher Laney. (Appellant's Brief at 24; Petition Ex. No. 60.) Laney recounts attempting to separate individuals after a physical assault that occurred inside the club, escorting the victim out, and then witnessing the melee in the parking lot. At that time, an individual who did not match Conway's description pulled what Laney believed to be a gun out of his pocket and pointed it at him. Laney then heard five or six gunshots. (Petition Ex. No. 60.) Once again, Conway does not explain how this information contradicts the state's case. Laney did not state that the man he saw fired the shots he heard. In fact, Laney's narrative suggests that the man he saw did not fire the shots because the encounter with the man holding the gun was nearly contemporaneous with the sound of gunshots and Laney did not report that the man fired the weapon. The interview is merely evidence that another individual besides Conway had a firearm that night. Finally, it must be noted once again that neither Laney's statement nor the security guard's statements exculpate Conway, who admitted to firing the shots that struck the victims.\n\n¶ 46 In addition, Conway also cites to exhibit No. 61 of his petition with the conclusory assertion that it contains \"statements of other witnesses whose statements impeached the prosecution's case.\" (Appellant's Brief at 24.) The exhibit contains an interview with one witness, Michael Nolasco, conducted on January 19, 2002, who witnessed the shooting and saw the shooter flee in an SUV. It is not clear how Nolasco's statement contradicts the state's case. Troy Ankrum, a bouncer, testified at trial that the shooter and others fled in an SUV. (Tr. Vol. VIII at 1250.) Furthermore, during his testimony, Conway admitted fleeing the scene in a vehicle. (Tr. Vol. XIII at 1250.) Thus, Nolasco's statement appears consistent with the state's case.\n\n¶ 47 Fourth, Conway cites to the evidence discussed in the previous assignment of error pertaining to his first attorney, Christopher Cicero, and asserts that this evidence was suppressed by the state. Conway does not explain how any of the evidence concerning Cicero was impeachable or exculpatory. For the reasons previously discussed, Cicero's statements were far from exculpatory, and because the state never actually called Cicero as a witness, they could not have been used to impeach him.\n\n¶ 48 For the foregoing reasons, the trial court did not err when it dismissed the fourth ground for relief in Conway's petition. Accordingly, the fourth assignment of error is overruled."}
{"index": "418-Conway", "allegation_num": "allegation_5", "allegation": "THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT GRANTED THE STATE'S MOTION TO DISMISS THE FIFTH TO ELEVENTH GROUNDS FOR RELIEF [] RELIEF AND DENIED CONWAY FACTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND RELIEF.", "extracted_text": "Conway asserts that the trial court erroneously dismissed the fifth through eleventh grounds for relief in his petition, all of which alleged that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during his trial. (Appellant's Brief at 25-26.)\n\nUnder the two-pronged test for ineffective assistance of counsel set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984), a defendant must first show that the counsel's performance was deficient by demonstrating that there were \"errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\" Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance resulted in prejudice, which must demonstrate that the defendant failed to receive a fair trial with a reliable result. Id.\n\nFirst, Conway argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable trial phase investigation. He criticizes their investigation of Ronald Trent because they failed to uncover several allegedly false statements made by Trent during his testimony that he believes could have been used to impeach Trent. The new evidence Conway cites to support this argument consists of transcripts of depositions recently conducted with the attorneys who represented him at trial. (Appellant's Brief at 27.)\n\nRes judicata applies to this argument concerning several of these statements. Conway argues that Trent perjured himself by stating that the mother of the victim in his case had approved his plea bargain. (Appellant's Brief at 27.) However, we considered this argument in Conway's previous petition. Conway I at ¶ 52 (stating that the mother of the victim \"admitted on cross-examination that she voluntarily signed a letter stating that she was in agreement with the deal\" and rejecting the assertion that her alleged disagreement with the plea deal demonstrated trial counsel's failure to prepare for Trent's testimony).\n\nRes judicata also applies to Conway's assertion that Trent inaccurately stated the time that Conway arrived at the bar, and that this statement could have been used to impeach Trent if his counsel had reviewed a surveillance videotape that was not admitted into evidence. (Appellant's Brief at 27.) The trial transcript reveals that this matter was addressed at length by Conway's attorney, the prosecutor, and the trial court, and could therefore have been raised in the direct appeal. (Tr. Vol. XVI at 2771-73.) The purported new evidence on this matter is simply an opinion elicited by Conway's current attorneys from his previous attorneys as to whether it would have had an impeachable effect, and, given the record, is insufficient to overcome the matter being barred by res judicata.\n\nConway also argues that Trent inaccurately testified that his brother, Jeff Conway, solicited persons to come to the bar to engage in the parking lot fight, and that Mandel Williams, one of the victims, had actually done so. According to Conway, this fact could have been used to impeach Trent. (Appellant's Brief at 27.) Conway cites no portion of the record to support his assertions that Jeff Conway did not actually ask persons to come to the club and that Williams had done so. Furthermore, even if Williams had asked people to come and participate in the fight, it is unclear why this means that Jeff Conway could not have asked the same of his friends. Finally, even if Conway had cited a portion of the record to support these assertions, they would not have impeached Trent. His actual testimony asserted that Conway had confided in him that Jeff called only Conway and told him to come to the club. (Tr. Vol. X at 1820.)\n\nConway also asserts that his counsel was ineffective for failing to uncover another incidence of Trent testifying as an informant, thereby assisting the prosecution in the conviction of a fellow inmate. The revelation of this fact would have had minimal impact on Trent's credibility with the jury. As previously discussed, Trent's motivations for testifying were disclosed to the jury. Conway has presented no new evidence to alter the conclusion we reached when resolving his first petition for postconviction relief; his trial counsel's investigation of Trent was not deficient and could not support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Conway I at ¶ 52, 63.\n\nConway makes several other arguments concerning his trial counsel's alleged failure to adequately prepare for trial. He argues that they failed to investigate Jeff Conway's belief that his life was in danger the night of the shooting because an individual that had previously attempted to assault him and had made threats was in the parking lot the night of the shooting. (Appellant's Brief at 28.) Conway does not explain the relevancy of this information to his defense. At trial, Conway testified that he shot at Williams after Jeff Conway identified Williams as the person who had just stabbed him. The presence of\nanother individual who had previously threatened Jeff Conway would not have bolstered Conway's claim that he shot Williams but did not intend to kill him.\n\nConway also argues that his trial counsel failed to reasonably investigate Brian McWhorter, citing the inconsistent statements that McWhorter gave to police. (Appellant's Brief at 28-29.) As discussed in the fourth assignment of error, McWhorter admitted in his direct testimony that he lied during his initial police interviews because he feared repercussions from Conway. Thus, the information in the investigative reports is merely cumulative of information available to Conway's attorneys at trial. Furthermore, the subject matter of McWhorter's direct testimony was available to Conway's attorneys before trial. Prosecutors requested a videotaped deposition of him because they were afraid that he would \"flee the state or be eliminated by associates of the defendant prior to trial.\" (May 21, 2002 Mot.; May 22, 2002 Order.) Thus, Conway's attorneys had the opportunity to depose McWhorter before trial and were aware of the inconsistent statements he made to police before cross-examining him. There is no new evidence to support Conway's assertion that his trial attorneys were deficient in their investigation of McWhorter.\n\nThe remainder of Conway's arguments alleging that his trial counsel failed to conduct a reasonable trial phase investigation refer to the same evidence discussed in the fourth assignment of error. (Appellant's Brief at 29.) Citing several conflicting statements of witnesses, Conway argues that his trial counsel conducted an unreasonable investigation of the identity of the shooter. However, Conway admitted shooting the victims. Thus, it was not unreasonable for his trial counsel to not investigate additional suspects. Conway also points to the evidence that he believes contradicts the state's theory of the case. Id. As discussed in the fourth assignment of error, this evidence was not inconsistent with the state's theory of the case, and would not have assisted his defense if his trial attorneys had uncovered it. The same can be said regarding the evidence pertaining to his initial attorney, Christopher Cicero, which was far from exculpatory and, in fact, corroborated the state's allegation that Conway was involved in a conspiracy to murder McWhorter. In short, no new evidence supports the assertion that his trial counsel failed to conduct a reasonable trial phase investigation.\n\nConway's second ineffective assistance of counsel argument alleges that his trial counsel unreasonably failed to obtain a ballistic and firearms expert to rebut Trent's\ntestimony concerning a statement Conway made to him about the penetrating ability of a.45 caliber pistol. He also faults his trial counsel for not calling an ophthalmologist to opine about his poor eyesight. (Appellant’s Brief at 32.) Both matters are res judicata. The recent depositions of his trial attorneys that Conway cites to do not demonstrate why these matters could not have been raised in his direct appeal. Furthermore, Trent’s statement was addressed in Conway's first postconviction petition. Conway I at ¶ 45-47.\n\nConway's third argument concerning ineffective assistance of counsel alleges that his trial counsel performed unreasonably during voir dire by failing to address the issue of race and failing to peremptorily strike a juror who was in favor of the death penalty. (Appellant’s Brief at 32-34.) These matters are barred by res judicata. The voir dire issue concerning race was raised in the direct appeal and addressed by the Supreme Court of Ohio. Conway II at ¶ 170-71. The argument concerning the juror in favor of the death penalty was raised and addressed in Conway's first postconviction motion. Conway I at ¶ 51-55.\n\nConway's fourth argument concerning ineffective assistance of counsel alleges that his trial counsel performed unreasonably during the state's case in chief. He argues that the attorneys failed to reasonably cross-examine Trent and McWhorter, as well as investigating officers concerning eyewitnesses and Cicero. (Appellant’s Brief at 35-37.) However, the issues he raises, such as statements Trent made about his own plea bargain or reasons for testifying, have all been discussed and we have rejected Conway's assertion that they were inconsistent or prejudicial to Conway. He also faults his attorneys for not using the surveillance video from the club. This matter is res judicata, as it was addressed by the Supreme Court of Ohio in Conway's direct appeal. Conway II at ¶ 152.\n\nConway's fifth argument to support his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, Conway argues that his attorneys performed unreasonably during the defense case in chief. He cites their failure to have an expert's testimony admitted who had prepared a computer simulation that he believes would have bolstered his claim that he did not aim the gun at Williams with the intent to kill. (Appellant’s Brief at 39-40.) This matter is res judicata, as the trial court excluded the expert, the issue was appealed, and the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the ruling after an extensive analysis in Conway II at ¶ 111-23.\nConway also faults his trial attorneys' failure to call a witness who would have confirmed that one of the individuals present at the club the night of the shooting had previously assaulted Jeff Conway. (Appellant's Brief at 40.) As discussed previously, a line of inquiry concerning the presence of someone who had previously assaulted his brother was not relevant to the issue of whether Conway fired the gun at Williams with the requisite intent. Conway testified that he saw Williams, believed Williams had stabbed his brother, and aimed the gun in his direction before pulling the trigger. Conway I at ¶ 19. For the same reason, his counsel was not ineffective for failing to call eyewitnesses who believed someone other than Conway was the shooter, as he admitted to pulling the trigger. (Appellant's Brief at 41.)\n\nConway also argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorneys failed to prepare him to testify at trial. He claims that if his attorneys had known that Trent had stated to investigating officers that Conway kept shooting because he knew that the shots from a.45 caliber weapon would pass through Gervais and hit Williams, his attorneys would have advised him not to testify. (Appellant's Brief at 42.)\n\nWe note that there is some controversy as to whether Conway's trial attorneys had notice that Trent had made such a statement. In a deposition conducted on August 9, 2012, Robert Suhr, one of Conway's trial attorneys, claimed that he did not know that Trent was going to make the statement. (Petition Ex. No. 64 at 139-40.) However, in an affidavit attached to the state's memorandum in response to Conway's first petition for postconviction relief, assistant prosecutor Cheryl Pritchard swore that a transcript of an investigative interview with Trent where he made a similar statement was provided to Conway's attorneys in advance of trial. (June 21, 2004 Appx. and Exs. for Respondent's Response, Ex. No. 3.) However, because the issue was raised in Conway's first petition for postconviction relief, the matter is res judicata. Conway I at ¶ 45-47.\n\nHe also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to provide him with audio recordings of his conversation with Trent before he was cross-examined. (Appellant's Brief at 43.) Conway raised this precise issue in his direct appeal and res judicata bars him from raising it here. Conway II at ¶ 172-74.\n\nFinally, Conway argues that his trial counsel performed unreasonably by failing to make a number of objections at trial, including the following: the bailiff\nadministering the oath to the jury instead of the clerk; a violation of Conway's right to a public trial; the accuracy of the transcripts of Trent's conversations with Conway; Trent's reference to Conway's other pending murder charge; the admission of the testimony of David DeVillers, a former assistant prosecutor; the admission of Benjamin Bechtel's testimony about the victim's background; Conway's exclusion from the jury instruction conference; and the course-of-conduct death penalty specification. (Appellant's Brief at 44.)\n\nConway does not explain why an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on the failure to object to these issues could not have been raised on direct appeal. All of the issues Conway raises were part of the record at the time of the direct appeal. It must be restated that \"constitutional issues which would otherwise be impossible to reach because the evidence supporting those issues is not contained in the record of the petitioner's criminal conviction\" is the only appropriate basis for filing a petition for postconviction relief. State v. Murphy, 10th Dist. No. 00AP-233 (Dec. 26, 2000), citing State v. Jackson, 64 Ohio St.2d 107, 413 (1980). Although Conway's new counsel have quizzed his trial attorneys about their knowledge of the law and reasoning for not objecting to the issues he mentions, these answers do not alter the reality that the failure to object to them was plainly part of the record by the time of the direct appeal. As such, the failure to object to them could have been part of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim Conway made at that time. For this reason, res judicata bars them from being considered in this successive petition. Steffen at 410. Moreover, many of the issues that the trial attorneys failed to object to were considered on direct appeal. See Conway II."}

Specifically, Goney argues that pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b), the jury, not the trial court, was required to find that Goney attempted to cause, threatened to cause, or actually caused serious physical harm before\nthe trial court could impose sentence for the RVO specifications.\n\n{¶ 25} R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b) states in pertinent part:\n\n(b) The court shall impose on an offender the longest prison term authorized or required for the offense and shall impose on the offender an additional definite prison term of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten years if all of the following criteria are met:\n\n(i) The offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the Revised Code that the offender is a repeat violent offender.\n\n(ii) The offender within the preceding twenty years has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more offenses described in division (CC)(1) of section 2929.01 of the Revised Code * * *\n\n(iii) The offense or offenses of which the offender currently is convicted * * *\n\n* [is] any felony of the second degree that is an offense of violence and the trier of fact finds that the offense involved an attempt to cause or a threat to cause serious physical harm to a person or resulted in serious physical harm to a person.\n\n{¶ 26} Based upon the language in R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), Goney argues that the jury, not the trial court, was required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he attempted to cause or threatened to cause serious physical harm, or that his actions resulted in serious physical harm. Each crime for which Goney was convicted required him to be found guilty of inflicting, attempting to inflict, or threatening to inflict only physical harm, not serious physical harm.\nGoney was ultimately convicted of Count I, robbery (R.C. 2911.02(A)(2)), Count III, kidnapping (R.C. 2905.01(A)(2)), and Count IV, abduction (R.C. 2905.01(A)(2)). As previously stated, the trial court merged Count IV into Count III. The trial court sentenced Goney to a mandatory eight years in prison for robbery. Upon finding Goney to be a repeat violent offender, the trial court imposed an additional two years in prison to be served consecutively to his eight-year robbery sentence. With respect to his sentence for kidnapping, the trial court sentenced Goney to a mandatory eight years in prison. Again, finding Goney to be a repeat violent offender, the trial court imposed an additional two years in prison to be served consecutively to his eight-year kidnapping sentence. The trial court then ordered that Goney’s sentences for Counts I and III be served consecutively to one another, for an aggregate sentence of twenty years in prison.\n\nR.C. 2911.02(A)(2) states in pertinent part:\n\n(A) No person, in attempting or committing a theft offense or in fleeing immediately after the attempt or offense, shall do any of the following:\n\n(2) Inflict, attempt to inflict, or threaten to inflict physical harm on another[.]\n\nR.C. 2905.01(A)(2) states in pertinent part:\n\n(A) No person, by force, threat, or deception, * * *, shall remove another from the place where the other person is found or restrain the liberty of the other person, for any of the following purposes:\n\n(2) To facilitate the commission of any felony or flight thereafter[.]\n\nInitially, we note that we agree with the Eleventh District Court of Appeals in State v. Payne, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2004-L-118, 2005-Ohio-7043, in which the court held that in order to be constitutionally permissible under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530\nU.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), “any fact, other than a prior conviction, must be determined by a jury or admitted by the appellant.” (Emphasis sic.) Id. at ¶ 114. Thus, any fact other than a prior conviction that is found by a jury or admitted by the defendant complies with Apprendi, regardless of whether it relates to a prior or current conviction. State v. Wilson, __ N.E.3d __, 2018-Ohio-902, ¶ 90 (11th Dist.).\n\n¶ 31 It is undisputed that in the instant case, Goney did not admit to any allegations that he attempted to cause or threatened serious physical harm, or that his actions resulted in serious physical harm with respect to any of the offenses for which he was convicted. Accordingly, under Apprendi, Goney was entitled to have a jury decide whether he should be designated as a repeat violent offender. See State v. Bishop, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2014-CA-190, 2015-Ohio-3023, ¶ 19–21.\n\n¶ 32 Nevertheless, as the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), “nothing prevents a defendant from waiving his Apprendi rights [to a jury determination of every element of the charge]. *** Even a defendant who stands trial may consent to judicial fact-finding as to sentence enhancements, which may well be in his interest if relevant evidence would prejudice him at trial.” Id. at 310. While the Sixth Amendment generally prohibits judicial fact-finding, there is an “exception for prior criminal convictions and the defendant's consent to judicial fact-finding.” State v. Hunter, 123 Ohio St.3d 164, 2009-Ohio-4147, 915 N.E.2d 292, ¶ 30, citing State v. Foster, 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470, ¶ 7.\n\n¶ 33 Prior to trial, Goney filed a motion in limine in which he noted that pursuant to R.C. 2941.149(B), “[t]he court shall determine the issue of whether an offender is a repeat violent offender.” Therefore, according to Goney's liminal motion, “[t]he issue of\nwhether the Defendant is a repeat violent offender is a question for the court, not the jury.” Accordingly, Goney requested that the trial court determine whether he should be designated as a RVO. The trial court granted Goney’s motion in limine at a hearing where Goney was present. Thus, Goney consented to judicial fact-finding regarding his designation as a repeat violent offender.\n\n¶ 34 That is not the end of our analysis, however. In the instant case, although the trial court was asked to determine if Goney was guilty of the RVO specifications, the trial court was still required to make all of the appropriate findings based upon the evidence before enhancing Goney’s sentence as an RVO. The trial court was only permitted to enhance Goney’s sentence relative to the RVO specifications if, as trier of fact, the trial court found appellant's actions threatened, attempted, or resulted in “serious physical harm” to the victim. See State v. Brown, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 10AP-836 and 10AP-845, 2011-Ohio-3159, ¶ 23, fn. 2 (holding the trial court properly enhanced the defendant's sentence for second-degree felony robbery only because the indictment for the attached RVO specification alleged “serious physical harm” and the jury instructions for the robbery count included a finding of “serious physical harm”); State v. Davis, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 152, 2009-Ohio-5079, ¶ 36 (holding that, although the defendant may have in fact threatened to cause serious physical harm to the robbery victims, only the trier of fact was permitted to make such a finding for purposes of penalty enhancement).\n\n¶ 35 Initially, we note that nowhere in Goney’s indictment did the State allege that he attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm,” or that his actions resulted in “serious physical harm” with respect to any of the offenses for which he was\nconvicted. Moreover, the jury instructions contain no mention of “serious physical harm.” Most importantly, the trial court did not make a finding that Goney attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm” against the complaining witness, Melissa Wright, before finding him guilty of the RVO specifications, and the trial record contains no threat of serious physical harm. In fact, at the sentencing hearing held on July 10, 2017, the trial court stated the following:\n\nThe Court: As recorded in the Court’s repeat violent offender entry, the Court found the Defendant to be a repeat violent offender, and pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b) finds the following: The Defendant is convicted of a R.C. 2941.149 specification that the Defendant is a repeat violent offender.\n\nThe offense the Defendant is currently convicted of is a second degree felony that is an offense of violence, and the trier of fact finds that the offense involved an attempt or a threat to cause physical harm to a person or result in serious physical harm to a person.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n¶ 36 Here, we find that the trial court made the proper findings with respect to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(i) and (ii). Specifically, the trial court found that Goney was “convicted of a specification of the type described in section 2941.149 of the Revised Code that the offender is a repeat violent offender,” and he “within the preceding twenty years has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to three or more offenses described in division (CC)(1) of section 2929.01 of the Revised Code * * *.” Id.\n\n¶ 37 However, with respect to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), the record establishes\nthat the trial court failed to find that Goney attempted to cause or threatened “serious physical harm” against a person before finding him guilty of the RVO specifications. Rather, as noted above, the trial court found “that the offense involved an attempt or a threat to cause physical harm to a person.” (Emphasis added.) Simply put, “physical harm” and “serious physical harm” represent two distinct legal standards and cannot be used interchangeably. Therefore, pursuant to the clear language in R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), the trial court failed to make the proper findings. Furthermore, although the trial court ostensibly found “that the offense involved * * * serious physical harm to a person,” there is no evidence in the record to support such a finding, with regard to Wright based on the evidence surrounding the robbery of the Fairborn Circle K. Thus, because the trial court failed to make the proper findings pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(B)(2)(b)(iii), it erred when it found Goney guilty of the RVO specifications.\n\n¶ 38 Goney’s first assignment of error is sustained, and each of his two-year sentences for RVO specifications are vacated."}

State v. Johnson, 2d Montgomery No. 26323, 2015–Ohio–347, ¶ 14, citing State v. Jenkins, 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 198, 473 N.E.2d 264 (1984), fn. 29. Kidnapping and robbery are not always allied offenses of similar import subject to merger, however, because they can involve distinct acts. Even when they involve the same conduct, they also each can involve a separate animus. “A separate animus for kidnapping exists where (1) ‘the restraint is prolonged, the confinement is secretive, or the movement is so substantial as to demonstrate a significance independent of the other offense,’ or (2) ‘the asportation or restraint of the victim subjects the victim to a substantial increase in risk of harm separate and apart from that involved in the underlying crime.’ ” Id. at ¶ 14, citing State v. Logan, 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 397 N.E.2d 1345 (1975), syllabus.\n\nIn the instant case, we see no error in the trial court's failure to merge the kidnapping involving Wright with the robbery. The record establishes that Goney ordered Wright inside the convenience store, and while he pointed a BB gun at her, Goney demanded all of the money in the cash register. Wright testified that Goney put the money in a black bag that he was carrying with him. Goney also ordered Wright to give him the money in the store’s second cash register and a blue coupon folder, but she showed him that neither the second register nor folder contained any money. At that point, Goney ordered Wright into a back room in the store where she remained until Goney had fled the scene."}

Barrow’s counsel expressed concern that the interview may have changed his approach.\n\n{¶20} The assistant prosecuting attorney stated that he had given this information to Buck’s and Barrow’s counsel, but that they had been represented by\nseveral attorneys. The assistant prosecutor stated that his case file was voluminous and he could not recall if he had specifically relayed this information to Buck's or Barrow's current counsel, but he had asked Detective Hilbert to give them as much information as they needed.\n\n{¶21} The trial court stated that there was no evidence that the prosecutor had withheld this information from defense counsel. It suggested that Buck's counsel finish his cross-examination of Detective Hilbert. The court would then give Buck's and Barrow's counsel an opportunity to talk to Detective Hilbert outside the presence of the jury to discover if there was any new material related to Detective Hilbert's second interview of George.\n\n{¶22} Buck's counsel stated that he had no issue with Detective Hilbert or the prosecuting attorney. Instead, his issue was with George who had testified that he had told Detective Hilbert in his February 7, 2014 interview that he had met Barrow to sell him marijuana, when this information was not in his original statement. Buck's counsel told the court that he had covered this inconsistency during his cross-examination of Detective Hilbert.\n\n{¶23} The next day, following defense counsels' off-the-record discussion with Detective Hilbert, the trial court stated on the record that Detective Hilbert's second interview with George had covered only the discrepancies between George's February 7, 2014 statement and his and Barrow's phone records and had not addressed any additional information. George had acknowledged during this second interview that he had met Barrow to sell him marijuana.\n\n{¶24} Buck's counsel resumed his cross-examination of Detective Hilbert. Barrow's counsel then cross-examined Detective Hilbert extensively about his second interview with George, the inconsistencies between George's first and second\nstatements, and his failure to testify at trial consistently with his first statement. Barrow's counsel additionally questioned Detective Hilbert about his disclosure of this second statement to counsel, and Hilbert's failure to mention the second interview in his testimony at the hearing on codefendant Buck's motion to suppress.\n\n{¶25} At the close of the state's case, Barrow's counsel moved for a mistrial on the basis that he had believed that the police had interviewed George only one time, and that Barrow had been prejudiced as a result of the state's failure to turn over the information to him about a second interview. The trial court denied the motion for a mistrial on the basis that it had given defense counsel an opportunity to question Detective Hilbert about the content of the second interview and to extensively cross-examine Detective Hilbert about his disclosure of the statement and its impact on George's trial testimony."}

Complicity is where a person ‘acting with the kind of culpability required for the commission of an offense * * * aid[s] or abets another in committing the offense.’ R.C. 2923.03(A)(2). To support a conviction for complicity by aiding and abetting, the state must show that the defendant assisted, encouraged, cooperated with, advised, or incited the principal in the commission of the crime and that the defendant shared in the criminal intent of the principal. State v. Johnson, 93 Ohio St.3d 240, 754 N.E.2d 796 (2001), syllabus. Aiding and abetting can be inferred by presence, companionship, and conduct before and after the offense is committed. Id. at 245.\n\nGeorge testified that Barrow had contacted him the day of the kidnapping under the pretense of purchasing marijuana from him and they had arranged a meeting. After some coaxing from Barrow, George got into Barrow's van to sell Barrow marijuana. Barrow and another man immediately began assaulting George from behind. As George struggled to escape, Barrow threatened to shoot him. Afraid for his life, George stopped struggling. The two men then bound George with duct tape and rope, wiped his neck and clothing with bleach, and drove away. George was then held for ransom until the following afternoon when he was able to escape.\n\nTelephone records and testimony from Kellam, Detective Hilbert, and Rucker established that shortly thereafter Buck and other unidentified men called Kellam demanding money and threatening to kill George if Kellam did not pay. Ransom drops were attempted at two separate locations. Telephone records and text messages detailed communications between Barrow, Buck, Watson, and Rucker. Rucker testified that he and Watson had ‘babysat’ George, that George had been scared for his life, and that George had kept asking Rucker if he was going to let him go. When viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, this evidence could have convinced a rational trier of fact that Barrow had acted as a principal or in concert with codefendants Buck, Watson, and Rucker to purposely by force, threat, or deception remove George from the place where he was found or restrain him of his liberty for the purpose of holding him for ransom. See Buck, Hamilton App. No. C-160320, 2017-Ohio-8242, at ¶ 28-49; Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at 386, 678 N.E.2d 541."}

Barrow’s counsel told the court that he had researched the 2007 matter and found another attorney’s name listed. Given his heavy case load, however, he could not specifically recall if he had represented Buck.\n\nThe trial court expressed its skepticism of any conflict by stating that the trial was in its second week, Barrow’s counsel had been representing him for some time, and there had been earlier court settings where Buck could have raised the claimed conflict. The court pointed out that Barrow had testified that Buck had nothing to do with the charged offenses, and that Barrow’s counsel had done nothing to try to incriminate Buck. Buck responded by stating that he had not realized earlier that there was a potential conflict. Barrow did not object or express any concern.\n\nBarrow argues on appeal that the trial court erred by failing to inquire further into this alleged conflict of interest. He argues that once the trial court learned that Barrow’s counsel had represented Buck in the prior unrelated criminal matter, the court should have questioned Barrow’s counsel about whether he had given Barrow advice or had questioned certain witnesses in order to favor Buck rather than to assist Barrow. Barrow further asserts that because his testimony exonerated Buck, the trial court was required to investigate whether his counsel had urged him to testify because this advice would have reflected an actual conflict of interest.\n\nPrior to Barrow’s testimony, Barrow’s counsel had informed the trial court outside of the presence of the jury that Barrow had decided to testify against counsel’s advice. Absent evidence that Barrow’s counsel’s basic strategic decisions were influenced by his representation of Buck nine years earlier in an unrelated matter, the trial court had no duty to make further inquiries into the existence of a conflict of interest. *State v. Tucker*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-020821, 2003-Ohio-6056, ¶ 30; *State v.

That section states that a petition for postconviction relief claiming a violation of a constitutional right must be filed no later than 180 days after the expiration of the time for filing the appeal. See R.C. 2953.21(A)(2). The time requirement for postconviction relief, pursuant to R.C. 2953.21(A), is jurisdictional. State v. Williams, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100639, 2014-Ohio-3589, ¶ 7.\n\nHarrison’s petition for postconviction relief is facially untimely. Nevertheless, an exception to the time requirement exists if it can be demonstrated that (1) the petitioner was unavoidably prevented from discovering the facts relied on in the claim for relief or that the United States Supreme Court recognized a new federal or state right that applies retroactively to persons in the petitioner’s situation, and the petition asserts a claim based on that right; and (2) there is clear and convincing evidence that, but for the constitutional error at trial, no reasonable trier of fact would have found the petitioner guilty of the offense. See R.C. 2953.23(A)(1). “The phrase ‘unavoidably prevented’ from discovery of facts warranting postconviction relief means that a defendant was unaware of those facts and was unable to learn of them through reasonable diligence.” State v. Short, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 82246, 2003-Ohio-3538, ¶ 9.\n\nHarrison gave no basis for the court to find that he had been unavoidably prevented from raising the first claim in a timely manner. The first ground for relief claims that the police withheld exculpatory evidence in violation of *Brady v. Maryland*, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). The allegedly exculpatory evidence was medical records in which the victim supposedly gave a different account of how many times she had been raped and when those rapes occurred. Harrison maintains that these records were not turned over to the defense until just before the state concluded its case-in-chief, when the only remaining witness for the state was a police detective. Harrison claimed in his petition that the medical records “are favorable to my defense, showing no evidence of sexual conduct.”\n\nHarrison admitted that the medical records were turned over in time for trial — “the medical records were withheld and not turned over to the defense until the last day of testimony after the witnesses, including the accuser, had already testified and left the courtroom. Thus, permitting the defense to question only the detective about the findings in the medical report.” Petition to vacate or set aside judgment of conviction or sentence, at 3. Even though he complains that he did not personally see the medical records before trial, there is no question that the records were provided to the defense and were the basis of questioning at trial. Harrison was thus aware that the medical records existed at the time of trial, so he has failed to show that he was unavoidably prevented from raising the issue of the medical records at an earlier time. In fact, Harrison raised the issue of the medical records as part of a Brady claim in federal court. The Sixth Circuit rejected that claim, finding that Harrison “could have presented his Brady * * * claims in his 2011 habeas petition.” Harrison, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 23219, at 6. That finding reinforces our conclusion that Harrison could have raised his Brady claims well before he brought them in his petition for postconviction relief."}

Hawkins’ claim of prejudice is based on the fact that the only two persons who could potentially corroborate what happened on the night in question are now deceased.\n\n“An unjustifiable delay between the commission of an offense and a defendant's indictment therefor, which results in actual prejudice to the defendant, is a violation of the right to due process of law under Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.” State v. Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097 (1984), paragraph two of the syllabus. “Once a defendant presents evidence of actual prejudice, the burden shifts to the state to produce evidence of a justifiable reason for the delay.” (Citations omitted.) State v. Jones, 148 Ohio St.3d 167, 2016-Ohio-5105, 69 N.E.3d 688, ¶ 13.\n\nDecisions on “actual prejudice” involve “‘a delicate judgment based on the circumstances of each case.’” State v. Walls, 96 Ohio St.3d 437, 2002-Ohio-5059, 775 N.E.2d 829, ¶ 52, quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 325, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971). To make this assessment, “courts are to consider the evidence as it exists when the indictment is filed and the prejudice the defendant will suffer at trial due to the delay.” Walls at ¶ 52, citing Luck at 154. (Other citation omitted.) However, “speculative prejudice does not satisfy the defendant's burden.” Jones at ¶ 20, citing Luck at ¶ 56. (Other citation omitted.)\n\nIn the case before us, the trial court heard from the following witnesses at the evidentiary hearings in connection with Hawkins’ motion to dismiss: Brian Hawkins;\nWayne Miller, Hawkins’ private investigator; Carol Ewing, a retired detective with the Dayton Police Department (“DPD”); Lindsey Dulaney, a current detective with the DPD Special Victims’ Unit (“SVU”); Gary Ware, an investigator with the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office; and Justin Hayes, a training detective for the DPD SVU. The testimony of these individuals revealed the following factual background.\n\n¶ 12 In July 2002, Ewing was a detective assigned to the DPD sexual assault child endangerment unit. Ewing was assigned a case involving A.J., who had allegedly been raped in the early morning hours of July 30, 2002, while she was a runaway from a foster home. The rape occurred outdoors behind the Wesley Center, which was located on Delphos Avenue, in Dayton, Ohio.¹ At the time, A.J. was fifteen years old.\n\n¶ 13 After the alleged rape, A.J. ran to a nearby Burger King, which was located a few blocks from the Wesley Center, and pounded on the restaurant’s door. A security guard answered and called the police, who transported A.J. to Dayton Children’s Hospital, where a rape kit was done. The rape kit was then sent to the Miami Valley Regional Crime Lab (“MVRCL”) for processing.\n\n¶ 14 Originally, based on information as to the assailant’s alleged nickname of “Twin,” Ewing put together two photospreads, but A.J. did not pick out either of the suspected individuals. On August 6, 2002, A.J. provided Ewing with Brian Hawkins’ name, which A.J. had obtained from friends. Ewing compiled another photospread, and on August 14, 2002, A.J. identified Hawkins as the person who had committed the rape.\n\n¶ 15 Ewing interviewed Hawkins in his home on October 29, 2002, because he\n\n¹ During testimony, witnesses referred to the Center as the Wesley Center and as the Wesleyan Center. To avoid confusion, we will use “Wesley Center.”\nhad been recently shot and could not walk. The interview was not recorded. Ewing would have noted in her report if Hawkins were heavily sedated or under the influence during the interview. She did not make such a notation.\n\n{¶ 16} Ewing told Hawkins the date of the alleged offense, and he said he thought he might have been in the hospital at the time. Ewing later followed up and learned that Hawkins had been in the hospital on August 11, 2002, which was about a week and a half after the alleged rape.\n\n{¶ 17} Ewing asked Hawkins if he knew someone with A.J.’s name, and he said he did not. He stated that he did not know A.J., that he would not have sex with a minor, and that he would not have sex outside. Hawkins did not provide Ewing with the names of any witnesses or an alibi. If Hawkins had given Ewing the names of witnesses, she would have followed up.\n\n{¶ 18} Hawkins recalled talking to a detective in October 2002. He stated that he had just gotten shot and was sedated. Although he could not recall what the detective said, he also testified that she talked about a knife, which “threw” him off. He said he thought they had the wrong person because he had never pulled a knife on anyone. The police did not show him any pictures of the victim. He also denied that he had said he would not have sex outside, as he had done that plenty of times. He claimed Ewing had lied in her report.\n\n{¶ 19} In November 2002, Ewing was injured and her last day of work was February 2, 2004. During the interim, she had two surgeries and at some point was on restricted duty until she retired. She could not recall specific dates, other than that she had her first surgery in July 2003. In February or March 2003, Ewing received results\nback from MVRCL, indicating the presence of sperm in the rape kit. Ewing then obtained a court order in October 2003 for a buccal swab from Hawkins. At that point, Ewing was on restricted duty, and another detective obtained the sample from Hawkins.\n\n{¶ 20} DPD did not receive the results from the DNA test until March 2004, which was after Ewing retired. Hawkins’ DNA was a match, and there would have been sufficient cause at that time for the police to present the case to the prosecutor’s office.\n\n{¶ 21} Ewing’s notes on the case, including the photo spread, were kept in a packet, which was the official police file. There would have been a notation on the front concerning whether the case was closed or open. Ewing also kept her pending cases in a certain file cabinet. She did not know what happened to the case files after she left the DPD, and she did not recall if she specifically told someone that there were pending cases in the file cabinet.\n\n{¶ 22} Hawkins continued to reside in the Dayton area and did not move out of state between 2002 and 2015. Nothing more was done on the case until January 2015, when Detective Dulaney received a phone call from the Miami County Prosecutor’s Office, indicating that the office had received a CODIS hit or DNA match on a case that was an investigation in the city of Dayton. The prosecutor sent Dulaney a copy of the 2004 lab report. Dulaney pulled the police report and saw that A.J.’s case had never been presented to the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office. After the case was assigned to her, Dulaney located A.J., and spoke with her. Dulaney also attempted to find Hawkins to obtain his side of the story, but could not locate him at the time.\n\n{¶ 23} Dulaney was never able to locate Ewing’s packet, which contained the photo spread and Ewing’s notes. However, any notes that Ewing took and anything she\ndid during her investigation would have been put into a police report. Dulaney was able to obtain a copy of the police report, because that was stored electronically. The police were also able to locate the following evidence: the 2002 rape kit, which was stored at the old Montgomery County Jail; Hawkins' buccal swab, which was still at MVRCL; and A.J.'s clothing, which was still intact. In addition, DPD was able to locate the following witnesses: the MVRCL employee who had processed the rape kit; the doctor and nurse who had collected the rape kit and who were still working at Dayton Children's Hospital; the Burger King security guard, who recalled speaking to A.J.; and the DPD officer who had responded to the call from the Burger King. This officer had retired from the DPD, but recalled the incident.\n\n{¶ 24} After being unable to find Hawkins, Detective Dulaney entered a suspect locator into the police system, which meant that if police came into contact with Hawkins, he would be told that Dulaney wished to speak with him. After the locator was in the system for a time with no success, the prosecutor went to a grand jury and obtained a warrant for Hawkins' arrest.\n\n{¶ 25} In May 2015, Dulaney was able to interview Hawkins. At the time, he was in jail and was transported to the Safety Building for an interview. Hawkins was told that he was there for an interview in connection with a rape investigation, and after being informed of his Miranda rights, agreed to speak with the police.\n\n{¶ 26} Dulaney told Hawkins about the allegations, and Hawkins said it never happened and that he did not know A.J. Although Dulaney showed him photos of A.J. – one photo was older, and the other was recent – Hawkins still did not recall knowing A.J. During the interview, Hawkins did not give Dulaney the names or addresses of any\nwitnesses. If he had given her names, she would have tried to locate the witnesses.\n\n{¶ 27} At the pre-indictment hearing, Hawkins testified that he had reviewed the police report as part of discovery and did not deny having sex with A.J. He maintained that they agreed to have sexual relations and the activity was not due to force.\n\n{¶ 28} According to Hawkins, he met A.J. around 3:00 a.m. on July 30, 2002, when he was leaving a “bootleg joint” on Shoop Avenue in Dayton, Ohio. The bootleg joint was an after-hours place where people came to gamble, drink, and meet women. Hawkins stated that the bootleg joint had two security guards who checked identification and patted people down. They also had a metal detector, and would not let people in who had weapons like knives. In addition, no one under 18 years of age was allowed inside. Hawkins identified three people as potential witnesses: Bobby Cartwright, who worked as a security guard, Kevin Cartwright, who used to come to the bootleg joint, and Jermaine Hunter, who was present in the yard of the bootleg joint that night.\n\n{¶ 29} The Cartwrights were Hawkins’ cousins, and could discuss security, as well as the fact that underage persons were not allowed, meaning that A.J. had lied about her age. Bobby was working that night, but would not have seen Hawkins and A.J., because he was inside. Jermaine Hunter was outside talking to A.J. when Hawkins left the bootleg joint, and was close enough to hear conversation between Hawkins and A.J. when she initially followed Hawkins away from the bootleg joint. Hunter could also testify that A.J. initiated contact with Hawkins. According to Hawkins, he had lost contact with these individuals and had not seen them for a number of years. He thought Hunter was in prison and had mental problems.\n\n{¶ 30} Hawkins testified that when he left the bootleg joint, A.J. followed him. He\nstated that at the time, he stayed at different people’s houses. Consequently, he and A.J. went to different people’s houses but no one was there. Hawkins described walking to a house on Delphos Avenue, then to a house on Bedford Street, back to the house on Delphos, and next to another house located at Oakridge Drive and Tyson Avenue. On the way back from the last location, A.J. propositioned Hawkins for sex the whole time.\n\n¶ 31 According to Hawkins, he and A.J. then had a sexual encounter behind the Wesley Center. Afterward, they went to a house on Upland Avenue, where Hawkins’ friend, “Moochie,” lived. Hawkins did not know Moochie’s real name; everyone just called him Moochie. When Hawkins and A.J. arrived at Moochie’s house, Hawkins told A.J. to stay outside, but she insisted on coming inside.\n\n¶ 32 Several people were at the house, including a woman named Tony Ousley, who was the mother of Hawkins’ friend, “Squiggy.” Hawkins and Squiggy had both grown up in the same neighborhood. According to Hawkins, he told Ousley that he and A.J. had sex and that A.J. was 18 years old. While they were there, Ousley spoke to A.J., who verified that she and Hawkins had sex. When Hawkins and A.J. left, Ousley pulled him to the side and said he needed to get away from A.J. or he was going to get in trouble. Ousley specifically stated that A.J. was lying about her age. When Hawkins found out from Ousley that A.J. was too young, he walked with A.J. for a few blocks and then handed her a couple of dollars. At that point, A.J. became angry. Hawkins believed she was mad because she thought she was going to stay with him the rest of the night.\n\n¶ 33 By the time of the pre-indictment hearing, Moochie’s house and the house where the bootleg joint was had been torn down. Hawkins’ investigator, Wayne Miller,\nfound the last known address of the Cartwrights, but was not able to actually locate them. He visited their last known address, but it looked vacant and vines were growing from beside the house onto the front door. Miller did locate Hunter, who was in a prison mental ward, and interviewed him. When shown a picture of A.J., Hunter said he had never seen her; he also said he could not recall ever visiting the bootleg joint on Shoop Avenue.\n\n¶ 34 Miller additionally discovered that Squiggy had been murdered in 2008 and that Tony Ousley passed away in 2011. At the hearing, Hawkins testified that Moochie was also dead and that he was not previously aware that Ousley had died. Hawkins said he could, however, have located both Moochie and Ousley in the past.\n\n¶ 35 As was noted, after the court heard the evidence, it concluded that Hawkins failed to prove actual, substantial prejudice. In particular, the court noted that its evaluation hinged on Hawkins’ credibility, and that Hawkins was not credible.\n\n¶ 36 In contending that the trial court erred, Hawkins argues that Ohio courts have not employed a credibility analysis in pre-indictment delay cases. Hawkins further contends that the facts of this case directly compare to those in Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d 150, 472 N.E.2d 1097, where the Supreme Court of Ohio held that pre-indictment delay had prejudiced the defendant. We disagree with both assertions.\n\n¶ 37 As a preliminary matter, Ohio appellate courts have held that decisions on motions to dismiss for pre-indictment delay should be reviewed on the following basis: legal issues are reviewed de novo, but “the court’s findings of fact are afforded great deference.” (Citations omitted.) State v. Powell, 2016-Ohio-1220, 61 N.E.3d 789, ¶ 11 (8th Dist.). See also State v. Zimbeck, 195 Ohio App.3d 729, 2011-Ohio-2171, 961\nN.E.2d 1141, ¶ 20 (6th Dist.); State v. Winkle, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 12 MA 162, 2014-Ohio-895, ¶ 23; State v. Cochenour, 4th Dist. Ross No. 98CA2440, 1999 WL 152127, *1 (Mar. 8, 1999).\n\n¶ 38 We agree with these standards, which are consistent with standards of review for other pretrial matters like suppression motions. In suppression situations, trial courts hear evidence on factual points and must necessarily make decisions on witness credibility. See, e.g., State v. Burnside, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, ¶ 8; State v. Brown, 2016-Ohio-4973, 67 N.E.3d 1278, ¶ 7 (2d Dist.). As these decisions note, trial courts “are in the best position to resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.” Burnside at ¶ 8, citing State v. Mills, 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 366, 582 N.E.2d 972 (1992).\n\n¶ 39 In Luck, the Supreme Court of Ohio considered whether the defendant was prejudiced by a fifteen-year delay between the time of a murder and her indictment for the murder. Luck, 15 Ohio St. 3d at 152, 472 N.E.2d 1097. The defendant, Katherine Luck, was one of the suspects originally interviewed around the time of the crime. However, after an initial investigation, the police could not gather any new evidence and took no official action for about fifteen years. Id. at 151. At that point, for reasons that were not clear in the record, an indictment was obtained against Luck, and she was arrested. Id.\n\n¶ 40 While under arrest, Luck made a confession at the police station, indicating that she had been physically attacked by the decedent, who was then killed in the fight that ensued. Id. at 157. According to Luck’s confession, another individual, who was her acquaintance (and who had also been an original suspect) was present at the time of\nthe alleged murder. *Id.* She told the police that this person, who was the only one who could help her, was dead. *Id.*\n\n{¶ 41} After concluding that the confession had been illegally obtained, the court found that defendant was “obviously prejudiced by not being able to seek verification of her story from [the deceased witness] and thereby establish mitigating factors or a defense to the charge against her.” *Id.* at 158. Finding both actual prejudice and an unjustifiable delay by the State, the court affirmed the dismissal of the murder charge. *Id.* at 159.\n\n{¶ 42} Unlike the defendant in *Luck*, Hawkins never asserted, either when he was originally interviewed in 2002, or when he was interviewed in 2015, that he had consensual sex with A.J. and that witnesses existed who could verify his story. Instead, he denied that he had been involved in any such incident. Consequently, *Luck* is not directly comparable to the case before us.\n\n{¶ 43} In *State v. Dixon*, 2015-Ohio-3144, 40 N.E.3d 601 (8th Dist.), the State waited almost 20 years to indict a defendant for rape. *Id.* at ¶ 2. After the trial court dismissed the charge due to pre-indictment delay, the Eighth District Court of Appeals affirmed. Notably, in that case, two parole revocation hearings were held in 1993, shortly after the victim told the police that the defendant had raped her.² At the parole revocation hearings, the defendant admitted having sexual intercourse with the complainant, but claimed it was consensual. *Id.* at ¶ 6. The defendant was sent back to prison for the\n\n---\n\n² After reporting the alleged rape to the police and having a rape kit done, the victim signed a “no prosecution” form and the defendant was released from jail. However, parole violation hearings were still held. *State v. Dixon*, 2015-Ohio-3144, 40 N.E.3d 601, ¶ 6 (8th Dist.).\nparole violation, but the State did not initiate any prosecution on the rape charge for almost 20 years, after the police “received a CODIS [Combined DNA Index System] hit confirmation from the Federal Bureau of Criminal Investigation that they had made a preliminary association between a submitted rape kit and the Defendant.”  *Id.*\n\n{¶ 44} Two witnesses who had testified at the parole revocation hearings were unavailable, including the defendant’s former employer, who was deceased.  *Id.* at ¶ 9. This witness, Norman Diamond, had testified at the revocation hearings that “he spoke with the alleged victim after the incident and the victim told Diamond that ‘she had feelings for [Dixon]’ and ‘if she could not have [Dixon], no one would.’  Diamond further testified that the alleged victim told him that the sexual encounter was ‘mutual with no force.’ ”  *Id.*\n\n{¶ 45} In concluding that the defendant had established actual prejudice, the court commented that the case against the defendant hinged on the victim’s credibility.  *Id.* at ¶ 30. The court further observed that the testimony of the deceased witness directly supported the defendant’s assertion that the sex was consensual, and also undermined the victim’s testimony.  *Id.*\n\n{¶ 46} Again, these facts are far different than those involved in the case before us. Hawkins never asserted that the sex was consensual or that witnesses existed.\n\n{¶ 47} Hawkins also relies on *State v. Jones*, 148 Ohio St.3d 167, 2016-Ohio-5105, 69 N.E.3d 688, in which the court stated that a defendant’s “inability to articulate specifically what [a witness’s] testimony would have been does not render his claim of prejudice fatally speculative,” as the court has “held that a defendant may establish actual prejudice where he or she is unable to seek verification of his or her story from a deceased witness.”  *Id.* at ¶ 28, citing *Luck*, 15 Ohio St. 3d at 157, 472 N.E.2d 1097. However, by\nmaking these comments, the court was not advancing a novel proposition of law; it was\ndiscussing its prior decision in Luck. Moreover, the issue in the case before us is not\nHawkins’ inability to articulate the content of a deceased witness’s testimony; the relevant\nmatter is that the trial court did not find Hawkins credible. As was noted, the trial court\nwas in the best position to assess credibility, and we defer to the court’s factual findings.\n\n¶ 48 As a final matter, Hawkins contends that the State’s pre-indictment delay\nwas not justifiable, as the police simply allowed the case to “slip through the cracks.”\nBecause Hawkins failed to meet his initial burden of proving actual prejudice, we need\nnot consider this issue. See, e.g., Jones at ¶ 13, citing State v. Whiting, 84 Ohio St.3d\n215, 217, 702 N.E.2d 1199 (1998), and State v. Adams, 144 Ohio St.3d 429, 2015-Ohio-\n3954, 45 N.E.3d 127, ¶ 99.\n\n¶ 49 Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it concluded that Hawkins failed\nto establish actual prejudice. The First Assignment of Error, therefore, is overruled."}

The first is that when the State filed the re-indictment, it included language in the kidnapping charge to the effect that the act may have involved a victim who was under the age of thirteen or was incompetent. Hawkins objects to the inclusion of this language because the State knew that A.J. was over the age of 13 and was not incompetent. Hawkins also claims that the kidnapping charge was added as a retaliatory act because he had filed a motion to dismiss the indictment.\n\n¶ 112 However, Hawkins failed to object to the re-indictment in the trial court, and we, therefore, review only for plain error. State v. Diar, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, ¶ 138. Plain error “is to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.” State v. Long, 53 Ohio St.3d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978), paragraph three of the syllabus. Our review reveals no error, let alone plain error.\n\n¶ 113 It is true that punishing “‘a person because he has done what the law plainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort ***.’” State v. Rahab, 150 Ohio St.3d 152, 2017-Ohio-1401, 80 N.E.3d 431, ¶ 8, quoting Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 363, 98 S.Ct. 663, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978). (Other citation omitted.) However, we have stressed that “‘[t]here is good reason to be cautious before adopting an inflexible presumption of prosecutorial vindictiveness in a pretrial setting. In the course of preparing a case for trial, the prosecutor may uncover additional information that suggests a basis for further prosecution or he simply may come to realize that information possessed by the State has a broader significance. At this stage of the\nproceedings, the prosecutor's assessment of the proper extent of prosecution may not have crystallized.' \" State v. Perkins, 191 Ohio App.3d 263, 2010-Ohio-5161, 945 N.E.2d 1083, ¶ 33 (2d Dist.), quoting United States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 381–382, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982).\n\n{¶ 114} In Perkins, we contrasted pretrial situations from those where changes in charging decisions are made after trial begins or by the time convictions have been obtained. Perkins at ¶ 33, citing Goodwin. We observed that decisions made at the latter times are more likely to be improperly motivated because, by those times, the State would have obtained all information about an accused, and would have decided the extent to which he or she should be prosecuted. Id.\n\n{¶ 115} We further noted that prior to trial, defendants are expected to assert procedural rights that impose burdens on the State. Perkins at ¶ 34, citing Goodwin. Such pretrial motions routinely include matters like motions to suppress, challenges to \" 'form and sufficiency' \" of indictments, and pleading affirmative defenses. Id. We stressed that prosecutors \"'should remain free before trial to exercise the broad discretion entrusted to [them] to determine the extent of the societal interest in prosecution. An initial decision should not freeze future conduct.' \" Id. at ¶ 35, quoting Goodwin at 382.\n\n{¶ 116} As a final matter, we observed that the grand jury system protects against prosecutorial vindictiveness, since its responsibilities \" 'include both the determination whether there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed and the protection of citizens against unfounded criminal prosecutions.' \" Perkins at ¶ 40, quoting United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 343, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974). See also State v. Kothe, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 49330, 1985 WL 4750, *6 (Dec. 26, 1985)\n(rejecting defendant’s contention that prosecution indicted him in retaliation for objecting to the sufficiency of two prior indictments for the offense because grand juries are independent bodies).\n\n¶ 117 No evidence of vindictiveness is apparent in the record. Evidentiary support existed for a kidnapping charge, and the grand jury was the body that decided if the facts warranted the additional charge.\n\n¶ 118 Concerning the language in the indictment, Hawkins again waived error other than plain error by failing to object. State v. Horner, 126 Ohio St.3d 466, 2010-Ohio-3830, 935 N.E.2d 26, paragraph three of the syllabus. Again, however, there was no error.\n\n¶ 119 Crim.R. 7(B) provides that a statement in the indictment “may be in the words of the applicable section of the statute, provided the words of that statute charge an offense, or in words sufficient to give the defendant notice of all the elements of the offense with which the defendant is charged.” An indictment’s purpose is to give an accused party notice of “‘that which he may expect to meet and be required to answer; so that the court and jury may know what they are to try, and the court may determine without unreasonable difficulty what evidence is admissible.’” Horner at ¶ 10, quoting Horton v. State, 85 Ohio St. 13, 19, 96 N.E. 797 (1911).\n\n¶ 120 The language used in re-indictment B conformed to the kidnapping statute, which states that “[n]o person, by force, threat, or deception, or, in the case of a victim under the age of thirteen or mentally incompetent, by any means, shall knowingly * * * restrain another of the other person’s liberty.” R.C. 2905.01(B)(2). Accordingly, there was no error, let alone plain error constituting a miscarriage of justice.\nHawkins' second argument is that the State denied him access to materials that would have assisted him at trial, and that the result would have been different if disclosure had been made. These materials include the Grandview Hospital records regarding an assault of A.J., and allegedly, A.J.'s mental health records.\n\n“The suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” State v. Johnston, 39 Ohio St.3d 48, 529 N.E.2d 898 (1988), paragraph four of the syllabus, following Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).\n\n“In determining whether the prosecution improperly suppressed evidence favorable to an accused, such evidence shall be deemed material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A ‘reasonable probability’ is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. This standard of materiality applies regardless of whether the evidence is specifically, generally or not at all requested by the defense.” Id. at paragraph five of the syllabus, following United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). “The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.’” State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, ¶ 27, quoting Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995).\n\n“The rule in Brady only applies to evidence unknown to the defendant at\nthe time of the trial.” State v. Royster, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26378, 2015-Ohio-625, ¶ 17, citing United States v. Clark, 928 F.2d 733, 738 (6th Cir.1991), State v. LaMar, 95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, ¶ 28, fn.2, and State v. Buhrman, 2d Dist. Greene No. 96 CA 145, 1997 WL 566154, *7 (Sept. 12, 1997). See also State v. Wickline, 50 Ohio St.3d 114, 116, 552 N.E.2d 913 (1990), citing United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976); State v. Braun, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 91131, 2009-Ohio-4875, ¶ 68 (“a Brady violation involves the discovery, after trial, of information that was known to the prosecution but unknown to the defense”).\n\n¶ 125 In the case before us, Brady would not apply to the Grandview Hospital records, including records pertaining to A.J.’s mental health, as Hawkins was aware of these records at the time of trial. See Transcript of Proceedings (July Trial), Vol. I, pp. 9-12, and Hawkins’ motion to produce medical records filed on October 15, 2015 (asking the court to order disclosure of Grandview Hospital records, which referenced an assault two weeks prior to the alleged rape, as well as A.J.’s emotional problems).\n\n¶ 126 Furthermore, the State did not withhold these records. Instead, Grandview Hospital no longer had any records, as the records had been destroyed, pursuant to the hospital’s policy of destroying records after ten years. Id. at p. 9. Accordingly, Brady simply does not apply, and even if it did, there is no indication that the State withheld any evidence.\n\n¶ 127 Hawkins’ final argument under this assignment of error is that the State committed misconduct when it said the DNA swab was taken at Hawkins’ home when the State knew it had been taken when Hawkins was in jail.\n\n¶ 128 “The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the remarks were\nimproper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the accused's substantial rights. * * The touchstone of our analysis ‘is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.’ ” (Citation omitted.) State v. Drummond, 111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, ¶ 226, quoting Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982).\n\n¶ 129 Our review of the record indicates that the State did not commit misconduct. At trial, Hawkins testified during direct examination that a DNA swab had been taken from him in December 2003 when he (Hawkins) was in jail. During cross-examination, the State showed Hawkins State’s Ex. 9, which indicated that the DNA sample had been recovered at a private address, not at the jail. Transcript of Proceedings (Jury Trial), Vol. II, p. 481.\n\n¶ 130 According to Hawkins, his post-conviction petition indicates that he, in fact, was in jail when the swab was taken. In response, the State notes that we cannot consider matters that were not in the trial record.\n\n¶ 131 We agree with the State. The Supreme Court of Ohio held many years ago that “[a] reviewing court cannot add matter to the record before it, which was not a part of the trial court’s proceedings, and then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter.” State v. Ishmail, 54 Ohio St.3d 402, 377 N.E.2d 500 (1978).\n\n¶ 132 In addition, the State contends that it was allowed to rely at trial on the information it had at the time, as depicted on Ex. 9. Again, we agree. Assuming for purposes of argument that Ex. 9 was incorrect in this regard, there is no indication that the State was aware of that. See, e.g., State v. Simpson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 19797, 2004-Ohio-669, ¶ 54 (refusing to find misconduct based on prosecutor’s\ninadvertent and isolated misstatement); State v. Smith, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2005CA70, 2006-Ohio-2132, ¶ 25 (prosecutor’s reference to photo-spread was improper but was isolated and did not rise to level of misconduct). Accordingly, we find no merit in Hawkins’ argument about prosecutorial misconduct.\n\n¶ 133 Based on the preceding discussion, the Seventh (and Fourth Supplemental) Assignment of Error is overruled."}

This statute provides “[n]o person employed by, or associated with, any enterprise shall conduct or participate in, directly or indirectly, the affairs of the enterprise through a pattern of corrupt activity or the collection of an unlawful debt.”\n\nR.C. 2923.31 defines certain terms set forth in the prohibition. The statute defines an enterprise as “any individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, limited partnership, corporation, trust, union, government agency, or other legal entity, or any organization, association, or group of persons associated in fact although not a legal entity.” R.C. 2923.31(C). The statute defines a pattern of corrupt activity as “means two or more incidents of corrupt activity, whether or not there has been a prior conviction, that are related to the affairs of the same enterprise, are not isolated, and are not so closely related to each other and connected in time and place that they constitute a single event.”\nR.C. 2923.31(E). Finally, the statute defines corrupt activity as engaging in, attempting to engage in, or conspiring to engage in a wide range of listed offenses including those that apply to this case, such as money laundering, theft, forgery, and telecommunications fraud.\n\nAppellant was also convicted of conspiracy (R.C. 2923.01(A)(1), which prohibits one from planning or aiding in planning the commission of, among other offenses, engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, with the purpose to, or promoting or facilitating, the commission of such an offense.

This argument ignores volumes of evidence introduced at trial. The evidence seized from appellant’s home, the testimony of codefendants that pointed to both appellant and George as the contacts through which they received checks to cash, and the surveillance evidence of appellant driving with people or meeting people at various locations with banking institutions where fraudulent checks were cashed or attempts to cash checks were made at that time. Many of those people testified about their contact with appellant and George.\n\nThe testimony adduced at trial demonstrated that appellant conspired with\nothers to engage in a scheme to defraud various businesses and financial institutions by creating counterfeit payroll checks and having people that were in desperate need for money use their real names to cash those checks. For instance, Jovan Blackwell identified appellant in court as the individual from which he received fraudulent checks. Appellant drove Blackwell to banks in Willoughby and Mayfield, and Blackwell cashed checks made out from Target Staffing and Executive Caterers accounts. Blackwell then split the money with appellant. Those checks, along with surveillance photos documenting the trips, were submitted by the state as exhibits at trial.\n\n{¶55} Bohanan, appellant’s source of financial account information, also testified that appellant paid him for this information.\n\n{¶56} In total, nine codefendants testified about their interactions with appellant, George, or both. Appellant attempts to attack the veracity of these witnesses’ testimony because they were testifying as part of plea agreements, or through minor inconsistencies in that testimony. The overwhelming weight of evidence, including all the machinations of appellant’s criminal enterprise found in the basement office of his residence, demonstrates that appellant’s convictions are not against the manifest weight of the evidence and are supported by sufficient evidence."}

She indicated that most of the touching occurred over her clothing, but that there were two instances where he touched her vaginal area under her clothing. Tr. 128, 146-47. Rupert argues that this testimony is not credible because there were discrepancies in her testimony.\n\nThe jury is the sole judge of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses. It may believe or disbelieve any witness or accept part of what a witness says and reject the rest. In reaching its verdict, the jury should consider the demeanor of the witness and the manner in which he testifies, his connection or relationship with the prosecution or the defendant, and his interest, if any, in the outcome.\n\nState v. Antill, 176 Ohio St. 61, 67, 197 N.E.2d 548 (1964). “The choice between credible witnesses and their conflicting testimony rests solely with the finder of fact and an appellate court may not substitute its own judgment for that of the finder of fact.” State v. Kruse, 3d Dist. Union No. 14-16-15, 2017-Ohio-5667, ¶ 66 quoting State v. Awan, 22 Ohio St.3d 120, 123, 489 N.E.2d 277 (1986). Here, the alleged inconsistencies were before the jury and it had the opportunity to weigh the evidence presented. The jury clearly took its task seriously as it found Rupert not guilty of Counts 3 and 4 which were also based upon T.R.’s testimony.\n\nE.B., who was the victim of the actions in Count 1, testified that she was lying on the bed in Rupert’s bedroom watching tv when he came in and laid on\nthe bed behind her. Tr. 168-69. E.B. then testified that Rupert reached his arm over her and started touching her vagina inside her pants, but on the outside of her underwear. Tr. 169-70. According to E.B., Rupert was rubbing the outside of her vaginal area, but did not go inside of her. Tr. 171. Rupert argues this testimony lacks credibility because on redirect, she indicated that his finger went in. However, as discussed above, the jury was given the opportunity to hear all of the evidence, including the inconsistencies and determine what was credible. The jury was not required to believe all of the testimony. The jury evidently chose to believe the testimony given on direct because it found Rupert not guilty of rape, but guilty of the lesser included offense of gross sexual imposition. The jury also found him not guilty of sexual battery as it related to E.B. Viewing all the evidence as a whole, we cannot say that the evidence weighs heavily against conviction or that the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice."}

We note initially that Barnes failed to object to the statement during the trial, so our review is limited to one of plain error. State v. Dixon, 152 Ohio App.3d 760, 2003-Ohio-2250, ¶ 26, 790 N.E.2d 349 (3d Dist.). \"The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the accused's substantial rights.\" State v.

Prejudice is shown when there is a reasonable probability that but for the improper remark by the prosecutor, the result of the trial would have been different. State v. Stevens, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-14-58, 2016-Ohio-446, ¶ 53, 58 N.E.3d 584. \"Not every intemperate remark by counsel can be a basis for reversal.\" State v. Landrum, 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 112, 559 N.E.2d 710 (1990). The touchstone of analysis \" * * * is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor. * * *\" Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 947, 71 L.Ed.2d 78, (1982). The Constitution does not guarantee an \"error free, perfect trial * * *.\" United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 508, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1980, 76 L.Ed.2d 96, (1983). Barnes’ argument is based upon one comment made by the prosecutor during closing arguments. Specifically, after discussing the testimony of the victims and their relationship with Barnes, the prosecutor inferred that Barnes had lied during his testimony. The prosecutor’s statement was \"if a person will abuse a child, what’s a little perjury.\" Tr. 498. This Court does not find accusations that a witness, including the defendant, has committed perjury in a case to be proper. \"Such statements function as backhanded impeachment as well as attempted witness intimidation and express the prosecutor’s personal belief or opinion as to the credibility of the witness, which is improper.\" State v. Halley, 93 Ohio App.3d 71, 79, 637 N.E.2d 937 (10th Dist. 1994). However, the fact that the prosecutor made one isolated remark during closing argument does not automatically make the trial unfair. A review of the closing argument as a whole does not show that the error was prevalent throughout the closing argument. Throughout the closing argument, the prosecutor repeatedly stated \"if\" you believe or \"if\" you find, inferring properly that it was up to the jury to determine the facts. See e.g. Tr. 484, 485, 488, and 489. The jury was properly instructed that statements made by counsel during closing argument were not evidence. Tr. 516. The trial court also told the jurors that they were the \"sole judge of the facts, the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.\" Tr. 516. Given all of this along with the evidence presented at the trial, this Court does not find that the single inappropriate statement by the prosecutor in this case was prejudicial."}

He asserts that Emily and Alice did not witness him touch S.J. inappropriately. However, the State, at trial, presented S.J.’s testimony to substantiate the essential elements of the charged offenses. On January 21, 2020, S.J. was deposed by the prosecutor and the defense counsel. A video recording of this deposition was played for the jury at trial. We will examine her testimony regarding each of the alleged incidents for which Lewis received a conviction to determine whether they are supported by sufficient evidence. Regarding the incidents alleged at the Tully Street house, S.J. testified that Lewis would come over before her mother got home from work. She stated that he would come into her bedroom where she would play after school and would let her play games on his phone. On several of these occasions, Lewis would sit on the bottom bunk of the bunkbed while she sat on his lap. S.J. testified that, as she was playing games on his phone, Lewis put one of his hands around her waist and put his other hand down her pants. She further stated that Lewis put this hand beneath her underwear and would rub her vaginal area. S.J. stated that, when this happened, her grandmother was outside of the room and that ‘it happened when nobody was really around * * *.’ She said that she ‘never really reacted’ and ‘would just keep playing [on] the phone.’ She also testified that this ‘happened several times at my grandma’s house.’ Regarding the alleged incident in the Ford Expedition, S.J. indicated that Lewis’s vehicle was not working and that he was, for this reason, driving Emily’s vehicle. S.J. testified that Lewis allowed her to sit on his lap and let her help to steer the vehicle. While her hands were on the wheel, Lewis reached his hand down her pants and touched her vaginal area. On this occasion, S.J. ‘asked him to stop and * * * pulled his hand away * * *.’ However, she stated that ‘he’d stop for, like, about five minutes and then he’s [sic] just keep going again.’ She stated that this continued until they arrived at his home. Further, S.J. testified that she was, at the time of the trial, twelve years old. Thus, S.J. could not have been over the age of thirteen at the time that these incidents were alleged to have occurred. S.J. also testified that she was seven or eight around the time that her mom was dating Lewis. S.J.’s testimony provided some evidence that substantiates each of the essential elements of the offenses that were alleged to have occurred at the Tully Street house and in the Ford Expedition. Thus, S.J.’s testimony, if believed, provided some evidence regarding each of the essential elements of these charged offenses."}

S.J. could not remember what she was wearing specifically as Lewis was touching her but stated that she usually wore jeans.... S.J. affirmed that Emily was never home when Lewis was inappropriately touching her.... S.J. indicated that A.J. was in the room at these times but that ‘he was pretty much in diapers still. He would just sit there and play with blocks.’... Regarding the incident in the Ford Expedition, S.J. testified that Lewis was borrowing Emily’s vehicle ‘because his wasn’t working and my mom had just gotten a Saturn Outlook.’...

S.J. stated that, while Emily and Lewis were dating, she did not tell anyone that Lewis was inappropriately touching her.... She stated that she saw Lewis about three times after Emily and Lewis ended their relationship.... On the first occasion, Lewis stopped over to help Emily with her vehicle.... S.J. next saw Lewis at a Halloween function.... The third time that she saw him was at A.J.’s kindergarten program.... S.J. testified that, when she saw Lewis, she was ‘[s]cared’ and ‘ran to [her] mom.’... She stated that Emily was ‘confused’ as to why she (S.J.) ‘was scared.’... S.J. then said, ‘And [Emily] asked why and I just said—I didn’t really tell her, I didn’t at all. But she kept asking so for, like, the few days and I finally told her and she was not happy.’... On cross-examination, S.J. admitted that, when she was first interviewed at Children’s Services, she did not remember all of the incidents because she felt ‘under pressure.’... She then clarified that she ‘was stressed * * * not really under pressure * * * because [she] was scared.’... She further stated that she ‘didn’t want to tell them [the social workers] anything because they’re strangers to me.’... She also affirmed that she did not tell Children’s Services everything about the incidents until her third visit with them.... S.J. affirmed that no one was pressuring her.... At trial, Emily testified that she was in a relationship with Lewis from 2014 to 2017.... She stated that Lewis would not generally bring his children over to the Tully Street house and would spend time with S.J. while she was at work.... Emily also testified that she felt that Lewis spent more time with her kids than with his kids and that S.J. was Lewis’s favorite.... She said that Alice was concerned by Lewis’s presence at the house when she (Emily) was at work and that Lewis’s visits caused tensions with Alice.... Emily stated that, for this reason, she suggested to Lewis that he wait to come over until after she got off of work.... Emily stated that Lewis would allow S.J. to play on his phone.... Emily reported that she attempted to limit S.J.’s time on Lewis’s phone and ‘actually stated to both of them one day that [S.J.] needed to stay off the phone * * *.’... However, S.J. reported to Emily that Lewis had ‘told [her (S.J.)] it was OK to be on the phone * * *’ and ‘told [her (S.J.)] not to tell [Emily].’... Emily confronted Lewis about this several times, but he continued to allow S.J. to play on his phone.... In her testimony, Emily confirmed that she had a Ford Expedition and that Lewis was allowed to drive this vehicle.... She testified that, for a time, Lewis borrowed her Ford Expedition because his vehicle was in the repair shop for a couple of weeks or months.... Emily also confirmed that, after she and Lewis had ended their relationship, Lewis came to her house to bring her a back brace and that S.J. ran upstairs when she saw Lewis come in the front door.... She also stated that S.J. saw Lewis again at a Halloween activity and then at A.J.’s kindergarten program.... On cross-examination, Emily admitted that she did not have personal knowledge regarding the allegations against Lewis and that she did not see Lewis engage in any inappropriate behavior towards S.J.... She testified that she was shocked when she heard S.J.’s allegations and that she did not, before May of 2019, have any reason to be concerned about Lewis’s prior interactions with her children.... Emily also stated that S.J. did not state the full extent of the allegations on the night that she finally explained why she was fearful of seeing Lewis at the kindergarten program.... Alice also testified at trial.... She testified that S.J. and Emily began living in her house in September of 2014 and that S.J. turned twelve in December of 2019.... Alice stated that Lewis would come to the house while Emily was still at work.... She noted that Lewis would pay attention to S.J. but would not pay much attention to S.J.’s younger brother.... Alice testified that Lewis would go into S.J.’s room and play with her.... She remembers Lewis ‘sitting there, sitting there on the bed and her [S.J.] too, either on his lap or sitting beside him and it just, then it went from sitting to laying down on the bed together.’... Alice stated that Lewis and S.J. would sometimes have a blanket ‘on their lap.’... She also saw S.J. playing on Lewis’s phone even after Emily told Lewis not to allow S.J. to play as much on his phone.... Alice stated that she was not always in the same room as Lewis and S.J.... She testified that she was sometimes watching television or caring for A.J. in another room while Lewis and S.J. were in the bedroom.... She affirmed that she did not have ‘eyes on them 100% of the time.’... Alice also stated that she has issues with mobility and had to use a cane to get around her house during the time in which S.J. was living with her.... She further testified that she could not see into the bedroom where S.J. and Lewis were sitting from the place she often was in the kitchen.... On cross-examination, Alice stated that she did not want Lewis coming over before Emily returned from work.... However, she also stated that she did not tell Lewis to stop coming to the house when Emily was not present.... Alice testified that, besides sitting or lying down on the bed with S.J., she did not see Lewis engage in any other inappropriate behavior.... She also admitted that she did not have any personal observations regarding the allegations that S.J. had raised because she (Alice) was in the other room at the times of the alleged incidents.... At trial, Detective Huebner testified that he sat down for an interview with S.J. and Emily on May 20, 2019.... He stated that he then scheduled an interview with Lewis for May 22, 2019.... A recording of the interview between Detective Huebner and Lewis was played for the jury.... In this interview, Lewis stated that he did not sexually abuse S.J. and that he did not touch her vaginal area.... He further stated that S.J. was lying about him inappropriately touching her and that S.J. had previously gotten in trouble with Emily for lying.... Lewis did admit that he let S.J. play games on his phone and that S.J. had sat on his lap while they were watching television.... He also stated that he saw S.J. on Halloween and at a kindergarten program he attended with a friend.... He said that he would watch Emily’s kids at her house but that other people were around when he was with S.J.... After the interview was played, Detective Huebner testified that he had another interview with S.J. because she had remembered another incident.... He then explained that they did not use a SANE kit to collect physical evidence because of the length of time that had passed since the alleged incidents.... He also stated that, given S.J.’s description of the inappropriate touching, he would not expect any identifiable injuries on S.J.’s body.... He also testified that, in his experience, it was common for a child not to report abuse of this nature immediately after the incident.... Detective Huebner further testified that, if a person was grooming a child for sexual abuse, that person would not generally behave negatively towards that child.... Based on the testimony presented at trial, Lewis raises several arguments to establish that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. First, he argues that Emily and Alice’s testimony was not based on firsthand knowledge of the allegations.... However, they did not need to witness the alleged incidents and provide direct corroboration for S.J.’s allegations for the jury to find Lewis guilty.... Further, Emily and Alice’s testimony did corroborate a number of contextual details surrounding S.J.’s essential allegations. Alice testified that Lewis would come to spend time alone with the children at her house when Emily was at work; that S.J. would sit on Lewis’s lap on the bed; that S.J. would play on Lewis’s phone; and that she (Alice) was not always in the same room as S.J. during Lewis’s visits.... Emily’s testimony established that Lewis spent time with the children while she was at work; that Lewis let S.J. play on his phone; that Lewis favored S.J.; and that Lewis had driven her Ford Expedition.... This testimony tends to support the credibility of S.J.’s allegations. For these reasons, we find this argument to be without merit.... Second, Lewis argues that the lack of physical evidence renders his convictions against the manifest weight of the evidence.... However, physical evidence is ‘not required to sustain a sex offense conviction.’... Further, in this case, Detective Huebner provided testimony as to why the State was unable to produce any physical evidence.... He explained that physical evidence would not have been available given the delay in between the alleged incidents and the investigation.... He also stated that he would not expect S.J. to have any identifiable, physical injury based on her description of the inappropriate touching.... After considering the record, we find Lewis’s argument to be without merit.... Third, Lewis argues that S.J. failed to identify a specific date for the allegations.... We note that, in this case, more precise dates for the alleged incidents were not necessary to prove an essential element of these offenses.... The testimony at trial indicates that Emily and Lewis dated in between 2014 and 2017, placing the alleged incidents during that period of time.... In this timeframe, S.J. was roughly between the ages of seven and ten.... Thus, the State established that S.J. was under the age of thirteen at all relevant times as is required to prove the offense of gross sexual imposition under R.C. 2907.05(A)(4).... Further, this Court has previously held that, in cases when young children are the victims of a crime, ‘it is reasonable that they [are] not able to remember exact times and dates of the rapes. This is especially true where the crimes involve several instances of conduct spread out over an extended period.’... ‘It is well settled that, particularly in cases involving sexual misconduct with a child, the precise times and dates of the alleged offense or offenses oftentimes cannot be determined with specificity.’... S.J. was a young child at the times of the incidents.... The alleged incidents occurred on multiple occasions in different locations over a period of time.... In the end, Lewis has not, given the facts of this case, demonstrated how the lack of more specific dates for the alleged offenses tends to establish that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence.... Fourth, Lewis also points to the facts that S.J. did not immediately report the alleged offenses as evidence that this convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence.... Lewis also questions S.J.’s silence on the grounds that she never indicated that she had been threatened if she came forward with the allegations.... Detective Huebner addressed both of these issues in his trial testimony.... He stated that, in his experience, it was common for abuse of this nature not to be reported immediately.... He also stated that, if a child is being groomed, the abuser would ordinarily not behave negatively towards that child, indicating that threats may not accompany all abuse of this nature.... Further, courts across this state have concluded that a delay in reporting allegations of sexual abuse does not necessarily indicate that a conviction for the related offenses is against the manifest weight of the evidence.... Thus, we conclude that this argument is without merit.... Fifth, Lewis argues that S.J.’s testimony regarding the alleged incidents was not sufficiently specific.... While we have already concluded that S.J.’s testimony contained enough specificity to provide sufficient evidence to support Lewis’s convictions, this argument addresses the credibility of S.J.’s testimony.... ‘[T]he credibility of witnesses is primarily an issue for the trier of fact.’... For this reason, ‘[w]e will not substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact on the issue of witness credibility unless it is patently clear that the fact finder lost its way.’... In this case, the jurors apparently determined that S.J.’s testimony was credible.... For each of these two incidents, S.J. described where she was located; what she was doing; what Lewis was doing; the area of her body that Lewis touched; and how Lewis touched her.... After reviewing the record, we cannot conclude that the jury lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice in determining that S.J.’s testimony was credible.... Thus, we find this argument to be without merit.... Sixth, Lewis argues that the S.J. did not present any testimony regarding sexual motivation.... While we have already determined that S.J.’s testimony provided some evidence from which a trier of fact could infer that the purpose of Lewis’s alleged contact was sexual arousal or gratification, this argument is about whether such an inference is against the manifest weight of the evidence.... Further, we also have already found that the jury did not lose its way in relying on the credibility of S.J.’s testimony in reaching a verdict.... ¶59 In her deposition, S.J. stated that Lewis put his hand down her pants, beneath her underwear and rubbed her vaginal area on more than one occasion while she was at the Tully Street house.... She also testified that Lewis put his hand down her pants, beneath her underwear and touched her vaginal area while they were in Emily’s Ford Expedition.... There is no indication from S.J.’s testimony that Lewis’s alleged contact with her vaginal area was accidental or was undertaken for a non-sexual purpose.... Given the circumstances surrounding these incidents and the nature of this contact, a jury could reasonably infer from S.J.’s testimony that Lewis was motivated by the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.... Further, while Lewis’s statements to Detective Huebner conflict with S.J.’s testimony as he denied acting in this manner, the jurors, as finders of fact, were permitted to resolve the conflicts between S.J.’s testimony and Lewis’s statements in favor of the State.... ¶60 Given the circumstances surrounding these incidents and the nature of this contact, a jury could reasonably infer from S.J.’s testimony that Lewis was motivated by the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.... Matter of R.C., 2020-Ohio-1486, --- N.E.3d ---, ¶ 60 (4th Dist.).... Further, while Lewis’s statements to Detective Huebner conflict with S.J.’s testimony as he denied acting in this manner, the jurors, as finders of fact, were permitted to resolve the conflicts between S.J.’s testimony and Lewis’s statements in favor of the State.... Tr. 253, 261-262.... State v. Harvey, 3d Dist. Marion No. 9-19-34, 2020-Ohio-329, ¶ 47.... Seventh, Lewis also asserts that S.J.’s testimony about the alleged incident at his house on Mentzer Church Road was not credible.... However, the jury acquitted Lewis of the charge that arose from this alleged incident.... We assume that Lewis points to S.J.’s testimony underlying this charge to argue that S.J. was not a credible witness.... But in evaluating the charges against Lewis, the jury, as finder of fact, ‘was free to believe [or disbelieve] all, part, or none of [the] * * * testimony’ offered by S.J.... As is often the case, it is not clear why the jurors chose to acquit Lewis of one of the three charges against him.... However, even if the jurors acquitted Lewis of this charge because they found S.J.’s testimony not to be credible on this matter, this would not mean that every word of S.J.’s testimony was entirely lacking in credibility and that Lewis should have, therefore, been acquitted of all of the charges against him.... A jury does not have to choose between believing all or none of a witness’s testimony.... Thus, the arguments against the charge for which Lewis was acquitted do not establish that the charges for which he received convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence.... After considering the evidence presented at trial, we find that this case does not present the exceptional circumstance in which the evidence presented at trial weighs heavily against the conviction.... Further, we do not find any indication that the jury lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice.... Thus, neither of Lewis’s convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence.... Accordingly, Lewis’s first assignment of error is overruled."}

We begin our analysis by noting that ‘[t]he failure to object is not a per se indicator of ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel may refuse to object for tactical reasons.’\n\nFurther, in disposing of the third assignment of error, we determined that the comments that Lewis identified were not improper. We cannot find that defense counsel’s performance was deficient because he failed to object to permissible comments. We also cannot find that the result of this trial would have been different had Lewis’s defense counsel objected to these permissible comments. Thus, this argument is without merit.\n\nLewis argues that his defense counsel should have challenged his conviction for the incident in the Ford Expedition on the grounds that the State failed to establish venue. Lewis alleged that the State failed to establish venue for this charge in his second assignment of error. In our analysis of those arguments, we determined that the State did properly establish venue for this particular charge.\n\nSince the State proved venue, the defense counsel’s decision not to challenge venue does not constitute deficient performance. Further, we also cannot find that the outcome of Lewis’s trial would have been different if his defense counsel had raised a challenge before the trial court that has since failed on appeal. For these reasons, this argument is without merit.\n\nFailure to object to State’s Exhibit: Lewis argues that his defense counsel should have objected to the admission of State’s Exhibit 7.

Dean, 146 Ohio St.3d 106, 2015-Ohio-4347, 54 N.E.3d 80, ¶ 237. To prevail on a claim that the trial court committed plain error, Hayes must show that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was obvious, and (3) it affected the outcome of the trial. See State v. Kirkland, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-4079, ¶ 71-72.\n\n¶42 The test for whether prosecutorial misconduct mandates reversal is whether the prosecutor’s remarks or actions were improper, and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the accused. State v. Smith, 97 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-Ohio-6659, 780 N.E.2d 221, ¶ 45. The touchstone of the analysis “is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.” State v. Madison, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-3735, ¶ 177, quoting Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 212, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982).\n\nA. Vouching\n\n¶43 Improper vouching occurs when a prosecutor implies knowledge of facts outside the record or places her or his personal credibility in issue. State v. Myers, 154 Ohio St.3d 405, 2018-Ohio-1903, 114 N.E.3d 1138, ¶ 145. A prosecutor\nmay not express a personal belief or opinion as to a witness’s credibility. *Id.* However, a prosecutor may comment on “considerations that the jury could properly consider in evaluating [a witness’s] credibility: his demeanor, consistency, and opportunity to observe, as well as the extent to which other evidence corroborated his testimony.” *Id.* at ¶ 147. None of the instances cited by Hayes constituted error, let alone plain error.\n\n¶44 Hayes points to prosecutor’s remarks describing Kelley as “earnest,” “passionate,” and “theatrical,” and telling the jury to focus on the facts rather than her credibility. The prosecutor pointed out Kelley’s theatrics and said if “that’s all you had to judge her credibility, * * * I mean, I know what your decision would be, but I’m going to ask you to keep your mind open and just think about the actual facts that we know.” The prosecutor did not vouch for credibility and instructed the jury to focus on the evidence.\n\n¶45 Hayes next directs us to the prosecutor’s comment that if Kelley was going to lie, then she “could have told a better lie.” The prosecutor argued that if Kelley was going to falsely implicate Hayes, she could have added further embellishment to her version of the events by saying that she saw Hayes at her car and spoke to him, rather than simply saying she saw a bowlegged man. The comment was in response to the defense attacks on Kelley’s credibility and did not express the prosecutor’s personal view of her credibility.\n\n¶46 Finally, Hayes argues that the prosecutor dismissed Kelley’s “contradictory testimony regarding seeing Mr. Hayes walk out of the complex versus seeing him jumping into a white SUV as a ‘mistake’ rather than a lie.” The prosecutor asked the jury to consider whether it was Kelley’s intent to omit information in her 911 call or whether she made a mistake in omitting it, stating, “That’s for you to decide.” This comment did not express the prosecutor’s personal opinion of her credibility. No plain error occurred.\nB. Misrepresentation of the Evidence\n\n{¶47} Hayes argues that the prosecutor misrepresented the evidence in several instances. First, to quote Hayes’s brief, “The prosecutor then submitted that, if Mr. Johnson were going to lie, why not explicitly say he saw Daryle Hayes walking away from the scene of the fire? Quite simply, he did.” However, this is a misreading of the record.\n\n{¶48} The prosecutor stated:\n\n[I]f Mr. Johnson is going to lie, why wouldn't he say instead of, I was walking Cookie, I heard glass breaking, then I turned, I saw what appeared to be a flashlight, but then it sort of flamed up. Daryle Hayes walked away, went away.\n\nIf [Johnson] was going to lie, why wouldn't he just say, I saw Daryle walk up, break the glass, set the car alight.\n\n{¶49} The prosecutor’s point was that Johnson said that he saw Hayes walking away from the fire, but that, if Johnson were going to lie to further implicate Hayes, he could have added that he saw Hayes walk up to Kelley’s car, break the glass, and set the fire. The prosecutor did not misstate Johnson’s testimony.\n\n{¶50} Next, Hayes argues that the prosecutor misrepresented the evidence when he said that Johnson wrote a statement. However, the prosecutor referred to the statement that Johnson wrote in connection with the police photo array. That signed statement was entered into evidence, and the prosecutor properly commented on it.\n\n{¶51} Hayes also argues that the prosecutor misstated the evidence as to how the investigator learned that Hayes’s girlfriend drove a white SUV. The prosecutor argued that Hayes himself had told the investigator that his girlfriend had a white SUV. Defense counsel objected, stating, “I don’t believe that’s what the testimony was.” The trial court overruled defense counsel’s objection. Because Hayes objected,\nwe apply a harmless-error standard of review. See State v. Jones, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-3051, ¶ 18. Under the harmless-error standard, the state must demonstrate that the error did not affect the substantial rights of the defendant, that is, that the error did not affect the outcome of the trial. Id.\n\n{¶52} Although the prosecutor incorrectly stated that Hayes provided the investigator with the information that his girlfriend drove a white SUV, the information that Hayes provided led to the investigator’s discovery of that information. To the extent that an imprecise statement about the evidence was made, the trial court addressed the issue by instructing the jury that the arguments of counsel are not evidence and that the jurors are the sole judges of the facts. See State v. Diar, 120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, ¶ 211; Kirkland, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-4079, at ¶ 117, citing State v. Apanovitch, 33 Ohio St.3d 19, 24, 514 N.E.2d 394 (1987) (jury instruction that closing arguments are not evidence contributed to determination that prosecutor’s improper statements did not deny a fair trial). Therefore, the prosecution’s statement, and the court’s error in failing to sustain defense counsel’s objection to the misstatement, was harmless.\n\nC. Conclusion as to Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n{¶53} After reviewing the prosecutor’s closing argument in its entirety, we hold that, although the prosecutor made a misstatement, the statement in no way permeated the state’s argument so as to deny Hayes a fair trial. See State v. Thompson, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, 23 N.E.3d 1096, ¶ 203. Consequently, we overrule the second assignment of error."}

An appellate court reviews an imposed sentence under the standard of review set forth in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), which governs all felony sentences. Pursuant to that statute, an appellate court does not review the sentencing court's decision for an abuse of discretion. Rather, R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) compels an appellate court to modify or vacate a sentence only if the appellate court finds by clear and convincing evidence that 'the record does not support the trial court's findings under relevant statutes or that the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.'

He further argues he received ineffective assistance by his trial counsel as counsel failed to move for a mistrial following the prosecutor's interruption of defense counsel's opening statement.1\n\nThe record reveals that defense counsel reserved his opening statement until the close of the state's case-in-chief. The prosecutor objected as follows during defense counsel's opening statement:\n\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The State's going to suggest to you that you heard a full confession from Mr. Combs and that you have a full written confession. What you have is a recorded statement from Mr. Combs and a written statement from Mr. Combs. And in that statement, he gives a lot of information.

Within his assignment of error alleging prosecutorial misconduct, appellant also makes the argument that defense counsel was ineffective for not objecting to an officer's \"rambling dissertation\" of efforts undertaken to apprehend appellant. Appellant did not separately set forth an assignment of error alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, as required by App.R. 16(A). As such, we need not address appellant's arguments regarding counsel's alleged failure to object to a witness's testimony. See App.R. 12(A)(2). However, even if we were to consider such an argument, the argument fails as counsel's decision not to object falls within the ambit of trial strategy and alone will not establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.

Let's avoid argument.\n\n[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. Thank you.\n\nAfter the trial court overruled the prosecutor's objection, defense counsel continued his\nopening statement without any further interruption.\n\nAppellant contends the prosecutor's single objection during defense counsel's opening statement damaged his right to a fair trial. He argues that by interrupting defense counsel's opening remarks, the prosecutor \"tainted the jury\" by \"sending a signal to the jury that [defense counsel] d[id] not deserve to be listened to.

This is reflected in his June 2018 report. Dr. Schlievert testified that Me.W.’s delayed disclosure of her sexual abuse stemmed in large part due to her fear of what would happen to appellant, her father, the fact that she did not know it was wrong, and that she had been isolated and did not have a trusted person to report the abuse to.

{"index": "477-Towns", "allegation_num": "allegation_1", "allegation": "There is insufficient evidence to support appellant’s conviction.", "extracted_text": "¶ 72 In addition to the proscription against dissemination of information about child abuse and neglect found in the memorandum of understanding, Ohio law also precludes disclosure of such information. Indeed, R.C. 2151.421(I) provides the following concerning disclosure of reports such as the Job and Family Services report:\n\n(I)(1) Except as provided in divisions (I)(4) and (O) of this section, a report made under this section is confidential. The information provided in a report made pursuant to this section and the name of the person who made the report shall not be released for use, and shall not be used, as evidence in any civil action or proceeding brought against the person who made the report. * * *\n\n(2)(a) Except as provided in division (I)(2)(b) of this section, no person shall permit or encourage the unauthorized dissemination of the contents of any report made under this section.\n\n---\n\n1 Appellant asserts that R.C. 2151.421(I) is unconstitutional as a prior restraint on his freedom of speech. Having already rejected appellant’s free speech arguments, we find no merit to appellant’s argument here, and we therefore find that R.C. 2151.421(I) is binding upon appellant.\nThe evidence introduced by the state at trial establishes that the Job and Family Services report contained information regarding reports of child abuse and neglect, including the name of at least one reporter. This information was plainly confidential under R.C. 2151.421(I). Under R.C. 102.03(B), appellant was prohibited from releasing information that is ‘confidential because of statutory provisions,’ which would include R.C. 2151.421(I).\n\nFurther, appellant was prohibited from disclosing this information by the memorandum of understanding, which clearly designates the information as confidential, a status that is both warranted because of the sensitive nature of these proceedings and necessary in order to ensure the safety of those involved in such proceedings, including the mandatory reporters of child abuse and neglect who are conducting government business. R.C. 102.03(B).\n\nAppellant attempts to avoid this conclusion by noting that he disclosed the Job and Family Services report to the Williams County Commissioners prior to releasing it to the public, thereby rendering the report a public record and vitiating its confidential status. Restated, appellant argues that because he disclosed the report to the Williams County Commissioners, he was therefore entitled to disclose the report to the public. We reject this argument.\n\nThe information released by appellant was confidential under the express terms of both the memorandum of understanding and R.C. 2151.421(I). Appellant cannot avoid that characterization and unilaterally render the information public simply by\nproviding it to another elected body. To hold otherwise would render advisory the proscription against disclosure of reports containing sensitive information concerning child abuse and neglect. Appellant’s logic would permit public officials to disregard Ohio law and disseminate this information at their discretion, in direct contravention of R.C. 2151.421(I) and, in this case, the memorandum of understanding executed by appellant.\n\n¶ 77 Appellant also argues that the information contained in the Job and Family Services report was published in local newspapers prior to its release, and was thus not confidential. However, BCI agent Emahiser testified that he was unaware of any public records available in the news or on the internet that identified ‘Nurse Pam from Hicksville Hospital’ by name, as did the Job and Family Service report. Appellant does not point to any evidence to the contrary. Because there is no evidence that the news reports referenced by appellant revealed the same confidential information contained in the Job and Family Services report, appellant’s argument concerning news reports is unfounded.\n\n¶ 78 Here, a prosecution for violation of R.C. 102.03(B) requires the state to establish that the information disclosed by appellant was confidential under either R.C. 2151.421(I) or the memorandum of understanding. The evidence put forth by the state establishes that the evidence was confidential under both the statute and the memorandum. Therefore, we reject appellant’s argument that the state’s evidence was\ninsufficient to establish that the material disclosed in the Job and Family Services report was confidential."}
{"index": "477-Towns", "allegation_num": "allegation_2", "allegation": "Appellant’s conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence.", "extracted_text": "¶ 78 Here, a prosecution for violation of R.C. 102.03(B) requires the state to establish that the information disclosed by appellant was confidential under either R.C. 2151.421(I) or the memorandum of understanding. The evidence put forth by the state establishes that the evidence was confidential under both the statute and the memorandum. Therefore, we reject appellant’s argument that the state’s evidence was insufficient to establish that the material disclosed in the Job and Family Services report was confidential.\n\n¶ 79 Next, appellant argues that the state failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that he recklessly released the confidential information contained in the Job and Family Services report.\n\n¶ 80 Under R.C. 2901.22(C),\n\nA person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.\n\n¶ 81 Appellant argues that he did not act recklessly in this case because he ‘thought names and other sensitive information should be redacted,’ and took action to remove the Job and Family Service report from public view once he realized that unredacted confidential information was contained therein. Appellant contends that his efforts to redact the confidential information, which included directing Nye to make the necessary redactions and consulting with his mentor about the release of the Job and Family Services report, refute the notion that he acted recklessly in this case.\n\n¶ 82 In response, the state argues that appellant’s attempt to make necessary redactions does not overshadow the reality that the posting of a report consisting of several hundred pages of potentially confidential information posed a significant risk of unlawful disclosure of confidential information. According to the state, appellant’s persistence in releasing the report constituted a heedless indifference to this risk, and amounted to recklessness on appellant’s part.\n\n¶ 83 Having thoroughly reviewed the record in its entirety, we make two observations relevant to appellant’s recklessness argument. First, it is clear from the evidence that appellant made some attempt to redact the confidential information from the Job and Family Services report, and acted promptly to remove the report from the internet once he was contacted by Meyers and informed that the report contained confidential information. Second, Nye’s testimony establishes that appellant was aware of concerns regarding the existence of confidential, nondisclosable information in the report following his redaction efforts and prior to its release. Nye informed appellant that the material could not be released, but appellant disagreed and decided to post it to the internet anyway.\n\n¶ 84 The first observation above indicates that it was not appellant’s intent to release confidential information to the public. However, the state was required to establish recklessness, not intent, and the second observation reveals that appellant’s effort to redact the confidential material was secondary to his desire to publicize what he perceived to be shortcomings at Job and Family Services.\n\n¶ 85 Appellant’s decision to publish the Job and Family Services report ignored Nye’s ‘rule of thumb’ that appellant’s office could not release and therefore should not release records that were created by another agency. It is clear that appellant made a calculated decision to publish a report containing sensitive, confidential information despite language prohibiting such publication contained in the Ohio Revised Code and the memorandum of understanding to which he assented as sheriff, and despite Nye’s practical advice cautioning against publication of the report.\n\n¶ 86 When viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, as we must do in a sufficiency analysis, we find that a rational trier of fact could find that appellant’s decision to release the report despite concerns made known to him regarding the sensitive nature of the information contained therein constituted a heedless indifference to the consequences of releasing the report and a disregard of the substantial and unjustifiable risk that the report contained confidential information that was nondisclosable, thereby establishing recklessness. Accordingly, we reject appellant’s sufficiency argument as to the recklessness element.\n\n¶ 87 Next, we turn to appellant’s manifest argument set forth in his second assignment of error. In his brief, appellant asserts that he ‘does not present this Court with additional areas of emphasis from those discussed in the [sufficiency] assignment of error.’ As to these areas of emphasis, namely whether the state established the confidential nature of the information contained in the Job and Family Services report and appellant’s recklessness, we have reviewed the record, weighed the evidence and all reasonable inferences to be drawn from that evidence, and considered the credibility of witnesses. Having done so, we do not find that the jury clearly lost its way in resolving conflicts in the evidence, nor do we conclude that the jury created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. While the evidence presented in this case on the issue of recklessness was perhaps susceptible to a different conclusion than that reached by the jury, we cannot say that this is the ‘exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.’ Thompkins, supra, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. Therefore, appellant’s conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence."}

C-170699 and C-170700, 2019-Ohio-2985, ¶ 9.\n\n¶24 Crim.R. 16(K) requires that an expert witness prepare a “written report summarizing the expert witness’s testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinion, and shall include a summary of the expert’s qualifications.” The report must be turned over to the other side “no later than twenty-one days prior to trial.” Crim.R. 16(K). “Failure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert’s testimony at trial.” Id.; State v. Boaston, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-1061, ¶ 1.\n\n¶25 As discussed by this court in Hall, the purpose of Crim.R. 16(K) is to avoid “trial by ambush.” Hall at ¶ 11. In the context of a criminal prosecution, Crim.R. 16(K) provides the defense “an opportunity to challenge the expert’s findings, analysis, or qualifications, possibly with the support of an adverse expert who could discredit the opinion after carefully reviewing the written report.” Id., quoting State v. Fetty, 11th Dist. Portage No. 2011-P-0091, 2012-Ohio-6127, ¶ 36.\n\n¶26 The court qualified Shuck as an expert witness and admitted as evidence the SANE Report and photographs of the apparent redness and bruising to Thompson’s throat and mouth. During her direct examination of Schuck, the prosecutor stated, “So we talked about two specific physical injuries after you went\nthrough your exam. And I would like to ask you your opinions about those injuries.” The prosecutor asked Shuck whether she was able to formulate an opinion as to the redness and bruising to the mouth and the back of the throat. Shuck testified, “It is consistent with [Thompson’s] narrative history of * * * a penis being forced into his mouth. And this is consistent with forceful penetration.” The prosecutor then asked, “And what do you base—so do you have an expert opinion about what is reflected to the injury in the back of the victim’s throat?” Defense counsel objected, and the following exchange occurred at sidebar:\n\nDefense counsel: We object to her indicating based on her expert status that she is – that she has an opinion that is a forceful penetration because that’s not reflected anywhere in her record. So we have not had an opportunity to arrive with any expert of our own whether or not that is, in fact, forceful penetration. She – obviously, there is no report indicating that that would be her testimony.\n\nThe court: Okay. Response?\n\nProsecutor: I believe that the witness is qualified to render an opinion of this nature based on her training and her experience. And that is the point of her testimony at trial.\n\nThe court: I’m going to overrule the objection on the basis that she can say, and did say that it is consistent with what was reported and what was reported contained in the notes. She is not stating definitively that was the cause, only that it’s consistent – that the bruising is consistent with forceful penetration. So the objection is noted but overruled.\nDefense counsel: To the extent that she would say that it’s her scientific expert opinion that it was, that –\n\nThe court: Then it would be sustained.\n\n{¶27} Howard contends that the following opinions rendered by Shuck were expert testimony: (1) that the bruising and redness in Thompson’s mouth and throat were consistent with his narrative and forceful penetration; (2) that the bruising and redness were consistent with blunt force trauma and were not the result of illness; (3) that the appearance of bite marks can vary person to person because people’s skin reacts differently; and (4) that choking may not always result in a physical manifestation such as a mark on the skin or redness.\n\n{¶28} The state concedes that that Shuck’s opinions were not included in the SANE Report. Instead, it argues that although Shuck was qualified as an expert, her testimony was not expert testimony, but rather lay testimony admissible under Evid.R. 701. Therefore, we must first determine whether Shuck’s testimony was expert or lay testimony.\n\n{¶29} In State v. Lavender, 2019-Ohio-5352, 141 N.E.3d 1000, ¶ 94 (1st Dist.), this court identified an expert witness as one who is “qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to provide a scientific, technical, or other specialized opinion about the evidence or a fact issue.” Id. at ¶ 95, quoting State v. Fread, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2013-03-045, 2013-Ohio-5206, ¶ 14. A lay witness is restricted to “giving an opinion or making an inference that (1) is based on firsthand knowledge, and (2) is helpful in clarifying the testimony or in determining facts.” Id. “The distinction between lay and expert-witness opinion testimony is that lay testimony results from a process of reasoning familiar in everyday life, while expert\ntestimony results from a process of reasoning that only specialists in the field can master.” Lavender at ¶ 95, citing State v. McKee, 91 Ohio St.3d 292, 297, 744 N.E.2d 737 (2001), fn. 2.\n\n{¶30} Shuck testified regarding her education and experience, including that she had conducted over 400 sexual-assault examinations, and was recognized by the court as an expert witness. Although a lay person is arguably capable of making a connection between bruising and redness and forceful penetration, Shuck’s notes in the SANE Report do not indicate the extent or severity of the bruising and redness, and Shuck testified that she could not have “confirmed” the injuries based solely on the photographs of the apparent bruising and redness. Therefore, the jury was asked to rely on Shuck’s personal observations and her opinion that the severity of the bruising and redness led her to conclude that it was “consistent with” Thompson’s narrative of “a penis being forced into his mouth * * * forceful penetration,” and “blunt force trauma.” This “consistent with” testimony went beyond a lay person’s knowledge—it resulted from Shuck’s expertise in sexual assault examinations.\n\n{¶31} Shuck rendered further expert testimony when she ruled out illness as a source of the bruising and redness, opined that the manifestation of bite marks on skin vary from person to person, and stated that choking may not result in a mark on the neck.\n\n{¶32} The court overruled defense counsel’s objection on the basis that Shuck testified that the injuries were consistent with Thompson’s narrative and forceful penetration, and not that the injuries were definitively caused by forceful penetration. However, expert testimony is often stated in terms of whether an injury or a behavior is “consistent with.” See, e.g., State v. Stowers, 81 Ohio St.3d 260, 261,\n690 N.E.2d 881 (1998) (court held that an expert witness’s testimony that the behavior of an alleged child victim of sexual abuse is consistent with behavior observed in sexually abused children was admissible as expert testimony).\n\n{¶33} Having determined that Shuck’s testimony was expert testimony and that the state failed to comply with Crim.R. 16(K), we must now determine whether the error was harmless. See Boaston, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-1061, at ¶ 60.\n\n{¶34} Crim.R. 52(A) provides, “Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.” In order for a defendant’s substantial rights to be prejudiced by an error, the error “must have affected the outcome of the [trial] court proceedings.” Boaston at ¶ 62, quoting State v. Fisher, 99 Ohio St.3d 127, 2003-Ohio-2761, 789 N.E.2d 222, ¶ 7.\n\n{¶35} This requires a three-part analysis:\n\nFirst, it must be determined whether the defendant was prejudiced by the error, i.e., whether the error had an impact on the verdict. Second, it must be determined whether the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Lastly, once the prejudicial evidence is excised, the remaining evidence is weighed to determine whether it establishes the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n(Citations omitted.) Boaston at ¶ 63, quoting State v. Harris, 142 Ohio St.3d 211, 2015-Ohio-166, 28 N.E.3d 1256, ¶ 37.\n\n{¶36} Howard likens his case to Hall, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-170699 and C-170700, 2019-Ohio-2985, where in a case involving child sexual abuse, the trial “hinged on a credibility battle between the defendant and his accusers.” Id. In Hall, the state qualified Detective Jane Noel as an expert in investigating child abuse and\nneglect, but failed to provide an expert report as required by Crim.R. 16(K). *Id.* at ¶ 12. This court held that it was not harmless error to admit the expert witness’s testimony where the testimony improperly bolstered the credibility of the victims and the state’s medical expert witness.\n\n{¶37} In its harmless-error analysis, first the court determined that Hall was prejudiced by Noel’s testimony because Noel was presented as an “accomplished expert,” the state emphasized Noel’s testimony throughout closing argument, and her testimony bolstered the victims’ testimony where the “state’s entire case hinged on the credibility of the victims.” *Id.* at ¶ 21-22. Also, the court noted that the “weight that expert testimony carries with the jury is fundamentally different than that of lay testimony,” and “countering such testimony requires unique considerations, of which defense counsel was deprived in this instance.” *Id.* at ¶ 23.\n\n{¶38} Second, the court determined that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. “Noel’s testimony bolstered the children’s testimony by lending it credibility in a case without any physical evidence against the defendant, thus likely impacting the jury’s verdict.” *Id.* at ¶ 24. The court also highlighted that the defendant was acquitted on multiple of the 12 counts against him; “this is not the prototypical case where evidence of guilt is strong, and we can have confidence that the error did not impact the outcome.” *Id.*\n\n{¶39} Finally, the court excised Noel’s testimony and reviewed the strength of the remaining evidence. *Id.* at ¶ 25. The case depended on who the jury found more credible—Hall or the victims. *Id.* Thus, the “admission of Detective Noel’s expert testimony likely colored the jury’s ability to properly weigh the credibility of the witnesses.” *Id.*\nTurning to the present case, we must first decide whether Howard was prejudiced by the inclusion of Shuck’s testimony. Since Howard admitted to “nibbling” on Thompson and leaving a “passion mark” on his hip, Shuck’s testimony regarding the manifestation of bite marks did not prejudice Howard, and so was harmless.\n\nThe state contends that Shuck’s remaining expert opinions did not prejudice Howard because he admitted that the encounter with Thompson may have been “a little rough,” and admitted that he “pushed” Thompson’s head onto his penis while Thompson performed fellatio on him in the living room.\n\nThe problem with the state’s argument is that Thompson denied ever performing fellatio on Howard in the living room. Rather, the charge of oral rape was based on Thompson’s testimony that after the anal sex in the bedroom, Howard forced Thompson’s mouth open and forcefully “jabbed” his penis into his mouth several times. Howard denied ever putting his penis in Thompson’s mouth in the bedroom.\n\nShuck was presented as an expert witness with extensive training and experience in conducting sexual-assault examinations, including having conducted over 400 such examinations. Similar to Hall, the case hinged on a credibility determination between Howard and Thompson. The jury acquitted Howard of anal rape (for which Shuck did not testify as to any physical injuries), and convicted him of oral rape (for which Shuck testified that Thompson had injuries to his throat and mouth consistent with “having a penis forced into his mouth,” forceful penetration, and blunt force trauma).\nShuck testified that the pictures of the bruising and redness to the throat and mouth do not accurately reflect the extent of the injuries. She even testified that she would not have been able to “confirm” the injuries based on the photos alone. This makes her “consistent with” testimony even more impactful—the jury was asked to rely on her visual findings in order to appreciate the extent of the bruising and redness in Thompson’s throat.\n\nThompson testified that Howard choked him multiple times, and hard enough to partially block his airway and cause him to become light-headed. Shuck’s testimony regarding the lack of marks on Thompson’s neck helped explain why Thompson’s husband did not notice any marks on his neck when Thompson came home, and why Shuck did not observe any marks on Thompson’s neck during her examination.\n\nIn closing, the state emphasized Shuck’s testimony that the injuries to the mouth and throat were the result of blunt force trauma, were consistent with Thompson’s story, and could not have been caused by illness. The prosecutor stated, “There is physical evidence that matches Mr. Thompson’s version of events.”\n\nAlso, as defense counsel pointed out in his sidebar conversation with the trial judge regarding his objection, he was not put on notice that Shuck would testify that the bruising and redness in the throat were “consistent with forceful penetration” and Thompson’s narrative, and so he was unable to effectively counter Shuck’s testimony. See Hall, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-170699 and C-170700, 2019-Ohio-2985, at ¶23.\n\nThe state contends that Howard was provided with Shuck’s SANE Report prior to trial, and so was not “ambushed” by Shuck’s testimony and had the\nopportunity to hire his own expert. There are three problems with the state’s contention. First, there is no question that the SANE Report did not include Shuck’s expert opinions.\n\n{¶49} Second, we question whether the lack of surprise should be considered in the harmless-error analysis. In Boaston, the court considered the fact that the defense was not surprised by the coroner’s testimony when determining whether the trial court erred in admitting the testimony, but it did not consider the lack of surprise in its harmless-error analysis. Boaston, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-1061, at ¶ 64-70.\n\n{¶50} Third, even if we do consider that Howard was on notice that Shuck had observed redness and bruising in Thompson’s throat and mouth, it did not excuse the state’s failure to provide an expert report that included Shuck’s opinions. In Boaston, defense counsel met with the coroner-expert witness 19 days before trial and became aware that the coroner would testify to two opinions not included in the previously provided expert report: the victim’s time of death and that a belt buckle was consistent with an abrasion on the victim’s chin. Id. at ¶ 40. Defense counsel went so far as to suggest to the state that it provide a supplemental expert report disclosing those opinions, but the state never did. Id. Despite the fact that defense counsel was not “ambushed” or “surprised” at trial when the coroner testified to those opinions, the Ohio Supreme Court held that it was error to admit the testimony because the opinions were not provided in an expert report. Id. at ¶ 59.\n\n{¶51} For the foregoing reasons, we find that Howard was prejudiced by Shuck’s “consistent with” testimony, her testimony ruling out illness as a source of\nthe injuries, and her testimony regarding the lack of choke marks on Thompson’s neck.\n\n{¶52} In the second prong of the harmless-error analysis, we must determine whether the inclusion of Shuck’s testimony was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As in Hall, the fact that the case hinged on a credibility determination between Howard and Thompson carries great weight. Also, Howard was acquitted of anal rape and the sexual-motivation specification. This was not a case where the evidence was so overwhelming that we can say that Shuck’s testimony did not affect the outcome. See Hall, 1st Dist. Hamilton Nos. C-170699 and C-170700, 2019-Ohio-2985, at ¶ 24.\n\n{¶53} Finally, once we excise the offending portions of Shuck’s testimony, we must determine whether the remaining evidence establishes Howard’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Once again, that the case depended on who the jury found more credible, Howard or Thompson, weighs heavily. The admission of Shuck’s expert testimony “likely colored the jury’s ability to properly weigh the credibility of the witnesses.” See Hall at ¶ 25. The remaining evidence against Howard is underwhelming. Therefore, we cannot say that it establishes Howard’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n{¶54} Having determined that the inclusion of Shuck’s testimony was not harmless error, and therefore, warrants reversal of the rape conviction, we must now decide whether the error also requires reversal of the felonious-assault conviction. If we determine that the error in admitting Shuck’s expert testimony “affected,” “tainted” or “cast considerable doubt” on the felonious-assault conviction, the interests of justice require reversal of the felonious-assault conviction. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Kenney, 911 F.2d 315, 319 (9th Cir.1990) (giving of an improper jury instruction on elements of mail fraud necessitated reversal of mail fraud conviction, but did not require reversal of the remaining convictions for Travel Act violations and conspiracy; mail fraud did not support either conviction nor were those convictions affected by the defective instruction); United States v. Kaplan, 470 F.2d 100, 103 (7th Cir.1972) (holding that error required reversal of defendant’s conviction on one count, but not on the remaining counts because they were not “tainted” by the error); United States v. Robinson, 545 F.2d 301, 308 (2d Cir.1976) (holding that because the erroneous jury charge on one count cast “considerable doubt” on the validity of the remaining count of conviction, “the interests of justice” require a new trial on that count).\n\n¶55 The crux of the felonious-assault case was whether Thompson knew, prior to the sexual act, that Howard was HIV positive. Howard testified that Thompson knew that he was HIV positive, and that they even discussed his diagnosis while they were sitting in the living room on the day in question. Howard also testified that he “posted” on his social media accounts that he was HIV positive, and that generally he was open about his diagnosis. Thompson testified that Howard never told him that he was HIV positive, and that he was not aware of that fact until he came to court.\n\n¶56 If the jury believed that Howard lied about not orally raping Thompson, then it would stand to reason that they may have believed that he lied about telling Thompson that he was HIV positive. Since Shuck’s testimony bolstered Thompson’s credibility, and credibility was crucial to the outcome of the felonious-assault charge, we find that Shuck’s testimony affected, tainted, and cast\nconsiderable doubt on the felonious-assault conviction. In the interests of justice, the second assignment of error is sustained as to both the rape and felonious-assault convictions."}

Harris*, 2017-Ohio-5594, 92 N.E.3d 1283, ¶ 43 (1st Dist.); App.R. 16(A)(7). Thus, Howard has forfeited any argument regarding the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions.\n\nSince we hold that Howard is entitled to a new trial under his second assignment of error, his argument that his rape conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence is moot. *See State v. Smith*, 2019-Ohio-3257, 141 N.E.3d 590, ¶ 26 (1st Dist.). Howard’s sixth assignment of error is overruled in part and rendered moot in part."}

We disagree.\n\n¶11 When considering an argument that a criminal conviction is against the manifest weight standard, this Court is required to\n\nreview the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses and determine whether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\n\nState v. Otten, 33 Ohio App.3d 339, 340 (9th Dist.1986). Courts are cautioned to only reverse a conviction on manifest weight grounds “in exceptional cases,” State v. Carson, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26900, 2013-Ohio-5785, ¶ 32, citing Otten at 340, where the evidence “weighs heavily against the conviction[,]” State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387 (1997).\n\n¶12 A.F. and T.C. testified that they were twelve years old when these events transpired. The girls testified that they left T.C.’s house in the early evening and walked to another girl’s house before walking to McDonald’s to purchase some fries. Surveillance footage from the McDonald’s showed the girls arriving around 5:42 p.m. and leaving about ten minutes later. Surveillance footage from a different store showed them continuing to walk in the direction of T.C.’s house a few minutes after 6:00 p.m.\n\n¶13 The girls testified that, when they reached T.C.’s house, a man with a gun attacked them. They both described the man as having a neck tattoo and a mixed complexion, as if he were a combination of Caucasian and African American. Additionally, T.C. remembered the man being\nclean shaven and wearing a large brown jacket. The girls testified that the man led them to the side of T.C.’s house and asked them for money. After they gave him their money, the man told the girls “he wanted his d*** sucked.” Before things could go further, T.C. testified, another resident of the multi-unit dwelling where she lived with her family arrived home. His arrival prompted the man to order the girls to the back of the house.\n\nA.F. and T.C. testified that, at the back of the house, T.C. fell through a covered cellar door and into a basement. Upon his discovery of the basement, the man led the girls downstairs and ordered them to strip. The girls testified that the man pointed the gun at them when they hesitated, so they followed his orders. While they were in the basement, he forced them to touch either themselves or one another, to engage in oral sex with one another, and to perform fellatio. Additionally, the man anally raped each girl. The girls testified that, after he raped them, “white stuff” came out of the man’s penis and fell onto the ground. T.C. testified that the basement was messy, and the man found a sock in a pile of clothes. She remembered the sock being colorful and testified that the man used it to wipe up the white stuff. Eventually, the man released the girls, and they ran from the basement.\n\nA 911 call came through at 6:24 p.m., reporting the rape and instructing officers to be on the lookout for a light-skinned man with tattoos and a brown coat. As police responded to T.C.’s home, her mother and a friend began searching outside for the girls’ assailant. They saw a man on the street who appeared to meet the assailant’s description and confronted him. The man, G.H., denied any responsibility, so T.C.’s mother took note of his name and returned to the house to speak with the police. At that point, she also sent out “hundreds of messages” by way of social media and text, asking for help identifying her daughter’s assailant. In doing so, she included a description of the man and indicated that G.H. might have been involved. Numerous people\nreplied to her plea for help and another possible suspect emerged. The other possible suspect was Mosley.\n\n{¶16} T.C.’s mother testified that she showed T.C. a picture of G.H. while they were waiting at the child advocacy center and T.C. indicated that he was not the man who attacked her. She then showed her daughter several more pictures, including one of Mosley. The mother testified that, when T.C. saw Mosley’s picture, she confirmed that he was the man who had attacked her.\n\n{¶17} The following day, the police compiled a photo array and included a picture of Mosley in the array. An officer presented the array to A.F. in the morning and to T.C. several hours later. The officer testified that both girls selected Mosley from the array and that his picture sparked an emotional reaction from both girls.\n\n{¶18} The State produced evidence that Mosley lived one block to the south of T.C.’s house. Based on his proximity, his appearance, the girls’ description of their attacker, and the results of the photo array, a warrant was issued for his arrest. A team of officers gathered to arrest Mosley just before noon the day after the rapes occurred. Officer Brian Waddell spotted Mosley on foot as he pulled into the parking lot of a gas station in his marked cruiser. He stated that, as soon as he emerged from his cruiser, Mosley made eye contact with him and immediately began running away. He then ran after Mosley while commanding him to stop and informing other officers that Mosley was running.\n\n{¶19} Detective Juan McCloud also was present when Mosley tried to run. He testified that Mosley had been walking alongside four other individuals and was the only one who “took off running” when he saw officers approaching. The chase ended a few seconds later when another officer tackled Mosley. Once Mosley was handcuffed, Detective McCloud testified, he offered an\nalibi for his whereabouts the previous evening. Specifically, Mosley told the detective that he was at the hospital just after 7:00 p.m. because he “felt like [he] had a knife [] stuck in [his] stomach.”\n\nThere was testimony that Mosley lived about 1.5 miles from Wooster Community Hospital. Surveillance footage from the hospital showed him casually walking into the emergency room with a female just after 7:00 p.m. As part of its forensic investigation, the police department asked BCI to analyze Mosley’s cell phone, concentrating on any activity that might have occurred around the time of the rape. The evidence showed that Mosley missed two calls from the woman who brought him to the hospital. The first of those calls came through at 6:11 p.m. and the second came in at 6:21 p.m. The BCI analyst also discovered that, at 7:16 p.m., Mosley searched the Google Play store for an application for his phone. The search that he conducted was for a police scanner.\n\nAfter Detective Anthony Lemmon listened to the interviews A.C. and T.F. gave at the child advocacy center, he searched the basement where the rapes had occurred. He was aware that the rapist may have used a sock to clean his ejaculate from the ground, so he made a point of looking for socks and uncovered four different kinds. He also found a washcloth lying on a table and decided to collect it as well. Both the socks and the washcloth were submitted to BCI for testing, along with A.C.’s and T.F.’s rape kits and underwear.\n\nA mixture of DNA, including male DNA, was detected on a swab taken from the back panel of T.C.’s underwear using polymerase chain reaction testing. The data was not sufficient for comparison, however, so the sample was forwarded on for additional testing. No semen was identified on the samples from the rape kits or on the girls’ underwear. Yet, it was found on one of the socks and on the washcloth. An analyst performed DNA testing on those two items. She testified that one person had contributed the sperm cells detected on the items, the\nestimated frequency of occurrence of that DNA profile was 1 in 1 trillion individuals, and the profile was consistent with Mosley’s DNA profile.\n\n{¶23} After polymerase chain reaction testing proved futile, a different analyst performed Y-STR testing on the swabs taken from the back panel of T.C.’s underwear. The analyst explained that, unlike polymerase chain reaction testing, Y-STR testing looks strictly for male DNA as it focuses on the Y chromosome. The analyst testified that Mosley was included in the male DNA the test detected on the back panel of T.C.’s underwear and neither he, nor any of his paternal male relatives could be excluded as the source of that DNA.\n\n{¶24} Mosley argues that the jury lost its way when it convicted him because it was swayed by evidence that was not properly admitted or argued. He claims that the State repeatedly misrepresented the DNA evidence against him and engaged in the “prosecutor’s fallacy” by overstating its statistical significance. He notes that no one ever testified that his DNA conclusively matched the DNA found on any of the swabs submitted for testing. He further notes that, while many items were tested, very few produced results. Because the State wrongfully portrayed him as the source of the DNA it uncovered in the absence of proof to that effect, he argues, his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence. The argument portion of his brief also contains a solitary assertion that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence because the identification made by one of the girls “was tainted[.]”\n\n{¶25} Initially, we note that Mosley has specifically alleged misconduct on the part of the prosecutor in his second assignment of error. See Discussion, infra. His argument to that effect likewise concerns the “prosecutor’s fallacy” and the State’s representations about the DNA evidence. We will respond to those arguments in our analysis of his second assignment of error rather than duplicating that analysis herein. See id. In performing our manifest weight review, we\nwill consider the evidence set forth at trial, the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, and the credibility of the witnesses. See Otten, 33 Ohio App.3d at 340.\n\n{¶26} Having reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice when it convicted Mosley. See id. Both victims identified Mosley as the man who raped them. While he claims that one of their identifications was “tainted,” he has not developed an argument to that effect, and this Court will not do so on his behalf. See App.R. 16(A)(7); Cardone v. Cardone, 9th Dist. Summit No. 18349, 1998 WL 224934, *8 (May 6, 1998) (“If an argument exists that can support this assignment of error, it is not this court’s duty to root it out.”). Mosley lived only one block from T.C.’s house and missed two calls on his cell phone around the time the girls were attacked. Although he claimed that he was suffering from significant abdominal pain at that time, surveillance footage from the nearby hospital he visited showed him casually walking in without any visible trace of discomfort. He also did not arrive at the hospital until just after 7:00 p.m., more than thirty minutes after the rapes were reported to the police.\n\n{¶27} The State set forth evidence that, not long after his arrival at the hospital, Mosley used his phone to search for a “police scanner” application. He also ran the following morning when confronted by the police. See State v. McCormick, 9th Dist. Summit No. 29121, 2019-Ohio-2204, ¶ 19 (flight may be considered as consciousness of guilt). There was testimony that the girls’ rapist used a sock to wipe his ejaculate from the ground, and DNA analysts found sperm cells on a sock collected from the basement. Those cells came from one person, the estimated frequency of occurrence of that DNA profile was 1 in 1 trillion individuals, and the profile was consistent with Mosley’s DNA profile. Moreover, there was testimony that he could not be\nexcluded as the source of the DNA that analysts uncovered on T.C.’s underwear when performing Y-STR testing.\n\n{¶28} The State set forth overwhelming evidence in support of Mosley’s convictions. Upon review, he has not shown that this is the exceptional case where the jury lost its way by convicting him. See Otten, 33 Ohio App.3d at 340. Accordingly, his third assignment of error is overruled."}

Those motions were based on prosecutorial misconduct, juror misconduct, and newly discovered, exculpatory evidence the State allegedly failed to disclose before trial. Upon review, we do not agree that the trial court erred when it denied Mosley’s motions.\n\n¶40 A defendant may move for a new trial when his substantial rights have been materially affected by juror misconduct, prosecutorial misconduct, or the discovery of new, material evidence that previously could not have been discovered with reasonable diligence. See Crim.R. 33(A)(2), (6). This Court generally reviews a trial court’s decision to deny a motion for new trial for an abuse of discretion. State v. Bressi, 9th Dist. Summit No. 29257, 2020-Ohio-4, ¶ 7; State v. Pyle, 9th Dist. Summit No. 28802, 2018-Ohio-3160, ¶ 47. Likewise, we review for an abuse of discretion a trial court’s decision whether to hold a hearing on a motion for new trial. State v. Powe, 9th Dist. Summit No. 29413, 2019-Ohio-5332, ¶ 9. An abuse of discretion implies the trial court’s decision is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219 (1983).\n\nJuror Misconduct\n\n¶41 When a defendant moves for a new trial on the basis of juror misconduct, a trial court must conduct a two-part inquiry. See Pyle at ¶ 50. “The first determination is whether misconduct actually occurred, and the second is whether that misconduct materially prejudiced the defendant’s substantial rights.” State v. Jalowiec, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 14CA010548, 2015-Ohio-5042, ¶ 48. Claims of juror misconduct “must be sustained by affidavit showing their truth * * *.” Crim.R. 33(C). Additionally, “the evidence of the alleged misconduct must come from a ‘source, other than one of the jurors, who possesses firsthand knowledge of the misconduct.’” State v. Leggett, 9th Dist. Summit No. 18303, 1997 WL 775688, * 5 (Oct. 29, 1997), quoting State v. Roudebush, 9th Dist. Wayne No. 96CA0025, 1996 WL 625248, * 1 (Oct. 30, 1996). “Juror testimony is generally not admissible to impeach a jury verdict unless there is supporting evidence aliunde.” State v. Penix, 9th Dist. Summit No. 23699, 2008-Ohio-1051, ¶ 38. See also Evid.R. 606(B). “The purpose of the aliunde rule is to maintain the sanctity of the jury room and the deliberations therein.” (Emphasis omitted.) Hessler, 90 Ohio St.3d at 123.\n\n¶42 Mosley supported his motion for new trial with affidavits from his two attorneys. Both attorneys averred that they were alerted to two instances of juror misconduct when speaking with the jurors after trial. One juror had said he felt Mosley was guilty because he did not testify in his own defense. Others had said they felt sympathy for a State’s witness due to defense counsel’s cross-examination. Mosley argued that their admissions evidenced their failure to follow the court’s instructions and decide the matter based strictly on the evidence presented at trial.\n\n¶43 Upon review, Mosley failed to demonstrate that any juror misconduct occurred. See Jalowiec at ¶ 48. The only evidence he presented in support of his argument came directly from his attorneys’ discussion with the jurors. He failed to set forth any “extraneous, independent\nevidence of alleged conduct based on the firsthand knowledge of one who is not a juror.” *State v. Scheck*, 9th Dist. Medina No. 05CA0033-M, 2006-Ohio-647, ¶ 25. Without that evidence, his attorneys were “incompetent to testify to the [jurors’] [] statements.” *Id.* at ¶ 26. See also Evid.R. 606(B). Because Mosley failed to set forth any admissible evidence in support of his claim of juror misconduct, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied that portion of his motion for new trial.\n\n**Prosecutorial Misconduct**\n\n{¶44} As with a claim of juror misconduct, trial courts assessing a motion for new trial based on prosecutorial misconduct must engage in a two-step inquiry. *Jalowiec* at ¶ 48. “The first determination is whether misconduct actually occurred, and the second is whether that misconduct materially prejudiced the defendant’s substantial rights.” *Id.* “[A] judgment may only be reversed for prosecutorial misconduct when the improper conduct deprives the defendant of a fair trial.” *State v. Knight*, 9th Dist. Lorain No. 03CA008239, 2004-Ohio-1227, ¶ 6. “The defendant must show that, but for the prosecutor’s misconduct, the jury would not have convicted him.” *State v. Wright*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 25280, 2010-Ohio-5106, ¶ 22.\n\n{¶45} “Prosecutors must avoid insinuations and assertions calculated to mislead.” *State v. Lott*, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 166 (1990). “‘A prosecutor, however, is permitted to comment freely on what the evidence has shown and what reasonable inferences may be drawn therefrom.’” *State v. M.G.*, 9th Dist. Medina No. 15CA0067-M, 2017-Ohio-4210, ¶ 13, quoting *State v. Colvin*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26063, 2012-Ohio-4914, ¶ 23. “Ohio law grants prosecutors wide latitude * * *.” *State v. Wittman*, 9th Dist. Summit No. 23291, 2006-Ohio-6971, ¶ 6.\n\n{¶46} At trial, the State drew heavily upon the DNA evidence in crafting a theme for its case. At the center of its theme was the concept of “125 Earths.” The prosecutor argued that “125\nis the exact amount of planet Earths that there would have to be of roughly eight billion people for someone, for anyone, to have the exact same sperm fraction DNA as Joseph Mosley.” The State utilized the “125 Earths” theme in both opening statements and closing arguments. Mosley argues that the State’s theme was a “DNA fallacy” that was not based on the evidence.\n\n{¶47} As previously noted, a DNA analyst from BCI testified that she detected sperm on a sock and a washcloth taken from the crime scene. She testified that one person had contributed the cells, the estimated frequency of occurrence of that DNA profile was 1 in 1 trillion individuals, and the profile was consistent with Mosley’s DNA profile. She specifically explained that her conclusion meant that “if [she] tested approximately one trillion individuals, [she] would expect that only one would have a DNA profile consistent with that sperm fraction.” The prosecutor asked the analyst about Earth’s current population, and she answered that there were about eight billion people on Earth. She also testified, in response to further inquiry, that there are 1,000 billions in 1 trillion. The State, therefore, divided 1 trillion by eight billion to arrive at its argument that there would have to be 125 Earths for someone else to have the same DNA profile as Mosley.\n\n{¶48} The United States Supreme Court has explained the so-called “prosecutor’s fallacy” as follows:\n\nThe prosecutor’s fallacy is the assumption that the random match probability is the same as the probability that the defendant was not the source of the DNA sample. See Nat. Research Council, Comm. on DNA Forensic Science, The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence 133 (1996) (“Let P equal the probability of a match, given the evidence genotype. The fallacy is to say that P is also the probability that the DNA at the crime scene came from someone other than the defendant”). In other words, if a juror is told the probability a member of the general population would share the same DNA is 1 in 10,000 (random match probability), and he takes that to mean there is only a 1 in 10,000 chance that someone other than the defendant is the source of the DNA found at the crime scene (source probability), then he has succumbed to the prosecutor’s fallacy. It is further error to equate source probability with probability of guilt, unless there is no explanation other than guilt for a person to be the source of crime-scene DNA. This faulty reasoning may result in an erroneous statement that, based on a random match probability of 1 in 10,000,\nthere is a 0.01% chance the defendant is innocent or a 99.99% chance the defendant is guilty.\n\n*McDaniel v. Brown*, 558 U.S. 120, 128 (2010). The fallacy also has been explained, by way of example, as using the conclusion that “‘there is a 99.9% chance that the animal will have two arms and two legs given that it is a chimpanzee’” to form the conclusion that “‘there is a 99.9% chance that the animal is a chimpanzee given that it has two arms and two legs.’” Browne, Kingsley R., *Pernicious P-Values: Statistical Proof of Not Very Much*, 42 U. Dayton L.Rev. 113, 115 (2017). Random match probability is distinct from source probability, and it is error to confuse the two. *See McDaniel* at 128.\n\n{¶49} Upon review, Mosley has not shown that the State engaged in misconduct when fashioning its theme and argument about the DNA evidence. *See Jalowiec*, 2015-Ohio-5042, at ¶ 48. The State properly highlighted the rarity of Mosley’s DNA profile and the odds of that profile appearing again in the general population (random match probability). The prosecutor never argued that there was less than a 1% chance Mosley was innocent. Indeed, the analyst from BCI specifically testified that she did not perform source attribution. The State’s “125 Earths” argument was a reasonable inference drawn from simple math, *see M.G.*, 2017-Ohio-4210, at ¶ 13, quoting *Colvin*, 2012-Ohio-4914, at ¶ 23, and the record supports the trial court’s determination that it was “consistent with the evidence.” *Compare Whack v. State*, 433 Md. 728, 746 (2013) (analyst’s testimony that defendant’s DNA might have been present at the scene did not support prosecutor’s argument, “stating emphatically that [the defendant’s] DNA was present”). Mosley has not shown that the prosecutor confused source probability with random match probability or otherwise misrepresented the DNA evidence. *See McDaniel* at ¶ 28; *Whack* at 753. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it rejected his claim of prosecutorial misconduct.\nNewly Discovered Evidence\n\n¶50 A defendant who moves for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence generally must show that the new evidence\n\n“(1) discloses a strong probability that it will change the result if a new trial is granted, (2) has been discovered since the trial, (3) is such as could not in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered before the trial, (4) is material to the issues, (5) is not merely cumulative to former evidence, and (6) does not merely impeach or contradict the former evidence.”\n\nJalowiec at ¶ 30, quoting State v. Petro, 148 Ohio St. 505 (1947), syllabus. The materiality standard is lessened if the defendant claims that the newly discovered evidence was withheld by the State in violation of his due process rights. Jalowiec at ¶ 32. In that instance, the defendant must show that (1) the evidence is favorable to him “either because it is exculpatory[] or * * * impeaching;” (2) the State suppressed it “either willfully or inadvertently;” and (3) he sustained prejudice. Id. at ¶ 31, quoting Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281-282 (1999). See also Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). “Undisclosed evidence is ‘material’ when ‘there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.’” Jalowiec at ¶ 31, quoting United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985).\n\n¶51 Mosley moved for a new trial based on the State’s failure to produce his medical records from the county jail. His attorneys indicated that, unbeknownst to them at trial, Mosley was being treated for chlamydia at the time of the alleged rapes. Medical records from the jail show that his antibiotics were brought to the jail and administered to him for several days. Mosley attached the jail records to his motion, as well as records from Wooster Community Hospital. The hospital records show that he was diagnosed with chlamydia twelve days before the rapes occurred and prescribed the antibiotic.\nMosley argues that chlamydia is a highly infectious sexually transmitted disease (\"STD\") that likely would have been transmitted to A.F. or T.C. if he had raped them. Because neither victim was treated for chlamydia, he argues, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different if the jury had heard evidence about his condition. Mosley argues that he is entitled to a new trial due to the State’s failure to disclose “the STD evidence[.]”\n\nUpon review, Mosley has not shown that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. See Bressi, 2020-Ohio-4, at ¶ 7. Mosley could have discovered the evidence at issue with due diligence, given that he would have been aware of his own medical diagnosis and treatment history. See Jalowiec, 2015-Ohio-5042, at ¶ 40. The fact that he may not have shared that information with his attorneys before trial is inapposite. He has not shown that the State suppressed the evidence. See id. at ¶ 31. Moreover, he has not shown that there is a reasonable probability that, had his attorneys been aware of that information, the result of the proceeding would have been different. See id. at ¶ 31, quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682. Mosley failed to produce any evidence indicating how many days’ worth of medication he was prescribed to treat his chlamydia. Nevertheless, the records attached to his motion show that he was prescribed an antibiotic almost two weeks before the rapes and continued his course of treatment for several days at the jail. Mosley’s argument that he was still contagious when the girls were raped is purely speculative. See Jalowiec at ¶ 41. It also overlooks the overwhelming evidence against him at trial, including DNA evidence and the fact that both girls positively identified him. See State v. Prade, 9th Dist. Summit No. 28193, 2018-Ohio-3551, ¶ 55, quoting State v. Murley, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 08-CA-26, 2009-Ohio-6393, ¶ 26 (“[T]he mere possibility of a different outcome is insufficient’ to warrant the granting of a\nmotion for new trial.”). Because Mosley could have discovered the jail records in the exercise of due diligence and, in any event, has not shown that they were material to his defense, we reject his argument that the trial court erred by denying his motion for new trial. His second assignment of error is overruled."}

In doing so, he stated: \"I did not take the stand in my own defense, which you did not ask me as to anyone, would I take the stand in my own defense, which I would have, and I still say yes, and I want to take the stand in my own defense.\" Mosley points to his allocution statements as evidence that he vocalized his desire to testify.\n\nThe record does not support the conclusion that Mosley was denied his right to testify in his own defense. At no point during the guilt phase of his trial did he notify the court, either by statement or action, that he wished to testify. See Fry at ¶ 24. Nor is there any indication in the record that he was unaware of his right to testify or that he and his attorneys were having a difference of opinion as to whether he should take the stand. See id. Accord State v. Manso, 9th Dist. Summit No. 26727, 2014-Ohio-1388, ¶ 35. Mosley only claimed that he wanted to testify after the jury found him guilty. See State v. Huth, 9th Dist. Summit No. 17351, 1996 WL 425897, *8 (July 31, 1996) (\"There is little doubt that in any trial, later review will expose things which those with the luxury of hindsight might have done better or differently.\"). His statements at sentencing were merely a reflection of his desire for a second bite at the apple.\n\nAbsent any indication that Mosley wished to exercise his right to testify, the trial court was not required to ask him whether he wanted to waive that right. Bey, 85 Ohio St.3d at 497; Manso at ¶ 35. Mosley has not shown that he was denied his right to testify. Consequently, his fourth assignment of error is overruled."}

{"index": "480-Mosley", "allegation_num": "allegation_6", "allegation": "The convictions and sentences are contrary to law in violation of Ohio’s Constitution and Amendments to the United States Constitution due to prejudicial and plain errors of denial of the effective assistance of trial counsel.", "extracted_text": "Mosley argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorneys failed to object when the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury on the State’s burden of proof. His argument pertains to the court’s instruction that a not guilty verdict is appropriate only if the State fails to prove “all the essential elements” of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Mosley claims that the court’s instruction amounted to both plain and structural error, so his attorneys ought to have objected. We have already determined that the trial court did not commit either plain or structural error when it instructed the jury on the requirements for a not guilty verdict. Its instructions were accurate as a whole, and the evidence against Mosley was compelling. Because Mosley has not demonstrated that the result in this matter would have been different if not for the court’s single erroneous instruction, we reject his argument that he was prejudiced by his attorneys’ failure to object. Next, Mosley argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorneys failed to (1) object to the State’s arguments about the DNA evidence, (2) object to the State’s disclosure of certain aspects of the DNA evidence on the third day of trial, and (3) refute the State’s evidence through either reasonable cross-examination or expert testimony. He claims that the prosecutor overstated the statistical significance of the DNA evidence in this case while denigrating defense counsel’s use of “attorney math.” Because the DNA evidence was the lynchpin of the State’s case, Mosley argues, he was prejudiced by his attorneys’ failure to combat that evidence and the State’s arguments. This Court outlined the State’s DNA evidence in our discussion of Mosley’s second and third assignments of error. In doing so, we concluded that the State did not engage in misconduct in fashioning its theme and argument regarding that evidence. Mosley’s attorneys may well have determined that any objections they made to the State’s arguments were unlikely to succeed and more likely to highlight the damning nature of the DNA evidence. Likewise, they may have thought it wise to rely on cross-examination rather than call a defense expert who would be subject to the State’s examination. Because both decisions were matters of trial strategy, they do not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. To the extent Mosley claims that his attorneys ought to have objected when the prosecutor accused them of “attorney math” in closing argument, he has not shown that their failure to do so affected the outcome of his trial. Nor has he demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel based on their failure to object to the State’s disclosure of certain DNA evidence on the third day of trial. Mosley cites a brief passage from the transcript, during which the prosecutor mentioned a “recent swab that was * * * looked at by both analysts” and “around 75 pages that were sent to [defense counsel] for the data and analysis * * *.” It is entirely unclear from the record, however, what that swab entailed or whether the State ultimately introduced that evidence at trial. The BCI analysts who testified at trial only testified to their reports, the last of which was completed ten months before the start of trial. Because Mosley has not shown that the State introduced evidence about a more “recent swab” at trial, he cannot demonstrate prejudice as a result of his attorneys’ failure to object to the State’s disclosure of that evidence. Finally, Mosley argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorneys never advised him that he had a right to testify. Yet, he has not cited any portion of the record in support of his argument. “Allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel that rely on evidence outside of the record are impossible to resolve on direct appeal.” Because this Court cannot determine Mosley’s claim on the basis of the record before us, we reject his argument regarding his attorneys’ failure to advise him of his right to testify. With regard to the photo array identifications, Mosley argues the entire procedure was tainted because T.C. first identified him based on a “one on one photo.” He claims that his attorneys should have moved to suppress the girls’ identifications because his photo was chosen based on T.C.’s identification, which was inherently suggestive. Yet, the record reflects that it was T.C.’s mother who first showed Mosley’s picture to T.C. Her “one on one” identification was not a product of state action. Moreover, officers testified in detail about the procedures they followed when compiling an array and conducting a blind administration so as to guard against a biased or suggestive identification. Mosley has not shown that there exists a reasonable probability that, had his attorneys moved to suppress the identifications, their motion would have been successful. Accordingly, his sixth assignment of error is overruled."}

State v. Harwell, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25852, 2015-Ohio-2966, ¶ 59, quoting State v. Lampkin, 116 Ohio App.3d 771, 774, 689 N.E.2d 106 (6th Dist.1996).

Rather, “[t]he elements of the offense charged and the venue of the matter are separate and distinct.” (Citations omitted.) Draggo at 90.\n\n¶ 13 Even if jury verdict forms were required to mention the jury’s finding as to venue, we would still not find an obvious error in the verdict forms at issue. The language used in the verdict forms sufficiently established that the jury found Shutway’s offenses were committed in Champaign County, Ohio. Specifically, the first verdict form contains the heading “Count One” followed by the proper statutory definition for the offense of failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer. The second verdict form contains the heading “Count Two” followed by the proper statutory definition for the offense of obstructing official business. While charging the jury, the trial court explained each of these counts in relation to the corresponding verdict forms by stating the following:\n\nCount One. The Defendant is charged with Failure to Comply with an Order or Signal of a Police Officer. Before you can find the Defendant guilty, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that on or about the 20th\nday of March, 2018, in Champaign County, Ohio, the Defendant operated a motor vehicle so as willfully to elude or fell a police officer after receiving a visible or audible signal from a police officer to bring his motor vehicle to a stop.\n\n* * *\n\n**Count Two.** The Defendant is charged with Obstructing Official Business. Before you can find the Defendant guilty, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that on or about the 20th day of March, 2018, and in Champaign County, Ohio, the Defendant, without privilege to do so and with purpose to prevent, obstruct, or delay the performance by a public official of any authorized act within his official capacity, did an act that hampered or impeded the public official in the performance of his lawful duties.\n\n* * *\n\nYou’ll open the Verdict Form Folder and within the verdict forms there are two sheets of paper. **One sheet of paper is for Count One. One sheet of paper is for Count Two. Each document has the same case caption at the top. Meaning, * * * one is labeled Count One and the other is labeled Count Two.**\n\n(Emphasis added.) Trial Tr. Vol. II, p. 487, 490, and 493.\n\n{¶ 14} When reading the foregoing jury instructions along with the language found in the verdict forms, it is clear that by indicating Shutway was guilty on the verdict forms the jury had found that Shutway committed the offenses at issue in Champaign County, Ohio. See Shedwick, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 11AP-709, 2012-Ohio-2270, at ¶ 43-44\n(finding no plain error with respect to venue in a jury verdict form where the language in the verdict form specified that the jury found appellant guilty of each count as it was charged in the indictment and where the jury instructions provided that in order to find the appellant guilty of the charged offenses the jurors must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the offenses were committed in Franklin County, Ohio). Therefore, Shutway’s claim that the jury verdict forms did not provide the jury’s finding as to venue lacks merit."}

Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); State v. Bradley, 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 141-142, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989).

We must “recognize that counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.” Id. at 690.

Strickland at 693-694; Bradley at 143.\n\n{¶74} First, Smith argues that she was prejudiced by defense counsel's failure to engage a crime scene reconstruction expert to demonstrate the sequence of events leading up to the shooting. Generally, the decision not to call an expert\nwitness does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel because that decision is solely a matter of trial strategy. *State v. Durgan*, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-170148, 2018-Ohio-2310, ¶ 43.\n\n{¶75} Nothing in the record indicates what kind of testimony a crime scene reconstruction expert could have provided, so resolving this issue in Smith’s favor would be purely speculative. *See State v.

Because Smith cannot demonstrate that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different but for counsel’s failure to hire such an expert, we cannot say that counsel was ineffective for failing to engage a crime-scene reconstruction expert. *See State v.

Hamilton No. C-040537, 2006-Ohio-2222, ¶29:\n\n[E]vidence supporting the privilege of self-defense—that the defendant feared for his and others’ personal safety—does not necessarily constitute sudden passion or a fit of rage as contemplated by the voluntary-manslaughter statute. While self-defense requires a showing of fear, voluntary manslaughter requires a showing of rage, with emotions of “anger, hatred, jealously, and/or furious resentment.” The Ohio Supreme Court has specifically held that “[f]ear alone is insufficient to demonstrate the kind of emotional state necessary to constitute sudden passion or fit of rage.” (Citations omitted.) In other words, self-defense requires a showing of fear for one’s safety or for another’s safety, whereas voluntary manslaughter requires a showing of rage or similar emotion. *See id.; State v. Collins*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 19AP-373, 2020-Ohio-3126, ¶51.\n\n¶79 Here, voluntary manslaughter would have been at odds with Smith’s claim that she shot King in self-defense out of fear for her safety and for her daughter’s safety. The decision by defense counsel to seek acquittal rather than inviting conviction on an inferior-degree offense was a matter of trial strategy. Therefore, we hold that counsel was not ineffective for failing to argue for voluntary manslaughter. We overrule the fourth assignment of error."}

Smith objected to some but not all of the testimony, so we apply different standards of review.\n\nFirst, Smith argues that the officer should not have been permitted to testify that he would not pull his gun out in the middle of a fight if no one else had a weapon and that: ‘When you pull your gun out, it should be a last resort thing; whether you’re a police officer or a civilian, when you pull a gun out you’re introducing deadly force into the scenario.’ However, Smith failed to object to the officer’s testimony, so we review for plain error. State v. Conway, 109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, ¶ 80. To prevail on a claim that the trial court committed plain error, Smith must show that (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was obvious, and (3) that it affected the outcome of the trial. See State v. Kirkland, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-4079, ¶ 71-72.\n\nWe find no plain error in the admission of this testimony. While the officer’s statements were irrelevant, they cannot be said to have affected the outcome of the trial.\n\nNext, Smith argues that the officer should not have been permitted to testify that a ‘firearm only ever escalates a situation. That’s why it’s always a last resort for police officers. When we decide to draw our weapons, it’s not something that’s taken lightly.’ Because Smith objected to the error, we apply a harmless-error standard of review. State v. Jones, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-3051, ¶ 18. Under the harmless-error standard, the state must demonstrate that the error did not affect the substantial rights of the defendant, that is, that the error did not affect the outcome of the trial. Id. Unlike the plain-error analysis, which places the burden on the defendant to show that the error affected the outcome of the trial, a harmless-error analysis places the burden on the state to show that the error did not affect the outcome.\nThe officer’s testimony that an officer only uses a firearm as a last resort was not relevant in this case where a civilian used a firearm. It therefore was error to allow this testimony. However, the admission of that testimony was harmless in light of the other evidence. We cannot say that the challenged testimony affected the outcome of the trial, so any error in the admission of the officer’s testimony was harmless. Therefore, we overrule the fifth assignment of error."}

State v. Langlois, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-11-1313, 2013-Ohio-5177, ¶18. In order to aid in determining the threshold reliability of such testimony, Daubert identified several factors for federal district courts to consider in addressing the issue. Id. These factors, along with Daubert’s approach to the reliability issue, were later adopted by the Supreme Court of Ohio. Id.\n\n{¶168} Mr. Aboytes has not demonstrated how a Daubert hearing would have resulted in the exclusion of Ms. Daiber’s testimony. Given a proffer of Ms. Daiber’s testimony in a Daubert hearing, the trial court could have reasonably determined that it met the requirements of Evid.R. 702(C). Langlois at ¶46. Thus, a motion to exclude Ms. Daiber’s expert testimony on that basis would not likely have succeeded. Id.; State v. Brown, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2012-L-007, 2013-Ohio-1099, ¶34.\n\n{¶169} Mr. Aboytes’ other arguments relate to whether Ms. Daiber’s testimony met the requirements of Evid.R. 702(A), which we have addressed above. As indicated, Mr. Aboytes’ arguments relate to Ms. Daiber’s credibility and the weight of her testimony. Defense counsel thoroughly raised these issues in his cross-examination of Ms. Daiber and in his closing argument.\n\nCross-Examination\n\nSecond, Mr. Aboytes argues that his defense counsel was ineffective for failing to cross-examine Mr. Starkman, who translated Mr. Aboytes’ side of phone calls he made to his father and A.L. at the police station.\nAlthough it does not appear that the trial court gave defense counsel an opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Starkman, defense counsel did not object or request cross-examination.\n\nCounsel’s decision whether to cross-examine a particular witness is a matter of trial strategy. *State v. Jackson*, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2007-A-0079, 2010-Ohio-820, ¶31. Even questionable trial strategy does not compel a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel. *See State v. Smith*, 89 Ohio St.3d 323, 328 (2000).\n\nFurther, Mr. Aboytes has not alleged that Mr. Starkman was not qualified as a Spanish interpreter or that his translation was inaccurate in any way. Therefore, he has not established that defense counsel’s cross-examination of Mr. Starkman would have proved useful.\n\n**Order of Witnesses**\n\nThird, Mr. Aboytes argues that his defense counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the ‘unusual order’ in which the state called Mr. Starkman as a witness, i.e., in the middle of Det. Doyle’s testimony.\n\nMr. Aboytes has cited no legal authority indicating that counsel’s failure to object to the order of witnesses may constitute error.\n\nEvid.R. 611(A) states that ‘[t]he court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) making the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.’\n\nWe see nothing unusual about the order of these witnesses’ testimony. Det. Doyle testified regarding his recorded interview with Mr. Aboytes. At one point during the\ninterview, Det. Doyle left the room, and Mr. Aboytes made his phone calls in Spanish. Det. Doyle then returned and continued interviewing Mr. Aboytes. Thus, the state’s order of witnesses was an efficient and effective way to present the recorded interview to the jury.\n\n**Use of the Term ‘Victim’**\n\n¶178 Fourth, Mr. Aboytes argues that his defense counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the use of the term ‘victim’ and for using the term himself throughout the voir dire process.\n\n¶179 The Supreme Court of the United States has held that ‘[t]he principle that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law.’ *Coffin v. United States*, 156 U.S. 432, 454 (1895). This principle is reflected in R.C. 2901.05(A), which provides that ‘[e]very person accused of an offense is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and the burden of proof for all elements of the offense is upon the prosecution.’\n\n¶180 The term ‘victim’ means ‘[a] person harmed by a crime, tort, or other wrong.’ VICTIM, *Black’s Law Dictionary* (11th Ed.2019). Depending on context, a party’s use of the term ‘victim’ at trial may imply that the charged offenses occurred, which reduces the state’s burden of proof. Therefore, it is more appropriate for the parties to use the phrase ‘alleged victim’ at trial to reflect the defendant’s presumption of innocence.\n\n¶181 As the Tenth District has noted, courts in other jurisdictions have held that the use of the term ‘victim’ is not the same as expressing an opinion that the defendant was guilty of crime; the term ‘victim’ applies to anyone who suffers either as a result of ruthless design or incidentally or accidentally. *State v. Madden*, 10th Dist. Franklin No.\nThose courts have determined that the term ‘victim’ is used appropriately during trial when there is no doubt that a crime was committed and simply the identity of the perpetrator is in issue. *Id.* at ¶31.\n\n¶182 We find those cases to be distinguishable, since the issue before the jury in the underlying case was whether crimes were committed, not simply the identity of the offender.\n\n¶183 Mr. Aboytes cites 17 specific pages of the voir dire transcript allegedly demonstrating that the trial court, defense counsel, and the prosecutor repeatedly used the term ‘victim.’ A review of the transcript does not support Mr. Aboytes’ characterization.\n\n¶184 In two cited pages, the prosecutor and defense counsel properly referred to ‘the alleged victim’ in relation to the underlying case. In three cited pages, the trial court used the term while reading the indictment; however, the trial court appropriately prefaced each charge with the phrase ‘it is alleged.’ The trial court also told the prospective jurors that they may not consider the filing of the indictment for any purpose other than that it set forth the charges and informed the defendant that he was charged with the offenses.\n\n¶185 One cited page involves defense counsel using the term generically when inquiring of a prospective juror who had previously been a police officer; and four cited pages involve the trial court and the prosecutor using the term while inquiring whether any prospective juror had previously been a ‘victim’ of a crime. Since the term ‘victim’ was not used in reference to the underlying case, we do not find deficient performance on the part of defense counsel.\n\n¶186 Four other cited pages involve defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the trial court using the term when inquiring of a prospective juror in a hypothetical context,\ni.e., whether, based on her disclosed personal experiences, she would need to hear from a ‘victim’ in a sexual assault case to convict. However, this conversation occurred in chambers outside the presence of the other prospective jurors, and this individual was ultimately excused. Therefore, there could be no resulting prejudice from defense counsel’s use of the term or his failure to object.\n\n¶187 This leaves cited three pages where the prosecutor used the term ‘victim’ in reference to the underlying case. Specifically, the prosecutor used the term in the context of inquiring whether any prospective juror would need to hear from the ‘victim’ to convict or would be ‘uncomfortable’ if he or she heard there was no injury resulting from vaginal intercourse performed on the ‘victim.’\n\n¶188 Even if defense counsel’s failure to object constituted deficient performance, Mr. Aboytes has not established that the outcome would have been different had defense counsel objected.\n\n¶189 While a trial judge must remain detached and neutral in any matter before the court, a prosecutor is not constrained by any such obligation of neutrality. State v. Nichols, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 19AP-113 & 19AP-116, 2020-Ohio-4362, ¶39. And in considering the record as a whole, the prosecutor’s references were isolated. The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that ‘[i]solated comments by a prosecutor are not to be taken out of context and given their most damaging meaning.’ State v. Hill, 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 204 (1996).\n\n¶190 In addition, the trial court issued several instructions prior to voir dire questioning and during the presentation of evidence. For instance, the trial court told the jury on more than one occasion that they were not to consider counsel’s statements as evidence. The trial court also told the jury that Mr. Aboytes had pleaded not guilty to the\ncharged offenses, which the trial court explained was a denial of each of the charges in the indictment and put in issue all the essential elements of each offense. Prior to deliberations, the trial court explained the concepts of the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt. We must presume that the jury followed the court's instructions. *State v. Mammone*, 139 Ohio St.3d 467, 2014-Ohio-1942, ¶147.\n\n¶191 Further, during the presentation of evidence, Mr. Aboytes’ video-recorded interview was played for the jury, where he confessed to sexual misconduct involving D.O. Thus, it was eventually established at trial that D.O. was a ‘victim’ of sexual abuse. At that point, the questions for the jury became whether the state had proven the elements of each of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt, such as venue, ‘force or the threat of force,’ and the number of offenses.\n\n¶192 In support of his argument, Mr. Aboytes cites *State v. Almedom*, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 15AP-852, 2016-Ohio-1553, where the Tenth District determined that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance based, in part, on his failure to object to the prosecutor’s reference to alleged child victims of sexual abuse as ‘victims.’ *Id.* at ¶4.\n\n¶193 We find *Almedom* readily distinguishable from the underlying matter. In *Almedom*, the Tenth District found that counsel performed deficiently in several other respects not present here, including failures to object to the trial court ‘consistently’ referring to the children as ‘victims’; to ask for a mistrial or limiting instruction after the state dismissed the charge involving one of the children; to file any pre-trial motions other than a motion for a bill of particulars; to file a motion to determine the children’s competency to testify; and to object to questions on direct examination and large portions of the state’s evidence. *Id.* at ¶2-8.\nIn addition, in *Almedom*, most of the offending references were made by the trial court judge, not the prosecutor, and the improper references were made throughout the entire trial. See *Nichols* at ¶39 (distinguishing *Almedom* on similar grounds).\n\nFurther, in *Almedom*, the Tenth District found that defense counsel’s conduct, linked with the trial court’s and prosecutor’s prejudicial comments, ‘undermined the proper function of the adversarial process’ so that it could not ‘be sure a just result was produced.’ *Id.* at ¶10.\n\nBased on the record before us, there is no indication that the adversarial process was undermined or that the result was unjust.\n\n**Trial Strategy**\n\nFinally, Mr. Aboytes argues that his defense counsel was ineffective for failing to have a ‘sound trial strategy,’ which he characterizes as ‘cumulative error’ on the part of defense counsel.\n\nSpecifically, Mr. Aboytes contends that the purpose of defense counsel’s oral ‘corpus delicti’ motion in limine was ‘unclear’ and indicated ‘a lack of understanding of the rules of evidence, especially in cases where alleged victims do not testify.’\n\nHowever, the transcript indicates that the purpose of the motion was to preclude the admission of Mr. Aboytes’ video-recorded statements to Det. Doyle, which has a recognized legal basis. The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that ‘[b]efore an out-of-court confession will be admitted, the corpus delicti,’ i.e., the act and the criminal agency, ‘must be established by evidence outside the confession.’ *State v. Van Hook*, 39 Ohio St.3d 256, 261 (1988).\n\nGiven that Mr. Aboytes had confessed to sexual misconduct multiple times on this recording, defense counsel’s wholly reasonable strategy was to attempt to exclude\nsuch incriminating evidence. Rather than having ‘no trial strategy,’ defense counsel pursued a trial strategy that ultimately was not successful. Unsuccessful trial strategies do not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. *State v. Head*, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2001-L-228, 2005-Ohio-3407, ¶65.\n\n{¶201} In addition, Mr. Aboytes contends that defense counsel failed to set forth a ‘coherent argument’ as why the jury should have found Mr. Aboytes not guilty on the rape offenses.\n\n{¶202} By the time of closing argument, the trial court had overruled defense counsel’s motions in limine and evidentiary objections. The jury had seen Mr. Aboytes’ video-recorded confessions and heard scientific testimony regarding the DNA evidence.\n\n{¶203} Nonetheless, defense counsel’s closing argument strategy is readily apparent from the record. He questioned the reliability of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses and specifically highlighted areas of potential reasonable doubt. And notably, the jury found Mr. Aboytes not guilty on one count of rape, which suggests counsel’s argument was persuasive. Even if there was another or better strategy, that fact does not amount to counsel’s breach of an essential duty to his client. *State v. Clayton*, 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49 (1980).\n\n{¶204} In sum, we conclude that Mr. Aboytes has not established deficient performance on the part of defense counsel or resulting prejudice."}
{"index": "490-Aboytes", "allegation_num": "allegation_2", "allegation": "Appellant’s conviction was against the manifest weight and sufficiency of the evidence.", "extracted_text": "Within his second assignment of error, Mr. Aboytes contends that there was insufficient evidence for his rape convictions.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n‘Sufficiency’ is a term of art meaning that legal standard which is applied to determine whether the case may go to the jury or whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury verdict as a matter of law.’” State v. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386 (1997), quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 1433 (6th Ed.1990). “In essence, sufficiency is a test of adequacy.” Id.\n\n‘An appellate court’s function when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.’\n\nState v. Jenks, 61 Ohio St.3d 259 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n**Sexual Conduct**\n\nFirst, Mr. Aboytes argues that the state relied solely on hearsay statements to convict him of rape. According to Mr. Aboytes, without these statements, the only remaining evidence of his misconduct was his own statements, which only proved potential sexual contact, not sexual conduct.\n\nMr. Aboytes was convicted of three counts of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) (counts 1, 2, and 4), which provides, in pertinent part, that ‘[n]o person shall engage in sexual conduct with another who is not the spouse of the offender * * *, when any of the following applies: * * * The other person is less than thirteen years of age, whether or not the offender knows the age of the other person.’ (Emphasis added.)\n\n‘Sexual conduct’ is defined as ‘vaginal intercourse between a male and female; * * * and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of the body or any instrument, apparatus, or other object into the vaginal * * * opening of another. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete vaginal or anal intercourse.’ R.C. 2907.01(A).\n\nBy contrast, ‘sexual contact’ is defined as ‘any touching of an erogenous zone of another, including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if the person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexual arousing or gratifying either person.’ R.C. 2907.01(B).\n\nAs explained above, A.L.’s and D.O.’s statements were admissible as excited utterances. However, Mr. Aboytes’ statements to Det. Doyle, by themselves, were sufficient to establish the element of sexual conduct. For instance, the transcript contains the following exchange:\n\n‘DET. DOYLE: So why don’t you tell me truthfully. I’ll take baby steps, the first little baby step, was there any type of activity with her? You can shake your head yes or no.\n\nMR. ABOYTES: (Nodding affirmatively).\n\nDET. DOYLE: Has it been going on for a little while?\n\nMR. ABOYTES: (Nodding affirmatively).\n\nDET. DOYLE: A couple months?\n\nMR. ABOYTES: No. I’d probably say just this month.\n\nDET. DOYLE: Why don’t you tell me about it. Was it what I described to you? What she said to me? Be honest. When I said there was sexual intercourse?\n\nMR. ABOYTES: Uh-huh.\n\nDET. DOYLE: Uh?\n\nMR. ABOYTES: Yeah.\n\n* * *\n\nDET. DOYLE: Okay. Did your penis go inside of her? Did you – did you have lubricant on?\n\nMR. ABOYTES: Yeah.\n\n* * *\nDET. DOYLE: How many times do you think that’s happened?”\n\nMR. ABOYTES: Within the month, maybe two, three.”\n\nThus, the record demonstrates Mr. Aboytes admitted to engaging in sexual intercourse with D.O., which constitutes ‘sexual conduct’ under R.C. 2907.01(A). Therefore, there was sufficient evidence to convict Mr. Aboytes of rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b).\n\n**Force or Threat of Force**\n\nSecond, Mr. Aboytes argues that the state did not present sufficient evidence on the element of ‘force or threat of force’ under count 4. According to Mr. Aboytes, the only evidence supporting this element came from S.P.’s hearsay statements where D.O. told her that Mr. Aboytes would count if she did not comply with his directives. There was no testimony that D.O. was threatened or felt she was threatened.\n\nMr. Aboytes’ conviction for rape under count 4 included the finding that he ‘purposely compelled’ D.O. ‘to submit by force or threat of force,’ which mandated a prison term of 25 years to life. See R.C. 2971.03(B)(1)(c). ‘Force’ is defined as ‘any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.’ R.C. 2901.01(A)(1).\n\nIn State v. Eskridge, 38 Ohio St.3d 56 (1988), the Supreme Court of Ohio announced a ‘relaxed standard’ for showing force in the context of a parent-child relationship. State v. Payton, 119 Ohio App.3d 694, 702 (11th Dist.1997).\n\nAccording to the court, ‘[t]he force and violence necessary in rape is naturally a relative term, depending upon the age, size and strength of the parties and their relation to each other; as the relation between father and daughter under twelve years of age. With the filial obligation of obedience to the parent, the same degree of force and violence would not be required upon a person of such tender years, as would be required were the parties more nearly equal in age, size and strength.’ Eskridge at 58, quoting State v. Labus, 102 Ohio St. 26, 38-39 (1921). ‘The youth and vulnerability of children, coupled with the power inherent in a parent’s position of authority, creates a unique situation of dominance and control in which explicit threats and displays of force are not necessary to effect the abuser’s purpose.’ Id. at 59, quoting State v. Etheridge, 319 N.C. 34, 47 (1987). ‘Because of the child’s dependence on his or her parents, a child of tender years has no real power to resist his or her parent’s command, and every command contains an implicit threat of punishment for failure to obey.’ State v. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 55 (1992).\n\nIn recognition of ‘the coercion inherent in parental authority when a father sexual abuses his child,’ the court held that ‘[f]orce need not be overt and physically brutal, but can be subtle and psychological. As long as it can be shown that the rape victim’s will was overcome by fear or duress, the forcible element of rape can be established.’ Eskridge at 58-59, quoting State v. Fowler, 27 Ohio App.3d 149, 154 (8th Dist.1985).\n\nIn the underlying case, there is no dispute that Mr. Aboytes was D.O.’s stepfather and acted as a father figure in her life. In addition, the transcript of S.P.’s conversation with D.O. at the park contains the following exchanges:\n\n‘[S.P.] Talk to me about what has been going on. Like can you tell me a little bit about what your dad – what you said about your dad or what – what is it that’s – what’s going on?\n\n[D.O.] So I was told to do my chores and he tells me to go in the room with him and he tells me to go on top of him.\n[S.P.] How? Like – like on top of him how?\n\n[D.O.] Like on his stomach.\n[S.P.] Uh-huh.\n\n[D.O.] Like where his private is. I told him no and he said come on or you’re going to get in trouble.\n\n[S.P.] And then what do you do?\n\n[D.O.] I do it.\n\n[S.P.] With clothes on or not? No?\n\n[D.O.] He tells me to take them off.\n\n* * *\n\n[S.P.] Do you take your clothes off or does he take your clothes off?\n\n[D.O.] I do ‘cause he makes me.\n\n[S.P.] He makes you?\n\n[D.O.] Uh-huh.\n\n[S.P.] And is he mad when he tells you this?\n\n[D.O.] I told him no. He – and he says take them off. He counts and then\n\n[S.P.] He counts?\n\n[D.O.] Uh-huh. If I don’t do it, he counts.’\n\nAs explained above, D.O.’s statements to S.P. were admissible as excited utterances. These statements, if believed, are sufficient to establish that D.O.’s will was overcome by fear or duress as a result of an implicit threat of punishment for failure to obey pursuant to Eskridge and Schaim and thus, the element of ‘force or threat of force’ to prove rape."}
{"index": "490-Aboytes", "allegation_num": "allegation_3", "allegation": "The trial court erred in permitting hearsay testimony from multiple witnesses at trial, and in permitting the expert testimony of Diane Daiber.", "extracted_text": "Within his third assignment of error, Mr. Aboytes contends that the trial court erred by permitting the admission of hearsay testimony. Specifically, Mr. Aboytes argues that A.L.’s and D.O.’s statements to S.P. did not meet the “excited utterance” exception to the hearsay rule.\n\n**Standard of Review**\n\nThis court has held that whether evidence constitutes inadmissible hearsay is a question of law subject to de novo review. *Morford v. Morford*, 11th Dist. Ashtabula No. 2017-A-0044, 2018-Ohio-3439, ¶12; see *State v. Hartman*, Slip Opinion No. 2020-Ohio-4440, ¶22 (holding that the admissibility of other-acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B) is a question of law subject to de novo review).\n\n**Excited Utterance**\n\n“‘Hearsay’ is “a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” Evid.R. 801(C). Hearsay is not admissible except as otherwise provided in the Ohio Rules of Evidence or other relevant constitutional or statutory provisions. See Evid.R. 802.\n\nOne exception to the hearsay rule is an “excited utterance” under Evid.R. 803(2), which provides as follows:\n\n“The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness: * * * A statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.”\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court of Ohio, “[t]he fact that this otherwise hearsay testimony is admissible is based on the notion that the excited statement maintains a high level of reliability.” State v. Taylor, 66 Ohio St.3d 295, 300 (1993). “This exception derives its guaranty of trustworthiness from the fact that declarant is under such state of emotional shock that his reflective processes have been stilled. Therefore, statements made under these circumstances are not likely to be fabricated.” (Emphasis deleted.) Id., quoting McCormick, Evidence, Section 297 (2d Ed.1972).\n\nThe Supreme Court of Ohio has established the following four-part test to determine the admissibility of an excited utterance (referred to in the common law as a “spontaneous exclamation”):\n\n“Such testimony as to a statement or declaration may be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule for spontaneous exclamations where the trial judge reasonably finds (a) that there was some occurrence startling enough to produce a nervous excitement in the declarant, which was sufficient to still his reflective faculties and thereby make his statements and declarations the unreflective and sincere expression of his actual impressions and beliefs, and thus render his statement or declaration spontaneous and unreflective, (b) that the statement or declaration, even if not strictly contemporaneous with its exciting cause, was made before there had been time for such nervous excitement to lose a domination over his reflective faculties, so that such domination continued to remain sufficient to make his statements and declarations\nthe unreflective and sincere expression of his actual impressions and beliefs, (c) that the statement or declaration related to such startling occurrence or the circumstances of such startling occurrence, and (d) that the declarant had an opportunity to observe personally the matters asserted in his statement or declaration.” *Id.* at 300-301, quoting *Potter v. Baker*, 162 Ohio St. 488 (1955), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n{¶56} In addition, this court has held that “when determining whether a statement is an excited utterance, the court should consider: (a) the lapse of time between the event and the declaration; (b) the declarant’s mental and physical condition; (c) the nature of the statement; and (d) the influence of intervening circumstances.” *State v. Kalia*, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2002-T-0023, 2003-Ohio-4226, ¶18.\n\n{¶57} However, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held that “[t]here is no per se amount of time after which a statement can no longer be considered to be an excited utterance. The central requirements are that the statement must be made while the declarant is still under the stress of the event and the statement may not be a result of reflective thought. * * * Therefore the passage of time between the statement and the event is relevant but not dispositive of the question.” (Emphasis sic.) *Taylor* at 303. “*[E]ach case must be decided on its own circumstances, since it is patently futile to attempt to formulate an inelastic rule delimiting the time limits within which an oral utterance must be made in order that it be termed a spontaneous exclamation.” *Id.*, quoting *State v. Duncan*, 53 Ohio St.2d 215, 219-220 (1978).\n\n**A.L.’s Statements to S.P.**\n\n{¶58} First, Mr. Aboytes contends that the trial court improperly permitted S.P. to testify regarding what A.L. told her during their phone conversation on April 9, i.e., that D.O. told A.L. that Mr. Aboytes had raped or molested her that day. According to Mr.\nAboytes, S.P.’s testimony contained “double hearsay” that should not have been admitted.\n\n{¶59} We agree that this portion of S.P.’s testimony constituted “hearsay included within hearsay” but disagree that it was inadmissible.\n\n{¶60} Evid.R. 805 provides that “[h]earsay included within hearsay is not excluded under the hearsay rule if each part of the combined statements conforms with an exception to the hearsay rule provided in these rules.”\n\n{¶61} This portion of S.P.’s testimony involved two levels of hearsay – D.O.’s statements to A.L. and A.L.’s statements to S.P.\n\n{¶62} The evidence indicates that D.O. told A.L. about Mr. Aboytes’ alleged conduct shortly after A.L. came home from work, which occurred shortly after the alleged offenses occurred. Mr. Aboytes has not asserted that D.O. was not under the stress of the alleged events at that time, that the lapse of time between the alleged events and D.O.’s disclosure to A.L. was problematic, or that D.O. had engaged in reflective thought before disclosing Mr. Aboytes’ alleged conduct to A.L. Therefore, D.O.’s statements to A.L. regarding Mr. Aboytes’ alleged conduct qualify as excited utterances under Evid.R. 803(2).\n\n{¶63} The evidence further indicates that after D.O.’s disclosure, A.L. called S.P. at about 6:30 p.m. screaming and crying hysterically. Mr. Aboytes has not asserted that A.L. was not under the stress of hearing D.O.’s disclosure at that time, that any lapse of time between D.O.’s disclosure and A.L.’s statements to S.P. was problematic, or that A.L. had engaged in reflective thought before calling S.P. Therefore, A.L.’s statements to S.P. also qualify as excited utterances under Evid.R. 803(2).\nSince each part of the combined statements was admissible as an excited utterance under Evid.R. 803(2), S.P.’s testimony regarding A.L.’s statements during their April 9 phone conversation was admissible under Evid.R. 805. Therefore, the trial court did not err in permitting this portion of S.P.’s testimony.\n\n**D.O.’s Statements to S.P.**\n\nSecond, Mr. Aboytes contends that the trial court improperly permitted S.P. to testify regarding what D.O. told her at the park. According to Mr. Aboytes, by taking D.O. on a private walk to the park, S.P. had “destroyed the domination of nervous excitement” over D.O.’s “reflective faculties.” We disagree.\n\nThe evidence indicates that D.O. and A.L. arrived at S.P.’s house about 20 to 30 minutes after A.L.’s phone conversation with S.P. D.O.’s eyes were red, her face was “puffy,” and she was very upset. She calmed down for about ten minutes, and S.P. walked with her for about five minutes to a nearby park. They sat down on a bench, and S.P. began asking D.O. questions regarding Mr. Aboytes’ alleged conduct, at which time she again became upset.\n\nThis court and others have held that “[t]he excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule should be applied liberally in a case involving the sexual abuse of a young child.” *State v. Arcuri*, 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 2015-T-0123, 2016-Ohio-8254, ¶57, quoting *In re S.H.W.*, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2015-CA-25, 2016-Ohio-841, ¶22; see *State v. Craig*, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2016-L-113, 2017-Ohio-8939, ¶38 (“The requirements for the admission of an excited utterance is not applied as stringently in sexual abuse cases involving young children as it is in cases involving an adult”). In fact, the Supreme Court of Ohio has recognized that “children are likely to remain in a state of nervous excitement longer than would an adult.” *Taylor* at 304. According to the court, “young\nchildren” have “limited reflective powers,” which “makes it likely that the statements are trustworthy.” *Id.*\n\n{¶68} In the underlying case, D.O.’s statements to S.P. were made on the same day and within hours of Mr. Aboytes’ alleged conduct. This court and others have found statements made by alleged child victims after more substantial lapses of time were admissible as excited utterances. *See, e.g., State v. Ashford,* 11th Dist. Trumbull No. 99-T-0015, 2001 WL 137595, *6 (Feb. 16, 2001) (one and two days later); State v. Chappell,* 97 Ohio App.3d 515, 521-528 (8th Dist.1994) (32 hours); *State v. Fox,* 66 Ohio App.3d 481, 488-490 (6th Dist.1990) (one day); *State v. Weigand,* 11th Dist. Lake No. 94-L-166, 1995 WL 803620, *3 (Nov. 17, 1995) (24 and 48 hours). Thus, one may reasonably conclude that D.O. was still acting under the stress of Mr. Aboytes’ alleged conduct during her statements to S.P.\n\n{¶69} Further, this court has held that “an event subsequent to the molestation can be the startling event leading to the reflexive statement.” *Craig* at ¶39. Therefore, one may also reasonably conclude that D.O.’s statements to S.P. were a reaction to S.P.’s inquiry rather than a consequence of reflective deliberation. *Id.* at ¶41.\n\n{¶70} Mr. Aboytes further contends that since S.P. asked D.O. for specific details regarding Mr. Aboytes’ alleged conduct, D.O.’s statements were the product of reflective thought. Again, we disagree.\n\n{¶71} The Supreme Court of Ohio has held that “[t]he admission of a declaration as an excited utterance is not precluded by questioning which: (1) is neither coercive nor leading, (2) facilitates the declarant’s expression of what is already the natural focus of the declarant’s thoughts, and (3) does not destroy the domination of the nervous\nexcitement over the declarant’s reflective faculties.” State v. Wallace, 37 Ohio St.3d 87 (1988), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n¶72 The evidence indicates that at the park, S.P. asked D.O. to tell her what was going on regarding Mr. Aboytes. She then asked follow up questions in response to D.O.’s specific disclosures.\n\n¶73 Mr. Aboytes has not explained how S.P.’s questions may be construed as coercive or leading. Based on our review of the record, it appears S.P.’s questions served to initiate the conversation with D.O. regarding alleged events that she had recently experienced that day. See Kalia, supra, at ¶20. They were not leading or coercive, and there is nothing to indicate that S.P.’s questioning destroyed D.O.’s nervous excitement. See id.\n\n¶74 Since D.O.’s statements were admissible as excited utterances under Evid.R. 803(2), the trial court did not err in permitting this portion of S.P.’s testimony.\n\nRecording of D.O.’s Statements to S.P.\n\n¶75 Third, Mr. Aboytes contends that the trial court improperly permitted the state to present the recording of S.P.’s and D.O.’s conversation at the park. Since we have determined that D.O.’s statement were admissible as excited utterances under Evid.R. 803(2), the recording of their conversation was likewise admissible. Therefore, the trial court did not err in permitting the state to present it to the jury.\n\n¶76 The discussed portion of Mr. Aboytes’ third assignment of error is without merit.\n\nExpert Testimony\n\n¶77 Within his third assignment of error, Mr. Aboytes also contends that the trial court erred by permitting the expert testimony of Ms. Daiber.\nStandard of Review\n\n¶78 “The determination of the admissibility of expert testimony is within the discretion of the trial court.” Valentine v. Conrad, 110 Ohio St.3d 42, 2006-Ohio-3561, ¶9. “Such decisions will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.” Id. An abuse of discretion is the trial court’s “failure to exercise sound, reasonable, and legal decision-making.” State v. Beechler, 2d Dist. Clark No. 09-CA-54, 2010-Ohio-1900, ¶62, quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 11 (8th Ed.Rev.2004).\n\nEvid.R. 702\n\n¶79 First, Mr. Aboytes argues that Ms. Daiber’s testimony did not meet the requirements of Evid.R. 702, which provides in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n¶80 “A witness may testify as an expert if all of the following apply:\n\n¶81 “(A) The witness’ testimony either relates to matters beyond the knowledge or experience possessed by lay persons or dispels a misconception common among lay persons;\n\n¶82 “(B) The witness is qualified as an expert by specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony;\n\n¶83 “(C) The witness’ testimony is based on reliable scientific, technical, or other specialized information.”\n\n¶84 Mr. Aboytes’ arguments appear to implicate Evid.R. 702(A). Specifically, Mr. Aboytes contends that since Ms. Daiber had no knowledge of the specific facts of the underlying case, she was in no better position to explain any of the issues in the case to the jury. We disagree.\nIt appears that the state presented Ms. Daiber’s testimony to bolster D.O.’s credibility based on the nature of the allegations and the fact that she did not testify at trial.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court of Ohio, “[a]n expert may not testify as to the expert’s opinion of the veracity of the statements of a child declarant.” State v. Boston, 46 Ohio St.3d 108 (1989), syllabus. However, an expert may provide testimony that supports “the truth of the facts testified to by the child, or which assists the fact finder in assessing the child’s veracity.” (Emphasis deleted.) State v. Stowers, 81 Ohio St.3d 260, 262-263 (1998). This testimony “does not usurp the role of the jury, but rather gives information to a jury which helps it make an educated determination.” Id. at 263, quoting State v. Gersin, 76 Ohio St.3d 491, 494 (1996).\n\nIn addition, Evid.R. 702(A) does not require that an expert’s opinion be based on facts perceived by him or her. State v. Cook, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2016-L-079, 2017-Ohio-7953, ¶52. This court and others have allowed experts to testify as to the common reactions of rape victims without having examined the victim. See, e.g., id.; State v. Stuart, 11th Dist. Lake No. 2018-L-145, 2020-Ohio-3239, ¶69; State v. Moore, 9th Dist. Medina No. 1736, 1989 WL 21233, *4-5 (March 8, 1989). The fact that Ms. Daiber did not examine D.O. was pertinent only to challenge her credibility. Cook at ¶52.\n\nMr. Aboytes also contends that Ms. Daiber’s testimony did not dispel any misconception held by the jury. Again, we disagree.\n\nSome of Mr. Aboytes’ charged offenses involved alleged conduct that D.O did not immediately report. Thus, Ms. Daiber testified regarding delayed disclosure with respect to child victims of sexual abuse.\nThis court has recognized that “the fact that delayed reporting by sexual assault victims is not uncommon is not within the knowledge of the average juror.” (Emphasis deleted.) Cook at ¶50, quoting State v. Solether, 6th Dist. Wood No. WD07053, 2008-Ohio-4738, ¶65. According to the Supreme Court of Ohio, “[m]ost jurors would not be aware, in their everyday experiences, of how sexually abused children might respond to abuse.” Stowers at 262, quoting Boston at 128. “Such testimony is permitted to counterbalance the trier of fact’s natural tendency to assess * * * delayed disclosure as weighing against the believability and truthfulness of the witness.” Id. at 263, quoting Gersin at 494.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Aboytes’ charged offenses involved alleged sexual activity with his stepdaughter. Ms. Daiber testified that the most common perpetrators of child sexual abuse are “male figures associated with the mother” and explained how they utilize their access, trust, and authority to commit their offenses.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court of Ohio, “[i]ncest is prohibited in all or almost all cultures and the common experience of a juror may represent a less-than-adequate foundation for assessing whether a child has been sexually abused.” Stowers at 262, quoting Boston at 128.\n\nFurther, one of Mr. Aboytes’ charged offenses alleged vaginal penetration “by force or threat of force.” The average juror may expect to be presented with evidence of physical injuries to substantiate such an offense. Thus, Ms. Daiber testified that “penile penetration” does not necessarily result in visible injury. Courts have permitted expert testimony that the absence of vaginal injuries is common in sexual assault cases. See, e.g., State v. Gardner, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 107573, 2019-Ohio-1780, ¶41, 44.\nFinally, during cross-examination of Ms. Cianci, the SANE nurse who examined D.O., defense counsel suggested that her interview of D.O. exceeded the proper scope of a medical examination, resulting in unreliable responses. Therefore, the state elicited testimony from Ms. Daiber regarding the characteristics of a typical sexual assault examination.\n\nAccording to the Supreme Court of Ohio, “[s]pecial interviewing processes are necessary to get information from child victims, who are often immature, inarticulate, frightened, and confused about the abuse they have received. Most jurors lack the knowledge of accepted practices in interviewing child victims, and expert testimony on the issue is therefore admissible.” Gersin at 494.\n\nAccordingly, Ms. Daiber’s testimony met the requirements of Evid.R. 702(A).\n\nCrim.R. 16(K)\n\nSecond, Mr. Aboytes argues that Ms. Daiber’s testimony was not admissible because she did not prepare a written report pursuant to Crim.R. 16(K), which provides:\n\n“An expert witness for either side shall prepare a written report summarizing the expert witness’s testimony, findings, analysis, conclusions, or opinion, and shall include a summary of the expert’s qualifications. The written report and summary of qualifications shall be subject to disclosure under this rule no later than twenty-one days prior to trial, which period may be modified by the court for good cause shown, which does not prejudice any other party. Failure to disclose the written report to opposing counsel shall preclude the expert’s testimony at trial.” (Emphasis added.) See State v. Boaston, 160 Ohio St.3d 46, 2020-Ohio-1061, ¶59 (finding error in the admission of expert testimony on topics not set forth in a written report).\nMr. Aboytes’ assertion is belied by the record. The state’s second supplemental discovery filed on August 8, 2019, which was well before the start of the jury trial on November 12, indicates that it provided defense counsel an expert report from Ms. Daiber. In addition, in his first written motion in limine, Mr. Aboytes acknowledged that the state listed Ms. Daiber as an expert witness in its supplemental discovery and “provided a report via email.”\n\nIn sum, Ms. Daiber’s testimony met the requirements of Evid.R. 702(A), and she prepared a written report that the state provided to defense counsel more than 21 days prior to trial pursuant to Crim.R. 16(K). Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting her testimony.\n\nAccordingly, the remainder of Mr. Aboytes’ third assignment of error is also without merit."}

Young*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2018-03-047, 2019-Ohio-912, ¶ 32. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of law or judgment. *State v. Williams*, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2003-01-001, 2003-Ohio-5873, ¶ 16. In order to constitute an abuse of discretion, the court's attitude must be unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. *Id*.\n\n{¶17} According to Crim.R. 33(B), a motion for a new trial based on a claim of newly-discovered evidence must be filed within 120 days after the day upon which the verdict was\nrendered. The rule permits an untimely motion if the trial court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence within the given time frame. Crim.R. 33(B). Clear and convincing evidence is the measure or degree of proof that is more than a mere preponderance of the evidence, but not to the extent of such certainty as is required beyond a reasonable doubt, which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established. State v. Belcher, 12th Dist.

Rodriguez-Baron, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 12-MA-44, 2012-Ohio-5360, ¶ 11. Clear and convincing proof requires Stepp to establish more than a mere allegation he was unavoidably prevented from discovering the evidence he now seeks to introduce to support his motion for leave to file a motion for new trial. Thornton at ¶ 19.\n\nBecause the present matter is well outside the 120-day period, Stepp was required to obtain leave of court to file a motion for new trial. Williams, 2003-Ohio-5873 at ¶ 17.

Walker*, 55 Ohio St.2d 208, 212, 378 N.E.2d 1049 (1978).\n\n{¶ 26} The abduction statute, R.C. 2905.02, provides, in relevant part, that,\n\n(A) No person, without privilege to do so, shall knowingly do any of the following:\n\n(1) By force or threat, remove another from the place where the other person is found;\n\n(2) By force or threat, restrain the liberty of another person under circumstances that create a risk of physical harm to the victim or place the other person in fear; * * *\n\n(C) Whoever violates this section is guilty of abduction.

It “means any violence, compulsion, or constraint physically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.” R.C. 2901.01(A)(1). In *State v. Heiney*, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-16-1042, 2018-Ohio-3408, we discussed the components of “force” and their respective definitions:\n“Any,” as used in R.C. 2901.01(A)(1), is an adjective. “’As an adjective, ‘any’ is defined as: ‘[o]ne or some, regardless of kind, quantity, or number; an indeterminate number or amount.’” State v. Euton, 3d Dist. Auglaize No. 2-06-35, 2007-Ohio-6704, 2007 WL 4374293, ¶ 60, quoting The American Heritage Dictionary (2nd College Ed.1985) 117. “[T]he insertion of the word ‘any’ into the definition of ‘force,’ recognizes that different degrees and manners of force are used in various crimes with various victims.” State v. Lillard, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 69242, 1996 WL 273781, *6, (May 23, 1996).\n\n“Violence” is defined, in part, as “[t]he use of physical force” or “[p]hysical force exerted for the purpose of violating, damaging, or abusing.” State v. Stevens, 3d Dist. Allen No. 1-14-58, 2016-Ohio-446, quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 1801 (14th Ed.2014) and The American Heritage Dictionary at 1350.\n\n“Compulsion” means “[t]he act of compelling; the quality, state, or condition of being compelled.” Stevens at ¶ 19, quoting Black’s at 348. “Compulsion can take other forms than physical force; but in whatever form it appears* * * [i]t can best be considered under the heads of obedience to orders, material coercion, duress per minas, and necessity.” Id., quoting Turner, Kenny's Outlines of Criminal Law 54 (16th Ed.1952).\n“Constraint” means “state of being checked, restricted, or compelled to avoid or perform some action.” *Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary* 248 (10th Ed.1996).\n\n*Heiney* at ¶ 98-101. Also, although the synonyms that the legislature chose to define the term force—violence, compulsion and constraint—are “ordinarily applicable to persons rather than things,” the definition applies “both to persons and things.” *State v. Lane*, 50 Ohio App.2d 41, 46, 361 N.E.2d 535 (10th Dist.1976).\n\n{¶ 29} At trial, the state presented its case of “force” as follows:\n\nIn this particular case the force that was used was physically removing the children and driving away. Those children were put in child restraint seats. * * * But reason and common sense says but for what Marcella and the defendant did, those children would have remained where they were at. [The oldest child] would have remained at the elementary school until somebody else came to pick him up, and [the younger two] would have remained at the Deckers.\n\n{¶ 30} In his brief, the defendant challenges the prosecution’s “theory” that it “need only show that ‘any’ amount of force was used.” Without citing any authority, he claims there is “no question” that the state must present “more than” the “ordinary force involved in picking up children from school or a baby-sitter.”\n\n{¶ 31} Force is expressly defined as “*any* violence, compulsion, or constraint * * * *.” (Emphasis added.) And, “a court cannot simply ignore or add words” to an\nunambiguous statute. *Portage Cty. Bd. Of Commissioners v. Akron*, 109 Ohio St.3d 106, 200-Ohio-954, 846 N.E.2d 478. As we remarked in *Heiney*, the use of the word “any” to describe “force” recognizes that different degrees and manners of force are used in various crimes with various victims.\n\n{¶ 32} For example, in *Lane*—an aggravated burglary case requiring the state to show a trespass “by, force, stealth, or deception”—the issue was whether the trial court erred by using the word “effort” rather than “violence, compulsion, or constraint” in its charge to the jury. The court found no “substantial difference between the statutory definition [of force] and that given by the trial court,” and it reasoned that “the statute clearly indicates that ‘compulsion * * * physically exerted’ against a thing to gain entrance constitutes force. The same is true of constraint. The ‘thing’ in this case is a closed but locked door.” *Id.* at 46.\n\n{¶ 33} In a similar case, also involving burglary, the Second Appellate District added that the definition of force “does not provide for any measure of the physical exertion that might constitute force, but instead looks to the purpose for which the physical exertion, however slight, has been employed. If the purpose is to overcome a barrier against the actor’s conduct, whether that barrier is the will of the victim or the closed but unlocked door of a home, the physical exertion employed to overcome the barrier may constitute force.” *State v. Gregg*, 2d Dist. Champaign No. 91-CA-15, 1992 WL 302438 (Oct. 26, 1992) (Finding sufficient evidence that defendant used force when he “turned the knob and opened the closed door to enter [the home]; A greater degree of\nphysical exertion, including violence, is not necessary to satisfy the [force element.”). See also State v. Johnson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 81692, 81692, 2003-Ohio-3241, ¶ 67-68 (“[F]orce’ * * * simply requires [that] effort be exerted against a person or thing.”).\n\n¶ 34 Just as the trespass-by-force element was met in the burglary cases by demonstrating compulsion physically exerted against a thing (i.e. a door), we find that the removal-by-force element in this case was shown by demonstrating compulsion physically exerted against things. Those “things” were the controls of the defendant’s truck and Marcella’s car. We agree with the state that the physical act of driving the children away from the place where they were found satisfies the force element in this case. The law is clear that any amount of force or threat of force, however slight, against a thing, here the motor vehicles, is sufficient to support an abduction conviction.\n\n¶ 35 Next, the defendant argues that the state failed to show that he removed the children under “circumstances which pose[d] a risk of harm to [them] or place[d] [them] in fear.” (Brief at 8 quoting Legislative Service Commission, 1973). He argues that the only evidence at trial established that the children left with their grandparents “willingly” and in the presence of other adults, who were “not alarmed.” But, under Section (A)(1), the state was not required to present evidence that the removal occurred under circumstances that created a risk of physical harm to the victims or that the victims were placed in fear. Such a showing is required under Section (A)(2), and those counts were dismissed before trial. Moreover, to the extent that the children’s willingness to leave with their grandparents raises the issue of whether the defendant was “privileged” to\nremove them, we note that the defendant has not challenged the sufficiency of the state’s evidence as to that element of the offense.\n\n{¶ 36} Finally, the defendant argues that the act of “buckling” the children into child safety seats cannot establish “the sole basis” of the force element because he was required by law to use child safety seats when transporting the children. See R.C. 4511.81 (“Certain children to be secured in child restraint system”).\n\n{¶ 37} As we have found, the act of driving the children from the place where they were found established force in this case, and that finding is without regard to whether the children were first fastened into child safety seats. But, it is also true that the state created confusion by stressing the fact that the children were buckled into car seats before the defendant and Marcella drove away.\n\n{¶ 38} First, it bears repeating that the state abandoned its abduction cases under Section (A)(2) which would have required it to show the defendant “restrain[ed] the liberty” of the children. Second, to the extent that the defendant was prevented from asserting R.C. 4511.81 as a defense, as he claims in his brief—because he was not told until trial that the state would identify the use of car seats as evidence of force—we find no reversible error. An appellate court cannot reverse a lower court decision that is legally correct even if it is a result of erroneous reasoning. City of Toledo v. Schmiedebusch, 192 Ohio App.3d 402, 2011-Ohio-284, 949 N.E.2d 504, ¶ 37 (6th Dist). That is, this court will not reverse a trial court decision that “achieves the right result for the wrong reason, because such an error is not prejudicial.” Id. Here, the state presented\nlegally sufficient evidence of force irrespective of whether the children were buckled in child safety seats, and the state’s reliance on them, if any, to show force is not grounds for reversal.\n\n¶ 39 In examining a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and determine whether a rational juror could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Jenks at paragraph two the syllabus. The testimony presented at trial, if believed, established that the defendant, personally and in complicity with Marcella, removed the children by force from the place where they were found. We find that the state presented legally sufficient evidence of “force” in this case. Accordingly, the defendant’s first assignment of error is found not well-taken."}

Tr. at 839-840.\n\nThe defendant objected, and the trial court overruled the objection. On appeal, the defendant argues that the prosecutor led the jury to believe, incorrectly, that the state only had to prove that the defendant did not have one of those—an immunity, license or right—to satisfy its burden of proof as to privilege.

Sellards, 17 Ohio St.3d 169, 171, 478 N.E.2d 781 (1985).\n\n¶ 48 The defendant complains that, in response to his motion, the state provided a ‘copy of the indictment and referred to the discovery in this case.’ In denying the defendant’s subsequent motion to compel, the trial court found that, ‘[t]he State of Ohio has a practice of providing open-file discovery’ and ‘[n]o bill of particulars is required when the state allows open-file discovery.’ See Aug. 15, 2018 Order, quoting State v. Coffey, 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-12-1047, 2013-Ohio-3555, ¶ 35. The defendant argues that Coffey is inapplicable because it involved an amendment to a bill of particulars, unlike this case which involves the absence of any bill. However, Coffey was not restricted to its facts. And, in any event, this precise issue was recently addressed in State v. Franklin,\n5th Dist. Muskingum No. CT2019-0042, 2020-Ohio-1263, ¶ 63-71, where the defendant filed a motion to compel a bill of particulars that included ‘the dates and times or the specific manner’ of the offenses. On appeal, the court upheld the denial of the motion to compel, finding that ‘it is undisputed that the [county prosecutor’s office] maintains ‘open-file discovery,’ pursuant to which the state provides discovery by allowing defense counsel to see all of its files regarding a case without requiring the defense to make a written request for discovery. No bill of particulars is required when the state allows open-file discovery.’ Id. ¶ 69.\n\n¶ 49 Likewise, the defendant in this case sought ‘the exact time that the offense(s) allegedly took place.’ It is undisputed that the state provided open file discovery, which according to it, included ‘a written statement by John Decker indicating [that the defendant] had come over to his home [and] had picked up two of the three children.’ The discovery file also included police reports, medical reports, and witness statements in the case. Thus, as in Coffey and Franklin, a bill of particulars would not have provided the defense with any additional information. Accordingly, under the facts of this case, we find that the purpose of the bill of particulars was fulfilled. Accordingly, the defendant’s third assignment of error is found not well-taken."}

If the conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general provision prevail.’ The statute ‘comes into play only when a general and a special provision constitute allied offenses of similar import and additionally do not constitute crimes committed separately or with a separate animus for each crime.’ State v. Chippendale, 52 Ohio St.3d 118, 120, 556 N.E.2d 1134 (1990). But, ‘when the offenses in question are not allied offenses of similar import, R.C. 1.51 does not preclude the offender from being charged with and convicted of both.’ State v. Rivarde, 197 Ohio App.3d 99, 2011-Ohio-5354, 966 N.E.2d 301 (12th Dist.), ¶ 11, quoting State v. Smith, 4th Dist. Meigs No. 09CA16, 2011-Ohio-965, ¶ 16.\n\nIn his brief, the defendant baldly asserts that the state was ‘required to pursue’ interference with custody charges against the defendant—rather than abduction—‘because’ the former is the ‘more specific charge.’ The defendant’s claim is wholly unsupported with any legal arguments. Indeed, the defendant failed even to identify the interference statute by number or set forth its elements, much less analyze those elements so as to establish that it is an allied offense of abduction. As noted by the state, the defendant also failed to cite any case law in support of his proposition.\n\nThis court is ‘not obligated to search the record or formulate legal arguments on behalf of the parties, because ‘appellate courts do not sit as self-directed\nboards of legal inquiry and research, but [preside] essentially as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties before them.”’ (Other internal quotation omitted.) *Risner v.

The appellate court, ‘reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against conviction.’” *Id.*, quoting *State v. Martin*, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983).\nThe defendant complains that this case ‘revolved around the service, or lack thereof, of a temporary custody order [in Hill-Hernandez’s favor], the violation of which could not result in an abduction charge.’ We disagree. The jury need not have concluded that the defendant had direct knowledge of the custody order in order to convict him. There was plenty of other evidence in the record to support the conclusion that the defendant knew, when he removed the children on December 19, 2018, that he did so without the consent of the children’s father. That evidence included testimony that the defendant raced out of the police station to get to the children before Hill-Hernandez did, that he directed Marcella to pick up the school-aged boy before the end of the school day, that John Decker told the defendant that Hill-Hernandez ‘got custody for the kids,’ and, notwithstanding that, the defendant ‘wasn’t going to give the kids back.’ Moreover, the defendant’s failure to provide any credible explanation for not communicating with Hill-Hernandez over the next twelve days certainly supported the state’s argument that he was, in fact, ‘on the lam.’\n\nFinally, the defendant complains that his civil attorney ‘pick[ed] fights with the police detectives * * * for no apparent reason.’ Defendant’s complaint, even if true, does not cast doubt on the weight of the evidence. Further, he bears at least some of the responsibility for his lawyer’s bravado, given that the defendant failed to tell him a critical fact at the time he was retained, namely that the juvenile court had already granted Hill-Hernandez temporary custody.\nBecause the trier of fact sees and hears the witnesses at trial, we must defer to the factfinder’s decisions whether, and to what extent, to credit the testimony of particular witnesses. *State v. Jackson*, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2018-CA-37, 2019-Ohio-2130, ¶ 24. Based on this evidence, it cannot be said that the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice.

This is because, according to Jones, sexual battery in violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(2) is not a lesser included offense of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(a). However, the Seventh District Court of Appeals has already determined that sexual battery in violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(2) is, in fact, a lesser included offense of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(a). See State v. Eberth, 7th Dist.
